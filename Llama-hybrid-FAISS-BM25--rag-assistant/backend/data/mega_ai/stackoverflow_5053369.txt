Do you think Zend framework misses the Symfony's Bundle principle ?

I have been working in ZF since it was v1.6 and i am pretty happy with it , but reading about symfony and its bundle principle : to make sumfony Bundle more clear : http://docs.symfony-reloaded.org/quick_tour/the_big_picture.html But what is a bundle? All the code you write in a Symfony2 project is organized in bundles. In Symfony2 speak, a bundle is a structured set of files (PHP files, stylesheets, JavaScripts, images, ...) that implements a single feature (a blog, a forum, ...) and which can be easily shared with other developers. In our example, we only have one bundle, HelloBundle. i was using the same idea by organizing my code in modules , but this is really painful any body has same bundle implementation for ZF ???
