How to calculate OR and confidence interval for two binary explanatory variables with interaction

I have a logistic regression model with several categorical explanatory variables and one interaction term (between two binary variables, named A and B). I know how to calculate the odds ratios for the different levels of A and B (for A=1, e.g., I need to add the coeff for A and coeff for A*B, then exponentiate), but how do I get a confidence interval for this OR? I need to do this in R please, this is the only statistical package I have access to.
