mtry is indeed bound by the number of variables in your model, as it specifies the size of the variable subset that is randomly picked for each random forest iteration. Given that it is a hyper-parameter, there is no way to know ahead of time what would be the best value of mtry . However, values of mtry that are close to the total number of variables in the model may weaken the forest by making the individual decision trees more correlated; when the decision trees consider similar sets of variables to split on, they are more likely to be similar, even if each is fit to a different bootstrapped data set. Ensemble models usually strive for independence of their members, as that improves predictive ability. Despite these concerns, the value picked by through proper validation, even if it is large, is probably a fair value to consider for a model.
