Where can I find Image(RGB) data to implement K means agorithm?

I am a newbie to Data science.I have learned about clustering algorithms(especially K-means algorithm)and I would like to implement this algorithm(using Euclidian distance metric) to segment image on basis of RGB values of the image so that I could find clusters of most similar colours in an image .but I didn't have any relevant dataset with me if anyone has or know where can I find the dataset ? please provide me any direct link .?
