Generic CSS templates anywhere (not layout)?

I am looking for a place where I can download a bunch of CSS stylesheets to change the appearance of my titles, links, paragraphs, etc. I am not an artist, so I am hoping to leverage other people's skills in choosing the right fonts, colors, sizes, etc. I do not want to include layout because then it won't be as generic. Does anyone know where I can get something like this?
