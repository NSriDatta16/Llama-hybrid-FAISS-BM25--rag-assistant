A good place to apply a lesson from the book Pragmatic Programmer. Backup and then delete all unused code. Trust me it will save developers from future headache. If you hesitate thinking you might need some future functionality based on commented out code, it's not even worth the pain of trying to understand unused code or logic. Better start with clean state of mind without the need to decipher obviously half-baked, untested code anyway.
