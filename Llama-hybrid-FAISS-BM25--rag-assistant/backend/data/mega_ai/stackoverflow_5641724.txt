Trouble Using function in python

Hey guys, I have a question that I am a list of numbers and I need to use functions to find the average. I think I pretty much have it, but I can not get it to print the average. Can you please tell me what is wrong. nums = [30,34,40,36,36,28,29,32,34,44,36,35,28,33,29,40,36,24,26,30,30,32,34,32,28,36,24,32] def average(nums): return sum(nums) / len(nums)
