How to interpret change in main effect odds ratio with continuous by continuous interaction term?

I am running a logistic regression model to evaluate how age and another measured variable (endo_thickness) associate with clinical pregnancy as an outcome. Both associate at a univariate level with the OR for age 1. Age is also a strong associated a predictor of endo_thickness and they have a weak but significant correlation (r=-0.03, p It makes me wonder if age and endo_thickness may have an effect on each other so I performed a model with the interaction term which reverses the OR for endo_thickness now. I'm not sure how to interpret this now? The interaction hovers above 0.05, does this mean that it shouldn't be included in the analysis? Without the interaction term With the interaction term
