In a case such as this where the number of variables exceeds the number of observations in the training dataset, I would turn to one of the penalized regression techniques, such as lasso or elastic net, which perform both variable selection and coefficient shrinkage. Logistic regression models using lasso or elastic net can be run with the glmnet R package. A good source on lasso and elastic net is Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman's text "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction" available online here: http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/
