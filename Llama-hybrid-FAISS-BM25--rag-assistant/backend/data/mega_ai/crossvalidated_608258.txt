The problem of finding the partitioning that minimizes the trace of the within scatter matrix (this is the target criterion that k-means tries to minimize) has been shown to be NP-hard . For a proof, see Drineas, Frieze, Kannan, Vempala, Vinay: "Clustering Large Graphs via the Singular Value Decomposition." Machine Learning 56, pp. 9-33 (1999) This means that there is no other way than brute force to find the global optimum. The article above, however, also presents an algorithm that finds a solution that is guaranteed to be less than two times the optimum criterion. From a practical point of view, you should follow the suggestions in the comments to your question and use a primitive Monte Carlo algorithm by trying out different start points for k-means. This is actually what the R function kmeans does (see its argument nstart ).
