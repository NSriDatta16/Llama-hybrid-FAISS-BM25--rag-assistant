if you want project A to have project B (and its libs) on its classpath, then goto project A's properties, select Java Build Path, then select the Projects tab. Here you Add project B. Although you may be generating jars for each project, eclipse doesn't pay much attention to the jars. If you are going to have lots of java projects with lots of 3rd party dependencies, you may want to look at something like m2eclipse.
