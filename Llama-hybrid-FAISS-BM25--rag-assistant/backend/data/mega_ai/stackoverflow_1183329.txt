Is it wise to use ‘databinding’ and the ‘Data Sources’ window in Visual Studio?

Is it wise to use ‘ databinding ’ and the ‘ Data Sources ’ window in Visual Studio? It seems to me that dragging and dropping objects from the data sources window is so easy and seamless just until something breaks, then you have to spend hours trying to figure out what went wrong with the code generated by Visual Studio. Do serious programmers use this functionality or do they write every line of code when it comes to manipulating data in windows forms? Thanks in advance.
