I've gone through the opposite process. One of the first things I learned was that while you can write Perl code that looks like C or C++, you shouldn't. The same goes for you. You can probably find a way to write Perl-ish C++ code, but don't bother. The languages are too different. You need to learn how to write C++ code as a C++ programmer. Several goods books have already been suggested. I think you should augment that by finding a mentor . You'll get immediate feedback if you're doing things the right or wrong way. You can also check out the C++ FAQ Lite , especially chapters 28 and 29 on issues for new C++ programmers. The biggest difference is that C++ is strongly typed. Every variable has a type, and it doesn't change. Your example Perl code is technically possible in C++, but it requires an extra library that I'm not sure you're ready for yet. Instead, the C++ way is to think about a collection of mixed but related items as their own new type - a struct or class . Another great option is to post specific C++ questions here on SO. We encourage beginner-level questions as long as they're clearly worded and show some prior effort.
