What is artistic about hyperparameter tuning?

I recently started competing at kaggle which exposed me with hyper parameter tuning of models such as GBM,xgboost etc.All the sources that I studied to get started with an approach to tuning invariably started with the line " Hyper parameter tuning is more of an art." Most of the texts used Gridsearchcv or randomizedsearchcv to brute force through possible values of parameters.There was nothing "artistic" in this approach. Is there a next level more insightful approach to hyper parameter tuning that I am missing?How to make hyper parameter optimization more insightful?Do all of us just brute force?
