parent hidden but children still visible (I don't want them visible)!

Okay, so I had a situation where I needed to add some cloned DOM elements to a parent DIV element in a web page. I had four of these parent DIV holders. When I make their visibility switch from visible to hidden, a really weird things happens: ALL of the post page-load added children REMAIN visible! Here is a link to download the source code: http://www.clarencebowman.com/parent-child-visibility/parent-child-visibility.zip and here is a link to view the phenomenon first-hand: http://www.clarencebowman.com/parent-child-visibility What you will see is a red box with some magenta child elements added to it, post page-load. There is a show/hide button at the bottom of the page. I added a green stripe in the parent DIV to show that its child elements do indeed inherit its visibility properly. But after you add the cloned child elements and then hide the parent DIV, NONE of the cloned child elements disappears! I have already tried placing the child to be cloned inside the parent DIV before running the duplicating script... it makes no difference. Any child elements that are added post page-load seem to have somehow lost their inheritance link with the parent DIV element (the red box)..... Anyone else experience this? Is there a simple way to repair/replace/re-assign the children's inheritance? I am using jQuery 1.5.
