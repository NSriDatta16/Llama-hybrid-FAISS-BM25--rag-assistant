Getting good Binomial intervals is hard and coverage is very variable (see Brown, Kai, Dasgupta 2001 ) due to the discreteness of the observations. While that is not the question here, it is related. Scholz provides a technical note that also deals with hypergeometric intervals (section 6) and shows that these intervals have similar behaviour, presumably for similar reasons.
