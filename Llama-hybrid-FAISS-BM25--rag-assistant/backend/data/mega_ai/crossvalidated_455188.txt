Large gradient magnitude in WGAN-GP

I've implemented a minimal WGAN-GP on MNIST ( code here ).it kinda works and outputs some digits but loss/gradient magnitudes are so huge, for example: $GradientPenalty \approx 10^{19}$ $D(\hat{x})- D(x) \approx -10^{10}$ $-D(\hat{x}) \approx 10^{10}$ There is definitely something wrong with these numbers, but I've got no clues, have you any ideas?
