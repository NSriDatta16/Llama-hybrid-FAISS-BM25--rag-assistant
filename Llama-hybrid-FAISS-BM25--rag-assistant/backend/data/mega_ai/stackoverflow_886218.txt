WPF page layout control selection

I have an imagebrush of a soccer field as the page background and I want to be able create a line up by dragging players off the bench and positioning them on the field accordingly. I don't know what control to use for the background that allows the PlayerCard control to reside where it is dragged. Any help as to how to begin would be appreciated. You can get the idea here. What control to use?
