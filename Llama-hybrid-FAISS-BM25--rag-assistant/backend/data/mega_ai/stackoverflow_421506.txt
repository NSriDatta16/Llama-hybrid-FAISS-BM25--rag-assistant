HAML was designed as a more elegant way to define page structure; It was not intended to be used for formatting text, like what you're asking it to do. In this case, you're probably better off using something like Markdown or Textile . Both of these already have WYSIWYGs ( for Markdown , for Textile ( forked version )), and Haml's got built-in filters to convert it into HTML. e.g.: #content :markdown @post.body (Haml's wonderful space-indentation will even be preserved on output!)
