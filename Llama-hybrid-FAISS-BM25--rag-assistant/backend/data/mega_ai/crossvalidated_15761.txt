How to calculate an overall job satisfaction score and test group differences?

I am doing a project on finding out whether there is a difference in job satisfaction between employees of non-profit organisations and for-profit organisations. I also need to find whether job satisfaction varies as a function of age (categorized as below 20, 21-30 and so on), gender, and type of job (paid or volunteer). Regarding the job satisfaction, I have summed up their answers and labelled them as being satisfied, ambivalent and dissatisfied. Within the job satisfaction, I also measured their satisfaction on different aspects of their job (eg, pay, promotion) and each of these aspects summed up makes the job satisfaction score. I am so confused on how to analyze the data. I have analyzed them using an independent samples t-test but I have just remembered how my supervisor told me I could use factor analysis. But I have no experience in using factor analysis. Can anyone please help me and advice me on how I should analyze my data? @matt parker: thanks so much for your suggestion. I've only realized that I've done the wrong analysis, 1 week before the deadline! I'll try reading up on factor analysis now and fingers crossed that I'll get everything done by next week! :S
