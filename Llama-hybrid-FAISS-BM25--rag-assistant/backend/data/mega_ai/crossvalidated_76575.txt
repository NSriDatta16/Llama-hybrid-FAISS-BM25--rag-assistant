The number 2 in Deviance

What is the additional coefficient 2 in AIC, or other deviance criteria? In the books or on the internet I keep reading "historical reasons". What the heck are those historical reasons? Is there a merit for the 2 keep appearing? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(statistics) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion Clearly the correct deviance for $AIC$ is $LogLikelihood - k$. Not only that it is negated it is also scaled by 2 in presentations: $AIC=-2LogLikelihood + 2k$ But then to fix it in relative likelihood we divide by 2. $Relative Likelihood = e^{(AIC_{min}âˆ’AIC_i)/2}$ Thanks
