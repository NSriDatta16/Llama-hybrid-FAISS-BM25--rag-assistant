Does Dimensionality curse effect some models more than others?

The places I have been reading about dimensionality curse explain it in conjunction to kNN primarily, and linear models in general. I regularly see top rankers in Kaggle using thousands of features on dataset that hardly has 100k data points. They mainly use Boosted trees and NN, among others. That many features seem too high and I feel they would get affected by dimensionality curse. But that doesn't seem to be the case as these models make them top the competitions. So, back to my original question - do some models get affected by dimensionality curse more than others? Specifically, I am interested in the following models (only because these are the ones that I am aware of/used): Linear and Logistic Regression Decision Trees/RandomForest/Boosted Trees Neural Networks SVM kNN k-means clustering
