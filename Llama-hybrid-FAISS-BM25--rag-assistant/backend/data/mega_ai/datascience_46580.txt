Neural Network Sensordata as Input

I have a dataset consisting of sensor recordings about human movement. There are 22 classes of different movement like sitting or walking and 19 sensor values. Each recording of a movement has about 1000 lines contained in a csv file. My problem: I don't know how to present those recordings to a neural network (TensorFlow) so that it can be trained on the movement classes and even predict what was done in recording by getting those 19000 values. I don't even know which Neural Network Model I should use and therefore need your help.
