Logistic regression: recoding ordinal independent variables into dichotomous variables — yes or no?

What is the reasoning behind recoding ordinal in dependent variables in a binary logistic regression? Example: imagine a researcher is intrested in the effects of some political attitudes on turnout {0;1}. He or she would draw on survey data and the key independent variable of interest would by a typical Likert-scale variable like this one ('internal efficacy'): Normal people like me cannot make a difference in politics. 1 - Strongly agree 2 - Somewhat agree 3 - Neither agree nor disagree 4 - Somewhat disagree 5 - Strongly disagree Suppose, the researcher would then recode survey responses into a dichotomous independent variable by combining 1 & 2 into 1 and assigning 0 to everything else. This would of course reduce information (i.e., somewhat agree is treated the same as strongly agree), but would simplify the interpretation in the sense that a respondent can be thought of either having high internal efficacy, or not. Here are two examples of analyses of voter turnout that actually recode independent variables that way or at least following similar lines of thinking; one of which is an article by myself. Habersack, F., Heinisch, R., Jansesberger, V., & Mühlböck, A. (2021). Perceived Deprivation and Voter Turnout in Austria: Do Views on Social Inequality Moderate the Deprivation—Abstention Nexus?. Political Studies, Link . Mahlangu, T., & Schulz-Herzenberg, C. (2022). The Influence of Political Efficacy on Voter Turnout in South Africa. Politikon, 1-17, Link . I wonder if there is any other reasoning behind transforming in dependent variables in logistic regression like this, meaning other than just simplifying the interpretation of survey responses. EDIT (1): I'm aware of @Tom's question from 2013 ( What is the benefit of breaking up a continuous predictor variable? ), but in contrast to his post, I'm exclusively interested in binary logistic models and the practice of dichotomizing ordinal variables (because it seems to be related to logistic regression models and the nature of the outcome variable). EDIT (2): I have edited my initial question to clarify that I am interested only in the dichotomization of in dependent variables in logistic regression, I am not interested in dependent variables and the approriate choice of logistic regression (binary, ordinal...).
