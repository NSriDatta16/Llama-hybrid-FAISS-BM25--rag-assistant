There is the RSNNS package that provides access to the "Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator" (SNNS). It contains the classical recurrent network structures of types 'Jordan' and 'Elman'. SNNS is a bit old (before 2000), but may still be worth a try. The R package itself has been updated in September this year.
