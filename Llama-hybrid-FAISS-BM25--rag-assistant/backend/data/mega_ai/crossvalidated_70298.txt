You can use a logistic regression model to estimate the risk that someone dies within a specific time period. There are no implicit assumptions about the instantaneous risk of death within that time interval, so you cannot obtain the hazard rate. However, you can interpolate the hazard to be constant across the time frame, so by using the the fitted risk (as you've calculated) divided by the time denominator, you will have an estimate of the hazard function. If you want an explicit estimate of the hazard function, you need to use the exact failure times and either a parametric survival model (possibly piecewise) or smoothed estimates of the baseline hazard from the Cox regression model.
