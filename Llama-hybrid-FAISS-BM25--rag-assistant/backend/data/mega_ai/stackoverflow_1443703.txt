Did you think of a solution based on subversion . You could use SharpSVN (.NET) to create your own Document management based on it. Advantages: Rights can be managed in SVN for access rights You can attach any information you want to the documents means SVN properties It is fully open source and actively used/maintained Links can be created with "externals" You can create baselines for your documents easily by branching/tagging Subversion makes binary diffs and so you minimize the backup overhead. Document retrieval might be a bit slow but usually users want the latest version of a doc and this could be solved by using the local copy or caching.
