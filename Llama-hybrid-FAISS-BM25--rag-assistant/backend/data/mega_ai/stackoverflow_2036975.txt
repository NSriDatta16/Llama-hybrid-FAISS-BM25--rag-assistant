You can't force an Activity to appear from an application running the background. The documentation says : If the application is running in the background and needs the user's attention, the application should create a notificaiton that allows the user to respond at his or her convenience. If your Activity is paused the user may be doing something else in a different application and probably doesn't want your Activity suddenly appearing on top of what they are currently doing. You should be using a Status Bar Notification . This allows your application to put an icon in the Status Bar. The user can then slide down the Status Bar drawer and click on your notification to open your application and show the relevant Activity . This is the way the vast majority of Android apps notify the user when running in the background.
