an intutive explanation is that given independence of treatment from potential outcomes the average of $Y_0$ in the control group (roughly E[Y_{i0}|D=0]) is as good an estimate of E[ $Y_0$ ] as the average of $Y_0$ in the experimental group. Thus, given the aforementioned independence you can 'exchange' participants in the experimental and the control group; they are just two random samples from the larger population. Hope that helps.
