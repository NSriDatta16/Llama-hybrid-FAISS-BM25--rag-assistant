A question about variable reference in chained XSLTs

I think this is a beginner question, it is regarding the variable references across different XSLT templates. The structure is like this: I firstly have an XSLT file, and in it, I've declared an template A, and within it, I basically loop through each record(row) of an XML file, say, xml_A, and I've declared a variable to refer to a particular field called "id" of the current record in xml_A. Then, within this for-each loop, I need to call another template B. .... For template B, I actually created another XSLT file under the same directory. The B contains millions of records from xml file "xml_B", but I only want the records that have the SAME id field as the current record of template A. Here is how I did it: ... Here comes my question. I used the above to refer to the id field of the current record that the upper loop is on. However, I am not sure whether this is correct, I've done some testing, since the data file is so huge, thus it is not easy to visually test if this is doing the right thing. So I wonder if anybody could advise if the above reference to variable of the outer-loop is correct since if I delete that, the XML editor will complain. Thanks in advance. Update from comments I think I didn't make it clear enough. Actually neither xml_A or xml_B is the xml files that are going to be XSLTed. They are just data files which I will use to pull data from, and there's another XML file C that is used as for applying the stylesheet on and it is empty. So in my style sheet, using the provide answer, I must have a way to make it refer to this data storage file xml_A.
