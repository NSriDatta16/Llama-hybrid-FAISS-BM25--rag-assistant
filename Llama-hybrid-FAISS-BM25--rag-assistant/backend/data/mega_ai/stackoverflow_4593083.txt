So when the user navigates back from Page1, you want to do something on MainPage? Override OnNavigatedTo in MainPage and handle the navigation that way. I don't think there's a really elegant way to determining that the navigation was due to a "backward" navigation - you may need to use PhoneApplicationService.Current.State to work that out. Note that this due to tombstoning etc, this could be a different instance of MainPage from the original one. Either way, you won't be able to just continue from where you left off within a method . You need to think in a more event-based way.
