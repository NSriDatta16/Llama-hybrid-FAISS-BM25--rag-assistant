When comparing the means of more than two groups (e.g. the average heights of children, teenagers, and adults) you can use ANOVA and MANOVA. If you want to examine between same class you can use paired t-test. Another method(for dynamic case) you can follow is to try simple spearman's correlation test for each iteration and create a subsidiary dataset from it and then try regression analysis on it. Pardon me, if my answer was not up to your expectation.
