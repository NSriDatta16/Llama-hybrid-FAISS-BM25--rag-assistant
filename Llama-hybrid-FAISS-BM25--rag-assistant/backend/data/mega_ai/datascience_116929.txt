Well, there are several reasons you can consider actually on why accuracy might not be the best measure of performance for an information retrieval system. For one, accuracy only considers the number of correct predictions made by the system, but not the relative importance of those predictions. For example, if a system has an accuracy of 90%, but only returns one relevant result out of a hundred, that result might not be very useful to the user. Even considering that, accuracy is a global measure that does not provide any information about the performance of the system on specific queries or groups of queries. This can make it difficult to identify areas where the system is performing well or poorly, and to make targeted improvements to the system. That's why Precision, recall, and F1 score are more useful measures for evaluating the performance.
