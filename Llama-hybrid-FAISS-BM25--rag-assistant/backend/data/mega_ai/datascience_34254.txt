Actually you want to classify time series. Going from here you have basically two options: Build features from this time series, i.e. RMS, Peak Values, etc.. and classify them with "classical" predictors like SVM or Random Forests. Use neural networks, or more specifically use LSTM in order to feed directly your "array of numbers", which is a time series.
