All of the server side solutions that you will see will really boil down to using the User-Agent string in the request. Doing the work on the client side (JS) has the benefit of being able to interact directly with the browser/OS. For example, jQuery's browser function - which might be exactly what you need - runs a series of tests on the DOM/browser to see how it reacts, and then determines the browser type and version based on those reactions. There have been some projects to extend jQuery's browser function to include OS detection, but I have not used them before; easily found with a quick Google search. Cheers.
