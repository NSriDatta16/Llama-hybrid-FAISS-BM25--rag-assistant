Unfortunately, net-snmp does not yet include support for agent creation in python. If you look at the README in the python directory of the net-snmp source tree, it says, The 'netsnmp' module provides a full featured, tri-lingual SNMP (SNMPv3, SNMPv2c, SNMPv1) client API. It looks like they've updated the FAQ and removed any mention of python. If you are set on using python, you can checkout PySNMP as an alternative. I don't have any personal experience with it but the project is active (the most recent update was in January of this year) and it looks to have most features except AgentX support (so you can't create a subagent that connects to snmpd).
