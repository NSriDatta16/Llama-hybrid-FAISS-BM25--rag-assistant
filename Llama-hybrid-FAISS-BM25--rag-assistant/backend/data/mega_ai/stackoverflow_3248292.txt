Bear in mind that since you want approximately 1/12th of all the data, it may well be more efficient for Oracle to perform a full table scan anyway. This may explain why performance was worse when you followed harpo's advice. Why? Suppose your data is such that 20 rows fit on each database block (on average), so that you have a total of 3,000,000/20 = 150,000 blocks. That means a full table scan will require 150,000 block reads. Now about 1/12th of the 3,000,000 rows will be for month 05. 3,000,000/12 is 250,000. So that's 250,000 table reads if you use the index - and that's ignoring the index reads that will also be required. So in this example the full table scan does a lot less work than the indexed search.
