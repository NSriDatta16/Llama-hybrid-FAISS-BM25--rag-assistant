In my opinion, the use of the equality makes dependence on $X$ explicit. The only place I have seen notation like $y \vert X$ is when the distribution of $y$ is being discussed. You see this frequently in Bayesian models like $$ y\vert \mu , \sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma) $$ This notation tells me that there is a prior for $\sigma$ and that the distribution of $y$ depends on whatever $\sigma$ is drawn from the data generating process. In any case, I don't see much difference between $y = $ and $y\vert X = $ .
