Ruby - Socks4 proxy with WWW::Mechanize and NET::HTTP::GET

I searched on google and read in the ruby manuals, but I couldn't find a way to use WWW::Mechanize and NET::HTTP::GET over a socks4 proxy. I read, that WWW::Mechanize is a subclass of the UserAgent module, and that therefore the ->proxy() method would work. But the manual only talks about http, ftp and gopher proxy. Any ideas how to support socks4? Here are the code snippets: def get_request(url_in) url = URI.parse(url_in) req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(url.path, {"User-Agent" => $UserAgent}) res = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) { |http| http.request(req) } return res.body end agent = WWW::Mechanize.new agent.user_agent_alias('Windows Mozilla') page = agent.get("urlhere") post_form = page.form('post')
