Removing codebehind files from WPF MVVM projects

I am coding a WPF application using MVVM pattern. I don't need to have codebehind files for my user controls. What is the best way to remove these files elegantly? I can create a user control class then I can use this class for my all views. (for more info: http://sondreb.com/blog/post/No-Code-Behind-for-MVVM.aspx ) Are there any alternative ways? Thank you.
