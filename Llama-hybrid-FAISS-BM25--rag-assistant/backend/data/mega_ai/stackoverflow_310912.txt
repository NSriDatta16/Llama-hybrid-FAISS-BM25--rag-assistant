How do I add an ActiveX component to my project in Visual C++ 2008

I am just learning Visual C++ and I am used to Visual Basic where I just select the ActiveX component from a list of references. I can seem to add it anywhere. If I go to the Project | References, it is all blank. It only allows me to specify a path and when I specify the path of the AcitveX component, nothing new happens. I dragged the ActiveX component into Visual C++ and it now shows up in the Object Browser but I cant seem to do anything with it. I am using Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition. Thanks
