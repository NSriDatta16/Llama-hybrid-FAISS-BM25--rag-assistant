If these are prediction intervals (and thus not confidence intervals, there is a difference !) for a prespecified coverage probability, then one can use interval scores . These can be scaled to be comparable between different time series (if this is what you are working with). If these are confidence intervals, then you are probably out of luck, because CIs by definition pertain to unobservable parameters.
