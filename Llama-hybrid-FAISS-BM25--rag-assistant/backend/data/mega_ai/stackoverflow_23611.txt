OU is an Organizational Unit (sort of like a Subfolder in Explorer), not a Group, Hence group1, 2 and 3 are not actually groups. You are looking for the DN Attribute, also called "distinguishedName". You can simply use DOMAIN\DN once you have that. Edit: For groups, the CN (Common Name) could also work. The full string from Active Directory normally looks like this: cn=Username,cn=Users,dc=DomainName,dc=com (Can be longer or shorter, but the important bit is that the "ou" part is worthless for what you're trying to achieve.
