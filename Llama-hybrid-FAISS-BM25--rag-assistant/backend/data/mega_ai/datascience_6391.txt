R - Interpreting neural networks plot

I know there are similar question on stats.SE, but I didn't find one that fulfills my request; please, before mark the question as a duplicate, ping me in the comment. I run a neural network based on neuralnet to forecast SP500 index time series and I want to understand how I can interpret the plot posted below: Particularly, I'm interested to understand what is the interpretation of the hidden layer weight and the input weight; could someone explain me how to interpret that number, please? Any hint will be appreciated.
