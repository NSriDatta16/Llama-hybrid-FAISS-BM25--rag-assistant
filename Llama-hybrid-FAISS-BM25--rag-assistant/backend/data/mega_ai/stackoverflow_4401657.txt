How to avoid SRP chaos?

By applying the SRP principle you are bound to have a lot of classes. If this works fine for a small project how can you handle and organize the amount of classes on a large project ? how do you organize the folder structure ? how do you remember what you build ? how do you know if others didn't build the same functionally in other class ?
