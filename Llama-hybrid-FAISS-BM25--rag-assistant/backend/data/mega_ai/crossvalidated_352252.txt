Accuracy very different from CV

In my random forest classifier in Python (2 classes), I am getting an accuracy score of 46.9 % (using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics). However, when I print clf.cv_results_['mean_test_score'], all ten results are above 65%. What's going on? Is there a bug? My apologies if this is a simple question.
