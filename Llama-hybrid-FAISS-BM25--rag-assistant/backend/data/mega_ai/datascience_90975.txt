keras mnist dataset

I am learning Neural Network . I was running following source code import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline import numpy as np (X_train , y_train) , (X_test , y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data() I was searching about keras mnist dataset. I found this . From that webpage I found This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. More info can be found at the MNIST homepage. But, I was trying lot of datas. Finally, I thought to write plt.matshow(X_train[10010]) It outputs : As mnist digits classification were they had test set of 10,000 images . So, over than 10000 should return error. While it is showing more plots. Why?
