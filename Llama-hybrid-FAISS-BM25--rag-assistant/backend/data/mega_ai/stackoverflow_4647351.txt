Creating a form with additional dynamic fields specified by customer, options?

We have a desktop app which basically models a job for a specific sector (Transport for example) with things like job date, references, driver allocation etc which is then sent to/from PDAs for status updates. Although it's mainly off the shelf, we usually end up having to do bespoke parts to suit the company, which about 90% of the time it only additional data fields that don't really require any logic, only storing / retrieval. I've been looking around for a basic drag and drop library to turn a form into an editable mode that I could save position, component type, default value and populate at runtime in non-edit mode but haven't really been able to find one. Is the best way to just roll my own or am I missing a library that will get me 60% of the way there? WPF or Winforms help would be appreciated (we're using Winforms but moving to WPF). Cheers, Thomas
