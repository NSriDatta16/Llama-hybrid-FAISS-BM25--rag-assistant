If you want to demonstrate that two sets of numbers are nearly identical, you don't need the correlation at all. You can just take the difference between them. If store one has monthly earnings a1,a2,etc and the other store has monthly earnings b1,b2, etc. then you just take the difference to get: (a1-b1, a2-b2,....). If the numbers are close to identical, then a1-b1, a2-b2, etc should all be close to zero. Take the average of all (a1-b1, a2-b2,...) and that average number should be close to zero.
