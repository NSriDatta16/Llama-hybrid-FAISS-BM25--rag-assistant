How do I work out which of my markers are visible in my Google map?

Here is what I am trying to do. I have about 160 places of interest. The user enters their address (postcode, full address, whatever) which I use Google to geo-encode. I then create a Google map centred about this point and I add a marker for each of my points of interest to the map (using a MarkerManager). So far so good. I want to display a list of items beside the map that correspond to the markers being displayed. When the user drags the window, or zooms in or out, or whatever, I want to update this list. If too many items are shown at once, I want to display a message to the user. What is the best way to do this? I tried adding a listener to the MarkerManager so that when it changed I could work out which markers were still shown. However, the event doesn't seem to fire as I expected, i.e. when the markers being displayed change. Also, I doubt that looping over 160+ markers like this every time is going to be efficient. GEvent.addListener(mgr, "changed", function(bounds, markerCount) { var visibleBounds = map.getBounds(); for (var i = 0; i Another item "; count ++; } } alert(count); }); What is the best way to accomplish this? UPDATE : This code works, but the event only seems to fire when the map is moved by a certain minimum distance. So if the user drags the map a short distance, the event doesn't seem to fire.
