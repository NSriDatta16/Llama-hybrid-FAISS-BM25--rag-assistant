How to use the MCMC method for multivariate distributions?

I wish to find the posterior of a joint distribution of 4 parameters whose prior and likelihoods are known, but I do not understand how to accept and reject samples, in any other case other than single variable cases used in Metropolis-Hastings. I am a mathematics undergrad, and I would be really grateful if you could direct me to some good literature. Thanking you in advance. PS:- This is for a problem in Operations Research(Reliability Theory). If you require a more specific description of the problem statement, please let me know.
