How to test for Granger Causality in non-time-series data

I would like to know how can I test for Granger Causality in data that does not present a sequential behavior. As far as I understand, at least in economic models, it is assumed that the data is stationary and that a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model is suitable to explain the data. However, when the data is not sequential (it is not a time series), a VAR model is no longer suitable, since there is no concept of lag. In this situation, what model should I use to test for Granger Causality? What statistical test should I use?
