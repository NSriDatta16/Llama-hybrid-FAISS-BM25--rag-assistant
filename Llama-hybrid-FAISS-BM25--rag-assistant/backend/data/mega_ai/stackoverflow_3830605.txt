For source code, :h = In a nutshell, in normal mode inside a block you wish to work with: =a{ to re-indent a block. =a} and =aB work as well. =2a{ to re-indent this block and its outer block. If you happen to stand on a brace then =% will re-indent up to the matching brace. >a{ to increase the indent of this block. to decrease the indent of this block. . repeats the last command, so decreases the indent of this block twice. Make sure you have filetype set so Vim recognizes the filetype. Indenting is a function of the file type, after all. For text, :h gq gq{ will format this paragraph. gq( will format this sentence. gqgq will format this line. gggqG will format the entire document.
