Nonparametric statistics is to a good extent a disjoint collection of tests and estimators. Especially for tests, I suggest instead using semiparametric regression models as a unifying framework. Commonly used tests such as the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests may be obtained as special cases of the proportional odds semiparametric ordinal logistic regression model. A better rank-based approach than the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic may be obtained likewise . The regression framework easily extends to allow covariate adjustment and longitudinal data. Iâ€™ve taken this approach in my introductory e-book BBR .
