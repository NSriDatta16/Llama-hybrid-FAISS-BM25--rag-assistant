Fitting a Time series model

My data set(Petrol 95 Octane) is stationary at 1st difference. Both Original data and 1st differenedata set has Heteroscedasticity. GARCH model doesn't fit to data set. Can I use ARIMA/GARCH? What are the other methods? I checked hereroscedasticity using Evies software used R to fit GARCH.( coefficient of the model doesn't significant ) This is the time plot.
