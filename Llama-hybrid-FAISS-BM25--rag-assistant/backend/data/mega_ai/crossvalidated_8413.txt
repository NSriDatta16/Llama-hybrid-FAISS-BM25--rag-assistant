The two together don't tell you anything more than the second one would alone! The main effects are uninteresting and misleading when there is interaction present. The second model tells you all you need to know. Here are a couple of plots, with R code, to help you understand what that second model looks like... library(lattice) a This one shows the estimated effect of a on y by levels of b . At each level of b , the relationship is positive. This is your significant positive slope for main effect of a in the presence of the interaction a:b . a This is image shows the estimated effects of b on y within levels of a . You can see why you have no significant main effect for b . The direction of the y~b relationship depends on level of a . Thus, no independent relationship (imagine averaging those lines) but a significant interaction (clear pattern when you take into account the level of a )
