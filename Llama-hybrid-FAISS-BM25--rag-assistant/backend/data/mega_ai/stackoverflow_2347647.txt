"Elegant" CruiseControl.Net and WiX integration

I am trying to integrate the automatic generation of MSI installers with my CruiseControl.Net installation. I can see how I can manually build an MSBuild file that calls candle and then light , but I need to make it build installers that can do upgrades, so can I use the BuildLabel (or something of that area) to regenerate new GUIDs for the newer versions? I have already separated out the configurable parts of the WiX definitions, so it might be easier to hand roll a script or something. Any help would be appreciated - especially working examples! Thanks (as usual) in advance Mark
