My best advice would be to require pair programming or code reviews for all code written. It is easy as a single developer to miss something or forget a security measure - but if that happens, it should get picked up at the code review, especially when the reviewer is aware that security is mission-critical for the application. In terms of tools, checkout Google Skipfish . It allows you to run a comprehensive suite of tests against the application, telling you where there might be things that need your attention.
