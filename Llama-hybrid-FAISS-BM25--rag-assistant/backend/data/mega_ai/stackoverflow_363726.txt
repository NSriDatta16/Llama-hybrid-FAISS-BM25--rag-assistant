Where can I find the official description of Flex html-template and output folder structure?

I'm looking for an official Adobe page explaining the ins and outs of the various directories used in Flex Builder, namely html-template, bin-debug and bin-release . There's a lot happening in these folder: folders get created and deleted, files get copied around automatically, or not, as seems to be the case with AIR apps. I'm looking for specific information on settings that control this behaviour, documented intention of the folder structure etc. In short, I'm trying to understand a part of Flex workflow that seems to work in unpredictable and completely undocumented ways. I'm not looking for help in organizing project assets, I'm more curious about how the semi-automatic output folders work, and how to affect their configuration.
