You can safely ignore the warning. It's a weird warning - it means you are using tools for API level 8 (Android 2.2/Froyo) but targeting API level 3 (Android 1.5/Cupcake). That warning will always come up unless you you were using the SDK to target the Android release it coincides with - in this case, you would have to target Android 2.2 with your current SDK.
