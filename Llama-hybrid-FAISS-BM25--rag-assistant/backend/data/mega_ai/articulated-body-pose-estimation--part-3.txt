ections are then triangulated to obtain 3D joint positions. The 2D network may be refined to produce better detections based on the 3D data. Furthermore, such approaches often have filters in both 2D and 3D to refine the detected points. In the second, a neural network is trained end-to-end to predict 3D joint positions directly from a set of images, without 2D joint position intermediate detections. Such approaches often project image features into a cube and then use a 3D convolutional neural network to predict a 3D heatmap for each joint. 3D shape Concurrently with the work above, scientists have been working on estimating the full 3D shape of a human or animal from a set of images. Most of the work is based on estimating the appropriate pose of the skinned multi-person linear (SMPL) model within an image. Variants of the SMPL model for other animals have also been developed. Generally, some keypoints and a silhouette are detected for each animal within the image, and then the parameters 3D shape model are fit to match the position of keypoints and silhouette. Unsupervised The above algorithms all rely on annotated images, which can be time-consuming to produce. To address this issue, computer vision researchers have developed new algorithms which can learn 3D keypoints given only annotated 2D images from a single view or identify keypoints given videos without any annotations. Applications Assisted living Personal care robots may be deployed in future assisted living homes. For these robots, high-accuracy human detection and pose estimation is necessary to perform a variety of tasks, such as fall detection. Additionally, this application has a number of performance constraints. Character animation Traditionally, character animation has been a manual process. However, poses can be synced directly to a real-life actor through specialized pose estimation systems. Older systems relied on markers or specialized suits. Recent advances in pose estimation and motion capture have enabled markerless applications, sometimes in real time. Intelligent driver assisting system Car accidents account for about two percent of deaths globally each year. As such, an intelligent system tracking driver pose may be useful for emergency alerts . Along the same lines, pedestrian detection algorithms have been used successfully in autonomous cars, enabling the car to make smarter decisions. Video games Commercially, pose estimation has been used in the context of video games, popularized with the Microsoft Kinect sensor (a depth camera). These systems track the user to render their avatar in-game, in addition to performing tasks like gesture recognition to enable the user to interact with the game. As such, this application has a strict real-time requirement. Medical Applications Pose estimation has been used to detect postural issues such as scoliosis by analyzing abnormalities in a patient's posture, physical therapy, and the study of the cognitive brain development of young children by monitoring motor functionality. Other applications Other applications include video surveillance, animal tracking and behavior understanding, sign language detection, advanced human–computer interaction, and markerless motion capturing. Related technology A commercially successful but specialized computer vision-based articulated body pose estimation technique is optical motion capture. This approach involves placing markers on the individual at strategic locations to capture the 6 degrees-of-freedom of each body part. Research groups A number of groups and companies are researching pose estimation, including groups at Brown University, Carnegie Mellon University, MPI Saarbruecken, Stanford University, the University of California, San Diego, the University of Toronto, the École Centrale Paris, ETH Zurich, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), the University of California, Irvine and Polytechnic University of Catalonia.
