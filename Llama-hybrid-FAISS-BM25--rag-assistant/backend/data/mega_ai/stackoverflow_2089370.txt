Size SKU in Magento

How can I allow SKU be longer than 34 characters (for simple products) for all products? When i add new product(simple) and enter more than 34 characters, Magento cuts it to 34 after saving. In the database the 'sku' attributes ( for quete item,order item,invoice item, shipment item) from eav_attribute table hold varchar(255). For Catalog_Product_Entity the attributed is VarChar(64). In either case, it is more than 34characters. Thus, I could change SKU to 64 characters without making any change in database, correct? How do i do that? I have good understanding of the user side magento code, but not Admin side. Can you suggest me good tutorial on making changes in Admin side that could help me figure this question myself. Thank you, Margots
