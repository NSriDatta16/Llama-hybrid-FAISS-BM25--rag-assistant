PHP: optimum configuration storage?

My application gets configured via a lot of key/values (let's say 30.000 for instance) I want to find the best deployment method for these configurations, knowing that I want to avoid DEFINEs to allow for runtime re-configuration. I have thought of pre-compiling them into an array via a php file pre-compiling them into a tmpfs sqlite database pre-compiling them into a memcached db what are my options for the best random access time to these configuration (memory is not an issue) ? the best structured access time if i can break up these configuration into families like (network, i18n, ..) Thanks Jerome
