There are techniques like singular value decomposition (SDV) and principal components analysis (PCA) that when applied to many documents (or many sentences in your case if you have only one document) can produce vectors of words that occur together. These vectors would then represent the topics. SVD and PCA are commonly used text analysis techniques that have been shown to be capable of identifying different sections/topics of newspapers (e.g., sports, finance, world, etc) when applied to many news articles.
