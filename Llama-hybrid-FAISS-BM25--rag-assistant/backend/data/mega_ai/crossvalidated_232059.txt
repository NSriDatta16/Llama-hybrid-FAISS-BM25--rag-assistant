Most of the current answers are oriented "data science", which is definitely a highly employable area. As the original poster mentioned a particular interest in stochastic processes and time series, another area of mathematical statistics* that may be relevant is state-space estimation . This is used to estimate models where the system evolves due to feedback between highly structured (quasi-)deterministic processes and stochastic forcing. For example state-space estimation is ubiquitous in autonomous vehicles . (*This area is commonly considered to be part of engineering, or other domains , but certainly involves mathematical statistics.)
