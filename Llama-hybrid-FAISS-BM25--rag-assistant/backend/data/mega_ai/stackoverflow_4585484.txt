On a side note, and this is more of an observation, in your DragableSpace code i've noticed two things. In public DragableSpace(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {... you haven't called a.recycle(); after you've accessed all your properties of obtainStyledAttributes. This is bad i think. I'm not entirely sure, as i've just picked up java, but i found that i had to change super.DragableSpace(...) to this.DragableSpace(...). This could have just been particular to my component, but wasn't entirely sure if that was correct or not.
