Passwords are as secure as the weakest link between user and the location where the password is stored. Basically, this means that it's not only the way the password is stored, that needs to be secured, but also the connection lines between user and storage. When server and communications are secure, the weakest link often turns out to be the user. (Because users sometimes have the memory capacity of a pet rock.) A colleague of mine once lost his laptop and he was quite worried that the thief would access all the secret stuff on his system. As it turned out, he had attached a small note on his laptop with his password on it. And unfortunately, he isn't the only person in this world who just writes passwords on a note next to their computer.
