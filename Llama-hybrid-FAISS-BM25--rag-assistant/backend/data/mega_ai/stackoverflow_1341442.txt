How to deal with mixed databases?

Did you ever have the following situation: you need to store information, but a part of this information is well modeled with one type of database (in a very loose sense), and another part is well modeled with another type. Examples: a set of files and additional information about each of them stored in a relational SQL database. an OODB together with a triplestore. two previously completely unrelated key/value data storage which must be integrated, but kept separated. What do you think it's the best way to deal with this kind of situation? keep the two types of data separated, and write a software layer that keep them synchronized ? use only one kind of database, adapting one kind of data into the other (e.g. storing the file into the relational db as a blob, or storing the relational part in a hacked up file-based database on the disk)?
