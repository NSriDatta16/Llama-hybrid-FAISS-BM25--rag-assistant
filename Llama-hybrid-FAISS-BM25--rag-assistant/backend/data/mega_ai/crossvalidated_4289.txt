I don't know if this is exactly what you are looking for (esp. I don't know how large is $n$ and what you intend to do with these results), however I have successfully used coinertia analysis when I was working with two data sets (same observations in rows), and for more than two data sets there are K-table methods, as implemented in the ade4 R package. An introduction to K-table analyses outlines the main principles. When the objective is to link two or more Tables, Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis is also an option. It seems to me that you can choose non-euclidean metric, provided it has some meaning for the data at hand and the interpretation of the factorial space. You can see an example with the use of kdist() in ade4 for applying an PCA on different distance matrices. Jollife's book on Principal component analysis should provide additional hints about this (but I didn't check). There's also all the work made in the spirit of Gifi on non-linear methods (in R, a lot of packages have been developed by Jan de Leeuw, see the PsychoR project).
