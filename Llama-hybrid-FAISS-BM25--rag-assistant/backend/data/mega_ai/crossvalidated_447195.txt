Need mathematical steps for Hoeffding's Inequality applied to Bernoulli Distribution

I am trying to understand Hoeffiding's Inequality in Machine Learning and I am referring to WikiPedia for it. Hoeffding's Inequality is defined as follows: $ P(|\hat{\theta} - \theta)| \ge \epsilon) \le 2e^{-2n\epsilon^2} $ But when the inequality applied to Independent and Identically Distributed Bernoulli Random Variables, the inequality becomes as follows: How can I derive the second inequality from the first ineqaulity? I hope to get understandable mathematical steps from the first to the second inequality.
