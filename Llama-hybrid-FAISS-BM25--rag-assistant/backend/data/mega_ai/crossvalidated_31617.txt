I don't have a proof of this, but I think this relates to the link function in the context of a generalized linear model. A model with normal errors and identity link (ie. an OLS regression) will have the property you describe. A model with a non-linear link function (like a logistic regression) will have differences in regression coefficients for rv1 between Y~rv1 + rv2 and Y~rv1 because you are averaging over a non-linear function.
