embedded linux, how to switch the use of the serial port at the push of a button?

I am a business programmer with a few years of Linux administration experience. I'm starting out in embedded Linux. Yesterday, we were discussing a new device design and I was asked a few questions I had no answers for. The engineers want to have some push buttons on an electronic board with a serial port on it. The OS is Linux. Normally, when a user will connect to the serial port, a protocol will answer him instead of a Linux login prompt. However, if he pushes a sequence of buttons on the device, a Linux prompt will answer him on the serial port instead. The Linux driver to handle the push button interrupt handling aside, how can you switch the basic use of the serial port like that? Does anyone have a URL reference on how to do this? (preferably with some sample code) Note: I proposed providing a nice menu on login for a given user, but no can do. Thanks in advice for any suggestions. Best regards, Bert
