How to interpret coefficients from a GARCH model?

Recently I have opened a question here to understand the output of a GARCH model. My goal is to understand if the series I'm checking is heteroscedastic or not. I'm using the garch() function from the tseries package. First I built a linear regression like this: mod Then I need to check if the residuals of this linear regression present heteroscedasticity. I did: g and then summary(g) I get the follow output: > summary(g) Call: garch(x = lm(A ~ B)$resi, order = order(c(1, 1))) Model: GARCH(1,2) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.2058 -1.0262 0.1404 1.1069 3.6553 Coefficient(s): Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) a0 3.361e-04 9.352e-05 3.594 0.000326 *** a1 3.045e-01 4.486e-02 6.787 1.14e-11 *** a2 1.209e-06 8.855e-02 0.000 0.999989 b1 4.938e-01 1.060e-01 4.660 3.17e-06 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Diagnostic Tests: Jarque Bera Test data: Residuals X-squared = 18.84, df = 2, p-value = 8.108e-05 Box-Ljung test data: Squared.Residuals X-squared = 49.7251, df = 1, p-value = 1.769e-12 Thanks to the user who answered my question, I now understand that the ao is the intercept and the other a1 and b1 are the coefficients I need to check to understand if this time series is heteroscedastic or not. The problem (doubt) is that now I also see a2 in the regression table: What does it stand for? Is it correct to say that if all coefficients have a $p$-value above 0.05 (...)
