Don't use a logistic regression with the original values because your data are not counts (in the two categories: amount distributed and amount not distributed) and the total sample size (amount proposed = amount distributed + amount not distributed) would be huge. The page in the link you provided suggested to use the fractions directly in a binomial or quasibinomial GLM with so-called "robust" standard errors. Maybe that will work but how does one evaluate the quality of the results? Another hack for for percentage data is to apply an arcsine transform to the response variable and then perform an Ordinary Least Squares regression (Crawley 2008. The R Book. p. 570). Be sure to check the OLS diagnostics (the residuals should be normally distributed and have a constant variance). I get the impression that you are not highly proficient in statistical modelling (like me) and am looking to pass judgement on someone else's published work. You need to take care that your re-analysis is reliable.
