After more reading, particularly the book by West and Harrison (1997), it seems that it is called a Bayesian forecasting or filtering problem. If you don't wish to model the dynamics (or can't), the model you could use is then that of a random walk. If the variables are normally-distributed, the Kalman filter would give you the maximum a-posteriori estimate.
