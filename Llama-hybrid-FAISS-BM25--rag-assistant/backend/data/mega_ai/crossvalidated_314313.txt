If you really believe the outliers come from a different process, then why not model that with a mixture model? Trimming and Winsorizing are crude solutions to say the least. Also, with regard to kurtosis, it is mainly determined by the tails: For all possible distributions of random variables $X$ having finite fourth moment, kurtosis is within $\pm 0.5$ of $E\{Z^4*I(|Z| > 1)\} + 0.5$, where $Z = (X - \mu)/\sigma$. Further, if you restrict the class of distributions to continuous distributions where the density of $Z^2$ decreases on the $[0,1]$ interval, then kurtosis is within $\pm 0.25$ of $E\{Z^4*I(|Z| > 1)\} + 0.25$. Finally, for any sequence of distributions where kurtosis $k$ tends to infinity, $\lim E\{Z^4*I(|Z| > b)\}/k \rightarrow 1$, for every real number $b$. The previous three statements are mathematical theorems proven in my paper "Kurtosis as Peakedness, 1905 - 2014. R.I.P.," and together explain why kurtosis is a measure of the tails of the distribution, and not the peak or center. Some have provided "counterexamples" to the fact that kurtosis measures tails, but these are red herrings: If you define a tail measure that is not kurtosis, then of course kurtosis does not measure that particular tail measure. There are infinitely many measures of tail. On the other hand, there can be no counterexamples to the theorems I just stated. All of which is to say that if you truncate the tails, you no longer have anything related to kurtosis. Actually, you would have something much closer to kurtosis if you reverse trim , replacing all $Z$ within $[-1,1]$ with 0, and then finding the average of the resulting $Z^4$ values. By the first theorem above, the actual kurtosis is between the result of that calculation, and the result of that calculation +1. Finally, these theorems apply to any distributions, including empirical distributions. With empirical distributions, $Var(X)$ has $n$ in the denominator rather than $n-1$, so the $Z$-values must be defined using that variance estimate. The kurtosis of the empirical distribution is then the average of the resulting $Z$ values, each taken to the fourth power.
