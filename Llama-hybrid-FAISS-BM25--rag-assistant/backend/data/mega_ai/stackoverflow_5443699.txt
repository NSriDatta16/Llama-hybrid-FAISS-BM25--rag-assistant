Pickling inner classes

I have a python module called model with basically the following content: class Database: class Publiation(object): pass class Article(Publication): pass class Book(Publication): pass class AnotherDatabase: class Seminar(object): pass ... I define the objects in the database as classes nested under a main class in order to organize them more distinctively. The objects are parsed from a large XML file, which takes time. I would like to pickle the imported objects to make them loadable in shorter time. I get the error: pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle : it's not found as project.model.Article The class is now project.model.Article , not project.model.Database.Article as defined. Can I fix this error and keep the classes nested like above? Is it a bad idea to organize classes by nesting them?
