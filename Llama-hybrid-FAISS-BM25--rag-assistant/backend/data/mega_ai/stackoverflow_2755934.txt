That is an accurate summary of the situation and I do not think there is a silver bullet answer. It all depends on how likely you are to need information or reports across the entire user base. I would remind you of two things: Business applications very quickly develop a need to run reports you never thought about when you architected the software. What will you do when a customer has five accounts and he insists your total fees are not what they should be? A characteristic about these reports is that you usually need them as quickly as possible. However, you can always use replication to merge all databases into one gigantic database (even on a separate machine) in order to run reports on that one. If your keys do not collide, that would save you a little bit of effort but in general you can make this work.
