JQuery (this).text is not appending via click

Poorly worded question, but I can't find a better way. Also, checked the 'related' questions and none solve this issue. I am using JQuery 1.4.2, and JQueryUI 1.8.1. I have a list of "buttons", and I want those buttons to make a copy of themselves in another list on the page. Here is what I have so far: $("#actionList ul > li > p").button({ icons: { primary: 'ui-icon-document' }, text: true }).click(function () { $('#callFlow').find(".placeholder").remove(); $(" ").text((this).text).appendTo('#callFlow'); }); #actionList is the DIV for the unordered list I have. P contain "button" effect. #callFlow is the DIV for the ordered list, which contains a single li with the class of placeholder. Most of this is from the shopping cart demo on the JQuery UI site. But I've gone away from draggable/droppable, and simply want the user to click the button and have it "duplicated" in the other list. No sorting is needed, as it's a flow building application that will eventually load an AJAX div based on the button you click. Any assistance is great. I hope I was clear enough in describing the issue.
