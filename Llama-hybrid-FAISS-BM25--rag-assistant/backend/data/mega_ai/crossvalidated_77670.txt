Robust test for time series count data

I'm going to analyse suicide rates for a time series, and I'd like to use robust tests, but I don't know which would be a good one. My purpose is to compare the variation of the suicide rates through the months and years and see if there are significant changes in respect to GDP. Then I also want to check differences among sex, age, etc. What would you recommend to me? I've heard about robust tests in Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing by Rand Wilcox. They are the best choice when normality and other assumptions are violated. Thanks.
