Please recommend solution to share source code internally

I work as a C# developer,our company has 4 teams,each of which devoted some 5 years develop in C#/Java.During years we wrote some applications(Some to improve our own work efficent,some to evaluate newly-learnt techs),or downloaded some sample program from internet to meet some specific scenarios. The problem is,these app/programs are not stored and introduced at a concentrated website.Some app/programs are put under source control--without introcduction,some are kept personally--no one except the owner himself knows its existance.You know it's quite frustrating if you re-invented the wheels before you find the wheels in a corner(We often break into such case across different teams). So could anyone help recommend any solution for me to achieve this goal: Restore the source code with introduction. Integrate with Git , or convenient to trace source code version. Easy to search. Easy to setup and maintain.We need to setup such service within our company. It quite looks like sourceForge,maybe:)I think probably there is already a proper product for me,isn't it? Thank you very much for your attention! ------------Update-------------- Finally we choose Redmine and are now hosting 10+ repositories, it integrates well with Git(And many other source control tools), supports wiki to write documents, and it's convenient for users to report bugs, require features for the hosted projects. It also encourages our developers to develop and share by their own interests.
