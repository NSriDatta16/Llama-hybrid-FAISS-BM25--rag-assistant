Poisson regression with offset vs logistic regression

I am thinking to use Poisson regression with an offset variable instead of a logistic regression in case where event is rare, since p (probability of success) is very small and n (sample size is large). Which would be the differences between these two approaches? Where can I found some literature about it?
