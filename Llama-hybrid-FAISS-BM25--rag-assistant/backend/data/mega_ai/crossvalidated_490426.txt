Neither is more correct than the other, and you aren't going to get radically different interpretations from a sign change (as $b$ from one formulation can have the exact same interpretation as $-b$ in the other). Choices like this are usually made on the basis of what makes the formulas easier to write or look more aesthetically appealing, not interpretation. Writing $w \cdot x - b = 0 \iff w \cdot x = b$ is (aesthetically) nice if you want to think of the hyperplane as a level curve of the function $f(x) = w \cdot x$ that corresponds to the value $b$ . But you can just as easily interpret $w \cdot x + b = 0$ as the level curve corresponding to $-b$ , so there is no difference in interpretation. It's worth pointing out that Vapnik (one of the inventors of SVMs) uses $w \cdot x + b = 0$ in the Theory of Statistical Learning , so perhaps that's the "canonical" choice.
