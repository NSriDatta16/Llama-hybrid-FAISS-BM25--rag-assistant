I suggest you take a look at the TidyTuesday repo , where every week they post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. The repo also contains other resources, like data science books. Together with the repo, I suggest the TidyTuesday videos by David Robinson , where he creates screencasts of complete data analyses in R for the TidyTuesday datasets.
