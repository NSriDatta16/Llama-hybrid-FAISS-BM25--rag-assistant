Since you can draw on a wide set of features, you use a selection method, such as Lasso Alternatively, you could consider a regularized framework with an extensive collection of features (explanatory variables, "filter bank" in image modeling terminology). Different features matter at different times. Commercial fundamental factor models (models based on company attributes) tend to have extensive sets of factors, not all of which matter in a particular period. this may result in completely non-overlapping characteristics in each period, which does not make sense from a business perspective It may make sense. The salient features of a particular period may vary. Perhaps sensitivity to inflation matters in one period and sensitivity to energy prices matters in another period. The issue is not that a factor is absent or a factor loading is "wrong" in one period, but the latent common factor is dormant or nearly so. You may want to decompose your problem into identifying common factor returns (to use financial risk modeling terminology) and common factor loadings (regression coefficients). This process is discussed in Connor, Gregory, and Oliver Linton. "Semiparametric estimation of a characteristic-based factor model of common stock returns." Journal of Empirical Finance 2007 Grinold, Richard C., and Ronald N. Kahn. Active portfolio management 2000 For an online framework for your factor loading estimation, you could consider implementing a Bayesian dynamic linear model (regression coefficients are permitted to change slowly with time). West, Mike, and Jeff Harrison. Bayesian forecasting and dynamic models 2006 Kalaba, Robert, and Leigh Tesfatsion. "Time-varying linear regression via flexible least squares." Computers & Mathematics with Applications 1989 To summarize salient features of a historical period, you could iteratively seek to replicate the return distributions, adding features until your synthetic distribution ("model") matches the observed distribution.
