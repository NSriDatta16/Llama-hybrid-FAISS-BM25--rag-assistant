I'm not sure if there will be universal agreement on "best practices", but the items you mention might have easy answers: Distribution is easy with java.net or Sourceforge. You'll publish your code using their standards, Packaging will be ZIP files. It's a good idea to create an MD5 hash to make it possible for clients to check the integrity of their downloads. Documentation - yes, lots please. Have separate javadocs and a reference guide that shows how to use your stuff. Have a public SVN that allows anonymous access so folks can get and build the latest code on their own. Have a bug tracker that allows people to report on bugs, new features, etc. Set up a wiki for discussion, feedback, etc. Maven has become something of an open source standard. Have a good pom.xml for those adventurous folks who want to check out and build your code. Unit tests and good code coverage will help to demonstrate your commitment to quality. I'll try to think of more.
