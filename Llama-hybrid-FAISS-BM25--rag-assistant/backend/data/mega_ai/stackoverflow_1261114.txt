A tag wraps around something, unlike an tag, which is a singular item. Therefore, there isn't a reason to use a tag.. I've been told that im using when i should use instead. â€“ maxp 49 secs ago If you need to use tags, I suggest wrapping the entire paragraph inside a tag, which will give you a line break at the end of a paragraph. But I don't suggest just substituting something like for tags are for paragraphs and signifying the end of a paragraph. tags are for line breaks. If you need a new line then use a tag. If you need a new paragraph, then use a tag.
