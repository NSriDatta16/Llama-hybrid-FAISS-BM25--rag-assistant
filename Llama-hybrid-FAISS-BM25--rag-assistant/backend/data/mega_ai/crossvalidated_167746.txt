you have too much option for classification. begining with linear discriminat will be easier if you are not familiar to machine learning alg. https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Classification you need classification rather than clustering. what is gene variables' scale. scale /ordinal/ binary ? and i guess target variable is binary.
