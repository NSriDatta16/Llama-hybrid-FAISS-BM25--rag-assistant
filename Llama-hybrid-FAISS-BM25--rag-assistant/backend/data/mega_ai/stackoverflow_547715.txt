I'd suggest a 3-part model, where the common data-format is a String which should be able to contain every value: Reader: In this layer the values are read from the source (ie. CSV-file) using some sort of file-format-descriptor. The values are then stored in some sort of intermediate data structure. Connector/Converter: This layer is responsible for mapping the reader-data to the writer-fields. Writer: This layer is responsible for writing a specific data structure to the target (ie. another file-format or a database). This way you can write different Readers for different input files. I think the hardest part would be creating the definition of the intermediate storage format/structure so that it is future-proof and flexible.
