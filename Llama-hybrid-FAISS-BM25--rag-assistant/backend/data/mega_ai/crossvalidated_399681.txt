Type 2 error in t-test on time series

I have an AR(1) time series with $1>\phi>0$ . If I naively use t-test to check $H_0:\mu=0$ and it does not reject the null, then can I accept the result? I think yes because for a time-series with positive autocorrelation, $\hat{\mu}$ would have a higher variance $({\sigma}^2(1+\phi)/(1-\phi))$ and therefore, the odds of making a type II error would be even smaller. Is this right thinking? I am looking for a more rigorous proof/reasoning? The reason I want to confirm this intuition is that in t-test we are making the conclusion based on t-distribution which is the exact distribution of the test statistic under null. However, the above argument is based on the asymptotic distribution. So we need asymptotic distribution of t-statistic in case of an AR(1) time-series.
