apply Kalman smoothing to irregularly spaced time series

My data is an irregularly spaced time series: date adate 0 2012-03-30 0.0 1 2012-03-30 1.0 2 2012-03-31 19.0 3 2012-04-19 1.0 4 2012-04-20 1.0 ... ... ... 240 2019-11-08 6.0 241 2019-11-14 0.0 242 2019-11-14 1.0 243 2019-11-24 13.0 244 2019-12-07 NaN since I want to perform some sort of timeseries analysis on the data (ARIMA , preferably) I want to interpolate it such that every data point is evenly distributed. I have read I can apply Kalman smoothing a series of data sampled at irregular time points . I have read a few papers and have found a number of libraries to apply Kalman filters like pykalman but I haven't understood how to apply it simply , like you can apply a linear or cubic interpolation using scipy/ pandas.
