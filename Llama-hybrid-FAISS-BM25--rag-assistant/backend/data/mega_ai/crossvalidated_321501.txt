Easiest approach is to train a CNN to qualify the 52 cards. And use a simple OpenCV application to acquire the image(s) and do some simple findContour operations and mask those contours one at a time and supply them to the NCC. It's very tricky though if those have no space between them. Because then there won't be individual contours to be detected. You'll then have to get creative by looking for edges and find the pip and index of each card and mask those.
