This was my code: var document = new Document(_pageSize, PageMargin, PageMargin, PageMargin, PageMargin); var writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, output); writer.CloseStream = false; writer.PageEvent = new Footer(HeaderFont, _defaultFont.BaseFont, report.Name); document.Open(); if (report.Results.Any()) document.Add(CreateTable(report.Results, report.Types, report.RootType)); else document.Add(new Paragraph("No results", _defaultFont)); writer.Close(); After adding the line document.Close(); before the writer.Close(); line, it now shows in both Foxit and Acrobat . I guess a key thing with itext# is to be very careful that objects are closed properly. This probably reflects it is a ported library and not a library built for .NET from the ground up.
