To bless or not to bless, that is my question!

first post from a newbie-user. Every question I google seems to bring me here and I always get a great answer to what I'm looking for; so naturally this was my first stop when I began pondering the usage of blessing in Perl. I've just gotten into Perl's OOP and just today read the post asking what bless does. I now understand that it references a scalar/hash/array to an object, 'attaching' it, if you will. In most of the examples of classes I see in Perl, they don't seem to have properties like I'm used to seeing in other languages... { package Person; my $property = "This is what I'm talking about :)"; sub new { ... } ... } So, I created a stupid class with a property to see what would happen. I gave the property the value 'NIL' right off the bat and then 'Not Nil!' in the constructor. Using a method LIST, I was able to print the property, and as I expected, it printed 'Not Nil!' My question is, if properties work the same as I expected them to work (declared in the body) then why use bless at all? What is the added benefit of having that reference when you could simply create a scalar/hash/array as a property, or create whatever references you want as a property? I hope I explained what I'm trying to ask well enough, very green with Perl :)
