Don't throw away any data . Do not undersample the majority class. It makes perfect sense that you get better performance when you don't throw away part of your data. For SVM specifically, you can assign a higher misclassification penalty to instances of the minority class to account for the class skew ( -wX flags in LIBSVM). If you use area under the ROC curve as your metric, the class skew won't even matter much, since ROC curves are insensitive to these things.
