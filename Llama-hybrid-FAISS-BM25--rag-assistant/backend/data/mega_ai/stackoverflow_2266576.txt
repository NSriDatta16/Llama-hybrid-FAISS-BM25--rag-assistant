I'll mention a few that i think are excellent resources but that i haven't seen mentioned on SO. They are all free and freely available on the Web (links supplied). Data Analysis Examples A collection of individual examples from the UCLA Statistics Dept. which you can browse by major category (e.g., "Count Models", "Multivariate Analysis", "Power Analysis") then download examples with complete R code under any of these rubrics (e.g., under "Count Models" are "Poisson Regression", "Negative Binomial Regression", and so on). Verzani: SimpleR: Using R for Introductory Statistics A little over 100 pages, and just outstanding. It's easy to follow but very dense. It is a few years old, still i've only found one deprecated function in this text. This is a resource for a brand new R user; it also happens to be an excellent statistics refresher. This text probably contains 20+ examples (with R code and explanation) directed to fundamental statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing, linear regression, simple simulation, and descriptive statistics). Statistics with R (Vincent Zoonekynd) You can read it online or print it as a pdf. Printed it's well over 1000 pages. The author obviously got a lot of the information by reading the source code for the various functions he discusses--a lot of the information here, i haven't found in any other source. This resource contains large sections on Graphics, Basic Statistics, Regression, Time Series--all w/ small examples (R code + explanation). The final three sections contain the most exemplary code--very thorough application sections on Finance (which seems to be the author's professional field), Genetics, and Image Analysis.
