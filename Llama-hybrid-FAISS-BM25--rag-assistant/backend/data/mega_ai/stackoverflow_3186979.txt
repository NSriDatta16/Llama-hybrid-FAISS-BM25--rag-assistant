AS3 - What's the difference between MyClass(instance) and (instance as MyClass)

You can upcast or downcast an instance (to a superclass or subclass) using this syntax: var i:MyClass = MyClass(instance); But what does the as keyword do? var i:MyClass = (instance as MyClass); Are they equivalent? or am I missing something here...
