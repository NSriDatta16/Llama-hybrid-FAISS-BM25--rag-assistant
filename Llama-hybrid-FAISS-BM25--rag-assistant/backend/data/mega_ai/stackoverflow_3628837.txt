c bitwise negation conversion question

the following code: signed char sc = ~0xFC; unsigned char uc = ~0xFC; when compiled gives me the following warnings: integer conversion resulted in truncation integer conversion resulted in truncation why do i get these warnings how do i write my code, so that i dont get these warnings (without using #pragmas) thanx, i'm using IAR Compiler for 8051, do you get similar warnings when compiling using other compilers?
