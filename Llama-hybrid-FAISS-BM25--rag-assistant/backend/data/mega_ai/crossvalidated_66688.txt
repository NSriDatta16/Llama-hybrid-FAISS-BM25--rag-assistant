The Cox proportional hazards model can be written in terms of the effect of predictor variables on the log relative hazard, which is also the effect on the log relative cumulative hazard scale. Log cumulative hazard is equal to the log of the -log of the cumulative survival function which Kaplan-Meier estimates. So you could say that the log hazard ratio (regression effect in the Cox model) estimates the average difference between two Kaplan-Meier estimates if you transform both of them by the log-log transformation.
