Linear regression can predict different patterns of data - you can use splines, you can use polynomial terms and so on. In addition, there is the whole field of time series analysis, although that usually deals with cases where there are more time points than you seem to have. But the problem seems to be that your data have no pattern. Thus, when regression (of any sort) or any other method comes up with a flat line, it is doing what it should - saying that there is no pattern in your data. If you had some a priori reason to expect a pattern, then you have learned something: Your reason is incorrect, at least in this data set without any covariates. However, since it seems like you are trying to predict the sales of drinks, I'm puzzled as to why you have no covariates in your model. Certainly the temperature and whether it is a weekend ought to be included.
