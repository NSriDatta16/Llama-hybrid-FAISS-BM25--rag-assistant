xml:space="preserve" in Word 2003 XML document

I'm using XSLT templates to generate word documents in XML format. The problem I'm having is with whitespaces (specifically - tabs). This is an example of a tab inside a paragraph in xml doc: This is some text after tab I added xml:space="preserve" to save the whitespace generated by tab, and this works in Word2007 (it opens up correctly) but it doesn't in Word2003. For Word2003 I have to put xml:space="preserve" tag inside the root element of w:wordDocument . This is a problem, since we do have a lot of spaces in our generated xml's and the default of ignoring them is a requirement. I know that Microsofts apps tend to ignore standards misuse and just assume what the user wanted without showing error. I thought that might be the error here since the word2003 and 2007 have different interpretation of the same format. If that's the case - how to correctly set this?
