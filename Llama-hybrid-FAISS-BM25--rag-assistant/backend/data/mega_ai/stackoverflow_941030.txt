Team Foundation Server 2005 and SQL Express 2005

I haven't seen anything that says SQL Express 2005 is not supported for use with Team Foundation Server 2005. However, when I attempt the installation I get all sorts of errors "SQL Agent service not installed", "SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services service is not installed", etc. Is SQL Server Standard or higher, required?
