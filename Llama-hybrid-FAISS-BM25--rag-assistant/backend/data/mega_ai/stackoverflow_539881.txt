Is probably easier to get a more high-level language to describe the robot's behaviors and intelligence and let the low level language to the actions (move arm, walk, stop). There is a lot of research in what is called BDI architecture for intelligent agents, google for it. You can find more about at this site , it's a DSL for describing agent behavior made in Java. It's called Jason interpreter and the language is AgentSpeak(L).
