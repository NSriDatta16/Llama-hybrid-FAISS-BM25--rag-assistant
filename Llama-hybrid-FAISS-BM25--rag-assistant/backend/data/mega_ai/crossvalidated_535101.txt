Bayesian combination of expert opinion

In a population of $N$ , $K$ experts pick $M_{k\in\{1, ..., K\}}$ individuals that will have a certain attribute. Note that $M$ can be different across experts (e.g., one expert can pick 5 individuals, another can pick 20). My goal is to sort the individuals by their relative likelihood of having that attribute. First thought that came to mind was to use Bayesian inference, but I don't have a history of how well the experts have done in the past. How would you formulate this problem? [Edit] A bit about the data set --- a close analogy to my problem is in fantasy football. At the start of every season, a panel of "pundits" pick their best XI to watch. My job is to aggregate all the picks without knowing each expert's track record. All I have is a bunch of IDs for each expert's picks but I can theoretically work out how the experts arrive at their selection by regressing on players' height, weight, shirt number (if it matters), performance in previous season, club, country etc. I guess one restriction is that I need to combine experts' picks, rather than regressing past performance on player attributes and build my own model.
