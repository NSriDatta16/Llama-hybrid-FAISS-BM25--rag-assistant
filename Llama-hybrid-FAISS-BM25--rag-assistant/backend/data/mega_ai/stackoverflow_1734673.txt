What are some examples of Go interfaces?

I found an interesting blog post about Go. I am trying to understand the concept of interfaces, but I find it very hard to do so from the code fragment in the blog post, and nearly impossible from the language specification . Can anyone point out a simple example of Go's interfaces in a working program?
