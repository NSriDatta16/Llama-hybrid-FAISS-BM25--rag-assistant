Problem with PHP sessions

Update Solved problem! After examining the code, the freaking problem was I was missing the }else{} after header ('location:referraldone.php?say=blankfields'); } . I'm really lost at the moment with this session code. I don't understand why the session isn't working. Where did I go wrong? I'm trying to take the data entered in the fields to the next page when someone makes an error not filling an required field. Codes are below: " method="post"> REFERRAL FORM Choose us as your Home Care Agency! We provide services 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.
