An intuitive explanation why the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure works?

Is there a simple way of explaining why does Benjamini and Hochberg's (1995) procedure actually control the false discovery rate (FDR)? This procedure is so elegant and compact and yet the proof of why it works under independence (appearing in the appendix of their 1995 paper ) is not very accessible.
