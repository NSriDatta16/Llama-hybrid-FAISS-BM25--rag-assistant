I went to read the post, and I also found it a bit unclear A 2008 Gallup survey found that TV ownership may be good for wellbeing. The results from the poll stated that the confidence level was 95% +/-3, which means that if Gallup repeated the poll over and over, using the same techniques, 95% of the time the results would fall within the published results. The 95% is the confidence level and the +/-3 is called a margin of error. At the beginning of the article you’ll see statistics (and bar graphs). At the bottom of the article you’ll see the confidence intervals. For example, “For the European data, one can say with 95% confidence that the true population for wellbeing among those without TVs is between 4.88 and 5.26.” The confidence interval here is “between 4.88 and 5.26“. I had to go read the original Gallup survey results . There it is indicated that respondents were asked to indicate their own well being on a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 represents "the best possible life for you" and 0 the worst. So $[4.88, 5.26]$ is the 95% confidence interval around the score reported by people without the TV. The confidence interval seems to be calculated from a frequentist perspective, meaning that as you correctly state in your question, it refers to the data generating process (the survey). It indicates that "if the survey were to be repeated a large number of times, each time by randomly sampling the same number of individuals from the population, the average well being rating for people without a TV is expected to fall within the confidence interval 95% of the times".
