You're on the right track, and you can answer your question using some old-fashioned tools. In your current model, the intercept reflects the predicted average productivity when Light , Water and Phenology are all at zero. You can make this a little more intuitive by centring these variables to have a mean of zero. Then, the intercept is just the average baseline productivity. Your hypothesis is that this baseline is lower in year 5. You can test this by creating a new variable, year5 , which has a value of 1 for data from year 5 and 0 otherwise, and including it as a predictor. The weight given to this predictor will reflect changes in productivity in year 5 that are not explained by changes in light, water, or phenology (whatever that is). Take care, though, in how you interpret p-values from any analysis like this. If this pattern in the data is the reason you've decided to do this analysis in the first place (the data generated the hypothesis), this remains an exploratory analysis unless you can find some fresh, independent data to confirm your results on.
