'no files to extract' message, when trying to extract zip which was downloaded forcefully

When i try to extract the zip folder that i downloaded from the server forcefully, i get the message, 'no files to extract'. But when i download the zip folder directly from the server, i am able to extract it properly. Here is the code that i used to download forcefully. $file = 'absolute/path/to/the/zip/folder'; header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Content-Type: application/force-download"); header( "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=".basename($file)); header( "Content-Description: File Transfer"); @readfile($file); Does anyone know why this is happening? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance
