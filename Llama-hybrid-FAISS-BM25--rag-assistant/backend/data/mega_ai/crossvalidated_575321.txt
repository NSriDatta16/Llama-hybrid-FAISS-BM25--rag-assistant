A Jeffreys 95% CI for the binomial proportion is based on the non-informative prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(.5,.5)$ and is said to give good frequentist results. Several other styles of Cis are in common use. You should pick one that does not rely directly on normal approximation. For example, if $n = 50$ trials with $x = 10$ successes then a a 95% CI for success probability $p$ is, then the Agresti 95% CI $(0.919, 0.283)$ for $p$ is found as follows: p.est = (12/64) CI.agr = p.est + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/64) CI.agr [1] 0.09187523 0.28312477 The test-inverted Clopper-Pearson interval $(0.083, 0.285$ is available in the R procedure binomon.test : binom.test(10, 60) Exact binomial test data: 10 and 60 number of successes = 10, number of trials = 60, p-value = 1.616e-07 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 95 percent confidence interval: 0.08292881 0.28521925 sample estimates: probability of success 0.1666667 And the Jeffreys' CI $(0.108, 0.326),$ based on a Bayesian argument with a non-informative prior, which is said to have good frequentist properties, is found as by taking quantile $.025$ and $.975$ of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(.5+x, .5 + n - x)$ as follows. qbeta(c(.025,.975), .5+10, .5+40) [1] 0.1077340 0.3258269 Among these, I prefer the latter because of its properties and ease of computation in R. It provides one possible solution to your problem. For $n = 61, x = 0,$ it gives the CI $(0, 0.04),$ as follows: round(qbeta(c(.025,.975), .5, 61.5), 5) [1] 0.00001 0.04018 It is easy to find $n = 61$ as a suitable sample size by trial and error or by grid search with values of $n$ from $1$ through $100.$ (I was looking for an interval that gives $(0,0),$ when rounded to one decimal place.) You might find @DavidLukeThiessen's suggested link useful; also, the Wikipedia page on confidence intervals for a binomial proportion. With my answer from the Jeffreys interval, you may want to compare results for $n = 61$ from several other intervals.
