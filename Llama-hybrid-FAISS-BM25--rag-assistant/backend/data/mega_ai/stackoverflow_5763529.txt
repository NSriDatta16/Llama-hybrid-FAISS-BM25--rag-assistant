iOS / Cocoa: using an URL as a key in a NSDictionary

For an application I'm working on I have a class that deals with the requests sent to a webservice. To reduce traffic load I want to cache most of the requests and their results (at least for the content that won't change often). A request is uniquely identified by the URL used, so I want to use the URL as a key. In a previous project I worked on I used to create a md5 hash of the URL to function as a key. I've began wondering how safe this approach is, since apparently there's quite a chance that 2 different URL's produce the same hashed value. Can anyone suggest a safer approach, or should I still stick with md5 hashes of the URL to function as a key in my cache dictionary?
