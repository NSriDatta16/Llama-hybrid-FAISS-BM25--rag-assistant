Ordering of the elements in a transition matrix (Markov Chain)

I am bit confused after solving the following Markov Chain exercise from a textbook Suppose that a student will be either on time or late for a particular class, and that the events that he is on time or late for the class on successive days form a markov Chain with stationary transition probabilities. Suppose also that if he is late on a given day, then the probability that he will be on time the next day is 0.8. Furthermore, if he is on time on a given day, then the probability that he will be late the next day is 0.5 If the student is late on the first day of class, what is the probability that he will be on time on the fourth day of class? I solved the exercise by defining the following transition matrix $P$, where $L$ represents the event that the student is late and $T$ represents the event that the student arrives on time: $$ \begin{array}{lrr} & \mbox{T} & \mbox{L} \\ \mbox{L} & 0.8 & 0.2 \\ \mbox{T} & 0.5 & 0.5\end{array} $$ Then, I can answer just by calculating $P^3$: $$ \begin{array}{lrr} & \mbox{T} & \mbox{L} \\ \mbox{L} & 0.772 & 0.278 \\ \mbox{T} & 0.695 & 0.0305\end{array} $$ Therefore, the answer is 0.722. However, I have realized that if I arrange the elements of the transition matrix $P$ in a different way: $$ \begin{array}{lrr} & \mbox{L} & \mbox{T} \\ \mbox{L} & 0.2 & 0.8 \\ \mbox{T} & 0.5 & 0.5\end{array} $$ then $P^3$ is different to what I obtained before, thus changing the probability that the student is on time on the fourth day of class after being late on the first day to 0.632. This second transition matrix is the one that can be found in the solutions manual of the textbook. Assuming that the probability shouldn't change based on the arrangement of the elements in the transition matrix, what is wrong with my first version of P?
