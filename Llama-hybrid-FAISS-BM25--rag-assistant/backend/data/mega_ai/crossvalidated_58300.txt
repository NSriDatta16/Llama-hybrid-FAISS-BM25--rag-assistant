I think the most appropriate summary for this application is just to simply state that the years were 15% different, Â± some uncertainty. Here's why: first, the concept of statistical significance per se doesn't fit naturally into the Bayesian framework; second, in this application it's not really plausible that the parameter takes the exact same value in the two data sets, so you might as well just estimate the difference directly. The interpretation of the fact that 0 is within the error bars is this: the data do not strongly indicate the sign of the difference. That's the Bayesian equivalent of "lack of statistical significance". But even if the result is not significant in this sense, you may (or may not) be able to make a scientifically interesting claim about the magnitude of the difference.
