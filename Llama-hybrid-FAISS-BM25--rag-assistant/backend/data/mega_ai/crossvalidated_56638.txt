How are ranks calculated in tie cases?

I am considering the following question: when there are ties, how are ranks calculated? In some references, they first rank them without repeating the ranks, and then average the ranks of those ties and assign the average rank to each one in the ties. I was wondering if that way is unanimously used in statistics for determining the ranks? Are there other ways to determine the ranks in tie cases? If yes, when to use which way? Thanks and regards!
