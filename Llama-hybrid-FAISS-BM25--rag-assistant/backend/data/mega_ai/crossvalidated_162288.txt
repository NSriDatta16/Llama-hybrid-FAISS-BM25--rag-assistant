Making sense of independent component analysis

I have seen and enjoyed the question Making sense of principal component analysis , and now I have the same question for independent component analysis. I mean I want to make a comprehensive question about the intuitive ways to understand ICA? I want to understand it. I want to get the purpose of it. I want to get the feel of it. I strongly believe that: You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother. -- Albert Einstein Well, I can't explain this concept to a layman or grandma Why ICA? What was the need for this concept? How would you explain this to a layman?
