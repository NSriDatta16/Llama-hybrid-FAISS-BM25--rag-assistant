Windbg heap command is sometimes buggy, especially when tracking huge leaks. To examine memory fragmentation you would better use Vmmap http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd535533 You will figure out the suspected memory location from Vmmap report. Then use Windbg to view the content of those allocations.
