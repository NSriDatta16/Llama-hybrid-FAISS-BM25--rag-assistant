R² of 1 with dynlm procedure?

Dear statisticians/programmers, I want to model the price of AXE deoderands in Albert Heijn (a dutch supermarket) as a linear function of its own past (up to two lags) and the past of the price of AXE deoderants in jumbo (another dutch supermarket), to check whether the price in Jumbo granger causes the price Albert Heijn. Anyway, I try to model this by means of the dynlm procedure in R. This however, gives an R² of 1 and the effect of the first lag is equal to 1. So something is wrong with the code but I cannot find out what. Can somebody please help me with this issue? The code and output are below. Many thanks in advance!
