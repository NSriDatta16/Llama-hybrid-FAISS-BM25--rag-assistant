Let me introduce you to the User-Agent HTTP header . It will contain an identifying string for the client accessing your page. It can be faked but you just can't be 100% sure if it's a RSS reader or a browser. Additionally, RSS readers might send Accept headers for rss content-types, which you may use to implement content negotiation ( MultiViews in Apache). But as there is no sure fire way, you better fail on the side of serving HTML more often than RSS, or better yet, do as everybody else does and provide a different feed for RSS.
