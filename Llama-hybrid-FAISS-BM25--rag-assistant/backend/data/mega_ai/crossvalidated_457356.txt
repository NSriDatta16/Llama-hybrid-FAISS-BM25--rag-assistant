XGBoost one-step ahead forecast

I have trained and cross-validated an xgboost classification algorithm in R using the following code: xgb_params Now I want to do one-step-ahead forecasting. However, using the following: xgbpred_prob it is required some new data to be stored into a matrix. Instead, I wish to do forecasting like the following code would do for an ARIMA model: fit It is like if the first part of the job which I have done was to validate the booster, instead now I wish to put the model into production mode and use it on a daily basis for daily forecasting. Do you have any idea how could I achieve that?
