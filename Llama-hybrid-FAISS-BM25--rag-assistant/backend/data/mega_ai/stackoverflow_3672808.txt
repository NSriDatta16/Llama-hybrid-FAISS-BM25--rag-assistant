There is a difference in accuracy between models of iPhone, in whether "real" GPS, or wifi triangulation, or cell tower location are being used, as well as issues from sky coverage and the particular satellites in view when GPS is being used, as well as how long you wait. In practice, the range I've seen is from infinite (or maybe the diameter of the planet) when I'm in an elevator (Faraday cage), to telling me when I walk from the front to the back of my car.
