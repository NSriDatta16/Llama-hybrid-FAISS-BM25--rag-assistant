Age process of renewal process is a Markov Chain

If $T_n=\sum_{k=1}^nX_k$ is a renewal process where $X_k$ are identical and independent with values in the positive integers, and $N(t)=\max\{j:T_j\leq t\}$ is the associated counting process, define $C_t=t-T_{N(t)}$ to be the "age" at time $t\in \mathbb{N}$. I'm wondering how to show rigorously that $C_t$ is a Markov chain. Heuristically, I can see that $C_{t+1}$ is $C_t+1$ if there is no renewal at $t+1$ and $0$ if there is a renewal at $t+1$, and that the probability of a renewal at $t+1$ should depend on the location of the last renewal and the renewals before that should be irrelevant. But I don't know how to make this "rigorous" or calculate the transition probabilities. So my questions are: what is a rigorous proof that $\{C_t\}$ satisfies the Markov property, and how do you calculate the transition probabilities \begin{align*} \Pr(C_{t+1}=i+1|C_t=i),\\ \Pr(C_{t+1}=0|C_t=i). \end{align*} The texts I'm reading treat this as easy enough to leave out the details, but I haven't grasped it yet.
