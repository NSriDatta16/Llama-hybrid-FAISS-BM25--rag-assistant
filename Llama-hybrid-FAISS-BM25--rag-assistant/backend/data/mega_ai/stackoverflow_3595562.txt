I just went through the process of installing and trying several carts for a project that I was working on. As Pierre says above, "There is no best shopping cart, however there is one best for your specific need" That is a very truthful statement. My project was for an on line soap company that has 5 different categories with 5 or so variations each. Not a big store and not one that changes inventory often. I tried the following carts: PrestaShop, Zen Cart, Magento, getshopped and phpurchase. My findings were that for a small store, PrestaShop, Zen Cart and Magento are a bit overkill. For a small shop, getshopped and phpurchase are better fits. Out of the 3 big shop solutions, I felt that Zen Cart is really hard to make look nice. It has a 90's vibe about the template that it comes with and takes a lot of work to get around that. Magento and PrestaShop were really cool. PrestaShop seems very UK specific. It did not take Authorize.net and I think that there may be a plugin that you can get. Magento seems like a great solution for a larger store and I liked the backend admin interface. I purchased getshopped plugin and integrated it into my Wordpress site (I purchased the Authroize.net integration gold cart level) I had such trouble dealing with the multiple bugs that I found riddled through the code base. I looked at their forum and many people who had similar issues were not responded to. Alot of people were as frustrated as me. I tried customer support - no response. I asked for a refund, no response. Basically, Get Shopped was a complete waste of time and money. I then found Phpurchase. The customer support person, Lee Blue was really nice - Lee answered my emails morning, noon and night. Lee is literally the nicest customer support person I've ever worked with! - so helpful. The code worked just as specced - no troubles and no complaints. I'm a very happy customer with phpurchase. If I need a small ecommerce site in the future, I will use that solution again, for sure. Note, I'm not an affiliate of Phpurchase or have any type of financial gain by recommending them, I just had such a rough time with getShopped and such a wonderful experience with Phpurchase!
