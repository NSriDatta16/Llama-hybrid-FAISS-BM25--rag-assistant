Test for statistically significant difference: Wilcoxon vs Median Permutation

I have a dataset that shows measured 'perceived quality'(dependent variable), by two different sizes in the context of 4 different intensity levels (200 values for perceived quality in each category, and non-normal distribution). So the data looks like this: [ ] Perceived Perceived quality when quality when Intensity size = X size = Y 5 0.76 0.8 5 0.80 1.1 5 1.18 1.1 5 1.18 1.1 10 0.82 1.0 10 0.96 1.4 10 1.00 1.2 10 0.96 1.2 12 1.00 1.4 12 0.96 1.4 12 1.10 0.2 12 1.08 0.7 20 1.10 0.7 20 1.14 0.8 20 1.06 0.8 20 1.16 0.9 I tried the Wilcoxon signed rank test to see if there is a significant difference between the perceived qualities of the two groups (different sizes) and p-value = 0.00049. Now, I have organized the data by the intensity levels and I wanna see if there is any significant difference between the perceived quality values of different sizes within each intensity level. So I have four sets like this (again, non-normal distribution): Intensity=5, Intensity=5, Perceived Perceived quality when quality when size = X size = Y 0.76 0.8 0.80 1.1 1.18 1.1 1.18 1.1 I tried Wilcoxon signed rank again, but I got these two errors in R: Warning: cannot compute exact p-value with ties and Warning: cannot compute exact p-value with zeroes After searching I realized maybe a permutation test is better when there are ties in the data, so I performed a permutation test with median (since the data in each group seemed skewed). My question is can I continue with the permutation test (with median) in the subgroups if I have done a Wilcoxon test for the large sample? Also, I am just not sure if I am on the right path. I tried permutation with the median for the large sample that Wilcoxon has showed the p-value = 0.00049 initially, and I am getting p-value = 1. However, when I change the median to the mean the p-value = 0.00582. I would appreciate any help. Thanks! Added: This is the boxplot of the main data that Wilcoxon gives me the p-value = 0.00049 for their difference.
