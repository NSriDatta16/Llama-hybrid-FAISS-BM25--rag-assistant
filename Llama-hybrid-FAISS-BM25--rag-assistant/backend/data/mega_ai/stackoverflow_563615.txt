You could show an overlay when hovering over an element. This overlay shows you 4 arrows (n/e/s/w) and u can click and move the element accordingly. If you are trying to oder items across a grid like facebook's and picasaweb's photo grouping features, then that is about the only way to handle that if you had 3 columns each with a list of items, clicking on any of the items would move the item either to the left or right, middle column could show option for left or right. you could still allow for dragging and dropping or sorting using the typical functionality for that.
