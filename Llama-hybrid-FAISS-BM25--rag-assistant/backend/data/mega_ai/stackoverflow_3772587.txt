It depends on how the random number is generated, and how the number will be converted to string. The ECMAScript spec doesn't specify both of these. In practice, the number will have at most 17 significant figures, so the maximum should be at most 10 17 . The spec does specify that a number will be displayed in decimal form (instead of scientific form) when the exponent is between -6 and 20 (10 -6 ≤ x 21 ), so we just need to restrict our attention on numbers in [10 -6 , 1) when trying to seek the maximum exhaustively. However, in this range a number must be representable as s × 2 e , where 1 ≤ s ≤ 2 − 2 -52 with a precision of Δ s = 2 -52 and -20 ≤ e ≤ -1. The spec recommends that ToNumber(ToString(x)) == x , so the number should be precise down to 2 -52+ e for a given e . Thus the "17-digit" number with (2 − n × 2 -52 ) × 2 e with the smallest n will be the biggest number representable with a given e , after chopping the initial 0. . v (-20) 0.0000019073486328124998 (-19) 0.0000038146972656249996 (-18) 0.0000076293945312499975 (n=3) (-17) 0.000015258789062499998 (-16) 0.000030517578124999997 (-15) 0.000061035156249999986 (n=2) (-14) 0.00012207031249999999 (-13) 0.00024414062499999997 (-12) 0.00048828124999999995 (-11) 0.0009765624999999999 (always 16-digit?)

From here we know that the absolute maximum is 78,124,999,999,999,965 . Math.random() can return any nonnegative numbers in the interval [0, 1), so the safe minimum is -324 from 5e-324 (the smallest subnormal number in double precision is 4.94 × 10 -324 ).
