Those headers are incomplete. This would only work in Internet Explorer, but would fail in others. The complete set is response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate"); response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); And you also need to set them in the previous JSP pages as well. Calling this inside a JSP would only disable caching the current JSP page. You need to copypaste it over all JSP pages ( shudder ). Or even better, use a Filter for this which is mapped on *.jsp . For an example, see this answer .
