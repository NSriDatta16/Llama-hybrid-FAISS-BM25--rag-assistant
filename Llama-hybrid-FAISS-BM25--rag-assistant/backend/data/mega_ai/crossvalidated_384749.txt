You have a factor variable Town . Assuming that it represents different town's, you have an estimated model and now wants predictions for towns not in the original sample. That is a natural want, but then you need a model which can be used that way . A usual linear model lm that you have used, with Town as a nominal factor, estimates a separate parameter for each town. To make predictions for your new town, it needs a parameter that was not estimated. There are multiple solutions, but the principled way is to model the effects of towns. Maybe you can get covariates describing towns, like population, average income, % unemployment, ... and include them in the model. If that works well, maybe there is no need for the Town factor in the model. But it could still be used, but now as a random effect, which would result in unseen towns giving predictions with higher standard error.
