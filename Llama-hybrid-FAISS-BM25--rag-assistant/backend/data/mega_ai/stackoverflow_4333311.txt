Combining URL text box with FileUpload control

I'm developing a web app which allows users to upload images. Instead of forcing them to first download an image I also want to allow them to provide a URL of the image elsewhere on the web. I've got the code to do this, my question is how can I combine these into one text box that will allow the user to enter either the location of the image on their hard drive or the location of the image on the web. I'm aware of the ASP File Upload control - but how could I leverage it to do this?
