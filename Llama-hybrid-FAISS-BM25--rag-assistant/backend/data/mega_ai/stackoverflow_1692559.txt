I want to encourage you to do your homework on your own and understand the concepts behind it, so I won't post any code for you, but here are some things to guide you: It is possible to do this with only one loop. Make one pass through the list, all the time saving the current smallest and second-smallest number. These are the smallest and second-smallest up until this point in the list. At the end, you'll notice (if you've done it correctly) that you have the smallest and second-smallest numbers. In the case of a duplicate number, just be sure to include an equals check in the condition you use; i.e., you'll be checking for smaller values, so use i and i as your two conditions (as opposed to a strict smaller than comparison).
