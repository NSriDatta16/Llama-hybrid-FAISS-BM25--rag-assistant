Welcome! I will try to give you some hints on how you could proceed from here. This is a study question so I guess my answer shouldn't be complete. With PCA, you just captured the main sources of variability in your data (as a linear combination of the starting features). Now you might see some groups or structure in the principal components plot. As you said, those components capture the shape of your entities. What is the null hypothesis here? It's not clear to me, but I would guess that goannas from different environment have different shapes. Try to state your Null hypothesis, it's very important to do that before testing. If that is the case, remember that your PCs are features (combinations of them) and it makes sense to use them as a characteristic of each goanna. So what would you do to test if two features are different across discrete groups? Does this recall some previous problem you faced?
