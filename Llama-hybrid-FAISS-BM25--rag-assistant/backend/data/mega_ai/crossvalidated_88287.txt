Let's say you have 4x2 X matrix, run SVD and get U,S,V: U is 4x4 S is 4x2, where only the top 2x2 is not empty V is 2x2 If you want to truncate to a single largest singular value: remove all columns from U leaving only the first one, now U1 is 4x1 remove all columns from S leaving only the first one, now S1 is 1x1 remove all columns from V leaving only the first one, now V1 is 2x1 You can restore the X matrix by U1*S1*V1' The dimensionality is greatly reduced because now you can use 4x1 U matrix instead of original 4x2 X matrix. UPDATE: you also have neat equality: X*V=U*S, so you could use both X*V1 or U1*S1 as your reduced dimension matrices, or simply U1, which is similar to the score in PCA
