One of the beauties of jQuery and similar approaches is that it encourages you to properly separate your behavior from your content. This approach would completely disregard that and mix content back into behavior. Another poster mentions progressive enhancement ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement ) which is a big part of this. Your application should degrade gracefully for users with limitations (no Javascript, limited plugins, accessibility issues). And I haven't even mentioned SEO ( hit wikipedia again, only one link allowed for me ;-) ). Search engines won't find your pages if your content is built by Javascript and inserted, the crawler won't be able to read your text.
