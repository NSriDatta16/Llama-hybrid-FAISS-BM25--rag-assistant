how to traverse though a 2d char array searching for words in java?

I am having trouble with a school assignment and would really appreciate some insight. I am asked to create a wordsearch using a 25x25 2d char array and somehow go through that array by developing an algorithm that will search through it to find 21 pre-defined words. So far I have been able to create a ragged array of the words that I need to find and the 2d array with the chars placed in each position. in = new ASCIIDataFile("wordsearch.txt"); display = new ASCIIDisplayer(); int numberWords = in.readInt(); wordlist = new char[numberWords][]; for (int i =0; i My problem in creating the algorithm to search though the 2d array and match it with a character in the wordlist. I am supposed to make different methods, for searching forwards, backwards and diagonal. I have been struggling for days just to do the forward search. I really how no idea about how to go about this problem, so far all I have is for(int k = 0; k } Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!
