Feature importance for random forest classification of a sample

This is a cross post from : https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/8208/feature-importance-for-random-forest-classification-of-a-sample Using a random forest is it possible to determine which features were the driving features to classify a specific sample as class A? I know I can ask which features are more important to perform classification of ANY sample, but can I ask this for a specific sample? E.g. Why was sample 1 classified as A? Which of its features were much more like class A than class B? Does it even make sense to ask this question of a random forest? Bonus points on how to do it with sklearn in python :)
