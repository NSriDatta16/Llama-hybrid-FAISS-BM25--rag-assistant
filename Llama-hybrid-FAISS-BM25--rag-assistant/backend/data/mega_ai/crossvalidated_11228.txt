MAPE is known to have problems, when the time series have values close to zero. Check whether this is the case, since high MAPEs may be the problem of time series values close to zero, not of model accuracy. For a discussion on accuracy measures I recommend this article by Rob Hyndman and Anne Koehler. If it is not the problem with MAPE, @Zach advice is spot on, you should always compare the forecasts with actual values, that is how you know how good your forecasts are.
