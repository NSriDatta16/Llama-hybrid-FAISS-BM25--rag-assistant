The command :margins sex" computes the "average adjusted prediction" for men and women. That is, the prediction for men is calculated by plugging the values from every observation into the logit model you already estimated but with sex=male for everyone, then taking the average of the predicted dependent variable. You can think of this as what the average probability of a seizure would be in your study if everyone were male (according to your logit model).
