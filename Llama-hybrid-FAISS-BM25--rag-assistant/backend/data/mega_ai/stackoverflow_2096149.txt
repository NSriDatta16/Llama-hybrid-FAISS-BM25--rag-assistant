UPDATE: It is now 8 years later and Kohana is no longer maintained. Laravel would be my current recommendation for a relatively simple yet very powerful PHP framework. Even though ZF is well established and well documented, I would suggest Kohana since it is quite a bit less complex. It is very easy to start tinkering with it by simply downloading or cloning the sample application from github . Symphony is not for beginners. I disagree that frameworks in general are not for beginners. Starting with a blank file and no framework leaves all of the architectural design up to someone who has no idea what they are doing while starting with a lightweight framework like Kohana gives you a well-organised platform and documentation to hit the ground running. Learning OO without any examples to guide you is very difficult since you don't already know what good OO design looks like. After downloading/cloning the Kohana sample app, hit the docs and you'll be writing well-designed OO code in no time.
