How to deal with unknown classes with a neural network classifier?

I have a small RNN with a softmax output, which succesfully classifies sequences within a known set of n classes. Now I have the problem that there might be sequences in the test data which do not belong to any of said classes. The model has just been trained with known classes. Of course, my model will try to lump in those unkown sequences into one of the given n categories, creating wrong results with fairly high propability. How to deal with unkown/untrained sequences that do not fit into any of the given/trained categories? What kind of measures could I take to mark these unknown sequences as unkown and therefore not part of said n classes.
