The words "Earth" and "earth" may have the same meaning, but according to word2vec algorithm, it derives the semantic information from the position of the words. Thus commonly, "Earth" will appear most often at the start of the sentence being a subject and "earth" will appear mostly in the object form at the end. So, the closest adjacent words may differ, but on overall both the sentences may contain the words such as "pollution, climate, water, countries". In conclusion, I guess with a larger window size, it seems to preserve the same semantic information with a little changes where the "Earth" will have some subject information and "earth" will have object information. So, averaging wont affect much and seems to be a possible case. But with lower window size, there is a high probability that it could have different meanings.
