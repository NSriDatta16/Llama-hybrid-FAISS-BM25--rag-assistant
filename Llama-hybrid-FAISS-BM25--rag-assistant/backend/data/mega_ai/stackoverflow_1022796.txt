I'm not sure why you're creating the cell in code. You can just drag the cell onto the table column in Interface Builder. Also, setObjectValue: is where you respond to the change in the cell's state. The user has already changed the cell's state to off; then you send setNextState and change it back. That's why the cell doesn't appear to uncheck: you keep re-checking it. What you need to do is not touch the cell at all, but set the object value (which, for this column, will probably be a Boolean NSNumber containing either YES or NO ) as the new value of the appropriate property in your model. Also, of course, make sure the column is set as editable.
