This might seem drastic, but, Use a language with defined memory, optimization and synchronization semantics. Otherwise Try putting code into other compilation units. Many compilers will honor "don't optimize" per compilation unit. Maybe some pragma's you can use inline if you're lucky. Basically, if the language doesn't define memory these semantics you're at the mercy of the compiler vendor.
