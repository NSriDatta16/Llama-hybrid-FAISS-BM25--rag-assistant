Likelihood for a bayesian approach

We assume that $y_1,...,y_n$ are outcomes of iid. random variables $Y_1,...,Y_n$ with $Y_i \sim poiss(\lambda)$ Now we consider a Bayesian approach. I have to write up the likelihood and show that $\bar{y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum y_i$ is sucient for $\lambda$ , i.e. that the likelihood only depends on $y_1,...,y_n$ through $\bar{y}$ . But I'm not sure how to find the likelihood in that case? Can anyone help me? I know in order to find $\bar{y}$ we find the score function and isolate $y$ but how du I find the likelihood?
