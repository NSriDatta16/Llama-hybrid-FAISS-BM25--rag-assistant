Using R to draw a time series with discrete data

Greetings, I have a table that looks like the following: date value 2007-11-05 134 2007-12-08 234 2008-03-10 322 2008-03-11 123 ... In summary, it has daily values for three years, but it doesn't have values for every day. What I need is to draw a line chart plot(data$date, data$value) for the whole time span, but considering that, for those days the table doesn't specify a value, it should assume the last known. In other words, the table only has values in the days that it changed. Any R experts out there that can give me an hand? :-) Thanks in advance!
