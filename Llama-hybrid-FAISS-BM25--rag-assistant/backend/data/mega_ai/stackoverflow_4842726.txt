Is there an ANSI Specification for the PIVOT statement?

Lately I asked the question How can I use PIVOT to show simultaneous average and count in its cells? The question is answered for SQL-Server (2005+) and Oracle (11g +) Obviously the sql-server implementation is rather limited and Oracle implementation yields strange column names. Are these independent solutions or are there based on some ANSI-standards?
