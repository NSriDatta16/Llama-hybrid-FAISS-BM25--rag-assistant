It's not practical to use Memcached for storage of relational data (like MySQL); it would be inefficient to request each item from Memcached and then test to see if it matches a query. There are better solutions to a problem like that (consider Memory tables in MySQL, for instance). On the other hand, if you're looking for simple key/value storage, that's certainly a practical application for Memcached. What I'd be a little wary of, though, is writing a CodeIgniter driver for it. The interface for Memcached in PHP is already dead simple: $memcached->get('my key'); $memcached->set('my key', 'my value'); I would suggest simply using the Memcached classes directly. Adding all the extra overhead to CI just seems dirty and unnecessary to me. On the flip-side of that, I've seen implementations of Memcached used for CodeIgniter's session engine. That's certainly a very valid reason to write a driver, and I would highly encourage it (sessions are a pain in the neck to scale). Good luck
