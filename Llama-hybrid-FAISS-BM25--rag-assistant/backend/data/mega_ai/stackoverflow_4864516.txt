How to access elements in a list in c++

I am working through problems in Accelerated C++ We have a program which stores strings in vectors and outputs them according to certain rules. The original code fragment is as follows. typedef vector Rule; typedef vector Rule_collection; typedef map Grammar; // read a grammar from a given input stream Grammar read_grammar(istream& in) { Grammar ret; string line; // read the input while (getline(in, line)) { // `split' the input into words vector entry = split(line); if (!entry.empty()) // use the category to store the associated rule ret[entry[0]].push_back( Rule(entry.begin() + 1, entry.end())); } return ret; } We are then asked to use lists instead of vectors. So all the vectors above will now become lists. The bit I am stuck on is how to deal with the line beginning ret[entry]].push_back etc. Also what to put in after Rule... I have tried using entry.begin() but that doesn't work. Any assistance would be appreciated.
