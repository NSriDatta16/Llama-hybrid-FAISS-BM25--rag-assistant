Do logistic population growth models relate to binary logistic regressions?

I ask this because all resources regarding logistic regression in R involve binary outcomes, so they try to model questions like when will increase in temp cause a switch to fail (0, 1)â€”involving probabilities. But if we are talking about population growth in any ecology, is it just scaled? I'm completely unaware of logistics in general, but the Richard's Curve seems to model anything with a leveling out population. What is population growth modeling called in statistics, specifically in R?
