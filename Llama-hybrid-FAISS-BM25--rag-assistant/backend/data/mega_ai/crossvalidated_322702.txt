Stationary process and time series prediction. Why? Please help me understand

So a time series assumes a stationary process. So, if the mean $\mu$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ are fixed for all $t$, what is the point? Isn't the next one is just going to come out of $N(\mu, \sigma)$? What is there to predict? Suppose I have data about how a person's measurement $x$ varies against $d$, the number of minutes until a deadline. This is not stationary. Can I use a time series method to predict a persons $x$ against time and $d$? Since $x_t$ is related to $x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}$ I would think a time series technique would be applicable. If not, what technique would I use?
