Are there are insights from the machine learning literature that moves away from linear regression using OLS when the goal is predicting a continuous variable? There are many methods other than standard OLS for modelling continuous data. There are even linear regression methods other than OLS (TLS/Deming regression for one). Other classical methods include GLMs, GAMs, quantile regression. Regularised regression also modifies the OLS penalty and therefore is not "just" OLS. I don't know why you think statistics had not moved past OLS without the help of machine learning. Perhaps it would be useful to read an introduction to statistical learning .
