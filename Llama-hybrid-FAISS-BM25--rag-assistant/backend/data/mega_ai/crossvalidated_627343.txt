Credible interval for a quantile from log-normally distributed data

Both reviewers of my latest article suggested better to work with credible intervals instead confidence intervals. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with Bayesian statistics. Until today, I was (obviously) more in the frequentist world, why I feel completely lost how I can obtain credible intervals from my data. After I have read a lot, I would say that I have understand the general difference between both interval types. But I do not see how I can get credible intervals. My situation: I have log-normally distributed data from an experiment. From these data, I wish to estimate distribution parameters $\tilde{\mu}$ and $\tilde{\sigma}$ , so that I can use the estimates to calculate quantiles with the inverted CDF (e.g., for $q=0.75$ ). My question now is, how can I calculate the credible interval $[ x^L_q, x^U_q ]$ for $x_q$ ? Based on the credible interval, I will argue that the unobservable quantile $x_q$ falls with a particular probability (here 95%) within this interval. Since I am not an expert in statistics I do not even know if my question makes sense. I hope that someone can push me into the right direction or give me some advice how to start.
