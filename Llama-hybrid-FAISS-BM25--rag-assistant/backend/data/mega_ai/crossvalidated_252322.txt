how to interpret interactions in a four-way ANOVA

I have a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 four-way ANOVA. IVs are A, B, C, D . The four-way interaction is not significant, and only one three-way interaction, A x B x C , is significant. In addition, 2 two-way interactions are significant: (1) B x D (2) A x D In sum, D doesn't participate in any significant three-way interactions, but it's involved in 2 two-way interactions. How should I proceed to interpret the simple or main effects? Should I average across D and deal with the A x B x C interaction first (e.g., A x B @ C1 , A X B @ C2 ), and then average across A and C to deal with B x D interaction (e.g., B @ D1 , B @ D2 ), and average across B and C to deal with A x D interaction (e.g., A @ D1 , B @ D2 )?
