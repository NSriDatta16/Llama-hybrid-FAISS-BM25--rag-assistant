Looping through localStorage in HTML5 and JavaScript

So, I was thinking I could just loop through localStorage like a normal object as it has a length. How can I loop through this? localStorage.setItem(1,'Lorem'); localStorage.setItem(2,'Ipsum'); localStorage.setItem(3,'Dolor'); If I do a localStorage.length it returns 3 which is correct. So I'd assume a for...in loop would work. I was thinking something like: for (x in localStorage){ console.log(localStorage[x]); } But no avail. Any ideas? The other idea I had was something like localStorage.setItem(1,'Lorem|Ipsum|Dolor') var split_list = localStorage.getItem(1).split('|'); In which the for...in does work.
