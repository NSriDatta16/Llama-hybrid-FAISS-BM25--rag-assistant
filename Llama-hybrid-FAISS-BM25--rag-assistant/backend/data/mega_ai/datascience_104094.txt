Is it Scientifically Rigorous to create a multimodal ML Model with data from multiple sources

I'm attempting to create a multimodal machine learning model for disease diagnosis. However, I'm having quite a bit of difficulty finding public data sets with all the data I need. For example, I need data on eye movement, facial expressions, and vocal fluctuations of an individual. I cannot find a data set that has all three of these for each individual. However, I am able to find separate data sets for each of these modalities, but each data set is from a completely different trial, and thus, is composed of different subjects. Is it scientifically rigorous to collect each modality from a different data set/individual due to the lack of public data? If not, would you happen to have any advice on where/how I could find data?
