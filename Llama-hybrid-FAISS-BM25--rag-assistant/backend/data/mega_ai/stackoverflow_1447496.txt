It'd be a lot easier if you made the weekday cells droppable â€” then you don't have to calculate the index of the current dropped cell and look up the contents of the day-of-the-week cell. Also, I think you need to give the cells a width and height in the CSS. This seems to do what you want, courtesy of the jQuery UI docs : td { width: 4em; height: 4em; margin: 3px; } td.weekday { background: #fcc; } td.droppable { background: #ccf; } div.draggable { background: #cfc; padding: 1em; width: 10em; } Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Drag Me $(".draggable").draggable(); $(".weekday").droppable({ drop: function() { alert($(this).text()); } });
