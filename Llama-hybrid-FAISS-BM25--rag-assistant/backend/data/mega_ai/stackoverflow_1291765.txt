How do I persist and restore my defstruct's to a file?

I want to persist my data to a file and restore the data when I rerun the program. I've defined my defstruct as such: (defstruct bookmark :url :title :comments) Program will simply do the following: 1. Load the defstruct's from url-db.txt 2. Read from an import file(s) passed into *command-line-args* and add to internal data var. 3. Rewrite the url-db.txt file. Sample import file: www.cnn.com|News|This is CNN www.msnbc.com|Search| news.ycombinator.com|News|Tech News
