How do I get Inline links in a paragraph grouped with images and that are interactive?

I currently have about 4-6 sentences that each come from different articles. They are displayed after each other in a TedxtBox that wraps the text. What I want to do is make the sentences interactive (hover/click) and also add a small icon at the end of the sentences with the same interaction. Each sentence should have individual events attached to it. How would you recommend me doing this? I have seriously have no clue at all. Thanks
