In my experience the most common cause for NaN loss is when a validation batch contains 0 instances. It's possible that you have some calculation based for example on averaging loss over several time stamps, but one of the time stamps has 0 instances causing a cascade of NaN values. Check carefully your validation set and how the loss is calculated on it.
