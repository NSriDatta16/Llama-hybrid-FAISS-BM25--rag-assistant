For the experiment described in the first paragraph, a two-sample t-test is indeed appropriate, as the participants are independent. For the crossover experiment you describe next, the paired t-test is indeed most appropriate. Both setups and analysis methods are correct and will give you unbiased estimation of the effect of gum. Yet the crossover setup has the advantage of conditioning on the participant, eliminating variability between participants and thus giving you better power and more precise estimation. Yet it hinges on the assumption that there is no effect of having chewed gum in the first session on the concentration on the second session, where the participants do not get to chew gum.
