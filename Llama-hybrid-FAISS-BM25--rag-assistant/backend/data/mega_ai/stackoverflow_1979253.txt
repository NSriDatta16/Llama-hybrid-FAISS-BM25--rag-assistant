We have purchased 12 years of intraday data from Kibot.com and are pretty satisfied with the quality. As for storage requirements: 12 years of 1-minute data for all USA equities (more than 8000 symbols) is about 100GB. With tick-by-tick data situation is little different. If you record time and sales only, that would be about 30GB of data per month for all USA equities. If you want to store bid / ask changes together with transactions, you can expect about 150GB per month. I hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
