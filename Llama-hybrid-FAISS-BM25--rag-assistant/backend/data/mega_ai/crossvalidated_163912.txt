Can you infer that sample is representative from statistical power?

I have travel times for 1000 routes (origin-destination pairs) and I collected about 12 actual travel time samples by driving some of these routes (randomly selected out of the 1000). I calculated statistical power of the 12 samples with an online power calculator by using the mean and standard deviation of the 1000 pairs and mean of the sample (alpha = 0.05). I got a power of 1 which I read somewhere means that the trend in the population would always be detected (from samples of any size). I then used this as a justification that the 12 samples are representative, and compared it with travel times for the sample routes obtained from other sources. A comparison of observed travel time vs predicted ones. Is this valid, and is inference of this sort achievable from statistical power? Also considering that observed time is being compared to time predicted from long-term averages (for similar driving conditions), how valid should I consider results of such statistical analyses.
