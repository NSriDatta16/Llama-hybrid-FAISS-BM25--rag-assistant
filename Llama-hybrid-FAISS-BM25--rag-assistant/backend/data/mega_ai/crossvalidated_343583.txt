You could take a Bayesian approach, as you say, and if your prior is a Gamma then your posterior will also be a Gamma, although you should make sure that the variable you are measuring is indeed continuous, otherwise your very first step (and subsequently everything that follows) will be incorrect. What you are asking for in this case however could be answered straightforwardly with the probability $\mathbb{P}[X \leq s\mid X > t], s > t$. The detailed calculation of this will depend on whether your random variable is discrete or continuous, but in general this is equal to $$\dfrac{\mathbb{P}[t t]} = \dfrac{F(s)-F(t)}{1-F(t)}.$$ In the discrete case, you can specify exactly at which point you want the probability to be evaluated, i.e. the event $\{X = s\}$, but be careful with the cumulative probabilities, as in the discrete case there is a difference between $\{X That being said, after your initial fitting of the distribution (on the "original" sample), you can use the estimated distribution to make predictions, so to speak, about devices that have not yet been tested, especially since you are interested in the case where the connection doesn't happen right away. If the probabilities you get for certain events seem to match the actual data from the new devices, your distributional fit seems to perform well. Otherwise, you either need to recalibrate the parameters by including the new devices' times in your data, or think of a different distributional model altogether. In any case, checking whether your model needs an update from time to time is never a bad idea.
