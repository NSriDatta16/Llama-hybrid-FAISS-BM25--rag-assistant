The AVD you're running has to be explicitly configured with SD card support or it will behave as if there isn't one. More information here . Your application also needs the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. Side note: You should be calling Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() to get the SD card's path instead of hard-coding /sdcard . It returns null if there's no storage available. You can use the canWrite() method on the returned value to determine if it's actually something you can use for storage.
