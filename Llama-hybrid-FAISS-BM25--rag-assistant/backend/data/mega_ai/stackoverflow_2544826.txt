Why not just use a vector of int values? Doesn't the bitset still use a byte per bit? You can also use a vector of bool values, but this is also implementation specific. Depending on whether you need storage efficiency or speed (or the utility of container methods that a couple of these approaches lack) you might profile to decide which approach to use.
