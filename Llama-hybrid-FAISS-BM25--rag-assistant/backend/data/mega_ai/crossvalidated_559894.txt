How to evaluate and compare regression models with limited number of observations in R?

I have a data frame with very limited number of observatons like the following and I want to run and compare a few regression models. I believe that any machine learning approaches would not make sense for my data and so, I have implemented linear models like the following. p1 As it is the first time I use such a small dataset 9I feel a bit uncomfortable), I would like to ask: are these methods apropriate for the size of my dataset? 2 what is the best way to compare these models? (does the size of the data matters here?)
