First thing you'll want to do is deal with your missing data. Some stats packages will "deal with it" for you, but usually don't tell you when or how it's being done. A common approach is to replace missing values with the grand mean, or perhaps the mode for categorical data--or eliminate the data point altogether. Your intuitions are right, PCA is not the only way to go, but it probably is the best approach here. If you happen to have a weighting scheme for your features (e.g., treating them all equally or according to a weighted model), you can compute a multivariate index for each item and do k-means clustering. The real advantage of this is that the computations are much simpler. If computation is not an issue, I'd opt for PCA instead, using a correlation matrix of your data. Here's a tutorial I found using a quick google search, but full disclosure: I haven't done PCA in R. R tutorial on PCA
