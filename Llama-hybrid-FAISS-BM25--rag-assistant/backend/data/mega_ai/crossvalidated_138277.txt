Excel can be great both for exploratory data analysis and linear regression analysis with the right plugins. There are a number of commercial products, although most of them leave something to be desired in terms of the quality of the output they produce (they don't take full advantage of Excel's charting options or the ability to link with other Office applications) and in general they are not as good as they could be for data visualization and presentation. They also tend to not support a disciplined modeling approach in which (among other things) you keep a well-documented audit trail for your work. Here is a FREE plugin, "RegressIt", that addresses many of these issues: http://regressit.com . It provides very good support for exploratory analysis (including the ability to generate parallel time series plots and scatterplot matrices with up to 50 variables), it makes it easy to apply data transformations such as lagging, logging, and differencing (which are often not applied appropriately by naive users of regression), it provides very detailed table and chart output that supports best practices of data analysis, and it maintains an audit-trail worksheet that facilitates side-by-side model comparisons as well as keeping a record of what models were fitted in what order. It makes a good complement to whatever else you may be using, if you are dealing with multivariate data and at least some of your work is being carried out in an Excel environment.
