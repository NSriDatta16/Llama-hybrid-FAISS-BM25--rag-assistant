Are they all out of step with you? Perhaps it's just you who is out of step! Lest I seem facetious, I mean what are the answers to the following questions: What has the team agreed should be the approach? Whose responsibility is it to enforce purity? If you don't go for enforced purity, whose responsibility is it to encourage purity? If it's not you, have a look in the mirror and make sure you are not the annoying noob on the team telling the old sweats how to do the jobs they've been doing since you were in Perl baby-clothes. What mechanisms do you have in place for sorting out such team issues? Regular code reviews, pair programming, bare-knuckle fights ? Asking them to read some tutorials is likely to be a waste of breath. What are your arguments for doing things the OO way? As Boris has observed, OO is not an end in itself, it is only a means to an end, and not the only means. There are probably more things you want to consider in your situation, but these should get you started.
