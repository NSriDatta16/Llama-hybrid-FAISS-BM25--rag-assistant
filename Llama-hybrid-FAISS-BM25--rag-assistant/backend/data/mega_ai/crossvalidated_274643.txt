In classical discrete-time survival analysis, the data are often broken down even farther, to individual data points for each time point within each sub-sequence (as you propose; indexed if you think that sub-sequences might need different models) of each overall sequence (which you label here as i ). The approach is explained for example in this paper by Willett and Singer . This turns the problem into modeling a binomial response as a function of the (potentially time-dependent) features and time, and allows different models for the multiple sub-sequences within a sequence. The cited paper uses logistic regression (logit link) to model the binomial response; a complementary log-log link instead might be more closely related to the proportional-hazards assumption of continuous-time Cox models. So your breaking down long sequences into sub-sequences has ample precedent. I have two comments on your particular application that you might want to consider. First, your analysis would be most useful if you have feature values for all time points, not just for the times of events. That's not clear from your description. Second, you might want to consider whether a good model of the event probabilities at each time point could be more generally useful than your loss function based simply on observed event times. If you model the individual probabilities you can reconstruct the loss function at the event times if you wish, and perhaps more easily examine different loss functions.
