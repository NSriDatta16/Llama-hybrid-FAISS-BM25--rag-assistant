Depends on your scenarios: If the event requires user interaction to resolve, then a modal dialog may well be the best approach because you can't continue until the user, for example, inserts the device into a USB port (or whatever). For other unusual notifications that the user may need to be aware of but may not disrupt the workflow, I suggest using an in-app popup-toast or updating the status window. If the user doesn't need to change/interrupt what they're doing, then don't warn/notify them: your device and app should "just work" - the user should only be interrupted if there's something that truly requires their attention or that will cause them disruption "soon".
