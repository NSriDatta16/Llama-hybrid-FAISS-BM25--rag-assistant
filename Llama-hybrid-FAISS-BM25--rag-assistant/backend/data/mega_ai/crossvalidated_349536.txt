Is it valid to average across forecast errors for series of parts?

I'm trying to do inventory control and measure bias in my forecasts. I can calculate the forecast error (Demand-Forecast) for each series of parts per month in a 12 month period, but I want to know if I can average across the errors in each month and the cumulative error for 100 part series? My concern is that some parts have large demands while some have few demands. 12 months are used for in-sample forecasting and 12 months are used for out-of-sample testing. Do I need to scale each error series first? Even cumulative errors?
