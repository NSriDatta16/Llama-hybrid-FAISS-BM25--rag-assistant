How to combine 2 regression from two data sets, same coefficient?

I have two data sets of gene expression and cause of they're made by two different platforms, I can't merge them. Now I have two regression with same coefficients: y=B01+B11X1+B12X2 y=B02+B12X1+B22X2 How can I merge them to get one regression model? attention: these regression models are output of two Bayesian networks reconstructed by continuous variables. There is an article "A novel method for combining Bayesian networks, theoretical analysis, and its applications" . But this article about discrete data. Estimated parameters in Bayesian network by continuous variables is also as estimate regression coefficients. So I want to combine two regression models to combine two Bayesian network.
