$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and session_regenerate_id in PHP

After reading a great post on PHP session security .I have two questions from the discussion. 1)$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] -This gets the information about the user's browser and other details and since a person can access their account from a different computer then how is it useful? 2)session_regenerate_id - This regenerates a session id , How should I use it ? Is the session_id deleted after a session has timeout or closed? Thanks for all your help.I appreciate each view and response.
