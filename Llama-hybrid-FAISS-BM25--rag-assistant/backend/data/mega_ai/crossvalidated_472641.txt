To complement Richard Hardy's answer, statistical time series models like ARIMA and the various members of the exponential smoothing family are used extensively in Supply Chain management and Retail to forecast demand, capacity, and inventory needs. And no, they are not merely modeling the residuals of some other supervised learning model, but modelling 1000s, or sometimes 1000000s of time series directly (consider for example a retailer with 500 stores and 50000 individual products: you end up 2.5M time series). Although the various R time series packages are useful and pedagogical, they typically don't scale well for such applications. Organizations resort to "industrial grade" large scale ERP packages, or more recently, building custom forecasting solutions on the cloud. It's ironic that you mention neural networks and tree-based methods as more useful or versatile, because in the time series forecasting space, those are considered relative newcomers who have yet to prove their usefulness. They're not entirely useless, there's just a debate around how useful they are compared to the statistical workhorses of forecasting, which are the various members of the exponential smoothing family.
