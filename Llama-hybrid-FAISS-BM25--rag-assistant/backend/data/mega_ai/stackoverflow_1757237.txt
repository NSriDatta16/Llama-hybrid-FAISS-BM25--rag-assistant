As a rule, functions should be small enough and written in a way that allows working out how it works by just reading them. A comment on top of the function describing what it does helps getting a quick overview of the function itself when reading through the whole source code file (unless the function name speaks for itself). Many projects are organized in that way, and that is great. However, what I am often missing when trying find my way around a larger codebase is something describing the big picture , i.e. the general architecture, principles, what goes where and similar things.
