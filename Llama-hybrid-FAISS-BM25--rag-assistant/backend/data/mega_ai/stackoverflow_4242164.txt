Real life SHELL SCRIPTS usage?

I'm learning UNIX/LINUX shell scripting and trying to think about it appropriate usage? The only thing that comes into mind - it'll be nice for let's say backup operations and logs management....But I'm sure it goes way beyond that...or is it? I'm sure there are people on this server who use Shell scripting on the daily basis. Can you tell me what do you use it for in your organization/business? Thanks:)
