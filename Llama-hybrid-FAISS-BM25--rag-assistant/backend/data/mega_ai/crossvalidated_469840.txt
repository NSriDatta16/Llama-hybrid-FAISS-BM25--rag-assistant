Why, or why not, factor categorical variables in regression modeling?

I'm currently in the midst of running several logistic regression models to test for effect modification (i.e., testing interaction terms) between two categorical variables (sex and age as a categorical variable). I realized that I'm not quite sure if I should factor all categorical variables or not? It seems reasonable that a categorical variable should be made into a factor rather than left as an integer but I don't fully understand what the potential implications of factoring vs not factoring are? And I assume that factoring is a common term across all languages but I'm referencing R programming. If anyone could add some mathematical clarity it would be greatly appreciated. Notably, I referenced logistic regression but I assume the implications would be similar across other distributions/links. Also, I played around with the model before posting and it didn't make much of a difference (save for interpretation if I left age category numeric) but I'm sure this is not always the case.
