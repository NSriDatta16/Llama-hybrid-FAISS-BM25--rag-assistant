Feature map for the Gaussian kernel

In SVM, the Gaussian kernel is defined as: $$K(x,y)=\exp\left({-\frac{\|x-y\|_2^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)=\phi(x)^T\phi(y)$$ where $x, y\in \mathbb{R^n}$. I do not know the explicit equation of $\phi$. I want to know it. I also want to know whether $$\sum_ic_i\phi(x_i)=\phi \left(\sum_ic_ix_i \right)$$ where $c_i\in \mathbb R$. Now, I think it is not equal, because using a kernel handles the situation where the linear classier does not work. I know $\phi$ projects x to a infinite space. So if it still remains linear, no matter how many dimensions it is, svm still can not make a good classification.
