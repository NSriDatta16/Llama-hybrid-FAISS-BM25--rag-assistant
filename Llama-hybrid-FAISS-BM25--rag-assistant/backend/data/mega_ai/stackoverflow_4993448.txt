Preloading Cocos2D textures when a standard UIKit UIView is visible

My app uses Cocos2D for animation and 2D rendering, but the "game lobby" (that's not what it is, but for all intents and purposes) is all standard UIView / UIKit code. I have a UIViewController subclass that has its main view set in the XIB file as an EAGLView . When I put all the Cocos loading code into viewDidLoad , everything works as expected, except that there is a 1-2 second freeze while Cocos loads all my textures. I have about 20 textures that I preload into the CCSpriteFrameCache before running my scene - so my animations are smooth immediately. I tried to move this texture loading code to my view controller's init method -- but when I try this, Cocos crashes, seemingly because there is no OpenGL context to work with. What I want to do is, while displaying a UIViewController 's main view (and not blocking the main thread), I'd like to load textures in the background, and then when finished, transition between that UIView and the OpenGL EAGLView . I am aware that there is an addImageAsync: call in Cocos now, so it's really just a matter of somehow "passing around an offscreen EAGLView/EAGLContext" that I can eventually stick into Cocos when I am ready to display that view. Does anyone have any pointers on an elegant solution to this?
