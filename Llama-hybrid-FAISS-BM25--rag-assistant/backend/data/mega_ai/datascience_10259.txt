You could build an ARIMAX model. This would permit to include autoregressive (AR) terms as well as well as the sales in product 5 as an Exogenous Input (X). This would give you a potential model where the sales for a product $i$ at time $t$ is given by $s^i_t$ then, $s^1_t=\alpha_1 s^1_{t-1} + \alpha_2 s^1_{t-2} + \ldots + \beta_0 s^5_t + \beta_1 s^5_{t-1} + \ldots $ Note that you may need to make the series stationary first, but see more on that below. You could estimate this model with the seasonal R package that relies on the X-13ARIMA-SEATS software developed by the US Census Bureau . I would recommend to ensure that your time series are all stationary, see for example this post before you use X13. I would also run cointegration tests. See for more explanation this excellent post . Since you only have data on week 5 I would start modeling in week 5 but you could include autoregressive (AR) terms related to the sales of product 1 prior to week 5.
