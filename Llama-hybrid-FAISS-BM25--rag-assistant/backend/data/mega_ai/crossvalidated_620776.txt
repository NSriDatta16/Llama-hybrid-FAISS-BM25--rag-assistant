Up to a few years ago, it seemed like "local" models (separate models per time series, e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, or separate dynamic regressions) would usually outperform "global" ones. However, the recent M4 and M5 forecasting competitions were quite decisively won by "global" methods - specifically by a smart combination of "classical" methods and DL for the M4, and by variants of Boosting for the M5. Incidentally, I believe the difference between "local" and "global" models was first articulated by Januschowski & Kolassa (2019, Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting ) and Januschowski et al. (2020, IJF ) in the context of an invited commentary on the M4 competition.
