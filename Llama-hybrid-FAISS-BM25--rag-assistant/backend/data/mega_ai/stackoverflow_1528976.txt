Can I execute a AJAX-enabled webservice method on the onbeforeunload event of a browser?

I am trying to execute a webservice method call from the javascript on the page, just before the user leaves the page. I got the javascript speaking the webservice perfectly. However, when I try to hook the javascript function to the window.onbeforeunload event, nothing happens. window.onbeforeunload = LogEnd; function LogEnd() { OnlineAgent.AnalyticsService.FeatureUseEndLog(63, OnCallComplete, OnCallFailed); } function OnCallComplete(result) { //var elem = $get("Results"); //elem.innerHTML = result; } function OnCallFailed(result) { //var elem = $get("Results"); //elem.innerHTML = "Failed: " + result; } The method on the webservice returns no values. I am unsure what to do with the onsuccess and onfailed callback functions, so I placed empty functions. Any ideas guys? Has anyone tried to do this before?
