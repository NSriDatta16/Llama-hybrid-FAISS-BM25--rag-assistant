what does scaling the normal vector of a plane (/hyperplane) mean?

I understand that, scaling (multiplying or dividing by a constant) the normal vector of a plane, does not affect the plane itself. But what happens when we do so? Are we zooming in or out of the space, like in a linear transformation? Or in simpler words, what's the intuitive effect on scaling the normal vector of a plane(or a hyperplane)? I came across the optimization problem whilst learning SVM (support vector machines) which goes like this: minimize $w^\top w$ s.t. $\forall_i, \, \ y_i(w^\top\cdot x_i+b) \geq 1$, where $w$ is the normal vector of the supporting hyperplane. So we are basically looking to minimize the length of the normal vector of the hyperplane ($w^\top\cdot w$) subject to the constraint. So I'm just wondering what effect could come out of minimizing the length of the normal vector.
