Since "statistical patterns" is an infinitely broad category, this is an overly broad question. In terms of the available software packages, this depends a great deal on what statistical model you wish to simulate from . Here are a few standard ones you might be interested in, and how to implement them in R . Continuous data Multivariate Gaussian: To generate data from this distribution (with some specified correlation matrix) you can use the rmvnorm function in the mvtnorm package . Regression models: If you have already generated the explanatory variables for a regression model (e.g., with the multivariate Gaussian distribution) you can then generate the response variable in the model directly using the model equation using a randomly generated error term. This allows you to generate data from Gaussian regression models, logistic regression models, other GLMs, etc. Time-series models: To generate data from the stationary Gaussian ARMA model (with some specified parameters) you can use the rGARMA function in the ts.extend package (see also O'Neill 2021 ). Discrete data Simple-random-sampling: To generate data using simple-random-sampling from a specified population of values you can use the sample function in the base package. This function can accomodate simple-random-sampling with or without replacement. Balls-in-bins model: To generate data from the extended balls-in-bins model you can use the sample.ballbin function in the occupancy package .
