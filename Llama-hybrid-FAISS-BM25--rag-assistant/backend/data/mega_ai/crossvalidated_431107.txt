The entirety of statistical inference is based upon assuming that a variable of interest: 1) Has a probability distribution; and 2) The parameters of the assumed probability distribution can be estimated form the data. You never know the true probability distribution of a variable (except perhaps in contrived or very unusual circumstances). If you did, though, you could make a wide variety of claims about real-world events or the randomness of real-world events. For example, suppose you owned a grocery store and you know that the number of customers per hour followed a Poisson distribution with rate parameter 2. With this information, you can conclude that, at any given hour of the day you will on average receive 2 customers. 95% of the time, you'll receive between 0 and 5 customers per hour. If you ran a sale and observed 10 customers arrive per hour, you would have solid evidence that the sale was having its intended affect of increasing customer interest in your store. In fact, observing 10 customers per hour is almost inconceivable for a Poisson process with mean = 2 (should occur less than 0.0001% of the time), so you would have rather strong evidence. I'm not entirely certain if this addresses your question, however. You specifically asked about how knowledge of the distribution could help you with respect to variables in a dataset. This is kind of an odd question because, as a researcher we are almost never interested in understanding the distribution of data for their own sake. Most of the time, we look at data to learn what it can tell us about a real-world "data-generating process." We hypothesize that the data came from some "population-level" process, and we infer the properties of that process from observing data drawn from it. Typically, the distributions of data are only indirectly useful; they can, for example, help us decide if an assumption of normality (which applies to the hypothesized data-generating process, not to the data themselves) is defensible.
