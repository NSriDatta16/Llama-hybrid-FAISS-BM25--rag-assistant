Async Task Timeout?

There is a very common task I face again. I have already solved this a couple of times, but now I am looking for a more " elegant " way - can you deliver some input? Situation: I have a Method which I would like to run "semi async". In other words: Start it and wait a given time x. If the method is not finished by then ("timed out"), I want to continue my code with some cleanup procedures. Solutions so far: Use an AutoResetEvent (or ManualResetEvent) combined with an annonymus method using .WaitOne(x). Use a Thread/BackgroundWorker combined with a Timer. If the timer hits its handler before the thread stops it, the therad is timed out. Both appraochs work fine but I imagine there is a better way with 4.0. Suggestions?
