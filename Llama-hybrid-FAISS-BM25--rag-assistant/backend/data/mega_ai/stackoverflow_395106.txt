I agree with Kim. Why not re-write your core API using the best practices you explained, and supply a set of proxy/adapter classes that expose the old interface but talk to your new API? Old developers will be naturally encouraged to migrate to the new API, but not be forced to immediately do so. New developers will simply use your new API. Announce an EOL for your old API interface if you are concerned about developers staying on the old API.
