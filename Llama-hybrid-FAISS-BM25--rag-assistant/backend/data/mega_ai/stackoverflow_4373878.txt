SimpleXML output to MySQL

I want to read the following XML file received from my e-commerce site and insert the records in MySQL. I tried it using simpleXML but it does not seem to be working. HAA_00 CAD 00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1234567890208108 Y PCAD PTYCSH 00000406 02 2013-03-31 HAA_00 CAD XYZCESFULL9900 CAD 00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0987654321756990 Y PCAD PTYCSH 00000520 00 2013-04-30 XYZCESFULL9900 CAD I have written the following code that is working as expected. ACCOUNT as $item) { $mysql="insert into test.mytable values ('".$item->ACCNO."','".$item->CURRCODE."')"; echo $mysql; } ?> But I have 1 question to ask. 1) There are times when I need to process 2 cards in the same ACCOUNT clause. How do I handle such situations?
