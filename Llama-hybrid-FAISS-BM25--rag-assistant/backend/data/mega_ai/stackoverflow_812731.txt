One all purpose (edmx./.dbml) or many depending on a criteria like domain, functionality?

Do you have one gigantic linq to sql DBML or Linq to entities .EDMX file / namespace or many files/namespaces separated logically?? For example in a db schema if you have 3 sub schemas like (Audit and UserMgmt), Human Resource, Sales..would you have them separated?
