Creating a timed launchd plist

I'm trying to create a plist for the LaunchAgents folder that will run perpetually and call a shell script every 30 seconds. It started with a template that I got here and that I tried to tailor to fit my needs, but it's still not working. Any help? Label com.Intel_Watchdog ProgramArguments /Library/A_Intel_WATCHDOG/A_WatchDog.sh StandardErrorPath /dev/null StandardOutPath /dev/null StartInterval 30 RunAtLoad Thanks so much!
