Is there a formal proof that Autoencoders perform non-linear PCA?

I have seen this statement in various blog posts, papers etc., and the claim is intuitive for me, however I had a hard time finding a paper with the actual proof for that. I guess one could view that as a case of Kernel PCA, but it is not obvious to me that each Neural Network model will automatically fulfill requirements for a kernel function. Besides there are papers which came out before the Kernel PCA paper. I would also assume that one needs to modify the training algorithm to learn the actual principal components. Is there a classic work that I have simply overlooked?
