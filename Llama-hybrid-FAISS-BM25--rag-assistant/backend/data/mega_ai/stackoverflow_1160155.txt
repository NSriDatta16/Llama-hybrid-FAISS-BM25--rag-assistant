CloudMade provides APIs for embedding OpenStreetMap maps in many languages - but not .NET as of the time of writing. There are plain HTTP APIs for map tiles available that you could call from .NET programs, but this is of course fairly low-level. The CloudMade APIs are designed for developers who want to embed OSM output in their projects, rather than the OSM API which is geared towards map creation, so I think you might be interested in the CloudMade stuff. See http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects for more.
