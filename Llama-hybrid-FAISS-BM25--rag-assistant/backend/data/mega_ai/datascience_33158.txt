XGboost - Choice made by model

i am using XGboost to predict a 2 classes target variable on insurance claims. I have a model ( training with cross validation, hyper parameters tuning etc...) i run on another dataset. My question is : is there a way to know why a given claim has been affected to one class i.e. the features that explain the choice made by the model? The purpose is to be able to justify the choice made by the machine to third party human. Thanks for your answer.
