How to use classifier a to test whether the boundary between classes (and the classes, themselves) is (are) similar across two datasets

I have two datasets which each contain two classes (four classes total). I suspect that both datasets contain the same kinds of classes (i.e. the boundary that distinguishes classes is similar across datasets, and the classes are the same across datasets) Dataset1: class1=A, class2=B Dataset2: class1=A, class2=B As opposed to... Dataset1: class1=A, class2=B Dataset2: class1=C, class2=D I want to test this idea using a nonlinear classifier (e.g. neural network) as my primary tool. The idea I have is to: 1) Train a classifier (via cross-validation) to distinguish class1 & class2 on dataset1. Measure performance/accuracy using test set and all that jazz. 2) Apply pre-trained classifier from step 1 to dataset2 to see how well it can separate the two classes within dataset2 3) Compare classification accuracy between testSet_dataset1 and testSet_dataset2 to assess how similar/different the class discriminating boundary is across datasets. With a nonlinear classifer such as a neural network, this classifier approach would likely be better than simply comparing distributions using the original feature representations (e.g. w/ KS test) due to the fact that the classifier will hopefully notice nonlinear patterns in each observation (which are likely vital to capturing the underlying stats of each class). Now for my questions: 1) How should I assess whether or not the accuracy difference in step 3 is SIGNIFICANTLY similar/different? 2) Would such a detected similarity/difference allow me to state that the datasets contain matching classes, or will I only be able to state that the boundary between classes are similar? 3) Would it be more straightforward/preferred to project my data into a lower-dimensional space (perhaps via an autoencoder to extract patterns from the feature space) followed by running a KS test on suspected identical classes across datasets? This would allow me to assess class similarities across datasets as well, while also utilizing more abstract/pattern-esque feature representations.
