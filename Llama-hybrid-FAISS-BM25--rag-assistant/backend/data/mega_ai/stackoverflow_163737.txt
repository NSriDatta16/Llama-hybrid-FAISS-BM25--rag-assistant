The "attic" in CVS is more of an implementation detail. The file can't be deleted completely from the repository, since the file history is in the " ,v " file itself, so CVS moves it aside. Subversion uses a more sophisticated repository storage mechanism where files don't need to be moved aside in this way. I don't think there's an easy way to query for the most recent revision where a file existed, but you should be able to find it easily enough using "svn ls -r rev ". In this case rev can be any one of the thing Subversion accepts to indicate a revision - a number, a date, etc. Just go back in history until you find it, then step forward until you find the last revision where it existed. Update: @AviewAnew has a good idea about checking the log of the directory where the file existed. Since a file delete is really a change to the directory that contains it, it should be easy to find where the file disappeared this way.
