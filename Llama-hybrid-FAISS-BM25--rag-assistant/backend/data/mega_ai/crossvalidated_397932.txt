There are many different flavors of GANs, so in this answer, I will refer to the original GAN. It's regarded as unsupervised because you don't assume that you have a target variable in your dataset -- and if you have one, you don't use it. All you need is some features (e.g., images) -- you don't need class label information for these images etc. Your goal is to sample from the distribution generating these images (via the generator). You are right though that there is some supervised learning going on inside a GAN via the discriminator. I.e., the discriminator is a binary classifier. The labels are not describing the content of the images, they are not part of the training set. It's merely an indicator whether the image is form the training set or from the generator. So, in that sense, GANs are for unsupervervised problems where you don't have label information, yet it also incorporates techniques from supervised learning. To call it an "unsupervised learning" technique is hence just a convention and in that case it's up for interpretation (I mean, DL technical language is broken anyway with lots of inconsistent terminology, so we shouldn't take it too seriously or literally I guess :))
