how do you organize your namespaces?

So I have logical entities (person, country, etc.), GUI elements / controls, data and navigation controllers / managers, then things like quad-trees and timers, and I always struggle with cleanly separating these things into logical namespaces. I usually have something like this: Leviathan.GUI.Controls Leviathan.GUI.Views Leviathan.Entities Leviathan.Controllers (data and other stuff) Leviathan.Helpers (trees and other stuff) Are there any good guides on this? I need to stop this mess.
