Change where jQuery UI drag helper is appended to document

I have a drag element which is inside a "popout" so when the drag initiates and the user moves away the "popout" hides itself (this is the desired functionality), however, because the helper function that I have set up to return my custom helper appends the helper right after the drag element it also hides when the popout closes. In summary my question is; can I change where in the document a jQuery UI custom helper is appended to the document?
