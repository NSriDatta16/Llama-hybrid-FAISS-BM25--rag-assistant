You could do a series of one sided tests for such a directional alternative, though it's also possible to test such hypotheses in a single test. There are several nonparametric tests - e.g. the Jonckheere-Terpstra and Match test for ordered alternatives (found, for example, in Neave and Worthington's, 1988 book Distribution-Free Tests. ). There are also parametric approaches for testing for trend. The book by Barlow, Bartholemew, Bremner and Brunk (1972) ( Statistical Inference Under Order Restrictions ) discusses some, though there are numerous more recent papers, some based on isotonic regression approaches, and some on linear-score tests for example. There's also Bayesian approaches. For example Gelfand et al (1990) and Gelfand et al (1992) discuss using MCMC for an ordered alternatives problem (the second in a two-way situation). Gelfand, Hills, Racine-Poon, and Smith, (1990), Illustration of Bayesian Inference in Normal Data Models Using Gibbs Sampling , Journal of the American Statistical Association, 85 :412 (Dec.), pp. 972-985 Gelfand, A.E., Smith, A.F. & Lee, T. (1992), Bayesian analysis of constrained parameter and truncated data problems using Gibbs sampling, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 87 , pp. 523â€“532 Of those, I'd be inclined to just do a Jonckheere-Terpstra, simply because its probably the most readily doable without going to extra effort; it can be found in quite a few packages, though some of the parametric trend tests may be available to you as well.
