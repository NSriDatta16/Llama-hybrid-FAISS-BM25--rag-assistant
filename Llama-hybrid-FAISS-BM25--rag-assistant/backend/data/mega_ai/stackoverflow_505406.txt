when to use OPTIMIZE in mysql

I have a database full of time-sensitive data, so on a daily basis I truncate the table and then import the new data (from a merge of other databases) into the truncated table. Currently I am running OPTIMIZE on the table after I have imported the daily refresh of data. However, looking at the mysql OPTIMIZE syntax page http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/optimize-table.html it says I can optimize to reclaim unused space and defrag the data. So should I being running OPTIMIZE twice? Once when I delete the data, and then again after I've reinserted it? or just once? and if just once, should it be after loading the new data? or after clearing out the old?
