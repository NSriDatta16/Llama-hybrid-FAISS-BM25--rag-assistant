Slice rows in R based on column value

I have multi-touch attribution data like: medium conversion 1 organic 0 2 (none) > referral > referral > (none) > (none) > referral 0,0,0,0,0,0 3 (none) 0 4 organic > referral > referral 0,1,0 5 referral > referral > referral > referral 0,0,1,0 6 organic > referral > referral > (none) > referral 0,1,0,1,0 I'd like to remove rows with no conversions (like rows 1, 2 and 3) and I tried grepl but couldn't make it work. For the remaining rows how to split rows so it ends with a conversion, e.g. row 4 will be organic > referral 0,1 and row 6 will split into organic > referral 0,1 and organic > referral > referral > (none) 0,1,0,1
