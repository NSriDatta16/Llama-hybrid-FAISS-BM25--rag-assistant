One has to be careful about the meaning of the word sparse. Your matrix contains many zeroes and one may represent such a matrix in a sparse way (to save on storage). But since the figures represent co-occurrences these zeroes are still to be considered informative (they are not missing; they are not structurally zero) and should therefore be taken into account when modeling the content of the matrix. The many zeroes and the skewness (approximately geometric) would suggest to use generalized forms of bilinear models (see de Falguerolles/Gabriel : Generalized Linear-Bilinear Models). The R-package gnm supports this type of models. The sparse variants of PCA/SVD you are referring to rather relate to L1-regularisations of the factorial representation such that estimated loadings come out as sparse (many zeroes).
