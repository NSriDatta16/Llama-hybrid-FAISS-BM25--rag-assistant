Yes, it hides a variable in a module from other modules. In C++, I use it when I don't want/need to change a .h file that will trigger an unnecessary rebuild of other files. Also, I put the static first: static const int foo = 42; Also, depending on its use, the compiler won't even allocate storage for it and simply "inline" the value where it's used. Without the static, the compiler can't assume it's not being used elsewhere and can't inline.
