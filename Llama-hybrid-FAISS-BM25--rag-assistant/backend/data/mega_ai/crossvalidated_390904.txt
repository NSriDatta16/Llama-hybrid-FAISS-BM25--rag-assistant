In cases in which you have a classifier which simply outputs, say, a binary value, I think your best bet is to do hyper-parameter optimization on the validation set and then pick the set of parameters which maximize your F1 score. You could choose the parameters via cross-validation - you can be as sophisticated as you want there. In general cases in which a classifier outputs at least a score, you can turn it into a probability by normalizing it. By the way, since you cited it, SVM use the Platt Scaling ( article , wiki page , related question ) to return a probability.
