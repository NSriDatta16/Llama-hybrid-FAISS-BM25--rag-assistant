Ruby Enterprise Edition uses less memory than vanilla Ruby because of its improved garbage collector. May be that's something you also want to take advantage of in development. As Passenger is running all the time you don't have to mess about stopping and starting Mongrel. Simply open your application's URL. If you're using Mac OS X there's even a handy preference pane which makes configuring Passenger to serve a Rails application a mere drag and drop away. It also lets you easily test your app in production mode.
