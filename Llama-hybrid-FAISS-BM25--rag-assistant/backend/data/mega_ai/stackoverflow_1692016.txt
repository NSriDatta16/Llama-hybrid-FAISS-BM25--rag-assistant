IF built correctly, then the same XHTML site should support both versions. That said, I see several possibilities: Check the user agent to determine the browser type Use a noscript tag on the intensive JS version with a link to the simple site Use JS to redirect to the intensive JS version on the simple XHTML site (not very good in terms of SEO)
