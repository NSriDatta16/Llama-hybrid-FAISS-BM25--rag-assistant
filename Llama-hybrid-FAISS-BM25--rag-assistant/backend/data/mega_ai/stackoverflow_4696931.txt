It sounds like you're looking for a UINavigationController. The UINavigationController lets you push new view controllers on top of existing ones. It gives you a navigation bar at the top that will allow the user to go back to the root controller. I think it's the kind of controller Apple uses it in the default email application, to give you an example. Concerning organization: you design your root view controller and a detail/add view controller. In your app delegate, you attach a UINavigationController to the window and you set its root controller to the main controller you want to display. That root controller can then push the add/detail controller onto the stack (and when it does so, it can tell the add/detail controller which types of button to display.) I can't answer your grouped properties question, but it sounds like a separate question anyway.
