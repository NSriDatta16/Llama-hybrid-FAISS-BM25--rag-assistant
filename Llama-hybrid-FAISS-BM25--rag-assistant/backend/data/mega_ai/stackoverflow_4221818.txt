I recommend against converting to UTC. When DST starts/ends is constantly changing and sometimes with little notice (Agentina once changed the statrt day to be just 12 days later). And it sounds like you want the process to run at 17:30 local time. The only way to do this is to store the local time and the time zone. And note "local time" is not the time in that timezone, it's just a set time of day. Then when you need to calculate the next time to run, apply the timezone to the taime for the date you're running and get the UTC time of that next event. So specific events - store in UTC. Reocurring events - store in local time & timezone. More at http://blogs.windwardreports.com/davidt/2009/11/what-every-developer-should-know-about-time.html
