How to use MVCMailer without breaking my service layer?

I am looking into using MVcMailer to make nicer emails. However one thing that I am unsure is how to organize the code. I currently have 2 projects. One for mvc and one for my repos and service layers. my 2nd project has no knowledge of MVC and I would like to keep it that way. I am thinking that my smtp code would go into a service layer or wrapper and then I would call it up from other service layers when I need to send emails out. So where does the MVC mailer fit in? Do I generate the body in the controller then pass it to a serivce layer that passes it to my smtp class?
