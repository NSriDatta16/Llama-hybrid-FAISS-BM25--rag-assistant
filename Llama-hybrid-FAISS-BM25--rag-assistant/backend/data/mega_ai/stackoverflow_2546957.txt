javascript on twitter to prevent embedding the html page

This is the javascript that you can find in www.twitter.com (just click to see the source code) I have just reformatted it for clarity: if (window.top !== window.self) { document.write = ""; window.top.location = window.self.location; setTimeout(function() { document.body.innerHTML = ''; }, 1); window.self.onload = function(evt) { document.body.innerHTML = ''; }; } now I understand this trick is to prevent other sites to wrap twitter in other iframes. but what I want to ask is do we really need all of this code ? what's the need of setting a function to execute in 1 millisecond, one to execute at 'onload' and one now. is that paranoia or is it really worth ? Many THanks in advance Reg
