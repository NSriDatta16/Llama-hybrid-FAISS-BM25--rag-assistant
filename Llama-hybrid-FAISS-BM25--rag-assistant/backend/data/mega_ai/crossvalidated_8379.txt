Create a scatterplot to check whether it makes any sense to suppose that a single correlation coefficient is an adequate description of the association between the variables. For example, in these (simulated) data the correlation for ages 6-20 is 90%, for ages 50+ it's -70%, and overall it's 15%. In such a situation reporting a single correlation coefficient would be as deceptive as reporting that the average number of legs among household pets is four when half of the pets are fish and the other half are spiders... The choice of how to express correlation is of secondary concern and rests on other aspects of the dataset.
