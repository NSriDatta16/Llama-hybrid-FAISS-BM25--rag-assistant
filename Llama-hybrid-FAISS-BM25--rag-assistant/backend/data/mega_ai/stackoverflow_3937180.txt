If you're using sdk 3.2 or higher, this is dead easy with the UIGestureRecognizer class. Otherwise, I'd do something along the lines of checking the amount of movement of the finger between touches began and touches ended, calling the gesture a tap if the movement is minimal and a swipe if it's large.
