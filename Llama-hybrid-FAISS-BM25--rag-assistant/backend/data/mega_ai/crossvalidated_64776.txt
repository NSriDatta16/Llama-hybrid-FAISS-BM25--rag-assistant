Given what you have stated, you should calculate the alpha's separately. For example, you could state that the measure of social X had an alpha value of .75 in sample 1 and of .80 in sample 2. If there are very few items (e.g., around 3), average inter-item correlation may also be used instead of Cronbach's alpha.
