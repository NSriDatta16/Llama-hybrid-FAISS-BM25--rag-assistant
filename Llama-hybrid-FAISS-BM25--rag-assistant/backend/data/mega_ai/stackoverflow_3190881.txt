Need your input on creating tables

I just want some advice about mysql database. I'm creating a new database for hired cars that need servicing and repairs. I have created 4 tables. Car_id is linked to a primary key table with car information. I was thinking of putting the repair_id and service_id with in the car data table. But that means it will have 3 primary keys in one table. WIll this be okay? Garage table- Garage id (Primary key) Garage name Mechanics fname Mechanics sname address Phone Mechanic data- Mechanics id (Primary key) Garage id (Foreign key) Mec name Repair data- Repair id (Primary key) Car id (Foreign key) Work description Mec id (Foreign key) Service data- Service id (primary) Car id (Foreign key) Works description Mec id (Foreign key) I have slightly altered the table. What do you think. Will it work? Garage data is Garage_id Garage name fname surname address Phone number type data is Type_code ------------ will be number 1 for repair and number 2 for service Type_description repair/service mecanics data is Mec id Garage id Type _code Repair_id Car id - i have created a table already for this Work description Mec id Service id Car id Works description Mec id Thank you for helping me. It will be useful if you can see if its okay.
