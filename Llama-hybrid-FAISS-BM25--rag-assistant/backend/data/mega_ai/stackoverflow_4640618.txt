Xcode / iOS Delegates

If I have a view controller which implements two protocols: @interface CustomerOperationsViewController : UIViewController > Is there any easy way to create the required callbacks for the protocols? Maybe an Xcode shortcut for implement methods? I'm going to the documentation each time for this. Related, is it possible to put the delegate into a different file than the file owner? I don't see how to drag from the UI element to a class other than the file owner.
