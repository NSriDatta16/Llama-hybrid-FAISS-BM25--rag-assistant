I found an answer to your question in the Section 6.3.3 of the Deep Learning book. (Goodfellow et. al, 2016): The use of softplus is generally discouraged. ... one might expect it to have advantage over the rectifier due to being differentiable everywhere or due to saturating less completely, but empirically it does not. As a reference to support this claim they cite the paper Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks (Glorot et. al, 2011).
