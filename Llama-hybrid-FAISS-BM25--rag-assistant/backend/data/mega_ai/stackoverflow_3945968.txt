NUnit locks my executable so that I can't recompile it

When I load my executable in NUnit, the application appears to be "locked". I run the tests but when I want to make some modifications to them, I have to close NUnit first otherwise my compilation will fail. Is there any workaround for this? EDIT According to Process Explorer, the only process accessing my executable right now are "nunit-agent.exe" and "nunit.exe"
