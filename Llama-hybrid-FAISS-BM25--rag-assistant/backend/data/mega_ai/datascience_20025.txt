Predicting next adverse event based on previous events

I have a clinical trial dataset where the patient details are recorded at certain time intervals(visits) over period of time. Each visit will contain data recordings of all the adverse events experienced prior to the visit, any medicines taken and the dosage of experimental drug in no particular order. for example a visit could have recordings of 5 adverse events (nausea, headache, hypertension etc.) experienced in the week prior to the visit, dosage of experimental drug and some medicines given to avoid the adverse events. Now i need to predict the occurrence of adverse events for a patient before his next visit and also need to know which medicines cause some of these adverse effects. I hope I've clearly explained the problem. What Machine learning/Statistical methods would best solve this?
