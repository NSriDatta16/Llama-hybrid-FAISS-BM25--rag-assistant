How to Handle Infinite Values in Feature Engineering for Machine Learning Models

I'm currently working on a machine learning project where I am creating new features related to the ratio of bytes sent and received in a communications network. However, I'm facing a challenge: when the number of bytes received is zero, the ratio calculation leads to infinite values. This is problematic for my machine learning models. I'm seeking advice on best practices for handling such infinite values in feature engineering. Specifically, my questions are: What are the most effective ways to handle infinite values in features, especially in the context of ratio calculations like bytes sent/received? Should I replace these infinite values with a specific number, or is there a more nuanced approach that would yield better results for machine learning modeling? Are there any standard practices in the industry for dealing with this kind of issue, particularly in network data analysis? Any insights, references to research papers, or examples from personal experience would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!
