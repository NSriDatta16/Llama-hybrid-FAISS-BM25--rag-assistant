Right now the F# team seems pretty busy with all the "productisation" effort. One email with the plans for the licensing is here . As we complete this over the next year, our plan is to make a corresponding source release of the F# compiler components under MS-PL. And: Along the way, we plan to make a source release of the MSR "Power Pack" components, also under MS-PL. These include tools such as fslex.exe and fsyacc.exe and some libraries. These may be released more often and may include experimental components. With: In general, we aim for the source code releases we make of F# to open, stable and correspond to supported releases. And perhaps the nicest bit :) : On the whole we prefer to "do" rather than "pre-announce". I'll also note that if you're not using the term "Open Source" meaning "approved by certain organisations as Open Source", then the source code is already included with the F# distro. (And using F12 "Go To Definition" in VS will jump you right to the source files.)
