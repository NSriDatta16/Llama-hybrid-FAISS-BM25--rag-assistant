What is the bayesian uninformative exponential prior?

I am looking to model a poisson process $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$ and infer $\lambda$ using bayesian inference from $X$ e.g. $[0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,1]$ could be my dataset. The data comes from the count of something occurring in a day. I am considering $Exponential(\alpha)$ as my prior as it can represent positive real numbers, and I am wondering how to pick $\alpha$. If it is not possible to do so in an uninformative way, I would also like to know if there are methods to sensibly pick $\alpha$ or possibly whether there is a more suitable prior distribution. The output would be a distribution around $\lambda$
