If your web role has limited functionality, you might be able to just set the Web project as the Active Project in your VS solution and run from there. For example, my web role doesn't call into table storage, blob storage, etc... it just makes some Azure logging calls and interacts with SQL Azure. So sometimes I just set the web project to be the startup project in the VS debugger, not Azure, and run from there. I've properly written my logging calls to check if Azure is available before they write, so they don't execute in this situation. Of course, if you're doing lots with table storage, queues, blobs, etc. then this is not for you.
