HTML5 Webapp as regular icon or app on iPhone and Android.

Sorry if this is a noob question, I searched quite a bit and couldn't find an answer. I'm developing a html5 app that relies on sqlite for local storage. I'd like for it to appear as an app icon on the iPhone/Android screen, what's the best way to do this? Ie can I write some sort of "wrapper" app to achieve it? Thanks!
