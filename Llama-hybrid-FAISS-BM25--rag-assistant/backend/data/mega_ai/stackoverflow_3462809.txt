NSURL allows relative URLs, which would include "cow". The general form of a URI given in RFC 2396 allows relative references: URI-reference = [ absoluteURI | relativeURI ] [ "#" fragment ] relativeURI = ( net_path | abs_path | rel_path ) [ "?" query ] rel_path = rel_segment [ abs_path ] rel_segment = 1*( unreserved | escaped | ";" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | "," ) Unless I'm misreading horribly, this means any sequence of valid characters can form a valid relative URL.
