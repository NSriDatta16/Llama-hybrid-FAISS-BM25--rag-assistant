Hint: As Adrian points out, we need to minimize $\omega$ as a function of $x$ and $y$. Now, \begin{align} \omega(x) &= 6x^2 - x(16y+8) + \cdots\\ \omega(y) &= 12y^2 - y(16x) + \cdots \end{align} have minima at $$x = \frac{16y+8}{12} = \frac 43y + \frac 23, \quad y = \frac{16x}{24} = \frac{2}{3}x$$ respectively, giving $(x,y) = (6,4)$ as the solution. Here, instead of the calculus-based method of finding minima, I used the fact that $ax^2+bx+c$ has an extremum at the average value of its roots $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ which average equals $\frac{-b}{2a}$ (no need to fuss with evaluating the square root). I leave it up to you to determine if this is doable in 2 minutes or not.
