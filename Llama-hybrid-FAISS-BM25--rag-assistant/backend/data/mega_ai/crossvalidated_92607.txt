Since your values are measurements, I assume the actual density close to 0 is not an issue and we can safely assume convergence for the Taylor expansion. (I understand that I should be using the t-distribution to best model it, as we only have an average of 4 reads, but I am trying to work it out for the Normal case first.) This appears to be a common misconception. Having small samples doesn't cause approximately normal data (or its mean) to have a t-distribution; if your reasons for assuming approximate normality are good, small samples doesn't change that. Your discussion doesn't make it clear how $V$ relates to $\alpha$. It's also not clear how finding the expectation of $1/V$ tells you about $K_d$. I feel like there are important details missing. In any case, I'll do the expansion: \begin{align} g(X) &= g(\mu_X + X - \mu_X) \\ &= g(\mu_X) + (X - \mu_X)\cdot g'(\mu_X) + \frac{(X - \mu_X)^2}{2!}\cdot g''(\mu_X) + \frac{(X - \mu_X)^3}{3!}\cdot g'''(\mu_X) + ... \end{align} Taking expectations term by term: \begin{align} E(g(X)) &= g(\mu_X) + g'(\mu_X)\cdot E(X - \mu_X) + \frac{g''(\mu_X)}{2}\cdot E[(X - \mu_X)^2] + ... \\ &=g(\mu_X) + 0 + g''(\mu_X)/2\cdot \text{Var}(X) + ... \\ &\approx g(\mu_X) + g''(\mu_X)/2 \cdot\text{Var}(X) \end{align} When $g(X) = 1/X$, $\quad\quad\quad\quad\ \ \approx \frac{1}{\mu_X} - \frac{1}{2\mu_X^2} \sigma^2_X $ An approximation for the variance can also be obtained.
