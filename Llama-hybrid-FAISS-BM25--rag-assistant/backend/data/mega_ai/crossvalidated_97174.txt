Ordered Probit and categorical variables

I wanted to run a quick and easy (or so I thought) regression on some data I have but now I am starting to doubt whether or not the regression makes any sense. I have seen some similar questions but they don't really answer what I want to know. I want to run an ordered probit/logit with the dependent variable having five ordinal outcomes. My explanatory variables are: age, work experience, gender, position with-in the organisation, country of origin and so on. "Gender" will be a dummy variable and "Country of origin" will be coded using dummmies. "Age" is a categorical variable so it will have values such as 18-25 years, 25-32 years etc. Should I code each group as a dummy variable? "Position with-in the organisation" is categories such as employee, executive and so on. Should I code each of these as dummy variables? Work experience are in categories such as 1-2 years, 2-3 years and 5+ years etc. Should I code these as dummy variables? What I am interested in knowing is that when I only have dummy variables as explanatory variables, will I get meaningful results? For some reason I find it very unintuitive.
