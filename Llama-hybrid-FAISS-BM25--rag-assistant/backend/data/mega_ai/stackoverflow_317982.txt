I would: Add some code to the master page code-behind to detect the source of the POST. Once I have the source of the POST (e.g. the Search box). I would then pass its query to the Search form. I used a similar process with having a HTML login form on the master page. I posted a question and subsequent solution here - check it out: Form Elements in ASP.NET Master Pages and Content Pages Once I got my head round it, it seemed a pretty simple and reasonably elegant solution. The benefit of this is that you have complete control over how the data is sent to the search form. And you don't need to enable transfer of form data to the search form and all that nasty stuff, just create a new GET request to the search page and let it do what it is supposed to do :) Hope this helps. NOTE: You can only have one form with runat="server" on an ASPX page. Additional forms MUST be HTML FORMS .
