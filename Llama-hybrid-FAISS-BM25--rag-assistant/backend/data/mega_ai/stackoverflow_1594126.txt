Using the Jena RDF library, how do I return the property of a URI resource?

I have a Jena URI Resource ( Resource reference to an object where isURIResource() returns true). An example Resource URI is this: http://d.opencalais.com/er/company/ralg-tr1r/4ee13d20-b44f-3bce-98bc-49a303e72db5 If you open that in a web browser, you'll probably be given the HTML representation of the data: http://d.opencalais.com/er/company/ralg-tr1r/4ee13d20-b44f-3bce-98bc-49a303e72db5.html You can change the .html extension to .rdf giving you: http://d.opencalais.com/er/company/ralg-tr1r/4ee13d20-b44f-3bce-98bc-49a303e72db5.rdf This RDF model is formatted as XML. The property I need to retrieve is: MSFT.OQ In summary, I'm looking for a way to use my Jena URI Resource to return the value of c:symbol , which in my example would be MSFT.OQ I'm aware that I could take this URI, GET the RDF representation via some HTTP client, then load and query the model as I'm doing already. What I'm assuming, however, is that Jena offers a more elegant solution to this recurring task.
