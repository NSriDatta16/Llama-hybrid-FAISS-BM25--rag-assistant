Additionally to the major issues described in other answers and comments, the technological limitations of current AI methods are absolutely insufficient for such high level of abstraction in causality reasoning. Let's assume this would be operationalized using on a corpus of scientific articles from various domains (this part is ok) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The state of the art in NLP doesn't even reach satisfying levels of performance in detecting direct causality between two sentences, a task that humans can do quite well. This means that the most basic step required for this problem is not even doable, let alone complex reasoning across different domains.
