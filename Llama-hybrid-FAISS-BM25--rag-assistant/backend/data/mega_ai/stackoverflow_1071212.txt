I read that post from Derek Silvers. There is something weird about it. He tells the tale of a project that got out of control, dragged on for months, and eventually had to be abandoned. He blames this on the Rails framework. Yet he never says what it was about Rails that caused the project to fail. The article would be far more credible if he offered some solid information, but he doesn't mention even one specific place where Rails let him down. The closest he comes is to say that their "needs" (?) clashed with Rails's preferences (which ones? How?) Meanwhile, people all over the world (including myself) are implementing complex Web applications in reasonable amounts of time using Ruby on Rails. Given the lack of detail, or really any specific technical information at all, in Derek's piece, it could easily be that the project failed for any number of reasons having nothing to do with Rails. The original question was "should I heed Derek Silvers' warnings about migrating from PHP to Rails?" My answer would be no, his "warnings" amount to a vague anecdote with zero supporting evidence. It is perfectly safe to ignore them. Should you reimplement a PHP app in Rails? That's another question. There is no blanket answer to that one. It depends entirely on circumstances.
