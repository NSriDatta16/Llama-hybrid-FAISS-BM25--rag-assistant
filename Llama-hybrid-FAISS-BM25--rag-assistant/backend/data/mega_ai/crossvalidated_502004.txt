Differential costs and benefits of class assignments are part of the reason why measures like accuracy are considered poor ways to assess models . If you have a well-calibrated model of class probabilities, the cost issues that you raise in this two-class scenario reduce to a simple choice of a cost-based probability cutoff for class assignment. Let's say the cost of assigning a case to class $i$ when it's actually in class $j$ is $c_{i|j}$ . Thus you can assign costs for correct classifications, and those "costs" could be negative (representing a gain). Start with a simple situation: classes labeled $1$ and $2$ , and no cost for correct classification. (That means values of 0 along the diagonal of your cost matrix.) Say that the estimated probability for assignment of a case with predictor values $x$ to class $1$ is $\hat p_1(x)$ . Then with only $c_{1|2}$ and $c_{2|1}$ to consider as costs, to minimize cost you need to determine which of the expected costs, $c_{2|1}\hat p_1(x) $ or $ c_{1|2}(1-\hat p_1(x))$ is lower. Those costs are equal when: $$ \hat p_1(x) = \frac{c_{1|2}}{c_{1|2}+c_{2|1}},$$ providing a cost-adjusted decision threshold. For the two-class setting and non-zero (potentially negative) costs for correct assignments, the same argument provides a threshold of: $$ \hat p_1(x) = \frac{(c_{1|2}-c_{2|2})}{(c_{1|2}-c_{2|2})+(c_{2|1}-c_{1|1})},$$ Notice that has the same form as for the simpler case without costs for correct classifications. So you can just re-define the misclassification cost as the difference in cost between incorrect and correct class assignment given the true class membership, set the cost of correct classification to 0, and get the same cost-based decision threshold. That's probably why you always see values of 0 along the diagonal of two-class cost matrices; from the decision-threshold perspective, you can always redefine the costs to achieve that. Things are more complicated in multi-class situations, as explained by O'Brien, Gupta and Gray in Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, Helsinki, Finland, 2008 . The above is based on their presentation of the two-class case. On this site you will see much emphasis on well-calibrated models and proper scoring rules instead of the measures that you report for your model. Rather than trying to figure out ways to adjust your measures to represent differential costs and benefits, it's simpler to get the probability model right first and take the costs/benefits into account at the ultimate class-assignment step. That said, there is a whole universe of potential proper scoring rules. If you already have a sense of the relative costs and benefits, you can choose a proper scoring rule that emphasizes probabilities near those of the cutoff you will ultimately use. Yi Shen describes this approach in his 2005 University of Pennsylvania thesis ; this answer discusses that and related approaches like targeted maximum-likelihood.
