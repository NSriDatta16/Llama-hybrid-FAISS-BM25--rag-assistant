Understanding a passage written about an exponential function

I read the following in the book Forecasting, Time Series, and Regression - Fourth Edition by Bowerman - O'Connell - Koehler (P. 296), and it said the following: It can be shown that as the power $λ$ approaches zero, the transformed value $y^λ$ approaches $\ln y$, the natural logarithm of $y$... To the best of my knowledge, when a number is raised to the zero power, it equals $1$, and also the limit equals $1$. Is there any way to explain this passage in the book, or is this an error?
