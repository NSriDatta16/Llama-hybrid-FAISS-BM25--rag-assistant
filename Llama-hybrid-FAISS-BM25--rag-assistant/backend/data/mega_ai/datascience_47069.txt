Service Request classification, questionnaire filling and call logging

I am very new to machine learning. I just went through some of the tutorials in Azure and completed one practice workflow(car price prediction). I hope I can ask basic questions here. Scenario : We get service request from our customers via email. This has fields like customer name, user name, email id, Equipment affected, type of call and Issue experienced(this is a free text area). The employee reads this email, mainly the issue experienced. Based on the issue experienced section, s/he takes the appropriate actions. We will have 4-6 fields(type of request , a few questionnaire etc). The issue experienced is a free text area where customer can write anything about the issue. Does this qualify as a AI model if we have last 2-3 years data. If yes, Is multi class classification the solution? If not, which ML algorithm needs to be used here. Can I rely on Azure for this or do we need to build a new model/algorithm for this? Sorry if it is a too basic question
