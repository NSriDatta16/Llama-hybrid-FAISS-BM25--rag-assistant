The 'naïve mean model' refers to a model where the prediction is just the average of the dependent/target variable for the whole dataset. Think of a regression where the slope is zero and the intercept is just the mean of all the data points - a horizontal line. This very simple reference model is what you compare a more complex model against. The $R^2$ then compares the new model against this simple/naïve reference model. This is why it's possible for a model to have a negative $R^2$ , if it makes predictions that are worse than just predicting the mean (see the linked answer for a good example).
