question about using the polymorphic association in rails

How guys I'm new to rails, here's my code: class Video true end class Drummer :videoable end class Cymbal :videoable end From this point I can use the drummer.videos to get all the video that belong to drummer, But I can't use video.drummer to get who is the video belongs to. of course I can use video.where(:videoable_id => '1', :videoable_type => 'drummer') to get the to find the exact drummer record, but I think there must be a elegant to do that in rails, right? and one more question, I want to improve this association, video and drummer, video and cymbal should be many-to-many, sometime there are more than 1 drummer or 1 cymbal in one video, so it makes sense do it this way. how can I do this?
