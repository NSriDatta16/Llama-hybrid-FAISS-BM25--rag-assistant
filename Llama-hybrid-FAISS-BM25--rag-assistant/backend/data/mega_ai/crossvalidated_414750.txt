You've done what I think most people would suggest doing. That you have a small sample size is not really something you need to combat; you can either adequately power your experiments or you can deal with the consequences (unless you are prepared to take a Bayesian approach). Anything else is, in my opinion, fishing for a rejection of the null on shakey ground.
