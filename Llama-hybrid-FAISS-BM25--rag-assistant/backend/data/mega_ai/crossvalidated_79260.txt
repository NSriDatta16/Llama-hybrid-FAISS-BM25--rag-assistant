As written, your question can't work, since y is a 0-1 variable and you're doing logistic regression. If you mean that the linear predictor had a nonlinear relationship with one of the independent variables, that is, $\eta = a + bf(x)$, say, for some nonlinear $f$ (with all other variables held constant), then you can write $x^* = f(x)$ and put $x^*$ in your logistic regression as an independent variable. [In a logistic regression, $\eta = \text{logit}(P[Y=1])$] This is quite commonly done in linear models and generalized linear models; there's a linear relationship, but it's with a transformed independent variable. Under the usual assumptions you need for a GLM, the transformed variable works perfectly well as a predictor. Note that if $f$ is known and that coefficient, $b$ is known, you don't put $x^*$ in as a predictor, because $x^{**} = bf(x)$ is then an alternative predictor with coefficient 1; those come in as offsets (e.g. specified in R by using the offset argument). (In ordinary regression you could let $y^* = y-x^{**}$ instead, for the same effect.) I will assume the coefficient of $f$ is unknown (though you specified it to be 1). In your particular case $x^* = f(x) = (x-4)^2$. If you were unsure about the "4" there (e.g. if it's just a rough guess or something, rather than a value that's definitely known), then you could instead use two new variables, $x^*_l = x-4$ and $x^*_q = (x-4)^2$ both as predictors, which will capture a general quadratic relationship (with the additional benefit that if the '4' is nearly right, the estimates be nearly uncorrelated with each other and with the intercept.
