In the framework of Transferable Belief Model (TBM) , it is possible to combine different predictions using for instance the "conjunctive rule of combination". In order to apply this rule, you need to transform the probabilities of the predictions into basic belief assignments. This can be achieved with the so-called Least-Committed-Principle. In R: library(ibelief) #probabilities p1 For the second example of three independent predictions of 0.75, this approach returns a higher value: p4 This is not very far from the Bayesian approach shown in Arthur B's answer.
