Estimating Multilevel Logistic Regression Models

The following multilevel logistic model with one explanatory variable at level 1 (individual level) and one explanatory variable at level 2 (group level) : $$\text{logit}(p_{ij})=\pi_{0j}+\pi_{1j}x_{ij}\ldots (1)$$ $$\pi_{0j}=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}z_j+u_{0j}\ldots (2)$$ $$\pi_{1j}=\gamma_{10}+\gamma_{11}z_j+u_{1j}\ldots (3)$$ where , the group-level residuals $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$ are assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution with expectation zero . The variance of the residual errors $u_{0j}$ is specified as $\sigma^2_0$ , and the variance of the residual errors $u_{1j}$ is specified as $\sigma^2_1$ . I want to estimate the parameter of the model and I like to use R command glmmPQL . Substituting equation (2) and (3) in equation (1) yields , $$\text{logit}(p_{ij})=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{10}x_{ij}+\gamma_{01}z_j+\gamma_{11}x_{ij}z_j+u_{0j}+u_{1j}x_{ij}\ldots (4)$$ There are 30 groups$(j=1,...,30)$ and 5 individual in each group .

Also p-value of group-level variable $(Z)$ and cross-level interaction $(X:Z)$ shows they are not significant . Still why in this article , they keep the group-level variable $(Z)$ and cross-level interaction $(X:Z)$ for further analysis ? Also How are the degrees of freedom DF being calculated ? It doesn't match with the relative bias of the various estimates of the table . I tried to calculate the relative bias as : #Estimated Fixed Effect parameters : hat_g_00 Why doesn't the relative bias match with the table ?
