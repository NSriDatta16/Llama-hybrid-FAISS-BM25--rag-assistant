Try running pylint with pylint --ignored-classes=Tags If that works, add all the other Django classes - possibly using a script, in say, python :P The documentation for --ignore-classes is: --ignored-classes= List of classes names for which member attributes should not be checked (useful for classes with attributes dynamicaly set). [current: %default] I should add this is not a particular elegant solution in my view, but it should work.
