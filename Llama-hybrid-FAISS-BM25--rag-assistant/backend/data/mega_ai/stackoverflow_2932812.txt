That looks like a regular expression match. The (.+) parts are 'wildcard' captures. This can be run against a string and the necessary information can be extracted. In most cases this string is language independent. Just a few notes: /si at the end means 'case insensitve' and '. match all' (means . will match everything including \n (which it normally does not)) The captures ( (.+) ) can be referenced after matching as $# in your average regex enabled language (where # is the order the (.+) appears in your regex string. EDIT: You've updated your question so as an example, the section Name:(.+)Company:(.+) will match Name:Some random set of characters Company: Some more random characters where 'Some random set of characters' and 'Some more random characters' are extracted into variables $1 and $2 (because they are first and second in the order in your regex).
