Mean of skew normal distribution with normal prior obtained with Gibbs sampling

I would like to obtain a new mean $\mu$ of a skew normal distribution with a normal prior of the form $N(\delta,\tau)$ on $\mu$ , and a given standard deviation $\sigma$ and shape parameter $\alpha$ . For this end, I am trying to implement a Gibbs sampler described in Kim 2005: Bayesian estimation for skew normal distributions using data augmentation . Let $x$ be the mean of the original skew normal distribution: $x$ ~ $SN(\mu,\sigma,\alpha)$ $\mu$ ~ $N(\delta,\tau)$ The approach by Kim (2005) uses the auxiliary variables $z$ and $y$ to obtain $\mu$ , conditional on $\sigma$ , $\rho$ , $x$ and $y$ with a Gibbs sampler: $z = (x-\mu)/\sigma$ $y$ ~ $N(\rho z , \sqrt{1-\rho^2)}$ with $\rho = \alpha/\sqrt {1+a^2}$ and $\mu$ ~ $N(\frac{\tau^2 (x-\sigma \rho y)+\sigma^2 (1-\rho^2) \delta}{\tau^2 + \sigma^2 (1-\rho^2)}, \sqrt{\frac{\tau^2 \sigma^2 (1-\rho^2)}{\tau^2 + \sigma^2 (1-\rho^2)})}$ (I use only a single value of $x$ , i.e. the mean, rather than samples from the skew normal distribution, hence I set all the $n$ for the sample size to $1$ .) As an example, let's set $x = 4$ , $\sigma = 2$ , $\alpha = -5$ $\delta = 1$ , $\tau = 2$ In R code, this looks like this: # Data x = 4 sigma = 2 alpha = -5 # transform alpha rho = alpha/sqrt(1+alpha^2) # Prior parameters delta = 1 tau = 2 # prepare Gibbs sampling N = 10000 # number of iterations mu The result of this analysis is not what I would expect. The posterior of $\mu$ seems to be pushed away from the prior ( $\bar{\mu} = 4.6$ ): When the sign of $\alpha$ is reversed ( $\alpha = 5$ ), the posterior of $\mu$ has a larger variance and seems to match the prior more than the data ( $\bar{\mu} = 2.1$ ): When I set $\alpha = 0$ , the posterior of $\mu$ looks as it should be, right between the prior and the data ( $\bar{\mu} = 2.5$ ): I'm failing to understand what is going wrong in the cases where $\alpha \neq 0$ , and I'd appreciate any help!
