How to calculate the average age of a subgroup

Just to confirm my findings to a group of data scientists... I have a data set with patients visits and among others the death age of deceased patients. If I then look up all diagnoses the patients had had and count the average death age X of patients with a certain diagnose (if a patient had diagnose A, his death age will be in the calculation for the average death age of patients with diagnose A, if he also had diagnose B, he will be in calculation of average death age of diag B as well, and so on...), Is it (Isn't it?) ok to say that "patients with diagnose A died on average at age X"? The data quality is high, and the data set is complete, including all patient data for patients in a certain hospital district and with these diagnoses. On general level (for common diagnoses) the average death age corresponds to the average death age of the population. It is just the death ages of certain diagnoses and patient groups ("if they also had diagnose C and/or D") are puzzling the audience and so I would need some conforming on this or ideas on how to estimate the average age if this is not the right way. For some groups the number of patients in a subset is very low but the "death ages" are still in line with bigger subgroups of the same diagnose. All ideas appreciated.
