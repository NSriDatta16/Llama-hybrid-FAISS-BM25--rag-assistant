Dummy variables in logistic regression

I'm running a logistic regression for an alumni population to indicate what factors relate to odds of giving. For gender I have a variable that I coded (1,0) so it's binary. If I want to include degrees (i.e. BA, BS, MBA, and PHD) do I create 4 binary variables so that if someone has a BA then they would have 1 in the BA column but 0 for BS, MBA, and PHD? I just want to take sure I code it correctly. Thank you!
