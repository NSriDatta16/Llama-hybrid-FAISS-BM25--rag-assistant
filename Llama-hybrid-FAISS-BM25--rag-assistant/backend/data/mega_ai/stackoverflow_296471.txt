I believe Flash Player 10 will natively let you select the ibar, drag hand, finger or normal cursors, but if you're in Flash 9 this isn't possible and I don't believe a CSS hack will work either. My advice is - use the MOUSE_MOVE event to position a graphic and set the frame rate as high as possible (e.g. 50 frames per second).
