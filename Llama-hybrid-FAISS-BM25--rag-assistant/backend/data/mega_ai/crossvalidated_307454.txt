In my point of view, multicollinearity is a problem if a vif value is bigger 10. But, if you think there is a problem, you should delete one of the variables with the high vif values and calculate the regression again. Perhaps, you find just one variable that is responsible for the high vif values. Then you should delete this variable. Otherwise, with pca you cannot interpret the parameters and you will lose information as well.
