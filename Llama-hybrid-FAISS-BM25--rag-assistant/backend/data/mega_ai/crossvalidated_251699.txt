Is a RV(1) a markov chain?

Consider the process $X_1$, $X_2$,... defined by $X_n=\alpha\ X_{n-1}+\epsilon_n$ where $\epsilon_i$ is independent random variable for all $i$ , $X_0=0$ and $\alpha$ is a constant. Does this process satisfy the Markov property? \ I said yes, because according to its definition, next value of the process only depends on the current value. However, I am not sure that whether it is necessary for $\epsilon_i$'s to be i.i.d or not. Any help would be appreciated.
