The natural approach is to look at the likelihood of your data , instead of fishing for estimates outside a proper model. Hence, you should derive the probability distribution of the variable $X=Y+Z$, which has the density $$f_X(x)=\int f_Y(y) f_Z(x-y)\,\text{d}y$$ and proceed from there by maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In case the integral does not allow for a closed form resolution, which seems very likely, you can resort to the EM algorithm, again naturally because of the missing variable aspect of your problem. If EM is similarly intractable, Bayesian analysis with MCMC algorithms may be the only solution based on the likelihood.
