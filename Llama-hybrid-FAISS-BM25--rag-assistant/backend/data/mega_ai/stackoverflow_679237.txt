I haven't used FT, but in doing queries on varchar columns, and looking for surnames such as O'Reilly, I've used: surname like Replace( @search, '''', '') + '%' or Replace( surname,'''','') like @search + '%' This allows for the apostrophe to be in either the database value or the search term. It's also obviously going to perform like a dog with a large table. The alternative (also not a good one probably) would be to save a 2nd copy of the data, stripped of non-alpha characters, and search (also?) against that copy. So there original would contain Lia's and the 2nd copy Lias. Doubling the amount of storage, etc.
