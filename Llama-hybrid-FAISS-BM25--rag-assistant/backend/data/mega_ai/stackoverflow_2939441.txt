By default, Firebug only show you part of the story. To see what really happens when you change margin-top: 0; for margin: 0 0 0 0; , please click on the arrow right to the Style tab (above ' header p ' on your snapshot) and select "Display default CSS properties" or sth like that and you'll see downward that html.css already styles p as: p { display: block; margin: 1em 0; } Beware, do NOT modify system styles or you'll have to restart Firefox, reopening tabs won't be sufficient. BTW this 1em margin is what you see in HTML without any style (menu Display / Page style / No style in Firefox or CSS menu of Web Developer Toolbar ) : your paragraphs have some vertical margin. So basically you erased a 1em bottom margin.
