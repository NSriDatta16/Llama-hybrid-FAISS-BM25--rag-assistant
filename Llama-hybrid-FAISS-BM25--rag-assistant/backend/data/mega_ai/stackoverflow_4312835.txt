Note the cash parameter is of type double and the .## at the end of the formatted string for cents. EDIT Here is the code in its entirety: static class Program { static void Main() { double d = 123456789.7845; string s = addCommas(d); System.Console.WriteLine(s); } public static string addCommas(double cash) { return string.Format("${0:#,###0.##}", cash); } } This prints "$123,456,789.78" to console. If you're getting error CS1502: The best overloaded method match for 'addCommas(double)' has some invalid arguments check to make sure that you're calling the function properly and that you're actually passing in the correct data type. I encourage you to copy/paste the code I have above and run it - BY ITSELF.
