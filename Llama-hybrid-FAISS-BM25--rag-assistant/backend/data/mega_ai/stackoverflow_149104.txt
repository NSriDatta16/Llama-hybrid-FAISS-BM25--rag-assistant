Yes, you can give "hints" with the query to Oracle. These hints are disguised as comments ("/* HINT */") to the database and are mainly vendor specific. So one hint for one database will not work on an other database. I would use index hints here, the first hint for the small table. See here . On the other hand, if you often search over these two fields, why not create an index on these two? I do not have the right syntax, but it would be something like CREATE INDEX IX_BAR_AND_FOO on sometable(bar,foo); This way data retrieval should be pretty fast. And in case the concatenation is unique hten you simply create a unique index which should be lightning fast.
