How To Stop Tomcat/Java Wrapping My Output

I've got a JSP page that I want to return a fragment of HTML. The trouble is that whenever I request the JSP, something is attempting to make the HTML more valid by wrapping tags around it. I don't want it to do this though as it will be used in a variety of other places. For an example, the following JSP: Wibble Will result in the following HTML: Wibble I really don't want those & tags there and would like to get rid of them but have no idea where this is happening to turn it off. Does anyone have any clues? * Edit * To give a little more information on what I am trying to achieve. This JSP will check a variety of things and form a piece of HTML. This HTML can then be included into other applications via a web service call.
