Your 7 data sets fall naturally into 3 distinct groups: {tweet vol, sentiment+, sentiment_neut, sentiment-}, {stock_vol}, {stock_buy, stock_sell} and, as you want to evaluate stock performance, this means you do need stock price vs. time. However stock buy price & stock sell price differ only by the bid-ask spread which is usually very small for stocks that trade with significant volume. If you use last-traded price, which is usually be the average of the buy & sell prices and if you are mainly interested in day-to-day changes then you can use % change in price = 100.0*(last traded price / yesterday's price -1.0) to remove the problem of differing price scales for each particular stock that you are looking at. You can also do the same with % stock trading volume change from day-to-day. If you are intending to use this to assist you in actual stock trading, then what you need to see is stock price starting to rise on rising stock volume. You might like to consider displaying the correlation coefficient between the net positive social media data (indicators) and price. If you do plan to start stock trading then try reading some of the excellent books on the topic by Van Tharp to help you avoid losing money while you build up your trading experience.
