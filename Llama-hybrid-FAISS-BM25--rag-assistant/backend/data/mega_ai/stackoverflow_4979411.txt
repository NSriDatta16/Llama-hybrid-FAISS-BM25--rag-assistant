There are two ways to achieve what you want. Both start from adding new item to your project. In the "Add new item" window select "ADO.NET Entity Data Model". There you will have two options. One to generate your model from existing database and second to create model manualy in designer. If you choose first one you can simply drag and drop tables from server explorer to design surface and all your entities and their relations will be generated for you automaticaly. Also you can modify that generated model later.
