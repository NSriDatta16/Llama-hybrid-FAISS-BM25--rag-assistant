binary and multiclass classifiers

I have a simple yes/no problem so I was naturally inclined towards using a binary classifier because I was reading the book, A Course in Machine Learning by Hal Daum√© III and I quote from it: [ Binary Classification: trying to predict a simple yes/no response. For instance, predict whether Alice will enjoy a course or not. Or predict whether a user review of the newest Apple product is positive or negative about the product. Multiclass Classification: trying to put an example into one of a number of classes . For instance, predict whether a news story is about entertainment, sports, politics, religion, etc. Or predict whether a CS course is Systems, Theory, AI or Other. ] But then my professor told me to try using naive Bayes and KNN for my problem which (according to the image I've attached below) are multiclass classifiers . So can it be beneficial to use multiclass classifiers for a simple binary problem? I'm probably going to try a lot of classifiers to get the best accuracy but before going straight into practical tests I wanted to get some advice because due to the abundance of classifiers I'll have to pick a few(and choose the one providing the best results) and that choice must be based on a certain reasoning.
