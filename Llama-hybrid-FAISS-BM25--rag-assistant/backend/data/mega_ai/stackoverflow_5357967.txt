Payment method input boxes disabled by default - interesting Javascript incompatibility

This bit of code is in Magento's default theme for onepagecheckout - upon load it calls payment.init() which is an object literal function: init : function () { var elements = Form.getElements(this.form); var method = null; for (var i=0; i For some reason, in IE9 only, it seems that the input boxes in the payment form default to "disabled=true"... is there a better way to accomplish this? IE9 is the only one that misbehaves here... Update: My temporary fix has been to disable this call altogether. We do not require hidden fields to be disabled. Is this a requirement to maintain compatibility?
