Iphone, for regularly updated data is NSUserDefaults still the easiest option?

I have been designing my app to store local user data which is changed / sorted and referenced regularly to be stored as global variables held by the app delegate and referenced through: appDelegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]delegate] Which seems to work though is most likely not best practice, is there any downsides to just holding the same data in NSUserDefaults, SQL Lite seems a bit heavy for my needs considering the data itself is a couple of small arrays of custom objects and is refreshed on start up and throughout the app. Is there a general best practice for local storage, or does it really depend?
