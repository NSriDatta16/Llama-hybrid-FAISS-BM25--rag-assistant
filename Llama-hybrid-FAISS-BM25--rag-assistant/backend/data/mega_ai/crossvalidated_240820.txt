Are Neural Nets viable to extract Date patterns in a text

I was just wondering, Is there any possibility that we train neural networks (may be LSTM / RNN ) on different formats of dates (with multiple examples in each format to expand its learning) and then ask the neural net to extract a close match of date in a RAW TEXT ? All I need is a Machine learning algorithm to do pattern matching instead of using regex . Can this be implemented? If so, Please provide me an idea of implementation or any already working solution ( Python / R ) is also fine. Update: Added my problem statement for better understanding My Input text file (input.txt) with different formats of dates (Say, I have some thousands of examples for each format) will be as following: (Say, I will only be expecting these formats of data in the raw file) 13/08/1993 23/09/2016 24/12/1992 ... 13-08-1993 23-09-2016 24-12-1992 ... 13-Sep-1993 23-Sep-2016 24-Dec-1992 ... Some other formats An Example RAW TEXT file is given below: (It is just a OCR Extracted info from a receipt) ROCKET MEALS 23/09/2015 RECEIPT ID: #294055 Shop: #1 ITEM QTY PRICE French Fries 33.26 Coca Cola 22.4 SUB TOTAL: 95.66 Tax: + 6.45 TOTAL: 102. 1 THANK YOU - VISIT AGAIN Expected Output: 23/09/2015 PS: I have already used regex for this but, actually I am curious to know how to train such a network and how it understands the patterns?
