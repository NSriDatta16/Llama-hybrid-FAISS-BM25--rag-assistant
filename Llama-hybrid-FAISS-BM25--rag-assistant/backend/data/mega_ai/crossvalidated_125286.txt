While this question/answer has been out there for a bit, I hought it might be helpful to clarify a few points in the answer. First, the phrase raised as a major distinction between hierarchical methods and deep neural networks 'This network is fixed.' is incorrect. Hierarchical methods are no more 'fixed' than the alternative, neural networks. See, for example, the paper Deep Learning with Hierarchical Convolutional Factor Analysis, Chen et. al. . I think you will also find that the requirement to define interactions is also no longer a distinguishing point. A couple of points that are not listed as a plus with the hierarchical modeling is, from my experience, the significantly reduced problem of overfitting and the ability to handle both very large and very small training sets. A nitpick point is that when Bayesian hierarchical methods are used, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are generally not statistical methods that would be applied.
