Well, there are some caveats dealing with things like exceptions and floating point numbers, but llvm can output C (though no one uses it in production so it often lags the main release). That means any LLVM based language that can be statically compiled can output to C, including all llvm-gcc frontends: C++ (llvm-gcc/ DragonEgg and Comeau ) Fortan (llvm-gcc/ DragonEgg ) Ada (llvmgcc) Ruby ( MacRuby ) D ( LDC ) Lua ( LLVM-Lua ) PHP ( Roadsend PHP ) Not all of these have necessarily been tested, and may require some tweaking to make work, but they should all work without too much trouble.
