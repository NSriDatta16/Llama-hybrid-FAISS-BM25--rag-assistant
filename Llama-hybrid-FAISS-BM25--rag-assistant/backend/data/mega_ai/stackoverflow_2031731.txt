Ok, technically the only proper way is to hack .Net and use reflection to call it's private constructor... see http://bart-at-work.blogspot.com/2008/11/create-cssstylecollection-instance.html Well, I figure that a CssStyleCollection doesn't have anything too special in it, so what I did was a simple yet elegant hack without reflection. CssStyleCollection Style=new Panel().Style; I'm not sure how "safe" it is, but it works on .Net and Mono, so it's good enough for me.
