Question about random variables and the distribution of the sample mean

I'm new to statistics. I am so confused as to why the Xbar (the random variable describing the sample mean) can be found by taking the average of all the X's. From what I understand the capital X's represent random variables. Random variables don't represent numbers, e.g. X1 â‰  5 or whatever. When I see a random variable, I just think: probability distribution. But how could you possibly add probability distributions together?! I would prefer if you gave the most simple answers as possible . Thank you!
