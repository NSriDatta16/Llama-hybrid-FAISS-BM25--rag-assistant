UTF-8 includes all characters from your French and Italian code page, but the language specific code pages does not include all of each others characters. So you can take input from each language and convert it to UTF-8 for storage, but you can not be certain that you will get the right characters if you take Italian input and show it as French. Use UTF-8 all the way if you can.
