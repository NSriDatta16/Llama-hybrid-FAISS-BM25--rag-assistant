Will embedding an advertisement slow down my website?

I've worked with a dozen advertisement networks and this is how they all want you to embed an ad on your website. The rest of my site Some of my personal code waits on the DOMContentLoaded event and some waits on the window.onLoad event. If these events get delayed because of the ad, my site will appear slow to the user. As the HTML is being parsed, does DOM construction halt as it hits the tag? Will the browser wait while ad.js is being loaded before continuing to construct the DOM? If so, DOMContentLoaded will be delayed. The ad inserts images at the location of the script tag. If the images take a long time to load, will window.onLoad be delayed? Is window.onLoad only delayed by static images already engrained in my HTML or is it also delayed by dynamic images inserted by the script tag?
