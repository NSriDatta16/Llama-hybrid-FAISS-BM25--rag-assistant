Multinomial Logistic Regression: small groups

I am implementing a Multinomial Logistic Regression, but I am encountering the possible issue of having very small groups when I create a frequency table of the dependent variable Y and one of the independent variables X (see table). Would this affect my results in a problematic way? Or should I for example just exclude this variable X in my regression (and with that ignore that these 2 variables seem to "correlate" to some extent)? -------- y0 --- y1 x0: --- 180 --- 2 x1: --- 50 --- 2 x2: --- 300 --- 4 x3: --- 50 --- 350 x4: --- 50 --- 20
