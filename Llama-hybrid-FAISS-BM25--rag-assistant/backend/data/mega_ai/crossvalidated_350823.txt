I would consider updating #5, as quantifiable metrics are not necessarily easy to optimize. For instance, directly optimizing 0-1 loss is NP-hard . So #5 could instead say: The metric we would like our model to optimize is quantifiable and is feasibly solvable (or has an appropriate surrogate). Other than that, your list looks pretty good to me. I wish more people would sit down and have this conversation before applying machine learning to a problem!
