Java User Interface Framework?

I am about to build a UI in Java and I am trying to determine what I should use. I definitely don't want to use vanilla swing. The one caveat is that it has to be added inside of an existing swing application. I am looking at JavaFX and Groovy Swing Builder. For the former it looks like there is fairly poor support for embedding into swing. Anyone have another other suggestions?
