Pytorch testing/validation accuracy over 100%

So I was training my CNN for some hours when it reached 99% accuracy (which was a little bit too good, I thought). But then it didnÂ´t stop and it went higher than 100%. So I thought, that must be because I messed something up in the accuracy calculater function, but I didnt find the mistake. Can somebody tell me if something is wrong here? def accuracy(model, dataset): # set .eval() to ignore dropout model = model.eval() accuracy = 0 total = 0 correct = 0 for _, data in enumerate(dataset): samples, targets = data samples = samples.float().cuda() targets = targets.float().cuda() predictions = model(samples) total += targets.size(0) correct += predictions.eq(targets.data).sum().item() accuracy = 100 * correct/total return accuracy Arguments: the model, and the dataset (for example the validation set or the testing set) Thanks for your help :)
