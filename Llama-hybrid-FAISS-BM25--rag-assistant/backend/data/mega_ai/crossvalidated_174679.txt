Looking at the follow-up paper ( http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gdahl/papers/cnnHFReLU_ASRU2013.pdf ) it seems they're referring to the number of feature maps (see beginning of chapter 2). That is, they have 2 convolutional layers, the first one having 128 feature maps and the second 256. Assuming this is correct, it'd be interesting to know if this usage of terminology (using "hidden units" to refer to feature map) is commonplace, as I'm not qualified to comment on that.
