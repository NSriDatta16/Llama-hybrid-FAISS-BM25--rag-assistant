Bear in mind that unless your code is measured down to the cycle, not each game loop will take the same number of milliseconds to complete - so 16.6666 being irrational is not an issue really as you will need to time and compensate anyway. Besides it's not 16.6666 updates per second, but the average number of milliseconds your game loop should be targeting.
