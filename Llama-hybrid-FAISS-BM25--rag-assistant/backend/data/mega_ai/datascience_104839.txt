Without labeled data, it is not possible to estimate how many False Alarms (false positives) or Missed Detections (false negatives) an anomaly detection system will have. What one can do is to set a decision threshold based on how many positives (regardless of true or false) one accepts to have. That number needs to be determined based on your business circumstances. For example: You have 1000 potential fraud cases coming in for review per day, 1 hour to review the suspect cases, and spend 0.1 hours on average per case. Then one has a capacity to review 10 cases, or 1% of the total. Then set the anomaly score threshold to the 99% percentile, expecting to accept around 1%.
