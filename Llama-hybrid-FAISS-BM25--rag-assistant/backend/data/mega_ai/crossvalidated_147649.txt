Site 6 is the intercept. In effect, your model states that the log odds of "referred" is some constant plus a site effect. You have told SPSS that site 6 is the baseline, which means that site 6 is rolled into the intercept. The parameters for the other sites reflect how the response changes in comparison to what happens at site 6. It would be nice to have an intercept term, representing the average response in some sense, and then parameters for each site ... however in such a model the 6 site effects would have to sum to the intercept term, making the design matrix singular. You would have one more parameter than your model strictly needs and the computer "will encounter a problem" when it attempts to estimate the parameters. To get around this technical difficulty, one chooses "reference levels" --- i.e., you fix one parameter to be 0, leaving you with 6 parameters to be estimated from the data. Other parametrizations are possible, but not, I think, in SPSS. I don't know why SPSS is giving you numbers in the output. Did you code Site as a numeric with associated labels in the "Values" column? If so, you should get the label names on the output. And these names should orient you when you change the reference value to Site 1.
