How to calculate joint probabilities from conditional probabilities in a Bayesian Network?

This question is about Bayesian Networks. I want to calculate the probability for certain events to be in a certain state knowing all conditional probabilities. Consider that I am totally new to Bayesian Networks. The problem Consider a Bayesian Network. For all variables $A_i,B_i \dots Z_i$ in the network I know the potentials in the form $P\{ A_i | par(A_i) \}=P\{A_i | B_1 \dots B_n\}$ for all possible states $a_i,b_1 \dots b_n$ . These potentials are calculated using subjective probabilities. Calculating single probabilities What I know are just potentials. For example, for variable $A_i$ I do not know $P\{A_i = a_i\}$ but I know $P\{A_i = a_i | B_1=b_1 \dots B_n=b_n\}$ . Where $B_1, B_2 \dots B_n$ are parents of $A_i$ . I want to calculate $P\{A_i = a_i\}$ . Consider that No restrictions are considered so this variable $A_i$ can have parents and children. As well as $B_1 \dots B_n$ . It does not seem too complicated. Having potentials I can use the total probability law and: $$P\{ A_i = a_i \} = \sum_{\forall b_1 \dots b_n} P\{ A_i = a_i | B_1=b_1 \dots B_n=b_n \} \cdot P\{B_1=b_1 \dots B_n=b_n \}$$ In the sum, the first part: $P\{ A_i = a_i | B_1=b_1 \dots B_n=b_n \}$ can be calculated using potentials. What about $P\{B_1=b_1 \dots B_n=b_n \}$ . That is, How can I calculate the probability that some variables have some state contemporarly? Please note that $B_1 \dots B_n$ are not one parent of the other, they are on the same level of the network, they are peers, meaning they have no parent relationship. They are parents of $A_i$ . The question Generally speaking, how to calculate the probability that some variables are in some state contemporarly? When they have no parent relationships? Preconditions are: I know the conditional probabilites (potentials).
