Not directly; the structure of a session is very limited, though you can store quite a bit of data within the session. Symfony just stores the session data as a blob in the db. You could try modifying the sfMySQLSessionStorage class to include the $_SERVER['REMOTE_IP'] in the session table if you really need it.
