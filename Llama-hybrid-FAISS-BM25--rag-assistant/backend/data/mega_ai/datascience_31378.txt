I found my error. My early calculations only involved one hidden layer, however, I did not include the derivatives of previous weights when calculating the hidden_error. This means that in the scenario of a neural network of: Input -> H1 -> H2 -> Output to calculate the backpropagation of the last step (Input Output) and weights_hidden_to_hidden (H1 -> H2).
