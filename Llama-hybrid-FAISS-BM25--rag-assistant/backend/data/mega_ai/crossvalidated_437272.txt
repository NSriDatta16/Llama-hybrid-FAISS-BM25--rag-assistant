Accounting for different factors during construction of hypotheses

I am a beginner in statistics (we are using statistics in a Data Science introduction course) We are learning about hypothesis testing and we have been asked to write Python code to perform hypothesis testing on any column of a given dataset. My dataset consists of 592 places (which would be the rows) and I want to perform hypothesis testing on one of the columns containing values of the literacy rate in those 592 places. I want to compare the mean of the current year's literacy rate with the previous years. According to the internet, the literacy rate for the previous year is 58.6%. I have normalized and standardized the values in the Literacy Rate column. I want my hypotheses to be: $\qquad H_0: μ_X \geq 58.6$ $\qquad H_1: μ_Y I want to use z-test to test this hypothesis. Now I have a few doubts: Should I take a sample out of the 592 values? And obtain mean and standard deviation of that sample to use in my z test? Since my values have been normalized and standardized, the values in my column have been re-scaled. Now according to my textbook, we need the mean and standard deviation to obtain the z score which in turn is used to obtain p-value. To obtain the z score I will be using the following formula: $\qquad z = (X−56.8)/\text{Std Dev}$ But it seems wrong to subtract it with a value like 56.8 while my mean values might be different due to the normalization and standardization. Should I actually use normalized and standardized values to perform a Hypothesis Test? The above question leads to another doubt. Am I using the value 58.6 in the right manner? My thought process seems fine to me, based on the examples given in my textbook. But please tell me what is off about this testing. I am relatively new to this and they have tried to stuff a lot into a 4 month course which has made further exploration of the topic quite difficult. I understand if it sounds like a basic question or that I haven't done my research but most of the websites talk about the decision making part rather than the construction of the hypotheses itself.
