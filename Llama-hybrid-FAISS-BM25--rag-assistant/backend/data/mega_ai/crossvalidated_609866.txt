First, from the perspective of education, PCA is a good entryway to the world of dimension-reduction techniques and associated methods. Whether we're talking ICA, non-negative matrix factorization, confirmatory factor analysis, partial-least squares, canonical correlation analysis... (you get the idea), understanding PCA gets you halfway there. From a practical standpoint, there are lots of times when PCA can be sensibly used to combine variables - I think the other answers give good examples. Now, I think what your question is really getting at is - what's the point of a naive application of PCA? What's the point of throwing PCA at a long list of variables and getting back a handful of components? Well, it's quite useful if all you care about is model prediction, and it's also quite handy when you have a lot of highly correlated variables in your data set. PCA is also very useful if you want to understand the structure of your data - for example running PCA on genetic data (millions of variables) tells you about broad trends in ancestry in your data set.
