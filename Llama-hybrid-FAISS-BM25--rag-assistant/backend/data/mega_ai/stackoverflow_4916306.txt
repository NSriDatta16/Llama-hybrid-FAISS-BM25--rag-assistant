I've just stumbled on this problem with IE8. Can't waste time figuring it out right now, but setting the window's PreviewDragEnter and PreviewDragOver to the following handler seems to work around the "Not Allowed" cursor part of it at the moment: private void Window_PreviewDragEnterAndOver ( object sender , DragEventArgs e ) { e.Effects = DragDropEffects.Link; e.Handled = true; }
