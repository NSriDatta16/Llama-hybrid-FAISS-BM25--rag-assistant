I guess the problem is that queue is made using a linked-list, and all the pointers must be saved in the heap. I don't think so. I think that the real problem is the mismatch between the rate at which your system gets input and the rate that it can process it. Unless you can process at at least the average input rate, you will eventually run out of memory, no matter how you represent the queue. You must either improve the processing rate, reduce the input rate or ... drop data.
