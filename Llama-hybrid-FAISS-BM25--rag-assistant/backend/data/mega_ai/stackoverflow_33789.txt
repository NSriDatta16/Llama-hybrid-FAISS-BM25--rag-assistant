Xcode uses template files for file and project templates and does variable expansion in both at creation time. Xcode 3.0 templates can be found in [Dev Installation]/Library/Xcode/, likely /Developer/Library/Xcode. If you want to modify these templates or add your own, use the following directories to save your new/modified templates so that they are not wiped out by future Developer Tool upgrades: File templates: ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File Templates/ Target templates: ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Target Templates/ Project templates: ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates/ I think that you can also use the /Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/[File|Target|Project] Templates/ directory for templates shared by all users. If you just want to change the MyCompanyName in the templates, the following command line will do the trick: defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions '{ "ORGANIZATIONNAME" = "NewCompanyName";}' A good tutorial on writing file templates is here [MacResearch.org].
