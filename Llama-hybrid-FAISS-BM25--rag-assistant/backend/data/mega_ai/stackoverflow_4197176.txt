Matching x words in brackets regex

I am trying to remove brackets from a string if it contains 4 or more words. I have been scratching my head and cannot get anywhere with it. preg_replace('#\([word]{4,}\)#', '', $str); # pseudo code Sample string: Robert Alner Fund Standard Open NH Flat Race (Supported by The Andrew Stewart Charitable Foundation) To match (more than x words in brackets) and remove: (Supported by The Andrew Stewart Charitable Foundation) I have two sources of data, and am using: similar_text($str1, $str2, &$percent) to compare and longish strings in brackets are unique to one source.
