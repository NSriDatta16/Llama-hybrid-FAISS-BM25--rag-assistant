Heap fragmentation is just as much of an issue under 64 bit as under 32 bit. If you make lots of requests with varying lifetimes, then you are going to get a fragmented heap. Unfortunately, 64 bit operating systems don't really help with this, as they still can't really shuffle the small bits of free memory around to make larger contiguous blocks. If you want to deal with heap fragmentation, you still have to use the same old tricks. The only way that a 64 bit OS could help here is if there is some amount of memory that is 'large enough' that you would never fragment it.
