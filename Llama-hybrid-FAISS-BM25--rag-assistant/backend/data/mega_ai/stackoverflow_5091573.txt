taskdef class com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport cannot be found Following "The java web services tutorial"

I saw the same issue in many different locations and even after a good portion of googling, I could not resolve it. What I am trying to do (the bigger picture) is to go through The java web services tutorial , which seems at points out of sync, Specially here , when I try to compile, I get the following message: C:\javaeetutorial5\examples\jaxws\common\targets.xml:26: taskdef class com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport cannot be found I have tried many different combinations of placing jars or changing environment variables, but with no result. Any successful stories? The full build error message is the following: BUILD FAILED C:\javaeetutorial5\examples\jaxws\helloservice\build.xml:4: The following error occurred while executing this line: C:\javaeetutorial5\examples\jaxws\common\targets.xml:26: taskdef A class needed by class com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport cannot be found: org/apache/tools/ant/DynamicConfigurator using the classloader AntClassLoader[C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\lib\tools.jar] Total time: 0 seconds And the corresponding taskdef : Also a peek into the endorsement directory: C:\javaeetutorial5\kschneid>cd %JAVA_HOME% C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_23>dir lib\endorsed Volume in drive C is OSDisk Volume Serial Number is AAAA-BBBB Directory of C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\lib\endorsed 25/02/2011 09:34 . 25/02/2011 09:34 .. 25/02/2011 09:34 105,134 jaxb-api.jar 25/02/2011 09:33 54,476 jaxws-api.jar 2 File(s) 159,610 bytes 2 Dir(s) 110,907,056,128 bytes free C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_23>
