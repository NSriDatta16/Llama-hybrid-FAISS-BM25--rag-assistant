I suggest using auto.arima if you are new to ARIMA. I use it and I have studied ARIMA for a while. :) It is FORECAST package in R. It quickly chose the model, something the classical methods struggle with when you have mixed models (that is both AR and MA).I am not sure what you mean by a massive difference. A massive difference in what? It could be there was a change in the process after the intervention. There are several options including interrupted time series, segmented regression, and test to see if there was a change through a chow test. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test I should warn you I am a data analyst not a statistician so be cautious about my advice. :) It is what I have seen others recommend.
