Inserting elements into the DOM in a jQuery Mobile based page

I'm experimenting with a jQuery Mobile app that will eventually end up as a non-Web app on a mobile device and so all the content has to be local. For that reason (I think) I need to construct the app in a single page delineated by data-role="page" tags otherwise the ajax loading mechanism in jQuery Mobile doesn't seem to work. The app will read data from a local storage DB and display it on the page in an unordered list, styled using jQuery Mobile to look like a native app. In my $(document).ready() function I execute the DB lookup and for each results, I create an tag around my DB results and then call $(".list").append(li_str); where .list is the class of my tag. The page renders as if jQuery Mobile isn't present - I see the correct data in each but it doesn't look correct. Comparing this result with a version where I hard code the tags in the page HTML - it looks like jQuery Mobile modifies the tags and inserts a lot of new classes etc. Maybe I need to build the page from the DB earlier in the page load cycle? Any suggestions?
