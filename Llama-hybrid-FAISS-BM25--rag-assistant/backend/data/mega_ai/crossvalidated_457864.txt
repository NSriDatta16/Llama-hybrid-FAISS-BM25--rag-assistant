Forecasting based on relationship between time series

I have 2 timeseries datasets let's call them A and B. So my problem is I want to forecast future values of timeseries A based on timeseries B. Timeseries A and B have the same characteristics i.e most likely will follow the same trend and seasonality. An example is shown at this picture : My question is what methods I could use so I can predict future values of timeseries A (blue line) based on timeseries B (orange line). I've been thinking about methods that could find the relationship between the 2 timeseries. In this picture timeseries B = 0,1 * timeseries A. But in a real case this relationship could be more complex. So for a given future period let's say January to February I have values for timeseries B and I want to predict values from timeseries A for that same period. The reason for trying this approach is because I don't have actual values of the timeseries I want to predict but I do have very good forecasts of a very similar timeseries. I am not sure what models I could use and to be more specific what the inputs of my model should be because this problem is not actually forecasting. It's more like about finding the relationship between timeseries.
