What is the advantage of transforming variables from nominal to ordinal/numerical when it reduces variance explained in CatPCA?

Context I have a dataset of 8 categorical variables. And I want to apply Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CatPCA). Before doing that, I have been advised to look at the transformation plots of all these variables after transforming them into nominal variables. This shows that some variables should be transformed into ordinal variables (when non-decreasing) and some into numeric (linear trend). Now when doing the CatPCA with all nominal variables and comparing this to the CatPCA with newly transformed variables, there is a slight decrease in variance explained in the dependent variable. Question So if variance explained decreases after the transformations, what is the advantage of the transformation?
