C++ -- Detours (Win32 API Hijacking) -- Hijack Class Methods

I had no problems hijacking function with Detours for a long time... When I tried to hijack class methods (in my case IHTMLDocument2::write from mshtml.dll) I encountered endless problems (mainly type mismatching). As I didn't find any relevant example on the net I began doubting this can be done. My question is: is it possible to hijack class methods with Detours? Can I have an example, please? If not, is it possible to hijack class methods in a simpler way with another hooking library? Thanks in advance guys!
