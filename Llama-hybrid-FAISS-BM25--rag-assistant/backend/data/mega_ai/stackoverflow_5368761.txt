You're confusing Cache-Control and Pragma headers. Swap them. Firefox namely also requires no-store and must-revalidate along the no-cache . response.addHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache,no-store,private,must-revalidate,max-stale=0,post-check=0,pre-check=0"); response.addHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); response.addDateHeader ("Expires", 0); Even more, only the no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate has been enough for Cache-Control to get it to work across browsers.
