How to find (partially) moved contents, when script crashes

I'm fairly new to unix. One of our new scripts went wrong and it tried to moved contents of huge directory on Network storage to a local directory (which actually didn't exist). The script failed giving error because of space limitation and now I don't see those contents anywhere (nowhere in old/new directory). Is there anyway to find those contents? uname -a : Linux abc.com 2.6.9-22.20.ELsmp #1 SMP Fri Nov 18 03:04:44 EST 2005 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Command mv /home/user/apps /local/app/contents Thanks, Prabhjot
