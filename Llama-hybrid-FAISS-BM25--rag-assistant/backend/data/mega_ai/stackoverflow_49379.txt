How to lock compiled Java classes to prevent decompilation?

How do I lock compiled Java classes to prevent decompilation? I know this must be very well discussed topic on the Internet, but I could not come to any conclusion after referring them. Many people do suggest obfuscator, but they just do renaming of classes, methods, and fields with tough-to-remember character sequences but what about sensitive constant values? For example, you have developed the encryption and decryption component based on a password based encryption technique. Now in this case, any average Java person can use JAD to decompile the class file and easily retrieve the password value (defined as constant) as well as salt and in turn can decrypt the data by writing small independent program! Or should such sensitive components be built in native code (for example, VC++) and call them via JNI ?
