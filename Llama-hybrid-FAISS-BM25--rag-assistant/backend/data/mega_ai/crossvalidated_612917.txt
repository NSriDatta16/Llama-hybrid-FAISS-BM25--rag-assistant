GARCH model analysis using python

I have an AR(3)-GJR-GARCH(2,2,2) model. How can I test the presence of ‘leverage effects’ (i.e. asymmetric responses of the conditional variance to the positive and negative shocks) with 5% significance level? Below is my code for the model: startdate = '2009-01-01' enddate = '2021-12-31' data = yf.download('GD', start = startdate, end = enddate) data.rename(columns={"Adj Close": "price"}, inplace = True) log_returns = np.log(data['price']/data['price'].shift(1))*100 # Log return in % log_returns.dropna(inplace = True) startdate = '2010-01-01' enddate = '2018-12-31' in_sample_return = log_returns.loc[startdate:enddate] gjr_garch = arch_model(in_sample_return,mean='AR',lags=3,vol='GARCH',p=2,o=2,q=2,dist='t').fit(update_freq=5) What do I do next to check if ‘leverage effects’ is present at 5% significance level? As I know the gamma parameter is the leverage and when gamma is non-zero it means that the model has leverage effect, but the problem is here in this model I have two gamma parameters. I thought checking gamma coefficient is enough but as it mentioned "5% significance level", I believe the p-value needs to be calculated and I'm not sure how do I do it.
