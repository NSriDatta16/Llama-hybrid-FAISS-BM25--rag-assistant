Additional ideas: For students in Computer Science major, learning programming on Linux/FreeBSD is much better than doing these on Windows. First, open-source OS is cheap; Second, these UNIX-like operating system is well-organized and open so that beginners can acquire more knowledge and techniques. In this subject about command line, we can see the *NIX shell is more powerful and beautiful than Windows cmd. For programmers or system administrators working on Windows platform, cmd (or PowerShell) is necessary skill. We can write cmd scripts to do some simple automatic jobs. For complex tasks, we can choose VBScript/Python/Perl/AutoHotKey and attach them together with cmd.
