Building an AVR with HTTP server and SNMP agent?

I need to build a prototype for a simple data collection device using an AVR microcontroller. The device will basically collect sensor data and make this data available via SNMP and a HTTP response. What are my options when it comes to AVR software that would already have a HTTP server and SNMP agent built-in?
