Extract Date forecast package R

I am using the forecast package and saved the results of t to a data frame. The row names represent my dates, which when printed look like > t Point.Forecast Lo.80 Hi.80 Lo.95 Hi.95 2010.856 812.9849 630.5707 995.3992 534.0064 1091.9634 2010.876 670.3363 485.1885 855.4840 387.1772 953.4953 2010.895 769.4848 584.2552 954.7145 486.2005 1052.7691 2010.914 692.8951 507.6630 878.1272 409.6070 976.1832 I am not close (yet) to getting this completed, but I am hoping to automate a LaTex report where I will print the forecasts to a report page and a plot of the forecast. I figure I can pass the dataframe to a LaTex table, but I need the dates to be formatted in a way where the end user will understand that they represent week ends (set to Sundays). I converted my original time series with "readable" dates to a time series object using ts(prod, start = 2009 +(31+28+31+5)/365, f=52 ) where the start of my timeseries was on April 5th, 2009 and represented weekly datapoints. Any help you can provide will be very much appreciated. Needless to say I am pretty new to R.
