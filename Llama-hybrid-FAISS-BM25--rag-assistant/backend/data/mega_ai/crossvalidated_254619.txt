Here is a statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, loosely taken from I.J. Good ( Weight of evidence: A brief survey , Bayesian Statistics 2, 1985). The weight of evidence. Suppose you observe data points $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ which you have reason to believe are independent samples from some unknown distribution having a density $f_0$. In the simplest case, you have two hypotheses $H_1$ and $H_2$ about what is $f_0$, say $H_1 = \{f_1\}$ and $H_2 = \{f_2\}$. Thus you have modelled the unknown $f_0$ as being one of $f_1$ or $f_2$. The weight of evidence of the sample $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ for $H_1$ against $H_2$ is defined as $$ W(x) = \log \frac{f_1(x)}{f_2(x)} . $$ It is an easy to interpret quantity, especially given a prior $P$ on the hypotheses $H_0$ and $H_1$. Indeed, in that case the posterior log-odds are $W$ plus the prior log-odds: $$ \log \frac{P(H_0 | x)}{P(H_1 | x)} = W(x) + \log\frac{P(H_0)}{P(H_1)}. $$ This quantity also has a number of convenient properties, such as additivity for independent samples: $$ W(x_1, \dots, x_n) = W(x_1) + \dots +W(x_n) . $$ Good provides further justification for the use of the weight of evidence, and $W(x)$ is also refered by Kullback and Leibler (in the paper that introduced the K-L divergence) as "the information in $x$ for discrimination between $H_1$ and $H_2$". In summary, given a sample $x$, the weight of evidence $W(x)$ is a concrete number meant to help you understand how much evidence you have at hand. Some people even use rule of thumbs such as "$W(x) > 2$ is strong evidence" (I don't encourage the blind use of such tables, mind you). The Kullback-Leibler divergence Now, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $f_1$ and $f_2$ is the expected weight of evidence in a sample $x \sim f_1$ . That is, $$ KL(f_1, f_2) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim f_1} W(x) = \int f_1 \log\frac{f_1}{f_2}. $$ We should intuitively expect that a sample $x \sim f_1$ provides positive evidence in favor of $H_1 = \{f_1\}$ against $H_2$, and this is indeed reflected through the inequality $$ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim f_1} W(x) \geq 0. $$
