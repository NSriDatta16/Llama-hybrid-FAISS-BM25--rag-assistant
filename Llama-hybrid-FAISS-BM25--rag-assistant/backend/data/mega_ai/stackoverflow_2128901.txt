Notice that the documentation says: "the Dictionary )>) class is implemented as a hash table ", not "the Dictionary )>) class is implemented as a HashTable " Dictionary is NOT implemented as a HashTable, but it is implemented following the concept of a hash table. The implementation is unrelated to the HashTable class because of the use of Generics, although internally Microsoft could have used the same code and replaced the symbols of type Object with TKey and TValue. In .NET 1.0 Generics did not exist; this is where the HashTable and ArrayList originally began.
