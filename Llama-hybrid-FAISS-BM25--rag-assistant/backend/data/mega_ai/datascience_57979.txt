MATLAB @ symbol for fminunc / fmincg function

I am following Andrew Ng's Coursera class on machine learning, and I came across this syntax for the fminunc and fmincg functions: fmincg (@(t)(lrCostFunction(t, X, (y == c), lambda)),initial_theta, options); Specifically, it is the @ that's confusing me. I read up on it and I still don't understand what we're doing with it here. Can someone clarify what this is doing, as well as how the t in the function call to lrCostFunction is related to the @(t) in the beginning.
