Which test to use to compare multiple ratios when variability among groups is very different (cannot use ANOVA)?

I am trying to see if the average proportion among different groups is same or there is atleast one group where the average proportion is different. So I thought about using ANOVA but when I computed the standard deviations of different proportions among the different groups, they are very different. Hence I am stuck as to which test to use. So following columns in my dataset are the point of focus servicecenterid, grossrevenue, servicetime servicecenterid is an id (nominal) servicetime is in hours grossrevenue is an integer I am computing revenue_hours which is revenue_hours = grossrevenue/servicetime Then each service center is a group and I am then computing the average revenue_hours for each service center and I want to see that does atleast one proportion differ by using ANOVA. But I cannot use ANOVA as each group's revenue_hours standard deviation is highly different
