Does Visual Studio Server Explorer support custom database providers?

I had used Server Explorer and related tools for graphical database development with Microsoft SQL Server in some of my learning projects - and it was a great experience. However, in my work I deal with Oracle DB and SQLite and my hobby projects use MySQL (because they are hosted on Linux). Is there a way to leverage the database-related tools in Visual Studio with other database providers?
