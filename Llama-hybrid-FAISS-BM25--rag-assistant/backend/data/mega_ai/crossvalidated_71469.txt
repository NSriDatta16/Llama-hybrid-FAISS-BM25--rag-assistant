How about doing your linear regression, then take the residual by subtracting your regression line from the data, and look at its standard deviation (SD) or median absolute deviation (MAD)? (The SD part may be basically equivalent to the R^2, I'm not sure of the math.) The problem is the "one to five or six" part. That's not much data there, but of course the data you have is what you have. (If you had a lot more data, you could consider decomposition methods on the residual to look at the power in higher and lower frequencies.) I thought of things like the KL-divergence or something like Alecos mentioned, but they're for differences in distributions not differences in time series, so I'm not sure they're applicable.
