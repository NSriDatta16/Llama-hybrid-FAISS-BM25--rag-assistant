Can I choose RIP-relative or absolute addressing for different variables with gcc in x86-64

I write my own link script to put different variables in two different data sections (A & B). A is linked to zero address; B is linked near to code, and in high address space (higher than 4G, which is not available for normal absolute addressing in x86-64). A can be accessed through absolute addressing, but not RIP-relative; B can be accessed through RIP-relative addressing, but not absolute; My question: Is there any way to choose RIP-relative or absolute addressing for different variables in gcc? Perhaps with some annotation like #pragma ?
