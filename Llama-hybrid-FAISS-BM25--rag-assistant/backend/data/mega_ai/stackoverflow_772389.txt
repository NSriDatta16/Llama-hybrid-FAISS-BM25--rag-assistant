Jereme has it right on the framework. I'll briefly mention something obvious about namespaces. Always remember what a namespace is for - it's to provide a "space" in which names will live. In particular, it's meant to provide a space small enough that the people creating names within that space will be less likely to produce duplicate or confusing names. This can only work if the namespaces are organized along patterns of organization, or of domain knowledge. A simple example often used is a pattern of Company . BusinessUnit . Application . The theory is that within the set of developers working on a given application, there is less chance for name duplication. This will not be true for a large application, where you would want to break it further based on layer or area. Similarly, of the business unit is too large, you'll want to break that down. But in all cases, you're really trying to partition sets of brains, as it's the brains that create the names.
