First of all, digitalize your data on a regular time scale with a time delta shorter than the shortest assumed period. For instance, in the case of the milkman, you could create a table with one record per day having the value 1 if the man come and 0 if not. The table would look like a regular time-serie : day, presence 1, 1 2, 0 3, 1 4, 0 Then perform a autocorrelation analysis of your time-serie. This is a mathematical tool often used in signal processing that consists in, as suggested by @MichelGrogan in his comment, calculating the correlation between the original serie and copies of the serie delayed by distinct time deltas (1 day, 2 days, ...). The result can be plotted as values of correlation in function of the lag value and is called an autocorrelation spectrum. Read autocorrelation for more details. The max values of the spectrum will give you the values of the most important frequencies observed in your data and confirm that pattern exists. If you do not see clear max values, you can conclude there are no pattern in your data. Here is an example in Python from your data : import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt day =['mon','tue','wed','thi','fri','sat','sun', 'mon','tue','wed','thi','fri','sat','sun', 'mon','tue','wed','thi','fri','sat','sun' ] num =[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] pres=[ 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0.] corr=np.correlate(pres,pres,'full') lag=[i-(len(corr)/2) for i in range(len(corr))] plt.plot(lag,corr/np.max(corr)) And the spectrum plot : As you can see there are clear maximum at 2 days and 7 days lags.
