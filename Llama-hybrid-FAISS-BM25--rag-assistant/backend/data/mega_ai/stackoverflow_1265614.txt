How often do you add the tissue, and how much time can it take? One simple solution is using a linked list+hash with pointers from one to the other. Meaning: Save a linked list containing all of the relevant points and their data Save a hash to easily get to this data: key = coordinates, data = pointer to the linked list. The implementation of the operations would be: Add a box: Go over the full linked list, and take only the relevant elements into the "work" linked list Iterate: Go over the "work" linked list Find neighbors: Seek each of the neighbors in the hash. Complexity: Add: O(n), Iterate O(1) for finding next element, Neighbor O(1) average (due to hash).
