Recommendations for encrypted password and email retrieval

I just finished encrypting the passwords in my database using a salted sha1. Naturally I'll need to implement a forgot password link ( email as well ). I have make shift versions of those right now that are no good. I am assuming due to the style of encryption, that I will need to prompt the user to reset their password. I am just looking for the most secure way to do this. Any suggestions, or links to resources and tutorials, as well as what kinda of method I should use would be greatly appreciated. thanks and good day.
