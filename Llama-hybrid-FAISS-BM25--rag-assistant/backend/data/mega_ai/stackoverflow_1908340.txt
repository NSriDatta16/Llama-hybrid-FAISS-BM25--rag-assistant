Try this: borjaom =JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Igen? J eller N " ); Also, JOptionPane can only be used to input Strings . So all of your variables that you set to receive the input from the JOptionPane should be declared as Strings. Ampere and Ohm should be declared as integers while FragaAm , FragaOhm and borjaom should be declared as Strings.
