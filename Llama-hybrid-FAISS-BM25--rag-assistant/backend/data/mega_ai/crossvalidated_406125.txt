this is not Bayesian, does it have a name

Suppose that I have prior belief B. Then I get an information D from the source S. I update B with D. However, my update magnitude depends on my trust T(S) in S. Also, the marginal update diminishes with difference D-B, as does my trust in T(S). Can this be expressed in Bayesian terms, or is this Bayesian at all?
