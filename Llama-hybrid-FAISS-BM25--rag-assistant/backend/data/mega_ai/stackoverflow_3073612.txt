One (well three) words: MERGE storage engine . See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/merge-storage-engine.html It's absolutely no problem to have only one table in a MERGE , even none would be allowed. Edit: nevermind, ALTER TABLE wouldn't work for this engine (the next operation to the MERGE table would fail.
