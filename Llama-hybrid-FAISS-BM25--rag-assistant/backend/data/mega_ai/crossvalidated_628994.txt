Why don't vegan::vegdist and vegan::metaMDS produce equivalent results?

This question has been discussed before but the proposed solution ( https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/459820/170801 ) is no longer reproducible for some reason. As a refresher - it has been suggested that turning off the autotransform and halfchange options in veganMDS() will allow you to produce identical results whether you are directly entering a community data matrix or distance matrix of it: library('vegan') data(varespec) dij However, when we run all.equal(scores(ord2, 'sites'), scores(ord3, 'sites')) it no longer produces: [1] TRUE as it did previously, but instead now produces: [1] "Mean relative difference: 0.5965117" Can anyone explain what's going on, please? Maybe https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1390/gavin-simpson ?
