Interpretation of (scale of) AIC, AICc and BIC when comparing different models

I'm trying to fit a model to a time series, but I am pretty confused as to which is the best. I'm looking at an arima model, and ets model and an stlf model, which each performed best within their own family of models. When comparing rolling forecasting errors for 6 month forecasts, they perform exactly equally well, each model has the smallest errors exactly one third of the time. I then try to look at other criteria such as AIC, AICc and BIC, and get the following results (my problem is really the scale of the information criteria - it's about a factor hundred smaller for the stlf model, is it really that much better or is something else at play here?): #The arima model: Series: myts ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,0)[12] Coefficients: sar1 0.8394 s.e. 0.0704 sigma^2 estimated as 19456: log likelihood=-229.81 AIC=463.61 AICc=463.99 BIC=466.72 #The ets model: ETS(M,N,M) Call: ets(y = myts) Smoothing parameters: alpha = 0.5505 gamma = 1e-04 Initial states: l = 500.5273 s=0.5977 0.3134 0.298 0.5218 1.6367 2.0899 2.1506 2.2123 0.8724 0.5279 0.4086 0.3708 sigma: 0.1507 AIC AICc BIC 438.9330 458.9330 461.1023 #The stlf model: ETS(A,N,N) Call: ets(y = x, model = etsmodel) Smoothing parameters: alpha = 0.483 Initial states: l = 6.0707 sigma: 0.1587 AIC AICc BIC 0.4533825 0.8170189 3.6204204 Can they be compared at all? I do think I remember something about only being able to compare these criteria between different models under certain conditions.
