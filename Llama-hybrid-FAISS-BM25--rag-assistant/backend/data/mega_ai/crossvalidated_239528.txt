The unregularized model is suffering from complete separation because you are trying to predict the dichotomized variable price_c from the continuous variable price from which it is derived. The regularized model avoids the problem of complete separation by imposing a penalty that keeps the coefficient for the price predictor from going off to $\infty$ or $-\infty$. So it manages to converge fine and work well. You should remove the continuous price predictor from the design matrix in this toy example. Edit: As @Erik points out, the continuous price predictor is already removed from the design matrix, which I somehow missed. So the complete separation arises from some other predictor or combination of predictors. It's also worth adding that, of course, none of these issues have anything to do with the particular implementation of logistic regression in R's glm() function. It is simply about regularized vs. unregularized logistic regression.
