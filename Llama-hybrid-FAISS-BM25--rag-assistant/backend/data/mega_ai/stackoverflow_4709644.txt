Read a time series table using read.zoo

I've looked all over the place, but I can't find where this question has been asked before. What is a clean way to get this data into a proper zoo series? This version is a copy/paste to make this post easier, but it will always come in the following table form (from a text file). My read.zoo() statement reads the Year as the index but the quarters (Qtr1, Qtr2, etc) are read as column names. I've been trying to figure out a non-garbage way to read the columns as the "quarter" part of the index, but it's sloppy (too sloppy to post). I'm guessing this problem has already been solved, but I can't find it. > texinp z z From the as.yearqtr() documentation, the target would look like: 1992 Q1 1992 Q2 1992 Q3 1992 Q4 1993 Q1 1993 Q2 1993 Q3 1993 Q4 566 443 329 341 344 212 133 112 1994 Q1 1994 Q2 1994 Q3 1994 Q4 252 252 199 207
