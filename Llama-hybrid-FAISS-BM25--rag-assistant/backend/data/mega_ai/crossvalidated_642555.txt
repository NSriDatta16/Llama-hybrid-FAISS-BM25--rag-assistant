Following on from discussion in the comments above with @SextusEmpiricus and @GrahamBornholt, and from my previous thoughts here An example where the likelihood principle *really* matters? , I will say that 'conflict' between the likelihood principle and inferences that might follow from a likelihood ratio test (or any other test, frequentist or Bayesian, or even pure likelihood) is not a conflict at all. The likelihood principle says that data that yield the same (proportional) likelihood function have the same evidential meaning concerning values of the parameter(s) of interest, according to the statistical model(s). Crucially, it does not say anything at all about inferences that might be informed by such evidence. Inferences will be (should be!) informed by the data (evidence) and and also at least some statistical issue such as loss functions concerning the possible inferential errors and prior information and or prior probability distributions about parameters of interest. There are also non-statistical issues that are relevant to scientific inferences, such as whether the study in question is intended to be definitive or preliminary, how expensive it might be to follow up on important results, whether there are corroborating results available, how reliable is the report or reporter, and maybe how well the statistical methods match the inferential intents. I am sure that you can think of other things as well, but the upshot is that there can never be a one to one relationship between statistical evidence and inference. And therefore most of (all?) the claimed 'violations' of the likelihood principle are nothing of the kind.
