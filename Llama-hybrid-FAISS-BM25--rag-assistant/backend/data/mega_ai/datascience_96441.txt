Data Lakes: What: The data lake is a general purpose, highly scalable, low-cost storage tier for raw data. If the data warehouse is a source of purposeful structured data that has been preprocessed and loaded to answer specific business-centric questions, the data lake is the staging area for data that might have importance in the future. Why? Given that businesses are moving to a “store everything” mentality across most of the data they produce, it is essential to have a storage tier that can scale to meet the storage needs of tomorrow while also providing benefits today. Challenges: The challenges of storing raw data, however, can manifest when the time comes to make use of and provide purpose to these deep pools of raw potential. The challenge is that over the months and years that data is sitting and waiting, changes to the data being produced and a lack of records as to what exactly was being recorded at various points can make older data unusable. This can dramatically increase the lead time to make use of the data or cause years of data to be thrown away due to corruption of data over time. Technical tip: So even though the data lake is conceptually a storage area for raw, under-purposed data, there is still a need to provide a moderate level of effort in order to ensure that data corruption doesn’t occur along the way, and that the business can make practical use of the data when the time comes to put it into action.
