Changing site URL with mod_rewrite

I'm finding a lot about creating pretty URIs and whatnot using mod_rewrite but what I'm looking for is a way to remove elements of a URL (as far as the viewer is concerned) and not just moving stuff around and/or reorganizing. I need this: http://www.mysite.com/foo/bar to be this: http://www.mysite.com/bar Basically, let's get rid of /foo in the URL. Is that possible?
