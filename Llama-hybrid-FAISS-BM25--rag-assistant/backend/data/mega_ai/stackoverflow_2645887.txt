partial is a 'template' that can be reused in any view pages. its simple & fast. all $data must be passed as parameter to the partial. imo, should be preferred if possible. component is like a 'template with its own action' that can be reused in any view pages. more powerful, but slower compared to partial. use if you have partials that require business logic (i.e. action/controller) http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/07-Inside-the-View-Layer#chapter_07_code_fragments
