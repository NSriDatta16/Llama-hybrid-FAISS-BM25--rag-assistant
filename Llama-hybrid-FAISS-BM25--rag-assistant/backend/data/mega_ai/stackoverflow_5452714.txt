You want to take a look into space-filling-curve, for example a z-curve or a hilbert-curve. You can think of a space-filling-curve to reduce the 2-Dimensional problem to a 1-Dimensional problem. Although the sfc index is only a reorder of the 2-Dimensional data and not a perfect clustering of the data it can be useful when the solution has not to satisfied a perfect cluster and has to be compute fairly fast.
