First, the evaluation metric for imbalanced data would not be accuracy. Suppose you are doing fraud detection, that 99.9% of your data is not fraud. We can easy make a dummy model that have 99.9% accuracy. (just predict all data non-fraud). You want to change your evaluation metric from accuracy to something else, such as F1 score or precision and recall . In the second link I provided. there are details and intuitions on why precision recall will work. For highly imbalanced data, building a model can be very challenging. You may play with weighted loss function or modeling one class only. such as one class SVM or fit a multi-variate Gaussian (As the link I provided before.)
