Search an item based on a custom property

I started this task assuming it to be pretty trivial one. However, going to the depths i find that its either not that simple or may be i am using a wrong approach here. In my case i have a number of documents which are not in the same directory however, they have the same names/title. What i want is to carry out a site based search and resolve the document with least number of unrequired results. So I decided to create a DocumentID (my custom ID) which is unique for each document and while storing the document using SPFile's Properties bucket I stored this new custom property DocumentIDalong with its value for every item. Now when i try searching out the document based on its DocumentID value i stored I dont get any results. Reading the problem on internet gave me hint that i should be creating a Managed property to be able to search within custom properties. As required i did the same however, i could not find an appropriate crawled property for my custom property (DocumentID). Now unless i find the correct crawled propery which i believe isn't under my control i won't be able to utilize the power of Managed property search. Anyone having a better idea or a solution to the point where i am stuck at? Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks and Regards, Raghu
