The units are a red herring: km/hr is misleading when we're talking about something that's more meaningful and intuitive at cm/year. With that said, you've already cited the maximum rates between zero and two years old and "puberty". You have to agree on what you're looking for: the maximum value or the overall value? Since this is an interview question, all you have to do is state your assumptions and give a result. If an individual reaches their full adult height by age 21 years, and the average height for a male in the United States is 69.2 inches, the average growth rate is between 3-4 inches per year. Since 1 inches = 2.54 Ã— 10-5 kilometers, you can see that it's about 7.5e-5 to 10e-5 km/year. Since 1 year = 8 765.8 hours, I'll leave that final multiplication to you.
