Found the solution. Issue was in this line: levelTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval: 0.03 target: self selector: @selector(levelTimerCallback:) userInfo: nil repeats: NO]; Since repeats was set to NO, the timer used to fire only once. So, the continuos monitoring of the averagePowerForChannel value could not be done. After setting it to YES, the code works perfectly.
