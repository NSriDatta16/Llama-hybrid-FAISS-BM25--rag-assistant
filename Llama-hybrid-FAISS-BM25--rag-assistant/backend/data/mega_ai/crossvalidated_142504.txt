Hopefully my answer is not circular, but look carefully at the equation. You are multiplying the deviation of x by the deviation in y, and then averaging the result. This average product of simultaneous deviation results in the measure and definition shown above. Compare to the definition of variance to see why the term co-variance rightly applies: it's the same shape of definition with a minor substitution.
