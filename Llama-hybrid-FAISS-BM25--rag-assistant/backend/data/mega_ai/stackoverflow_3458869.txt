Looks like I solved this pretty quickly on my own. Referring to the JQuery UI wiki , the ui item in the change event is the same one in the select event, so I can modify my code to read like this: $(function() { $("#customerName").autocomplete({ source: "/Customers/CustomerListJSON", minLength: 2, select: function(event, ui) { $("#customerOrganizationId").val(ui.item ? ui.item.Id : ""); }, change: function(event, ui) { $("#customerOrganizationId").val(ui.item ? ui.item.Id : ""); } }); }); There's no need to test for the event, just for whether there is an item in the ui argument. The ID setting in the select event is probably redundant, but to be safe I'm going to keep both.
