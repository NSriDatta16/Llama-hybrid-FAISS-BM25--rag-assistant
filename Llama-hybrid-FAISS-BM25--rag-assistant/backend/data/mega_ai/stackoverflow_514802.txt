Well, you certainly don't need to sort them. Just take the average of their x and y coordinates. This will work in N-dimensions as long as they are collinear. EDIT: I realized that I'm computing the mean. You are computing the median, as stated in another answer, which is probably more likely to get the minimum distance to all points. EDIT2: The median is the correct answer for an odd number of points. For an even number of points, it's any point along the innermost line segment defined by the area with the same number of points on both sides. Proof (ish): You found a correct answer, but for even number of points there are muliple. For any two points, any point on the line segment between those points will have the sum of its distances to both points be the same. Any point outside that line segment will have its distances greater than on the line segment. So, to find the point with the smallest distance from all collinear points, you need to decompose the problem into contained sets of two points, i.e., line segments that are fully contained in other line segments. Then, just take the smallest line segment (or point in the case of odd number of points) and pick a point on that line segment. All points on that line segment will have the minimum distance from all points for that particular configuration. If you want to graph this, all distance from point graphs will have the same shape: / For a line segment, the distance graph will look like this: _/ In essence, you want to add all distance graphs and find the minimum.
