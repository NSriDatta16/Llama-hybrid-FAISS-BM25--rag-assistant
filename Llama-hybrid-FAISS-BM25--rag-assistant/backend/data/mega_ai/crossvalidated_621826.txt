There is a number of models you could use for such a problem. You could simply use linear regression with interaction terms, where different features would interact with watching time. This is a model that can detect a relation that differs for specific subgroups. Notice that with such a model, you don't need to discretize the data into intervals, you could use the watching time as-is. Stagewise regression would lead you to build a regression model where you would have distinct regression lines conditionally on some features. This would be useful if you have some prior knowledge about the data and want to define a model that explicitly states how to split the data for separate regression lines. If you don't know how the data is clustered, but you know that there are several clusters where each has its own regression line, you could use latent-class regression , a model that combines cluster analysis and regression. A regression tree would split the data into many groups and predict means per each group. If you want to take into account multiple interactions between the features and use a non-parametric model, this may be one possibility. Finally, you could use something like a neural network that will by itself figure out the interactions in your data.
