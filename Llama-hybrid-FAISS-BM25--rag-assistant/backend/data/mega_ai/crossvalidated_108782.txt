How many answers to memorize for a test?

Recently one of my friends asked me this deceivingly simple question: I have a midterm with a predetermined list of 15 possible questions. Out of the 15 questions only 7 will actually appear on the test. Out of the 7 that appear on the test I will only have to answer 5. How many answers should I memorize to make sure I get 100% on the test? I think I have convinced myself that it is pretty easy to show that he needs to memorize exactly 13 questions - 15-(7-5) - in order to guarantee he will know at least 5 of the questions on the midterm and thus get 100%. However I am having trouble generalizing the math to answer some more interesting questions. Specifically: How many answers should I memorize such that 75% of the time I will get 100% on the test? Or: How many answers should I memorize such that on average I will get at least an 80% on the test?
