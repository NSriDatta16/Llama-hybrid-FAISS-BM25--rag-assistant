What is the derivative of a set or a string?

Neural networks operate on numbers, and it's well-known what the derivative of numeric functions are, as well as what the derivative of matrix functions are. What about functions that operate on maps or strings? Is there a derivative of the union/difference of a map, or the append/replace/delete/concat of a string? Does the chain rule still apply, or does another chain rule now exist? What, if any, would be the study of the calculus of sets and strings? Would it be a calculus of sets and ordered sets?
