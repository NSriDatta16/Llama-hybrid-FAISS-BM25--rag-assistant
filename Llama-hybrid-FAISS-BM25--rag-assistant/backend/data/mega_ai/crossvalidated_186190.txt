price prediction in r using time series

I am trying to make a prediction of imbalance prices in the elctricity market. My dataset consists of data for every 15 minutes (this is the time period in which a price is determined) during 11 months. I have several exogenous factors (like the spot market price) included mentioned here as x1 etc. In forecasting the price I am using the following code: lag My code works, but I am unsure if it does wat I want it to. I am trying to predict the price only 1 time unit (so 15 minutes) ahead. That's why I have lagged variables in the function. Can someone help me out? Should I additionally specify how much time ahead I want to forecast? If so, can you tell me how? Thanks for your help!
