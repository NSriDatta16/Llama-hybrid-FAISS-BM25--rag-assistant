Your other option is actually to debug the serialization code. The way to do this is to put a try/catch around your call to Serialize, and have a breakpoint in your catch. Then when the exception get's thrown, drag the yellow bar to one line above where Serialize get's called and this time, you'll be able to set a breakpoint inside the Serialization code if you know where the code is stored. That's because the Serialize method actually gets generated and compiled on the first run. You can see more details of how to do this in this blog posting .
