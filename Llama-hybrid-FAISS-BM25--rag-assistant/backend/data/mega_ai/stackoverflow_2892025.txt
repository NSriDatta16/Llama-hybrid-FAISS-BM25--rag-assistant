Why didn't you just use a triple store to store all of your data? If you use a triple store with SPARQL endpoint capability then you would have a SPARQL-accessible web api. Similarly, many other data sets on the web are exposed as SPARQL endpoints and accessible via HTTP. There are many triple stores available with persistent storage both in a db and otherwise (Jena + SDB, Mulgara, Virtuoso, Oracle, etc). You could certainly extend Mulgara through their resolvers to support queries against your custom db but I think that's probably a lot of work for not too much real value. I'm sure you could use existing concepts to handle your notion of categories in RDF or perhaps by layering something over Jena.
