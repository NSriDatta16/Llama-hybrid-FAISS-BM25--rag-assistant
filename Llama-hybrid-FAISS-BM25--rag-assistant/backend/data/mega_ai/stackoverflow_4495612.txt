SSL should be used anywhere where you are communicating information that should not be public. It is a very dangerous assumption to believe that no-one is listening to traffic between your computer and the remote server. All someone needs to do to snoop traffic is be on your network - they don't need admin access to your router. Without using SSL for sensitive communications, a single machine with a virus on a coworkers computer is all that is needed for stealing your identity. The ISP also has access to all network traffic - how much do you trust their techies? Dear User, We've decided against encrypting our internet traffic because we just don't think it's important. We decided that it's really too hard to monitor internet traffic, so if anyone really is prepared to go to that effort, well they deserve all the data they can get their hands on. If you're using an old style of router, have corrupt IT staff and/or co-workers, or someone just doesn't like you and decides to steal your data, we accept no liability. We advise against you telling anyone about our decision, as this will direct unwanted attention to our IP traffic. Kindest Regards, Good Enough Programming Disclaimer: If you are a hacker and stumbled across this message while monitoring IP traffic, we politely point out that what you are doing is illegal, and request that you pretend you never saw it.
