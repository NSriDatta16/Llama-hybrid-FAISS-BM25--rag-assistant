Quite simply, there is no possible algorithm that can guarantee you will never have to iterate through every item in the list. However, it is possible to improve the average number of items you need to iterate through - sorting the list before you begin your search. By doing so, the only times you would have to iterate through the entire list would be when it is filled with only "abc" and "xyz." Assuming that it's not practical for you to have a pre-sorted list by the time you need to search through it, then the only way to improve the speed of your search would be to use a different data structure than a list - for example, a binary search tree .
