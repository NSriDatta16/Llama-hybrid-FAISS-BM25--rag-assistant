software for organizing text

( I suspect that the question may not belong here as it's about software and not about programing. However, this is my computers community, and I trust you guys to refer me elsewhere if you think it's not appropriate to answer it here. ) So, I'm writing a lot. Text. For myself. Diaries, ideas, insights, observations. It always comes in the form of passages, passage at a time. Until now I used to write in word documents, organizing them by rough categories divided to different documents, and by chronological order. I figure out that this is way sub optimal. I can have more, and I do need more. I'm looking for a software that will allow me to: 1 - tag passages 2 - store date and time automatically (created and edited) 3 - powerful full text search 4 - besides the above, I'd like it to have as much word processing capabilities as possible Recommendations for a software that have this? Now, I don't need this to be online. I'm doing this for myself, and don't want it to be published anywhere. I figure out however that many web platforms may have much of what I need, so I don't automatically reject the possibility to use one for my offline needs. Thanks guys Gidi
