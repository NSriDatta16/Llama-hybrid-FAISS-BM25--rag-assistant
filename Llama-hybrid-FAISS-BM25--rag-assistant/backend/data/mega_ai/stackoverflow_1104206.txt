As others have pointed out, you've got an uncaught exception, which calls terminate(). It is implementation-defined (see the Standard, 15.3 paragraph 9 and 15.5.1 paragraph 2) whether destructors are called in this case, and the definition in your implementation is apparently "No, they won't". (If terminate() is called for any other reason than throwing an exception that doesn't have a handler, destructors will not be called.)
