How about: A ranking is an order preserving or order reversing (surjective) mapping of a set of numbers to an interval of natural numbers starting from 0 or 1. A rank is an element from the image of a ranking. This definition has some limits when there are ties. In that case people sometimes define the rank as an average (not a natural number) or some places are skipped (not a surjective function). For example we can have $$\begin{array}{r} \text{input} & \{1,&2,&3,&4,&4,&5\} \\\hline \text{output1} & \{1,&2,&3,&4,&4,&5\} \\ \text{output2} & \{1,&2,&3,&5,&5,&6\} \\ \text{output3} & \{1,&2,&3,&4.5,&4.5,&5\} \\ \end{array}$$ Output 1 relates to the rank of a number $x$ defined as 'the number of unique values equal to or below $x$ '. Output 2 relates to the rank of a number $x$ defined as 'the number of numbers equal to or below $x$ '. Output 3 relates to the rank of a number $x$ defined as 'the number of numbers equal to or below $x$ if a value is unique, and when several numbers are the same/tied the average value of the ranks given to these numbers if they would not be tied'. The definition as a ranking being 'surjective' and mapping to 'natural' numbers does not coincide with cases 2 and 3. But if we would adjust the definition to include cases 2 and 3, then the definition becomes very general and is just any order preserving mapping. The idea of a ranking as a counting process is lost. A definition that can reconcile examples 1 and 2 is The rank of the number $x_j$ in a list, is the number of numbers $x_i$ in that list, either counted with or without multiplicity, for which we have $x_i R x_j$ , where $R$ is the binary relation $\leq$ or the binary relation $\geq$ .
