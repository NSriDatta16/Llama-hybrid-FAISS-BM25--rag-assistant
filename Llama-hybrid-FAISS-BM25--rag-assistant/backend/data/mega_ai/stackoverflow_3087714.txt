Conditional validation with jquery

Ok this is driving me crazy. I have a user account page. Where you have the option to change your password. I want a conditional jquery validation that if the user types in a new password in the new password box the box that confirms the password as well as the box that asks for the old password is turned into a required element. here is my ragtag code so far: $("#aspnetForm").validate({ rules: { : { required: :specified} : { required: :specified} }, messages:{} }); Just to clear something up. I am using :specified because if the filed is filled. Maybe some other condition?
