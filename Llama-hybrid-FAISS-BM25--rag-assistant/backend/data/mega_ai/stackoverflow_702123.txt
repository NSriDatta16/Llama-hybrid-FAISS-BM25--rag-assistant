Linq Map! or Collect!

What is the Linq equivalent to the map! or collect! method in Ruby? a = [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ] a.collect! {|x| x + "!" } a #=> [ "a!", "b!", "c!", "d!" ] I could do this by iterating over the collection with a foreach, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant Linq solution.
