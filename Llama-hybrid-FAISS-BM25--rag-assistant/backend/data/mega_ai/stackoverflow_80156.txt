Just to add to the other answers, I would encourage you to look at actual textual representations of SOAP and XML-RPC calls, perhaps by capturing one with Ethereal. The whole, "XML-RPC is simpler" argument doesn't make much sense until you see how incredibly verbose a SOAP call is. Many of the fairly popular web sites out there shy away from SOAP as their API due to just the amount of bandwidth it would consume if people started using it extensively.
