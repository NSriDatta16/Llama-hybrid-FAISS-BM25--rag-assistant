Can i use Activex with silverlight4?

I need to use a ActiveX control in my silverlight application. After some research i found out a few ways in which a silverlight app can use ActiveX control Use ActiveX control in a webpage along with silverlight plugin and use javascript for interaction between silverlight and activex. Use a webbrowser control in silverlight 4 and load the webpage containing activex in webbrowser control. Is there any other way that can utilized to embed activex control in silverlight app. I read somewhere that silverlight 4 has support for COM components. Can silverlight4 provide support for embedding activex control in a silverlight app. Any help on this is highly appreciated and if some samples/documentation link is there that would be great. Thanks in advance.
