Building web pages on the server-side or client-side?

I've always wondered how to decide on choosing between using server-side code versus client-side code to build HTML pages. I'll use a very simple php vs javascript/jquery example to further explain my question. Your advice and comment is very much appreciated. Say I'm about to present a web page to a user to select a type of report in my web page. Which makes more sense? For server-side creation, I'd do this: "battingaverage", "htmlLabel"=>"Batting AVG report"), array("htmlID"=>"homeruntotals", "htmlLabel"=>"Home Run Totals report"), ); foreach ($results AS $data) echo " {$data['htmlLabel']}"; ?> Using client-side code, I'd get the javascript to build the page like the following: $.getJSON("rt.php", {}, function(data) { var mainDiv = $("#reportChoices"); $.each(data, function(idx, jsonData) { var newInput = $(document.createElement('input')); newInput .attr("type", "radio") .attr("name", "reportType") .attr("value", jsonData["htmlID"]) mainDiv.append(newInput).append(jsonData["htmlLabel"]); }); }; All I would need on the server is a data dump php script such as: "battingaverage", "htmlLabel"=>"Batting AVG report"), array("htmlID"=>"homeruntotals", "htmlLabel"=>"Home Run Totals report"), ); echo json_encode($results); ?> This is a very simple example, but from this, I see pros and cons in different area. 1 - The server-side solution has the advantage of being able to hide most of the actual programming logic behind how everything is built. When the user looks at the page source, all they see is the already-built web page. In other words, the client-side solution gives away all your source code and programming logic on how certain things are built. But you could use a minifier to make your source look more cryptic. 2 - The client-side solution transfers the "resource load" onto the client system (i.e. the browser needs to use the client's computer resources to build most of the page) whereas the server side solution bogs down, well, the server. 3 - The client-side solution is probably more elegant when it comes to maintainability and readability. But then again, I could have used php libraries that modularize HTML controls and make it a lot more readable. Any comments? Thanks in advance.
