Comparing principal components if number of variables changes

I have a database that contains daily stock returns of more than a thousand stocks for many decades. I would like to achieve the following goals: Construct a time-varying measure of co-movement (or common component) of stock returns. Compare the evolution of this measure over time, and later relate it to other variables. The main idea is to see whether the importance of the common component of stock returns systematically varies over the business cycle . My first idea was to run a PCA in each quarter, save the the share of explained variance by the first principal component, and then this quarterly time series of explained variance would be the measure of co-movement over time. The problem, however, is that the number of variables for which I run the PCA is not constant over time. In the early part of the sample I have, say, 200 stocks and in the more recent part, say, 1000. I assume it doesn't make sense to compare the explained variance by PC1 if the number of variables is different over time. Is there any measure that can be compared if the number of variables changes over time?
