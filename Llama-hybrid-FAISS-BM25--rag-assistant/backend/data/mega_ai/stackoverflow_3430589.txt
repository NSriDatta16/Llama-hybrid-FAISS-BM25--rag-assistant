Installable Google App Engine Apps

When an app is designed with the intention of being made as an Installable App in the App Marketplace for GAE, are there any extra steps the developer should take concerning security? For instance, if Company A installs the app, and Company B installs the app, do they each have their own datastore? If not, how do I, as the developer, separate the two? I have lots of concerns about this, I don't want to get to far along in the development of my project just to have to rip out half the code and start over. I have a lot of questions about this entire process, and I haven't been able to gain a lot of practical information from the GAE docs. I know that I have to create the application manifest, and deploy the app, and so forth, I'm just curious how you create an app that is ready for and respectful of the multiple organizations that will use it and their privacy. Any information or links to information would be great. Thanks.
