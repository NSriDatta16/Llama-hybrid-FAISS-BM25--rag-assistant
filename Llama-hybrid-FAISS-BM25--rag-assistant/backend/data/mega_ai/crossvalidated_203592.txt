[ EDIT : I think I'm in over my head here and would appreciate input. I originally specified a ARMA(2,1) with seasonal ARMA(1,1), assuming that any trend that would normally require differencing would be handled by the year xreg variable. But the ar1 coefficient was 1.5, which isn't good. So I've now switched to ARIMA(1,1,1) with seasonal ARIMA(0,0,1), but I'm not sure that's right either. If you look at How to know if a time series is stationary or non-stationary? , StasK makes the point that non-economic time series (climate in particular) are more complex than ARIMA can handle -- I think.] I believe I've calculated what you're looking for, using R's arima to account for a yearly seasonality and also an ARMA (2, 1): climate The results are: Coefficients: ar1 ma1 sma1 yr2 0.5285 -0.3086 -0.6463 0.0292 s.e. 0.0984 0.1089 0.0255 0.0433 sigma^2 estimated as 0.03562: log likelihood = 190.25, aic = -370.5 I also tried with your pdo variable in, but it doesn't help: mod2 Does this look reasonable? At any rate, the coefficient for year (the linear trend) is not significant with an s.e. nearly as large as the coefficient. (Basically the same if we look at 1950-2014 or 1923-2014.) Hopefully this gives you a start. arima is a little backwards, syntax-wise, from a regression, but has flexible ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA terms.
