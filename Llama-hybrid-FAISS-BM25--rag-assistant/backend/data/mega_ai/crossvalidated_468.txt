If you're coming from the programming side, one option is to use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for Python. There's an O'Reilly book, available freely , which might be a less dense and more practical introduction to building classifiers for documents among other things. If you're interested in beefing up on the statistical side, Roger Levy's book in progress, Probabilistic Models in Study of Language , might not be bad to peruse. It's written for cogsci/compsci grad students starting out with statistical NLP techniques.
