Word embedding for a single word

I want to tackle email similarity with a word embedding approach, not an expert in embedding text but it is possible to embed emails where similar emails have similar vectors? is that okay?. I know that I can do text similarity approaches like Jacard or Levenhenstein but that would be too expensive for the job that I want to do because I will need to compare email from user i against all other users emails and do this same thing for all user ( i try already this and is too expensive ). I thought maybe i was able to embed the emails somehow ( this is my question - which way would be the best way to do that ? ). My final goal would say that vector from the embed of mereo923@gmail.com would be very similar to mereo329@gmail.com . There is any approach which could help me with the creation of this embedding?
