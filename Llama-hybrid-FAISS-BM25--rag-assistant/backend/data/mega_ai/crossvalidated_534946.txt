Why absolute value of eigenvalues are used in PCA or LDA?

In PCA and LDA techniques, eigenvectors with the $k$ largest eigenvalues give principal components. However, when selecting these eigenvalues, are they to be sorted by the absolute value (regardless of sign) of the eigenvalues or just the eigenvalues themselves (with sign) ? That is, are the eigenvectors decided by the order of dominant eigenvalues ? And are thus just the dominant eigenvectors ? [ Dominant eigenvalues as defined here] If yes, can you provide a simple intuitive explanation of why sign of eigenvalue does not matter. I found some implementations doing so.
