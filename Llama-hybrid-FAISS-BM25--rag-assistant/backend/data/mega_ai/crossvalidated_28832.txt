Binary classification vs. continuous output with neural networks

Wikipedia says in binary classification : Tests whose results are of continuous values, such as most blood values, can artificially be made binary by defining a cutoff value, with test results being designated as positive or negative depending on whether the resultant value is higher or lower than the cutoff. Is there some guidance as to whether this is a desirable thing to do or not? I have data where the output value is continuous in the training set and I'm interested to know how strong the output variable is. Ideally an accurate continuous value would be the best, but I also would be satisfied with binary classification. My layman's assumption is that the binary classification task would be a little simpler. Is there any guidance as to whether to prefer continuous output vs binary classification?
