Use IP blacklists. Block spammer-owned networks , known bots with static IPs , etc. They're not enough for complete protection (you can't effectively fight Windows zombies with dynamic IPs), but significantly reduce volume of spam. As for the rest, let through posts that look completely innocent, e.g. you've detected that user's browser supports JavaScript post contains no links user isn't connecting from country/ISP from which you get more spam than visitors this IP hasn't submitted suspiciously many posts and require CAPTCHA in all other cases. If you want to put more effort into this, you should implement bayesian filtering for text and tracking reputation of liked domains. I've implemented a quite comprehensive filter â€“ Sblam! that implements all sorts of anti-spam techniques and interfaces several external blacklists. It's open-source, so have a look and copy the code!
