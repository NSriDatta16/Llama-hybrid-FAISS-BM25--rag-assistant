My dad has a garage filled with tools, and a lot of them I've never seen him use. But they're all there for a purpose. I believe it a worthy endeavor to make my programming repertoire as robust. There will be times when I need the big guns of C++, but for many things, I've been having a good time with C#, Java, and Ruby or Python if I can get away with it. The more we know, the less we're at the mercy of a language.
