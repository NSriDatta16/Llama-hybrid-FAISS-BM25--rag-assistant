1-D convolution neural network in Keras

I am exploring 1-D CNN with Keras. My data is $\mathit{k}\times\mathit{N}$ where $\mathit{k}$ is the number of time stamps and $\mathit{N}$ is the number of features. I want to apply CNN with 1-D convolution so that the each filter processes. Can some explain what is meant by dilation in the context of conv1d in Keras ( https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/ )?
