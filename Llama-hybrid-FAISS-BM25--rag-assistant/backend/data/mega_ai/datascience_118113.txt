Indeed, you cannot aggregate because two problems may predict the price of stocks in dollars and the squared meters of houses, respectively. Your solution is feasible but cannot adapt continually; the mean and standard deviation may change if new data arrives, and thus, both statistical moments must be recalculated. Distinctively, it is not strictly necessary to aggregate the metrics if your task is to select the best predictive model among many. In such a case, you can use the Critical Difference Diagram (CDD), as pointed out here . $^\dagger$ $^\dagger$ Please pay attention when interpreting CDD's results: higher metric values are better in classification tasks, while lower ones are preferred in regression.
