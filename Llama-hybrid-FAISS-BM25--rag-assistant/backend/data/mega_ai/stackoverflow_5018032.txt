The link given in the above answer is no longer correct -- Amazon had it's documentation reorganized. I think these are the correct pages to read: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/dev/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/s3-developer-guide/RESTAuthentication.html
