IE6 Float Drop

I seem to have a bit of a problem with IE6, normally I would just drop the support for IE6 but the project I'm working on there is a chance that there will be lots of people visiting the site with IE6. If you have IE6 and you want to check out the problem use my Home Page link. Basically div#content drops below the div#left. I tried Robert Nyman method but that didn't work. Any body know any other method ? #wrapper{ width:980px; margin:auto; background-color:#fff } #header{ width:980px; position:relative } #middle{ width: 980px; padding:20px; overflow:hidden; clear:both } #left{ float:left; width:200px } #main{ width:740px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 210px } #content { width: 480px; min-height: 400px; float:left } #right{ float:left; width:240px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px } #footer{ clear:both; width:980px; margin:auto; padding:20px 0 }
