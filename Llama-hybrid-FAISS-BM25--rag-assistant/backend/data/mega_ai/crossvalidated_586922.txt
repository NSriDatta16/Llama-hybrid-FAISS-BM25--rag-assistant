If you don't correct for batch effects in gene expression values, your modeling will be inefficient and results might be unreliable. Even with the "outcome variable ... balanced in the two batches," failure to adjust for batch effects will lead to increased variance in the results that will diminish your power to detect true differences related to outcome. That's the case whether you are doing standard differential gene expression or any other type of analysis like LASSO or random forest. That answers question 1. For question 2, a random forest doesn't lend itself to the easy interpretation of decision trees. See Section 8.2.2 of ISLR, second edition , which includes an example of a random-forest classification scheme based on gene-expression data. In particular, note that (page 344): in building a random forest, at each split in the tree, the algorithm is not even allowed to consider a majority of the available predictors. Random forest might improve your classification scheme, but it won't provide a clear path along the features like a decision tree. Thus I don't think that it would allay your fear (expressed in a comment) about two separate pathways being activated to lead to poor outcomes, either. With a binary outcome, I suspect that standard differential gene expression analysis comparing the two outcomes will be more powerful and interpretable way to start. Then evaluate the pathways containing the most differentially expressed genes.
