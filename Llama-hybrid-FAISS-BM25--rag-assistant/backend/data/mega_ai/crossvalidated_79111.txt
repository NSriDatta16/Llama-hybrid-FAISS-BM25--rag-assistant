Conditional Logistic Regression, Rare Events and R

I have a panel data set organized around 35 provincial units, with 110 binary "positive" outcomes in the dependent variable. This is for about 2600 observations in that data set. I have a couple questions. 1) Would it even be reasonable to run a logit at the national level, combining each province count? 2) Is it reasonable to try for a fixed-effects model, using condionoanl logit/clogit() in R? 3) Would a rare events model be a better alternative and is it possible to do it with fixed effects in R? Thanks.
