Hacking linear regression

Let's say I perform linear regression on some data that produces the following $R^2$ : $\text{RSS} = 1966815.13$ $\text{TSS} = 2145213.91$ $R^2 = 0.083$ Now let's say I bucket (take the average of successive equal size windows) the data and perform the exact same linear regression. This time the $R^2$ is: $\text{RSS} = 1187.56$ $\text{TSS} = 4758.32$ $R^2 = 0.75$ What have I just done here? I clearly haven't improved the explanatory power of the model over the original data, yet I've hacked the $R^2$ by averaging. What's the bias / variance argument of why this occurs? A graphical representation: Edit: I've reduced the total variance of the data, but the bias remains unaffected. When (if ever) is this a valid statistical approach?
