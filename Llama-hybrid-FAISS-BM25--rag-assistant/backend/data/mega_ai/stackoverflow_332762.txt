When you have a hidden layer is that you are creating a combined feature of the input. So, is the problem better tackled by more features of the existing input, or through higher-order features that come from combining existing features? This is the trade-off for a standard feed-forward network. You have a theoretical reassurance that any function can be represented by a neural network with two hidden layers and non-linear activation. Also, consider using additional resources for boosting, instead of adding more nodes, if you're not certain of the appropriate topology.
