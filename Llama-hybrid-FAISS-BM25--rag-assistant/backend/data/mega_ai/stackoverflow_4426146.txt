stopping a UIScrollView at a specific position

Im trying to implement a horizontal scroll view for an iPad app. The scroll view shows a series of images. After scrolling, when the scroll view stops I want the images to be aligned along specific points along the horizontal. To do this I tried 2 approaches: 1) Disable scrolling for the UIScrollView and instead implement a PanGestureRecogniser which would detect the translation and velocity of the "swipe/drag" motion and set the content offset of the scroll view accordingly to the required pre-determined points. But, the problem here is that if the user slowly drags the scroll view, the scroll view motion is very jerky because the retrieved x co-ordinated of the scroll view jump back and forth around the point the finger is pressed. For eg: x values goes from 50 to 70 when the finger moves along 60-70. How can i make the motion of the scroll view smooth? 2) Enable scrolling for the UIScrollView and check the end of deceleration and then set the content offset of the scroll view to adjust it to the necessary position. But the problem here is that the scroll view adjusts to its final position only after it stops decelerating and there is a visible delay and this animation does not look good too. Is there a way that i can detect when the scroll view is about to stop scrolling and then adjust its position instead of waiting it to end scrolling. From what iv read on some forums this wont be possible. 3) A paging scrollview will not work in this scenario as I dont want the entire width of images to be scrolled out. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can implement the above functionality.
