Computing a Gaussian posterior from a Gaussian prior and likelihood function in R

I'm new to both R and Bayesian statistics, and I have a problem where I have a normally distributed prior that elicits a mean and standard deviation. The introduced likelihood function is also normally distributed with a mean and standard deviation that can be drawn from a sample. Now I understand that a posterior is formed that will also be normally distributed. I have been asked to generate this in R, but I cannot find an example of R code where the posterior is formed from a normally distributed prior and likelihood function. Could someone please point me in the right direction. Thanks.
