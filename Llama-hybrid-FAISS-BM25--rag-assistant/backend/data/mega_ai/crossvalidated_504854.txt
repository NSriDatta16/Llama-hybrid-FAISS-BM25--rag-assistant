For datetime components, best trick is cyclical encoding. This lets the model learn that 1am and 11pm are similar (which isn't the case if you were to feed it raw variables of 01 and 23). Example code for month, or week of year: df['checkin_month_sin'] = np.sin((df["checkin_month"]-1)*(2.*np.pi/12)) df['checkin_month_cos'] = np.cos((df["checkin_month"]-1)*(2.*np.pi/12)) df['checkin_week_sin'] = np.sin((df["checkin_week"]-1)*(2.*np.pi/53)) df['checkin_week_cos'] = np.cos((df["checkin_week"]-1)*(2.*np.pi/53)) Here's a code example notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/datetime-embeddings-for-end-to-end-deep-learning And I give some more examples in a presentation I made, (lazily linking): https://github.com/ddofer/talk/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Time%20Series%20and%20Feature%20Engineering.pdf
