Jquery: Content Rotator / Slider question

I'm looking to overhaul a website for a friend of mine at http://gaonlinedriversed.com/ They threw together the current site with Joomla. You might want to turn your sound off before going to the site, it has a pretty annoying video that starts up, with no option to mute or pause it (one thing I'm fixing). Anyways, my question: I believe the site uses MooTools for the content slider on the home page which I'm not familiar with, but I am familiar with Jquery and love it. I've done various galleries / sliders before, but none of them really recreate the look and usability of the existing site. Namely, I'm looking for a "slider" that does: A few thumnail photos that change the main content which consist of html content (Picture, Header, Paragraph and button to more content). I've looked at Coda, Gallery View and few others, but none seem to do exactly what I'm trying to recreate. Any direction would be appreciated.
