Good question. But yes, that would be the expected behavior. I can only think of a 'hacky' solution to the problem, which would be to place an invisible div element with a very high z-index over the part where you don't want dropping to take place. This should provide a pragmatic solution to your problem, but it isn't pretty. In fact, a reasonably good solution would be to add that invisible element dynamically as soon as the drag action starts, so as to stop the user from dropping there. When the drag stops, you can remove it again. Update Ok, so learning that the first try doesn't work, I went to have a look at the jQuery docs . They specify a containment option, which is an element in which the sorting should be contained. So I'd say you can do the invisible element thing again, but this time place it exactly on top of the area you want to be able to sort in. Then, specify this element in the containment option. If that doesn't work, I'm out of advice ;)
