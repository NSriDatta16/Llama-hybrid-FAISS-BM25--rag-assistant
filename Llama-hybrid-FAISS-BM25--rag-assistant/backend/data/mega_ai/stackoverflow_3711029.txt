How do I dectect mobile devices while ignoring IPad

I want to ignore IPad as a mobile device in my application I'm currently using this expression to detect mobile devices: request.user_agent =~ /Mobile|webOS/ Standard stuff. The iPad agent string looks something like: Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.4 Mobile/7B405 Safari/531.21.10 I've tried the following without success: request.user_agent =~ /!(iPad)(Mobile|webOS)/ Please let me know what is wrong with the expression. Thank you.
