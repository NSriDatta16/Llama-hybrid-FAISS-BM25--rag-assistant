Well, I have no clue about plesk, but sftp uses ssh to tunnel the communication between client and server. Therefore, the user can access your server with ssh, and get a full fledged shell to do nasty stuff. If you don't pay attention he can read other users homes, or read your server's configs. Unless you chrooted the user, and took further care about hdd, cpu, mem, ... limits, you should not allow access to your server to a potentially untrustworthy user via ssh. To my knowledge, there is no way to allow sftp/scp without complete ssh access.
