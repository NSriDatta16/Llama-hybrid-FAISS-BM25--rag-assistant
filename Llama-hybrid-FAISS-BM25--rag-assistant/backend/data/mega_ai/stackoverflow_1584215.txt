Internet Explorer stuffs all of your form elements by name into the window object as properties, which is fragile, incompatible, difficult to use with any finesse -- and what makes your second example work. Other browsers simply take the clean route of not implementing that interface at all, leaving you with the proper DOM functions. Or a toolkit. jQuery really is quite nice. ;)
