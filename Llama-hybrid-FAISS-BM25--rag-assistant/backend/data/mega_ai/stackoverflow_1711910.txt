Make sure you are picking the relationship arrow from the Entity Relationship stencil. Drop the connector (arrow) on the surface. Pick the top of the arrow and drag into middle of the Orders table Pick the other end and drag into middle of the OrderDetails table. You can also select fields to connect in "Arrow definition tab". No need to specify foreign key in advance, it will auto-add once you make connection with the arrow.
