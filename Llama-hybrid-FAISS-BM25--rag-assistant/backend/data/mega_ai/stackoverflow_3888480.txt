jQuery limit sortable to parent table row

So I have a table which has several categories, with several items underneath in each category. Something like: Category1 Item1 Item2 Item3 Category2 item1 I want to be able to sort each "item" within its category only. So "item1" inside "category2" should not be able to be dragged to "category1". Not really sure how to accomplish this.
