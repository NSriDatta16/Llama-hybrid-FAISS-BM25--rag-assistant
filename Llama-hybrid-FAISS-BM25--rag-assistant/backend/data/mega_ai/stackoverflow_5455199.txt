I've put your code in an Android project and ran it on the emulator and it seems to be working fine. I would change the code to first check for a lastknown location, and after that check for location updates. Location location = locManager.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER); If that location is null, or too stale (timestamp) for your needs, you can start requesting location updates. (currently, you're first requesting location updates from the GPS, and then decide to retrieve its lastknownlocation). This might cause the location manager to stop querying the GPS. Also you need to ensure the following is in place : For GPS Provider, make sure the following permission is put in the manifest Ensure the GPS is turned on that you have sufficient GPS coverage. Do this by checking for the GPS icon in your Notification bar Test on a real device Although testing GPS location listeners works partly through the emulator, the behavior of an actual device will always be different. Debug on the emulator Basic GPS testing can be done using the emulator. Put a breakpoint in your locationlistener, and use the DDMS perspective to send some GPS coordinates to your AVD image.
