Neural Network problems

I am using an external library for Artificial Neural Networks in my project.. While testing the ANN, It gave me output of all NaN (not a number in C#) The ANN has 8 input , 5 hidden , 5 hidden , 2 output, and all activation layers are of Linear type , and it uses back-propagation, with learning rate 0.65 I used one testcase for training { -2.2, 1.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 5, 3, -5 } ,{ -0.3, 0.2 } for 1000 epoch And I tested it on { 0.2, -0.2, 5.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0, 35, 0.0 } which gave { NaN , NaN} Note: this is one example of many that produces same case... I am trying to discover whether it is a bug in the library, or an illogical configuration.. The reasons I could think of for illogical configuration: All layers should not be linear Can not have descending size layers, i.e 8-5-5-2 is bad.. Only one testcase ? Values must be in range [0,1] or [-1,1] Is any of the above reasons could be the cause of error, or there are some constraints/rules that I do not know in ANN designing..? Note: I am newbie in ANN
