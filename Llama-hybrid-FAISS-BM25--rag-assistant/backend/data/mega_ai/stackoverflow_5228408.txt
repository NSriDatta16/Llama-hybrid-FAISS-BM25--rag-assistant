MySQL Auto Increment Custom Values

I am trying to make a column in a mysql database that auto increments by one but goes from 0-Z and then rolls. For example 000, 001, 002, ..., 009, 00A, 00B, ..., 00Z, 010, ..., 0ZZ, ..., 100. I would like to have the database create the column through an auto incrementing field. The ideas I have are: Create a column for each character that goes from 0-36, then auto increment row N (where N is the least significant digit) by 1. Then add a trigger on each column to add 1 to column N-1 when column N reaches 36. Create a table with 36 rows where each row contains a character 0-Z and pull the appropriate character from the table with similar carry logic from the above Create a stored procedure to do the appropriate logic from item 1 Have the actual program generate a value and insert it into the table have a regular auto incrementing value and calculate the next value in the sequence (this is the least optimal as it makes it difficult to parse by a person just looking in the database) I was hoping that there was something elegant which would allow for this like a built in mechanism to do this that I just do not know. I have no knowledge on stored procedures / triggers so help with it would be greatly appreciated. I think the easiest way would be to have a lookup table for the characters and when row 36 is reached it is reset to 0 and then there is a carry to row N-1.
