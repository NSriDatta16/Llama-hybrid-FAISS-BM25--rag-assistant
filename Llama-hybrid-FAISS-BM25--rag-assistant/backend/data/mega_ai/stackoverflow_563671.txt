First of all, get a new job. ;) Second of all, because Open Source IS all volunteer, you don't have to commit to any specific schedule. I would say a couple of hours a day would be MORE then enough to make SIGNIFICANT contributions to any open source project. I tend to do most of my open source stuff on the weekends. I probably average about 3 hours during the week, and an additional 5-6 over the weekend. By the by, Open Source work is one of the best ways to "keep up" on new stuff ;)
