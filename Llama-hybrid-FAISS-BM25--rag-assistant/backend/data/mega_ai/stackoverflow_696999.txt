How to consolidate multiple rails application and share ressources

I have thi intranet I developped back then with PHP. I handles multiple apps and tools (blog, link sharing, file sharing, events, clendar...), and a big user autenthication system for logging in and authorisation management. I'd like to start re-building it with Rails. I don't want to build one big app. I'd like to build the site as multiple smaller apps, sharing a few common ressources like the user administration system, templates, layouts and navigation... Rails Engine provide a way to embed an app into another. I guess I could have a "main" app, embedding all other apps. But I don't feel it's the right way (I may be wrong) if I have 10-15 different apps. How would you do it ? Thanks.
