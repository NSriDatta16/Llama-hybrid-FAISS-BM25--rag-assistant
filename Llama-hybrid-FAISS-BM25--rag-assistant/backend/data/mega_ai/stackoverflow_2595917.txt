Assuming you are using gcc, when linking your library, set -fvisibility=hidden and in your library source, mark all of the functions you want to be visible as extern. I think this should work as long as openssl has not declared their own functions extern. I think if openssl has declared some symbols extern, you can manually force symbols to be hidden with pragmas. There are other options involved. Check the gcc docs in the fvisibility section for a full explanation of what is available to you.
