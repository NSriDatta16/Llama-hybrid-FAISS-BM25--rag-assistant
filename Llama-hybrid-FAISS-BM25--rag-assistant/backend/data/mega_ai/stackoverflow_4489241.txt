Assuming you have a "user control" (you should try to refer to them as partial view's in MVC) that looks like this: >" %> This means your partial view expects a list of Announcement objects. Now, the question is - where are you rendering this partial view ? You could be doing it from a master page, you could be doing it from a view, or you could be doing it from another partial view. Either way, the code to render the partial needs to look like this: But - where do you get the announcements from. Assuming you have a Repository/DAL/helper method to get the latest announcements - i think you should have the ViewModel's you require inheriting from a base ViewModel: public class AnnouncementViewModelBase { protected IEnumerable GetAnnouncements() { // call DAL } } Then any master/view/partial that needs to render the latest announcements partial should be bound to a ViewModel which inherits from that base view model. In the cases where the master/view/partial is not strongly-typed (e.g dynamic view), you can stick it in the ViewData. But if you have organized your view's correctly this shouldn't be required.
