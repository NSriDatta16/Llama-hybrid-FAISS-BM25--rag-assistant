When not to use gradient descent?

I am trying to understand whether application of Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) goes in every model where optimal parameter values are to be obtained? Take for example, a hypothetical time series updated based on Exponentially Weighted Moving Average(EWMA): X_t = alpha * X_(t-1) + (1 - alpha )* X^_t Can I simply apply SGD to determine appropriate alpha here? Thanks
