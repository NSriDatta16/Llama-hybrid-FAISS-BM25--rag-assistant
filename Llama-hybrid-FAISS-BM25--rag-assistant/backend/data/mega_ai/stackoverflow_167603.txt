Can you make the .vbp file read-only when you aren't editing it (ie, adding modules, etc)? As far as form files...I can't think of any good way at all to make VB not reorder them. But I have to say that I've never encountered this before. Are you sure that something else isn't going on? It's entirely possible that I just never paid any attention to this in the past, so I'm not saying you are mistaken, just offering my own observations.
