Delete duplicate rows according to condition

I am using PostgreSQL database. I have the data like below. id name1 name2 modified_date - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 40 Balfe | Pat | 2010-10-01 17:48:44.804823 41 Battigan | David | 42 Balfe | Pat | 2010-10-01 12:46:49.627593 44 Balfe | Pat | 2010-10-04 14:04:28.72415 45 Balfe | Pat | 46 Balfe | Pat | 2010-10-01 17:30:39.193153 47 Balfe | Pat | I want to delete some rows from the table. The conditions to delete are: It will delete duplicate records with modified_date = Null --> one copy of duplicate records should not be deleted. Records with modified date should not be deleted although they are duplicate. From the table above, the record with id 47 or 45 should be deleted.
