How do you compare music data

I want to write an app to rename sort and organize my music library (mp3's, wav's, flac's). I wanted to take a portion of the song, say the first minutes, and compare that to a database and then retrieve the song name and tag information. I have heard that you can do this with last.fm but a look through their api info didn't help. My question is, what is this called so i can google it better? nothing I am trying is helping much. This would be similar to the shazam android app. My preferred language would be Java, so I can run it on a few operating systems easier, but that might be subject to change depending on how I can do it.
