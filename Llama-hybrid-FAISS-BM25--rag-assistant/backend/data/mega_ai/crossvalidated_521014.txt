What does holding other variables fixed in a regression mean?

I am sorry if this sounds redundant but I couldn't find a good explanation on this anywhere else yet. I understand that controlling for a variable in a regression can be imagined by drawing separate regression lines through different values of that variable as illustrated here: Is there a difference between 'controlling for' and 'ignoring' other variables in multiple regression? (first figure). My question is, when we have several regression lines, how do we end up with a single regression coefficient? Is it an average of the slopes of all the separate lines or something? Let's say I regress wage on years of experience and education. I am interested in the effect of experience holding education fixed. So I run: $wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 experience + \beta_2 education + u$ And let's say $\beta_1$ turns out to be 2.3. So is 2.3 an average of all slopes across all education levels (average of all regression lines)? Thanks for your help!
