Display ALL categories that a product belongs to in Magento

I am conceptualizing a new Magento site which will have products that are included in several categories. What I am wondering is if I can display all categories a product is in on the product detail page. I know that it is possible to get the category, but is it possible to display a list of all categories which a product belongs to? For example, a shirt may be included in the Shirts category, as well as in Designers and Summer . Ideally, I would like to be able to display the following: More from: Men > Shirts Men > Designers > BarnabÃ© Hardy Men > Summer
