Magento - How can I run code when my order is canceled or refunded

My payment module is required to sent notifications to the payment service if an order is canceled or refunded. I assume that the "Cancel" button on the order page (in the administration backend) will cancel the order, and that the "Credit memo" button (after an invoice has been created) will refund the order. How do I run my code on these events? I tried using the cancel() method in my payment method model, but the code did not run.
