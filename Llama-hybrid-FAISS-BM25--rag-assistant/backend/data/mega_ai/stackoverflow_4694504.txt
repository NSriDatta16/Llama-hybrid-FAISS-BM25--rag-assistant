I'd recommend importing the wst.ui bundle into your workspace as a source project. You can do this through: File -> Import... -> Plugins and Fragments. Select the org.eclipse.wst.xsl.ui and choose project with source folders. The schema directory should be imported along with it, but if it's not, you may need to manually import it (ie- copy and paste from the zip file). This will ensure that the exsd is available.
