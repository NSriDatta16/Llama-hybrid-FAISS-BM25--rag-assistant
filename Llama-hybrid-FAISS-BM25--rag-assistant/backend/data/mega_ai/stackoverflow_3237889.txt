Verify Mercurial Checkins

Is there any way to verify/authenticate checkins in Mercurial? I'd like to roll out HG across our organisation (60+ developers) and I'd like a way to ensure everyone's checkins are from the correct user and that they are all in the correct format. During trials we found that some users checked in under completely different usernames (copied someone else's .hgrc file) and others checked in under a number of different versions of their name (first name, full name, email address, etc) using different clients. We could add a hook to enforce the format of the username but it still doesn't guarantee that it's the correct user. Does Mercurial have anything to manage this or am I just stuck in a CVS/SVN way of thinking? Thanks, Dave.
