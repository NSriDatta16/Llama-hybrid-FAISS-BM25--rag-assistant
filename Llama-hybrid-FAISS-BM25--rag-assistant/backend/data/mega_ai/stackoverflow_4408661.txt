If your blocks (allocated and deallocated memory) are still smaller that a C library allocator handles without problems with fragmentation than you must not face any memory fragmentation. For example take a look at my own question about allocators: Small block allocator on Linux (or RedHat Linux) to avoid memory fragmentation . In other words. You have implented your own ::operator new() and in it you call malloc() and pass a slighly bigger block size. malloc() is in a C library and it is responsible not only for allocating and deallocating but also for avoiding memory fragmentation. If you do not frequently allocate and free blocks with sizes bigger than the allocator can handle efficently then you can expect that there will be on memory fragmentation.
