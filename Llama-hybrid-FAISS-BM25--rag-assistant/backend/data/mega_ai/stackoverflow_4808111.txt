Minimum message length algorithm

I have bundles of objects different size ( lot of objects can have same size, example: I have 54 object of 6B, 76 of 10B, 79 of 24B etc. The size of the objects are 6, 8 ,10 .... bytes ). I need to pack that bundle in couple messages ( each message has maximum length 256 bytes). Problem is how to get the solution with the minimum number of messages? Is there any known algorithm for this? Do I need Hopfield neural network for this?
