Average Expected Mean Squared Error = Expected Mean Squared Error?

In my university lecture, I was introduced to the mean squared error $ L2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N (t_n - y_n)^2 $ and its expected value $ E[L2] = \frac{1}{N} E[\sum_{n=1}^N (t_n - y_n)^2]$, where $ t_n, 1 \leq n \leq N $, come from i.i.d. distributions with gaussian noise (sample values) and $ y_n, 1 \leq n \leq N $, are the values predicted by the linear model that was fit(ted?) to the data set. Now I was wondering whether you could further simplify to $ E[L2] = E[(t_1 - y_1)^2] $, since the $ t_n $ come from identical distributions. Is my speculation correct?
