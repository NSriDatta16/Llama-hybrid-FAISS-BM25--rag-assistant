You already know how to program; in order to prepare yourself for a real life job, the most important thing is probably not how to program better, but to learn the things you'll have to do that aren't programming. In your workplace, you most likely won't be asked to write line "fire and forget" programs, but work in a team on large applications. In order to do that effectively, you need to learn: How to communicate effectively with analysts, customers, managers and your fellow programmers How to plan and coordinate work: using source control systems and bug tracking systems, working with written specifications, following a development process - "software engineering" Perhaps most importantly: get used to working with other people's code - third party libraries, frameworks, and of course colleagues' code. This, too, can most effectively be learned through hands-on experience in a real project. For me, the big eye-opener was working in a group of about 10 students in an experimental project organized by university with some industry support. Perhaps you can find or organize something similar at your university? If it has a chair dealing with software engineering, they should be happy to do something like that if they aren't already. Failing that, joining an open source project is good too.
