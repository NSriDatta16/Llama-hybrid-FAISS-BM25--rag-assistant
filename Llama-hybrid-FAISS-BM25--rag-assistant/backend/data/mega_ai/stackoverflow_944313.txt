Take a look at Fame, see http://www.squeaksource.com/Fame.html We use a specialized subclass of Collection that updates the opposite end when you add or remove elements. Also, you can annotate your classes with pragmas to annotate relations. These pragmas are used by the Fame framework to do all kind of nice stuff.
