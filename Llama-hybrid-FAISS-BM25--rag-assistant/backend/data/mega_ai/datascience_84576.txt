Indeed you can have two different model architectures and they yield the similar output but that does not generalize on all the data input. For example SVM with linear kernel and logistic regression can give you similar results. For neural network, RCNN and CNN-LSTM can too have similar results, but it depends entirely on the input. For the submitted architectures that you have provided you need to code and test them yourself.
