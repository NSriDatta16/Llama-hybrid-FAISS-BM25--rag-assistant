Numerical instability vs infinite odds ratio

This is a subtle question which I don't think has been precisely asked so please read carefully before voting to close: It's well known that GLMs, notably logistic regression, can spit out bizarre output with little to no warning or help to the analyst when the data are sparse or when there is separation or quasiseparation. GLMs estimated with the Newton Raphson method trigger an early termination due to fitted probabilities that are numerically one or zero, meaning the floating point arithmetic doesn't have the precision to identify whether a boundary estimate maximizes the likelihood. Are there algorithms or other approaches to finding and reporting possibly infinite coefficients in bivariate or multivariate GLMs models that terminate early due to numerical instability? Addendum: While this question has excellent answers, it requires that we actually know that separation has occurred. It is not necessarily the case that we know this. For instance, in multiple dimensions it can be very hard to detect.
