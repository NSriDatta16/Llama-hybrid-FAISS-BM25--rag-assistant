Mirroring file moves with rsync

The proprietary software that we're using for backups (sadface) generates a series of images that we use rsync to sync over to an off-site location. The files generated look something like: a.bak b.bak c.bak So we sync those across and get exactly the same structure on the off-site machine. Then the backup program runs again and we get something like: archive/a.bak archive/b.bak c.bak d.bak e.bak So the rsync job runs and we end up with something like: archive/a.bak archive/b.bak a.bak b.bak c.bak d.bak e.bak Obviously, we would prefer the off-site machine to look like the on-site machine does, to avoid clutter and save on storage space. Is there any way to get rsync to mirror the moves that have happened on-site, or are we going to have to work out something outside of rsync ?
