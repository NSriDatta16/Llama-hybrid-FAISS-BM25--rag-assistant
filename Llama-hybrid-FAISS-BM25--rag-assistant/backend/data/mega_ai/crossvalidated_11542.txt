Each outcome may be thought of a bernoulli trial with success probability $p$. A ${\rm Bernoulli}(p)$ random variable has mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)$. Therefore the average of $n$ independent ${\rm Bernoulli}(p)$ random variables also has mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)/n$, which is typically estimate by $\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})/n$. So, in your example the standard error of your mean estimate is $1/\sqrt{4n}$.
