How do you return draggable content to their original positions in iPhone dev?

I am wanting to create a button in my iPhone app that when touched will return other draggable elements to their original position. I have looked at the Apple "MoveMe' example, but that returns the button to the center of the screen. I want to be able to position draggable objects around the screen, drag the objects within the app, and then return them to their original starting positions by pressing a designated button. Any help appreciated!
