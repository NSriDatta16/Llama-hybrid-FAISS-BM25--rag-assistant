Obtaining motion vectors from raw video

I'd like to know if there is any good (and freely available) text, on how to obtain motion vectors of macro blocks in raw video stream. This is often used in video compression, although my application of it is not video encoding. Code that does this is available in OSS codecs, but understanding the method by reading the code is kinda hard. My actual goal is to determine camera motion in 2D projection space, assuming the camera is only changing it's orientation (NOT the position). What I'd like to do is divide the frames into macro blocks, obtain their motion vectors, and get the camera motion by averaging those vectors. I guess OpenCV could help with this problem, but it's not available on my target platform.
