Interpretation of Odds Ratio of Zero

In logistic regression, does an odds ratio of zero make sense, and if so, what's the interpretation. I've only been able to locate one reference that specifically refers to OR of 0: Making Sense of Data: A Self Instruction Manual on the Interpretation of Epidemiological Data (Abramson et al, 2001 ) p113 which just states that an odds ratio of zero indicates one of the odds being compared must be zero, and that it indicates a strong negative association (unless the other odds is close to zero). If an OR of 1 indicates no association, OR of 0 must indicate infinite association ? In that case, is a predictor with an OR of zero a predictor that results in complete separation? I'm not sure the background of the study is relevant to the question, but just in case: the DV is the presence or absence of medium scale residential development in a neighbourhood, and the IV with a odds ratio of 0 is the median house / land sales price per square metre, which theory says is likely to be a predictor of the scale of residential development. The variable was significant in the logistic regression.
