To summarize: condition (aka treatment ) has two levels, "DRUG" and "NO DRUG". And gene (aka gene_name ) has three levels, "A", "B" and "C". The "NO DRUG" and "C" levels are the reference levels for the condition and gene variables, respectively. And the research question is: For each gene does the treatment change its length? That is, estimate the average difference in log length due to treatment, for each of the three genes A, B and C. Since both fixed effects are categorical, the model coefficients have straightforward interpretation: The intercept is how much of the variance the model can't account for (a bucket for "other stuff") This is the population-level E(log(length) | condition = "NO DRUG", gene = "C"). That is, the average log length of gene C when no treatment is applied. conditionDRUG is telling me the effect of the drug on ALL genes This is the population-level difference E(log(length) | condition = "DRUG", gene = "C") - E(log(length) | condition = "NO DRUG", gene = "C"). This is, the change in the average log length of gene C due to the treatment. It's the answer to the research question for gene C. gene_nameA is gene A compared with the missing gene, C, which I guess is the reference? This is the population-level difference E(log(length) | condition = "NO DRUG", gene = "A") - E(log(length) | condition = "NO DRUG", gene = "C"). That is, the difference between the average log length of un-treated A gene and untreated C gene. gene_nameB same as above but for B conditionDRUG:gene_nameA these last two I don't quite understand. Are the relative to the missing interaction term or what? Yes, these terms are interactions defined as population-level differences compared to the intercept. So E(log(length) | condition = "DRUG", gene = "A") - E(log(length) | condition = "NO DRUG", gene = "C"). This interaction doesn't answer the research question directly because both condition and gene change while we want to condition on gene and estimate the difference due to treatment. Here is where it's helpful to express the research question in terms of pairwise comparisons of marginal effects and compute those comparisons with either marginaleffects or emmeans . This approach scales effortlessly with larger and more complex models. fit
