Cribbing from The Pragmatic Programmer, you could use a DSL to encapsulate the rules and write a process engine. For your presented problem, a solution might look like: MATCH{ Soccer soccerBaseVal IsMale 5 !IsMale 1 } SWITCH{ Monday 12 Tuesday 13 } Then match everything in the first col of MATCH, and the first item in each SWITCH you come to. You can make whatever syntax you feel like, then just write a bit of script to cram that into code (or use Xtext because it looks pretty cool).
