I avoid correlated subqueries (noncorrelated subqueries and derived tables are OK) and any cursors that I can avoid. Also avoid while loops if you can. Think in terms of sets of data not row-by-row processing. If you are using a UNION, check to see if UNION ALL will work instead. There is a potential results difference, so make sure before you make the change. I always look at the word DISTINCT as a clue to see if there is a better way to present the data. DISTINCT is costly compared to using a derived table or some other method to avoid it's use. Avoid the implied join syntax to avoid getting an accidental cross join (which people often fix, shudder, with distinct). (Generating a list of 4 million records and then distincting to get the three you want is costly.) Avoid views that call other views! We have some folks who designed one whole client database that way and performance is HORRIBLE! Do not go down that path. Avoid syntax like WHERE MyField Like "%test%' That and other non-saragable where clauses can keep the optimizer from using indexes.
