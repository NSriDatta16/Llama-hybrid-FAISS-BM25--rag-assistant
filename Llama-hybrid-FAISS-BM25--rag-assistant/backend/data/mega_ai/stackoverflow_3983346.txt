There are a number of problems with your request: The list of people who can maintain an iText fork is fairly short. I happen to be one of them. ;) The list of people who can maintain an iText fork and are willing to potentially thwart Bruno's efforts to finally make some money from iText is (was when this was initially written) zero. I am certainly not one of them. So there are lots of folks floating around who would love some free (little 'f') code for their commercial app. They can use 2.1.7 and deal with any bugs, go it alone, share their source, or shell out some money. (And yes, I realize the hypocrisy of maintaining an MPL fork while encouraging others to pony up some dough. I've tried to do that with my own company, but my efforts thus far have not born fruit.)
