AIC and BIC values by auto.arima and manual ARIMA

A time series of yearly data, I want to compare the AIC and BIC values by auto.arima and manual ARIMA. library(forecast) drink I want to replicate it, so do a manual with same ARIMA(0,1,0): drink.fit To get the AIC and BIC values: AIC(drink.fit) BIC = AIC(drink.fit,k = log(length(drink_ts))) BIC # AIC: 138.7121 # BIC: 138.2272 The AIC and BIC values by auto.arima and manual ARIMA are slightly different. Does it matter? Am I missing anything in the manual ARIMA? (by the way, if thereâ€™s a direct way to get the AIC and BIC from the manual ARIMA) Thank you.
