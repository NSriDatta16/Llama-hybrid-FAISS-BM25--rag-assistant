Silverlight 3 Offline Mode

Has anyone found that the userbase is more reluctant to install Silverlight 3 Apps in offline mode because they have no control over "where" the app is installed to? I've had a few issues of a similar nature in the past, with 'power users' getting upset that they can't specify install directories. Are there any workarounds? Any way to get the Silverlight offline installs to prompt for specific install locations and the like? The specific reason given is that users want to install apps to remote storage, like a USB stick or something.
