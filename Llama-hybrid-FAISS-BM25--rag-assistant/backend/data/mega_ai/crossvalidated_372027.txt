Controlling for categorical variables when generating logistic regression elasticity curve

Assume we have a multiple logistic regression model with 3 continuous independent variables ( x1,x2,x3 ). I understand that if we want to create an elasticity curve for a continuous variable of interest (let's say x1 ) in a multiple logistic regression model, first we need to control for all the other continuous variables ( x2 and x3 ) by averaging them and using the averages in the logistic regression equation to generate the predicted probabilities ( y^ ) over a range of expected values for the variable of interest, x1 . (see Miller, Marketing Data Science, ch.2 fig 2.4) My question is what if we have a binary variable and a categorical variable in the model. How do we control for them? I would assume that we have to create a separate curve for each combination of the 2 categorical variables. Any guidance would be much appreciated.
