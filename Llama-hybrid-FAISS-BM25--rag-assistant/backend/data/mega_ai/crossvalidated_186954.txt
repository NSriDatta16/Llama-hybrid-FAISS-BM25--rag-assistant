For tabular data of the following form: $$ \begin{array}{c|ccc} & Y & \bar{Y} & & \\ \hline X & w_{11} & w_ {12} & w_{1.} \\ \bar{X} & w_{21} & w_{22} & w_{2.}\\ & w_{.1} & w_{.2} & w_{..}\\ \end{array}$$ A logistic regression model does not explicitly model the counts of the $X$ which is nice when $X$ is not representative of the population of interest (such as in some matched designs). The parameters estimated are the odds in those with $\bar{X}$ (intercept) and odds ratios (odds in those with $X$ divided by odds in those with $\bar{X}$). The odds are ratios of risks. In a logistic regression model, the outcome $Y$ is a binary 0/1 value where the frequency weights are given by the $w$s. A loglinear model estimates risks. So, unconditional on $w_{1.}$ or $w_{2.}$ the loglinear model (which is a Poisson model), estimates the risks of having $X$ or $\bar{X}$ in this sample (treating the sample as representative of some generalized population). Similarly for $w_{.1}$ and $w_{.2}$. The estimated values represent risks of outcome versus risks of not having an outcome. Ratios of risks for opposite events are odds, the same odds derived from the logistic model. In this Poisson model, the $w$s are treated as the count outcomes, and 0/1 indicators of the tabular position of the $Y$ and the $X$ are adjusted. If one further controls for the interaction between them, well you obtain ratios of ratios of risks, or ratios of odds, or an odds ratios. Thus, using two different modeling techniques you estimate the exact same thing. Example R code: x With example output > table(x,y) y x 0 1 0 30 18 1 24 28 > exp(coef(fit1)) (Intercept) x 0.600000 1.944444 > exp(coef(fit2)) (Intercept) y x y:x 30.000000 0.600000 0.800000 1.944444 The one-to-one correspondance of logistic regression parameters to those obtained in poisson regression is a consequence of that which I described above. The odds ratio: a d/(b c) = 30*28/24/18 = 1.9444 is the measure of association between $x$ and $y$
