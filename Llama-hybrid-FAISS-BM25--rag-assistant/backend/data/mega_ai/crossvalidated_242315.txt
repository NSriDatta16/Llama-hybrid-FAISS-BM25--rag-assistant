what does one mean by numerical integration is too expensive?

I am reading about Bayesian inference and I came across the phrase "numerical integration of the marginal likelihood is too expensive" I do not have a background in mathematics and I was wondering what exactly does expensive mean here? Is it just in terms of computation power or is there something more.
