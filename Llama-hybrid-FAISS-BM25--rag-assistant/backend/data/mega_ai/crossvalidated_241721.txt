Can I safely remove feature from my model

Lets say I have a simple logistic regression model that is built based on 5 features: $A,B,C,D,E$. I measured its performance via Cross Validation and learned that the F-score is 0.7. I then removed features $B$ and $D$ and noticed that the F-score improved to 0.75. Is my intuition right that the model is now better targeting my data and I can safely remove and essentially forget about those features in future fine tuning my model?
