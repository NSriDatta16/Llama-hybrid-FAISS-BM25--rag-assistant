In the case in which $y(t)$ is real (to keep it simple) it means that values above the mean of $y(t-k)$ tend to be followed by values above the mean of $Y(t)$; the interpretation is the same as for your $X$ and $Y$, just replace $y(t)$ and $y(t-k)$ in place of $X$ and $Y$. The Fourier transform of a signal will in general be complex valued; the square modulus of the Fourier transform would show a peak as you said. It turns our that the Fourier transform of the covariance sequence is the square modulus of the Fourier transform of the signal (up to a constant, depending on how you define things). This is not hard to see: the covariance sequence is the convolution of the (centered) series with itself, and the Fourier transform of the convolution of two sequences is the product of the respective Fourier transforms. Sometimes the series are complex valued and that is the way of defining the covariance in such cases. I think looking at books such as Brillinger's Time Series: Data Analysis and Theory or Jenkins-Watts Spectral analysis and its Applications , just to name two off the top of my head will help you with issues such as these.
