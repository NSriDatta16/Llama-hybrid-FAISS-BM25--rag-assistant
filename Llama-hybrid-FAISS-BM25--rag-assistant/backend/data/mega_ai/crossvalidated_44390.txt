Sampling distributions help with questions

Possible Duplicate: Probability of mean of random sample being in a certain range When a pizza restaurantâ€™s delivery process is operating effectively, pizzas are delivered in an average of 45 minutes with a standard deviation of 6 minutes. Suppose each night, 9 deliveries are selected at random and their delivery times are recorded. For the sake of argument, assume that the pizza deliveries are normally distributed. (3 pts each) What is the probability that the average time for the sample mean each night is within 2 minutes of the population mean? What is the probability that the average time for the sample mean each night is within 2.5 minutes of the mean? What is the probability that the average time for the sample mean is within 4 minutes of the mean? I'm doing some research and teaching myself how to solve these, any help on the answers?
