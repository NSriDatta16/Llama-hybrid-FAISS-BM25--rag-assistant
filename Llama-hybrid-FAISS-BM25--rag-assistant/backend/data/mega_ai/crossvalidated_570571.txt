Importance of Fourier terms in time series forecasting

I am trying to forecast a time series in Python by using auto_arima and adding Fourier terms as exogenous features. The data come from kaggle's forecasting challenge. The specificity of this time series is that it has daily data with weekly and annual seasonalities. Multiple sources have used SARIMAX + Fourier terms and/or auto arima with fourier terms. Why do we use fourier terms? What value they bring into the model? what are alternatives to fourier terms?
