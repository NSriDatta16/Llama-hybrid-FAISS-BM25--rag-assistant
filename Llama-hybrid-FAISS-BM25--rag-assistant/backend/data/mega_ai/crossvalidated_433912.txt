Extract standard errors from Arima model applied to groups using sweep

I am following the sweep vignette on Forecasting Time Series Groups in the tidyverse , see here . sweep is the broom package for time series data. I am estimating an AR(1) model using Arima from the forecasting package on each group. I can estimate the AR(1) for each group, and I can report the coefficients tidily with sw_tidy . However I cannot report the standard errors that correspond to the coefficients tidily . ind_ts is a dataframe where rows are groups and there is a column data_ts . An element of the column data_ts is a list of time series data. I use the following command to apply the Arima model to the time-series data in each row of data_ts : ind_ar % mutate(fit.ar = map(data_ts, Arima)) The column fit.ar contains the output of the AR(1) model applied to each group's time series. To get the coefficients of this AR(1) in tidy format I use sw_tidy : ind_ar %>% mutate(tidy = map(fit.ar, sw_tidy)) %>% unnest(tidy) However I would also like a column with the corresponding standard errors for estimates i.e. ind_ar$std.er .
