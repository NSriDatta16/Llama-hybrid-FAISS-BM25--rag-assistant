Zero inflated Count Data treatment with XGBOOST

I am planning to run an xgboost in response data that is: Count data (0 to 15) Very right skewed Zero inflated (lots more zero than other counts) In the XBG package with R, I have specified count:poisson as my objective, but the predictions doesnâ€™t seem to account for zero inflation. My question is how can I account for zero inflation in this case? Thanks!
