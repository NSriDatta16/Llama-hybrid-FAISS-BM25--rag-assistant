How to increase position offsets in a lucene index to correspond to tags?

I am using Lucene 3.0.3. In preparation to using SpanQuery and PhraseQuery, I would like to mark paragraph boundaries in my index in a way that will discourage these queries from matching across paragraph boundaries. I understand that I need to increment position by some suitably large value in the PositionIncrementAttribute when processing text to mark paragraph boundaries. Let's assume that in the source document, my paragraph boundaries are marked by ... pairs. How do I set up my token stream to detect the tags? Also, I don't actually want to index the tags themselves. For the purposes of indexing, I would rather increment the position of the next legitimate token, rather than emitting a token that corresponds to the tag, since I don't want it to affect search.
