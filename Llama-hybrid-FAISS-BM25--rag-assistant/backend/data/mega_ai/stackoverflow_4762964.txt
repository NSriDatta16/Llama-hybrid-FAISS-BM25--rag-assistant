I'd vote for using the date/datetime types, just for the sake of simplicity/consistency. If you do store it as a character string, store it in ISO 8601 format: http://www.iso.org/iso/date_and_time_format http://xml.coverpages.org/ISO-FDIS-8601.pdf http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html Among other things, ISO 8601 date/time string (A) collate properly, (B) are human readable, (C) are locale-indepedent, and (D) are readily convertable to other formats. To crib from the ISO blurb, ISO 8601 strings offer representations for the following: Date Time of the day Coordinated universal time (UTC) Local time with offset to UTC Date and time Time intervals Recurring time intervals Representations can be in one of two formats: a basic format that has a minimal number of characters and an extended format that adds characters to enhance human readability. For example, the third of January 2003 can be represented as either 20030103 or 2003-01-03. [and] offer the following advantages over many of the locally used representations: Easily readable and writeable by systems Easily comparable and sortable Language independent Larger units are written in front of smaller units For most representations the notation is short and of constant length One last thing: If all you need to do is store a date, then storing it in the ISO 8601 short form YYYYMMDD in a char(8) column takes no more storage than a datetime value (and you don't need to worry about the 3 millisecond gap between the last tick of the one day and the first tick of the next. But that's a matter for another discussion. If you break it up into 3 columns — YYYY char(4), MM char(2), DD char(2) you'll use up the same amount of storage, and get more options for indexing. Even better, store the fields as a short for yyyy (4 bytes), and a tinyint for each of MM and DD — now you're down to 6 bytes for the date. The drawback, of course, to decomposing the date components into their constituent parts is that conversion to proper date/time data types is complicated.
