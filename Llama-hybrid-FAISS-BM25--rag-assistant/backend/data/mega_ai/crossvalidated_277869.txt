If you are interested in predicting future binge drinking from a set of variables, then a decision tree may be the way to go. If you are interested in which variables are associated with binge drinking, I would suggest that you should switch up to using logistic regression for the categorical dependent variables and regular old OLS regression for the continuous dependent variables.
