This project has several aspects that can be addressed separately: Scanning . Can the sheets be separated and fed through a sheet feeder? If yes, go for a document scanner like fujitsu fi-6140 or similar. Works great, up to 3000 pages a day. Still a lot of work, mind you. If not, go for a camera setup. Look at http://diybookscanner.org/ and similar professional setups. Expect to invest a minute per 10 to 100 pages, depending on system. OCR . Works fine on printed text. Go for pdf with text in picture, so you dont have to proofread. Meaning you see the scanned picture in the pdf, onto which the ocr-ed text is superimposed. If this document gets printed, it is in effect a photocopy, but you can copy and paste the text from it. Data storage and Retrieval . The solution for this depends very much on the plans you have for your data. How many people should access it? If alone, a file system solution might be ok. If many, think about a digital library system like Dspace or Greenstone Digital Library.
