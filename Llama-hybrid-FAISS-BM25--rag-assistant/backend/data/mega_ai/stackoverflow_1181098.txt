Just the first part of that question can fill entire books. Just some quick choices: lm() for standard linear models glm() for generalised linear models (eg for logistic regression) rlm() from package MASS for robust linear models lmrob() from package robustbase for robust linear models loess() for non-linear / non-parametric models Then there are domain-specific models as e.g. time series, micro-econometrics, mixed-effects and much more. Several of the Task Views as e.g. Econometrics discuss this in more detail. As for goodness of fit, that is also something one can spend easily an entire book discussing.
