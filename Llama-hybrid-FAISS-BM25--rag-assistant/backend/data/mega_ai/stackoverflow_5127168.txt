caching font-face fonts

I'm using @font-face to embed a font hosted on TypeFront, but my font is not cached by the browser (Firefox 3.6.13 and Epiphany 2.30.2). This is causing a FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) on Firefox and MFOMT (Momentary Flash of Missing Text, I just made that one up) on Epiphany every single time the page loads (I'm Ok with a FOUC/MFOMT the first time the the page loads, but not everytime). I'm trying to avoid having to embed the font in CSS in Base64 if possible and I can't host the font myself. Why is the font not cached? Are there any alternative free font hosting service that does not have this problem? Test page: TypeFront Cache Test @font-face { font-family: "Journal"; src: url("http://typefront.com/fonts/825588825.ttf") format("truetype"); } h1 { font-family: "Journal"; } Test text If I observe in Firebug, the Net tab shows that the font is served with "200 OK" every time the page loads, instead of "304 Not Modified" or other indications that a cached font are being used (e.g. the browser not even attempting a HTTP request).
