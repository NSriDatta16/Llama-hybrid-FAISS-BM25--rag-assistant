I think that the best way is to create on your server a php/asp/... page that will scrape data from the remote website. Then, in that page, you can use some CURL to scrape data. See here . Next, you return the data in the format you want (XML/jSon/etc...). Finally, you can easily call that script from your code. On the other hand, pay attention to not scrape anything as skimming is generally illegal and Apple ca reject your app because of that. There is a nice post talking about it.
