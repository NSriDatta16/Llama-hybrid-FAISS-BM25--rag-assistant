Adding Row Specific context menu to an UltraWinGrid

I'm a newbie using Infragistics . I'm trying to add context menu to a specific row/column in UltraWinGrid , which I'm not able to. Looks like adding context menu to the grid is simple but adding it to a specific row/column is not straight forward. Can you please tell me how to do this?
