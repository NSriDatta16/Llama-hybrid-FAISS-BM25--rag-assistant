Why use the sample SE when calculating the p value?

In the OpenIntro text book, there is the following example: Globally, the average sleep for a high school student is 7 hours. The researchers at the rural school conducted a simple random sample of n = 110 students on campus. They found that these students averaged 7.42 hours of sleep and the standard deviation of the amount of sleep for the students was 1.75 hours. So: H0: mean sleep time = 7 hours H1: mean sleep time != 7 hours They then go on to calculate the p-value, which is the probability of seeing data that is at least as in favor of H1, assuming that H0 is correct. So we need to quantify how likely it is to see a value of 7.42 or greater if the true mean is 7 (H0 correct). In order to quantify this, we surely need to know something about the true variation as well (H0 correct)? is the distribution tight? (in which case 7.42 is unlikely), or is it wide (in which case 7.42 seams reasonable). but the true variation is unknown, only the sample variation is known. I would like to get an understanding as to how the sample variation (or the later derived standard error of the sample) can give us insight into the true variation (assuming H0)
