using MediaElement play video issue

I am using the popular sl2videoplayer from codeplex to play video, and everything is fine when I play remote video on an IIS web server. Sl2videoplayer could be found here, http://www.codeplex.com/sl2videoplayer But when I open the default.html locally from disk (double click default.html to open in IE), there is error message in IE like this (there is a warning sign in IE at the left bottom corner, please refers to the below screen snapshot). There is no code change in sl2videoplayer except that I change the media file to Output.wmv as shown below. Any ideas what is wrong? The effect I want to achieve is I want to play local file using the silverlight player without connecting to server (when disconnected from internet), could we do that using Siverlight. default.html I am using (I copied Output.wmv into ClientBin directory, and VideoPlayer.xap resides in the same directory) Error message in IE and related screen snapshot, Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; CIBA; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MS-RTC LM 8; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; OfficeLiveConnector.1.4; OfficeLivePatch.1.3) Timestamp: Fri, 10 Jul 2009 06:20:19 UTC Message: Unhandled Error in Silverlight 2 Application Code: 4004 Category: ManagedRuntimeError Message: System.NotSupportedException: The URI prefix is not recognized. at VideoPlayer.App.Application_UnhandledException(Object sender, ApplicationUnhandledExceptionEventArgs e) at MS.Internal.Error.CallApplicationUEHandler(Exception e) at MS.Internal.Error.GetXresultForUserException(Exception ex) Line: 53 Char: 13 Code: 0 URI: file:///C:/Test/sl2videoplayer/VideoPlayerWeb/default.html Screen snapshot in IE, http://i31.tinypic.com/xgh84i.jpg thanks in advance, George
