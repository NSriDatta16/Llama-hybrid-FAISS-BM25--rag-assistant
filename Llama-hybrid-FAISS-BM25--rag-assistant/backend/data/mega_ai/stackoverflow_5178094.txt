Neural networks - Finding o/p from two distinct i/p patterns

I have two distinct (unknown relationship) types of input patterns and I need to design a neural network where I would get an output based on both these patterns. However, I am unsure of how to design such a network. I am a newbie in NN but I am trying to read as much as I can. In my problem as far as I can understand there are two input matrices of order say 6*1 and an o/p matrix of order 6*1. So how should I start with this? Is it ok to use backpropogation and a single hidden layer? e.g.-> Input 1 Input 2 Output 0.59 1 0.7 0.70 1 0.4 0.75 1 0.5 0.83 0 0.6 0.91 0 0.8 0.94 0 0.9 How do I decide the order of the weight matrix and the transfer function? Please help. Any link pertaining to this will also do. Thanks.
