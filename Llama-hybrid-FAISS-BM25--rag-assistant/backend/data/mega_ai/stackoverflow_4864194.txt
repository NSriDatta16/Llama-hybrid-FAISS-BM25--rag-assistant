Newbie question about Continuous integration and selenium tests,

I'm very new to C.I. but I have recently inherited a project where Team City has just been implemented and I'm slowly getting my head around it. One thing we would like to do is run some Selenium Tests as part of the build process. I've created the selenium tests and can run them successfully via nunit-console on my development machine. The build server builds the project and then deploys it (A web forms application as it happens) to a staging server. Before each selenium test we set the database to a known state, i.e. to only have certain records in place - that way each test is independent of the others. The problem is the staging server will be used by real "human" testers so this would cause them a problem with the database continually being reset (records being removed etc.) The question is should I really also deploy the application to a virtual directory on the build server and run the selenium tests against that and only deploy to the staging server if those tests pass? Or have I got this stuff completely wrong? If so how do you do it in your organisation?
