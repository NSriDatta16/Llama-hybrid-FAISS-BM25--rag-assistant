How to use train_test_split with existing dataset?

I am looking for an example of how to use train_test_split with an existing dataset. I have a CSV that can be bought into a dataset with: data = pd.read_csv('c:\MyData.csv') My aim is to use this data with a One-Class SVM. When I look at examples of using train_test_split though they all seem to want to generate a random dataset and then use that. This is usually done with the X, y = followed by the parameters you want to give the data. Looking at the sklearn webpage you then use: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42) This would give you a test size of 33%. How do you specify that the X, y = is data or am I barking up completely the wrong tree and not thinking about this correctly? Any help as always is greatly appreciated.
