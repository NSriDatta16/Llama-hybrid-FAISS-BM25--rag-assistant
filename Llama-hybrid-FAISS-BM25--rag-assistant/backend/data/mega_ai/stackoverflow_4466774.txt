If you have any sort of complex data model, and you are compelled to use MySQL or one of its great many forks, then use a transactional storage engine that supports foreign key references. Otherwise you will have to reinvent the data integrity "wheels" all over again, and that is not fun and is error prone (especially when you find that your data has integrity problems all over the place, and you're missing the proper information to put it back together. I'd suggest using something like PostgreSQL, if you are able to do so, because such robustness features are built-in. You can still balance load between servers if your application grows to such a volume that it is required.
