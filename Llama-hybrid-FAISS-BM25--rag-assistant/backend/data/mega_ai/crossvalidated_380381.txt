Why py-faster-rcnn has 0 detection in trained model with no pretrained weight?

I tested py-faster-rcnn and found that if I don't use pretrained weight then mAP is 0 in testing. I hope that I should see some value eventhough not very high. With pretrained model, mAP was above 99%. Why so difference and how can I solve the issue? With pretrained weight AP for vertical = 1.0000 AP for horizontal = 0.9500 AP for plate = 1.0000 Mean AP = 0.9833 ~~~~~~~~ Results: 1.000 0.950 1.000 0.983 ~~~~~~~~ Without pretrained weight, AP for vertical = 0.0001 AP for horizontal = 0.0000 AP for plate = 0.0000 Mean AP = 0.0000 ~~~~~~~~ Results: 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 ~~~~~~~~
