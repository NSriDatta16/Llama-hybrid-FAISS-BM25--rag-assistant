I think his definition of "fail" is a bit too broad. I've worked on a lot of projects that I've never received any direct return on my investment and I haven't considered any of those to be "failures". Sure, I didn't get filthy rich from them but I gained a lot of experience that I'm able to put down on a resume or convey during an interview. I think he's just being overly pessimistic about how the industry works. EDIT I read through the article some more. I do think he's right that the amount of new apps flowing in will die down but that's just because the market will be saturated with all the obvious ports. As with any new web technology it's a "fastest gun" race to make IRC clients, tetris games and of course, pac man. I still feel he's acting like this is a tragedy of some kind. I think this will be a much more exciting time when we'll see developers with immensely creative ideas finally come out of the woodwork when they're not afraid of their applications getting lost in the crowd.
