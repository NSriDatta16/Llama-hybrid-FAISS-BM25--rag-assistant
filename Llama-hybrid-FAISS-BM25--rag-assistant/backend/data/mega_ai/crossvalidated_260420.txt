How to convert the odds standard error to probability standard error?

I have conducted a logistic regression analysis using dummy variables in R. I would like to convert the outputted oddsratio standard error to probability (interpreted as risk) standard error. I am able to convert the outputted odds ratio to risk through: ln(odds) = intercept + ln(odds ratio) odds = exp(ln(odds)) risk = odds / (1+odds) How should I convert the odds ratio standard error to risk standard error or confidence intervals? Thanks!
