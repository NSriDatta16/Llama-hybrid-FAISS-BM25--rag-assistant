I think aggregation is basically a column operation and data split a row operation, so they can interchange freely. Having said that, I don't think you should aggregate because energy consumption will likely depend on the distribution and deviation of temperatures as well as its mean or sum. E.g. cold at nighttime and hot daytime may yield more consumption than the average with low deviation.
