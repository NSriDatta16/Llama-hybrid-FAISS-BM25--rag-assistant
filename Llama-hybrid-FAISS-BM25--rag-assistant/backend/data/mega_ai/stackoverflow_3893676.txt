Is there a PHP image-management system that has a fully customizeable front-end?

I am searching for an image management system, based in PHP, that allows for organizing images into galleries/categories, but that has a fully customizable front-end. For example, I would like full control over what elements are on the front-end, so that I can design the gallery pages to be without any admin access or extra meta-data. I am currently trying to create a theme using Gallery 3.0 . This is a great image manager, but I am hitting some walls with customizing the front-end to be exactly as I wish. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks
