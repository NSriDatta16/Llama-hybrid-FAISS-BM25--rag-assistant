perfect variable separation, determine cutoff via ROCR package in R

I am developing a logistic regression model where perfect variable separation occurs. I want to calculate a cutoff from this data. Interestingly, the length of the slot cutoffs of pred.obj is only 5, as well as the slots fp , tp , tn , fn , n.pos.pred and n.neg.pred . I expect it to have the same length as the observations. Has anybody an explanation for this? (And knows how to solve it?) MWE: library(ROCR) # package for prediction/performance functions y
