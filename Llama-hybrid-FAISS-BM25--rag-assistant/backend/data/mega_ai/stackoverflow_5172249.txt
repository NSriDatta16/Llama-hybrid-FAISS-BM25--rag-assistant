How to replace HTML tag in URLRequest Flex 4 / Air

I am embedding a website into my application, and Adobe Air does not recognize the breakline HTML tag in the source code (Firefox and Chrome auto-correct the error). I have attached the source code below. Is there a way to replace the breakline with the correct syntax (no forward slash). I do not control the website, I am merely loading it into my application, so I can't just change it at the source. I am using an mx:html object and htmlLoader to load the url. Website Source: Status Report Alarm History List of&nbsp;Alarms for Multiple Groups&nbsp; mxml Component: Script to load URL: htmlControl.htmlLoader.load(new URLRequest("http://mysite.com/somepage.asp")); Thanks you.
