In addition to the previous nice answers (+1 to both), I'd like to offer the following insights: Consider using entropy-based approaches, methods and measures for change point analysis . Check my related answer for some ideas (it focuses on time series, but I see no reasons for why the same approach cannot be applied to some other domains). Consider using Early Warning Signals (EWS) Toolbox and corresponding R package earlywarnings . The toolbox (methods and software) includes, in addition to time series analysis, spacial data analysis , which AFAIK is a significant part of environmental data analysis (i.e., see EWS site's menus Spacial Indicators and Case Studies ).
