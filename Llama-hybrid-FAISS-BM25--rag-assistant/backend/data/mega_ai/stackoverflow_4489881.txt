Static Web Assets over CDN and Optimal Number of Hosting Aliases

What is the optimal number of host aliases (i.e. storage-1.host , storage-2.host , etc.) to have with a content delivery network? I'm using Amazon Cloud Front and can set up to 10 different CNAME records. My understanding is that browsers will initiate two parallel connections to any given host, but I'm wondering if browsers will connect to an unlimited number of different hosts or is a limit set in place? I have taken a look through a few large services (such as YouTube and Flickr) and noticed that they tend to use 4 different host aliases. Is this the optimal number? Thanks!
