ing algorithms like Discrete Linear Transform (DLT). The reconstruction is only possible where there are Stereo Corresponding Points (SCPs). The quality of the results are dependent on the quantity of SCPs, the more SCPs, the better the results but it is slow and inaccurate. The skill of the operator is a factor in the quality of the image. SCP based techniques are not suitable for bony structures without identifiable edges. Generally, SCP based techniques are used as part of a process involving other methods. Non-Stereo corresponding contour method (NCSS) This method uses X-ray images for 3D Reconstruction and to develop 3D models with low dose radiations in weight bearing positions. In NSCC algorithm, the preliminary step is calculation of an initial solution. Firstly anatomical regions from the generic object are defined. Secondly, manual 2D contours identification on the radiographs is performed. From each radiograph 2D contours are generated using the 3D initial solution object. 3D contours of the initial object surface are projected onto their associated radiograph. The 2D association performed between these 2 set points is based on point-to-point distances and contours derivations developing a correspondence between the 2D contours and the 3D contours. Next step is optimization of the initial solution. Lastly deformation of the optimized solution is done by applying Kriging algorithm to the optimized solution. Finally, by iterating the final step until the distance between two set points is superior to a given precision value the reconstructed object is obtained. The advantage of this method is it can be used for bony structures with continuous shape and it also reduced human intervention but they are time-consuming. Surface rendering technique Surface rendering visualizes a 3D object as a set of surfaces called iso-surfaces. Each surface has points with the same intensity (called an iso-value). This technique is usually applied to high contrast data, and helps to illustrate separated structures; for instance, the skull can be created from slices of the head, or the blood vessel system from slices of the body. Two main methods are: Contour based reconstruction: Iso-contours are attached to each other to form iso-surfaces. Voxel based reconstruction: Voxels of the same intensity value are used to form iso-surfaces. Popular algorithms are Marching Cubes, Marching Tetrahedrons and Dividing Cubes. Other methods use statistical shape models, parametrics, or hybrids of the two See also 3D pose estimation – Process of determining spatial characteristics of objects 3D reconstruction – Process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects 3D photography 2D to 3D conversion – Process of transforming 2D film to 3D form 3D data acquisition and object reconstruction – Scanning of an object or environment to collect data on its shape Epipolar geometry – Geometry of stereo vision Camera resectioning – Process of estimating the parameters of a pinhole camera model Computer stereo vision – Extraction of 3D data from digital images Structure from motion – Method of 3D reconstruction from moving objects Comparison of photogrammetry software Visual hull Human image synthesis – Computer generation of human images References Further reading Yasutaka Furukawa and Carlos Hernández (2015) Multi-View Stereo: A Tutorial [1] Flynn, John, et al.
