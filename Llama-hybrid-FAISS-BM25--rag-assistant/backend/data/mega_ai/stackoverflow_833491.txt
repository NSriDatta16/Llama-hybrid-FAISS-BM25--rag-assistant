jQuery UI Sortable - disallowing transfer into child elements

I'm working with jQuery's UI sortables and have created a system of divs in this format; text: ... ... text: ... The divs can have an infinite number of children, and I want to be able to drag and drop all of the .mainDiv's within their parent box, so I have used this: $(".mainDiv").parent().sortable({items: ".mainDiv", containment: "parent"}); However, this allows elements to be dragged into their child or sibling .children divs. which I do not want to happen. I want to restrict elements to staying within their parent. Any help here would be hot. Cheers
