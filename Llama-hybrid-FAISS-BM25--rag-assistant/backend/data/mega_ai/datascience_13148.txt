Deep learning facial recognition research project

I'm a second year pure maths, applied maths and computer science student. I have taken up a research course and was given the topic to focus on facial recognition using deep learning. I have done a fair deal of reading on the topic (looking at older methods such as eigenfaces and fisherfaces all the way to newer methods such as deepface). I also feel comfortable with the maths and algorithms underlying ANNs. I was wondering whether someone in the community could maybe point me in the direction in what I (as an undergraduate) could take a deeper look at in the category of facial recognition using deep learning? I thought it might be interesting to pursue recognising faces given a few images of a face i.e.
