I have had significant success in empirically identifying trend changes using AUTOBOX http://www.autobox.com/cms ,a commercially available piece of software that I have helped develop. You might want to look at stochastic vs deterministic trend/seasonality in time series forecasting for an interesting discussion. A time trend model (deterministic in form) is as follows y(t)=a+bx1+cx2 etc where x1=1,2,3,4....t and x2=0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4 thus one trend applies to observations 1âˆ’t and a second trend applies to observations 6 to t. AUTOBOX's automatic empirical procedures have been very successful BUT like all "new science" or "advanced innovative procedures" it needs to be constantly aggressively challenged. Test all things but hold fast to what you know to be true ! Please post your data or send it to me privately and I will use the data and report the results to the group. If you are skittish about releasing the data simply code it by adding/subtracting a constant. The procedures used to identify the number of trends and the length of each trend is based partially on the work of Tsay http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf . All of these advanced procedures are not currently available in the free software market.
