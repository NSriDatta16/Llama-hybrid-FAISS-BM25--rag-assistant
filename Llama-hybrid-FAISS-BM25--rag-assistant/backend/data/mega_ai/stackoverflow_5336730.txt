OTRS 3.0: Agent notes by email - notifications

My goal is that agents can attach notes to a ticket by email. I have set up a second mail address ticketnotes@... which is filtered by a PostMaster Filter. In this way I can set the X-OTRS-[FollowUp-]ArticleType header to note-internal and X-OTRS-[FollowUp-]SenderType to agent and the email gets attached as agent note to the ticket mentioned in the subject. That works quite well. The problem is that the subsequent notifications emails are of the type Agent::FollowUp and not Agent::AddNote . That is confusing my agents. Can someone tell me what I'm missing here?
