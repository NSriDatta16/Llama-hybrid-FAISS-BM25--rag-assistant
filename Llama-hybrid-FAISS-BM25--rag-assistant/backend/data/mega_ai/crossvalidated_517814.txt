Markov Chain for Amino Acid Sequence

I was wondering if it is possible to apply Markov Chain to this amino acid sequence "ddvlsldeddddsdyncgednd" to find the probability of this sequence forming in this particular positional order, given that I already calculated the conditional probability of amino acid B coming next given that amino acid A comes before it in this particular sequence. for example, I have calculated: P(D coming next|D came before it) P(v coming next|D came before it) P(l coming next|v came before it) . . . . P(D coming next|N came before it) Therefore, I would then do the Markov chain calculation to be something like this: P("ddvlsldeddddsdyncgednd")=P(D|D) * P(V|D) * P(L|V) * ..... * P(D|N)
