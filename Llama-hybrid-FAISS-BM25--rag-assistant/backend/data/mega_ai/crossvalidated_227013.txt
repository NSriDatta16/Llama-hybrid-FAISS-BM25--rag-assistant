Propensity Score Matching for more than 2 groups

I'm new to propensity score matching (PSM). So, my questions can be bit trivial. 1) Suppose I've 3 treatment levels and want to check the effectiveness of the treatment levels. Treatment levels are taking drug on time, not taking drug on time and not taking drug at regular interval. For this I need to do multinomial logistic regression. But in PSM we do case-control study. So, how we are going to define which will be the case and which will be the control? Will it be the case that we will use one group as control for each time and other 2 groups as case? 2) Can anyone please tell me which package to use for multilevel group in R. I checked this link. But this link is old. I also checked this package which seems to do multilevel. But is there any other option for packages?
