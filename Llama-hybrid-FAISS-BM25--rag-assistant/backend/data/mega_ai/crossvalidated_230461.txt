See structural VAR (SVAR) modelling, e.g. in LÃ¼tkepohl "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" (2005), Chapter 9; Pfaff "Analysis of Integrated and Cointegrated Time Series with R" (2008), Section 2.3; or the vignette of "vars" package in R, Section 2.2; among other sources. SVAR is a form of VAR that allows for contemporaneous relations between variables. Actually, to estimate a SVAR you first turn it into a corresponding VAR representation and then turn the results back into the SVAR representation. The latter step can be done under special conditions related to the concept of identification . If your series happen to be integrated and cointegrated, a special form of SVAR, namely, a structural VECM (SVECM) could be the relevant model. It is also covered in the sources cited above.
