It's like this OVR has separate classifiers to each classes. If you have 3 classes it has 3 classifiers and the class that gives the maximum number of score is from each oh three score functions will be selected as the class. In multinational case it has the same classifier and it's quit like a perception where you will get range of score values to each classes. It use the cross entropy error. and hard to coverage the loss function.
