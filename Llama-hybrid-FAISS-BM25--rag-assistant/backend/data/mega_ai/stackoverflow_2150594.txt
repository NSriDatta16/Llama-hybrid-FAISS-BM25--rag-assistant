Determine if a POINT is between two other POINTs on a LINESTRING (SQL Server 2008 Geography)

I have a SQL Server 2008 GEOGRAPHY data type in my database containing a LINESTRING . The LINESTRING describes a potentially curvy road. I have another table that contains a start point and end point, both GEOGRAPHY POINT 's, on the road. I need to know if a third point falls between those two points on the road ( LINESTRING ). Currently, I'm testing that: the third point is on the line the distance between the new point to the start point and the distance between the new point and the end point are both less than the distance between the start point and end point This works, but it seems really inelegant doesn't work at all if the road u-turns on itself! Is there a way that works?
