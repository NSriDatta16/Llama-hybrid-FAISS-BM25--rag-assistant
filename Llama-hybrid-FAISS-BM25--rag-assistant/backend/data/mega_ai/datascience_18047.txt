It sounds as if you don't need clustering . But rather you are trying to detect near duplicates . The difference is that clustering tries to organize everything with a focus on the larger, overall structure. But much of your data probably isn't duplicate. Clustering is difficult and slow. Near duplicates is much easier, and much faster (e.g., with MinHash or similarity search)
