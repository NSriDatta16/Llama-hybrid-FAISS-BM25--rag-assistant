Tab control + DataGridView in WinForms

I have multiple results sets coming back from a server request against a datasource. I want to organise these with a WinForms tabPage for each result set, on a single tabControl. I am displaying the data in a DataGridView, but want to avoid having a DataGridView instance on each tabPage - I'd rather intercept the "switching to new tab page" message, and load up the appropriate results set from my local cache. Is there an easy/obvious way to do this?
