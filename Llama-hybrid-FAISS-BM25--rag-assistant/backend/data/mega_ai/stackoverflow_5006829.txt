I had a similar problem but I was making the zip files differently so I dont know if this will apply. My issue was with Internet Explorer, I would create the zip file when the user clicked a link and in IE it would auto download when it was done but the other browsers would work fine. I would check for the $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] in my link and I had to add "target=_blank" to it in order to stop IE from auto downloading.
