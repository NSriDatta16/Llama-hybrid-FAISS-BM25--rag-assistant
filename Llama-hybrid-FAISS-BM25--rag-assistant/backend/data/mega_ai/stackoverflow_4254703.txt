Side-by-side execution and MS Unit Test

Environment here is C#/.Net 4. In my MS Unit Test unit test project I'm testing a piece of code which uses a COM dll for some date conversion calculations (this in turn uses some other COM DLLs so in all three COM DLLs are involved). When running in a normal application/service set-up, I have no problem getting the side-by-side execution to work through use of manifests linking to the COM dlls' assembly identities, but when trying to do the same from my unit test project, I always get failure due to 'class not registered' exceptions. Now, I've tried this already: Embedding the test DLL manifest Embedding both the test DLL manifest, the COM dlls manifests + the COM DLLs themselves But to no avail. So I'm wondering: how could I make the unit test environment aware of the COM linking through the manifests? To me, it seems like the DLL manifest linking isn't quite working (the EXE manifests are working fine), but usually those kinds of thoughts equals doing something wrong ... I'm usually pretty successful in searching for stuff like this, but on this one, I've had very few hits, and nothing which resembles this, so please, if you have any thoughts or input, do share :) And if elaboration is needed, please let me know. (I know, that the use of the COM dlls could probably be avoided by some dependency injection the right place, but for now I'd like to explore this case regarding unit testing a side-by-side setup).
