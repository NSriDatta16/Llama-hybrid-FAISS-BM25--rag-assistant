Repeated Measures in R, SAS or SPSS: Whale Body Temperature Data

I have a question regarding a repeated measures experiment. I have 5 whales (randomly selected) that I recorded body temperature on. Data was collected via satellite, programmed to transmit records at 2-minute intervals, but data for each whale are not a complete time-series data set (i.e. unbalanced records/missing data points). A state-space model was creating using the whale's GPS location to determine what state each whale was in while tracked at sea. The states are the following: resident foraging, resident transiting, and post-resident transiting. I've partitioned the body temperature data into the 3 states. I have also divided up the body temperature data into 2 diel periods: daytime and nighttime. So I have two subplot factors: Diel (2 levels: day and night) and State (3 levels: res. forage, res. transiting, post-res. transiting). I have more than 500 body temperature values for each state/condition for all 5 whales, and I have more than 1000 body temperature values for daytime and nighttime periods for all whales. But again, I don't have the same number of data points for all whales, due to lack of satellite transmissions and the fact that there were differences among individual whales (e.g. some foraged for longer periods). Can anyone offer non-parametric statistical advice (data transformations were all unsuccessful) for setting up a model analyze the effect of daytime/nighttime and state (and the interaction between these factors) on whale body temperature in R, SAS, or SPSS? Would be happy to explain more about the data or experimental design. Thanks, Jim
