TFS Build Agent not responding

I came across an issue I can't resolve, here are the details: I am using TFS2008 in my APPTier and in my Build Agent. Initially I installed everything in the Apptier server (including the build agent), and I was able to start an build in the Apptier(and build) server. Now, I have to create a new Build agent in a different server. I installed the Team Foundation Build in my build machine (lets called it MyBuildAgent). Using TeamExplorer I create a new Build Agent pointing to my build machine for building some project, but when I start the build, it throw the following message: TF215085: An error occurred while connecting to agent \myproject\MyBuildAgent: TF215076: Team Foundation Build on computer MyBuildAgent (port 9191) is not responding. (Detail Message: Unable to connect to the remote server) The service "Visual Studio Team Foundation build" is running in my build machine, also, I am able to start an build in the Apptier from the MyBuildAgent, but I can't start an build in MyBuildAgent itself. Anyone can tell me what I am doing wrong or what part did I miss in order to configure my new build agent?
