Could you not assume that $y^{-1} \sim N(.,.)$ for the inverse of a normal random variable and do the necessary bayesian computation after identifying the appropriate parameters for the normal distribution. My suggestion below to use the Cauchy does not work as pointed out in the comments by ars and John. The ratio of two normally random variables follows the Cauchy distribution. You may want to use this idea to identify the parameters of the cauchy that most closely fits the data you have.
