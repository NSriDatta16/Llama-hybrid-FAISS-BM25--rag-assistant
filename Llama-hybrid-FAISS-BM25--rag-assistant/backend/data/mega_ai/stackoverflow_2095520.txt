Fighting client-side caching in Django

I'm using the render_to_response shortcut and don't want to craft a specific Response object to add additional headers to prevent client-side caching. I'd like to have a response that contains: Pragma: no-cache Cache-control : no-cache Cache-control: must-revalidate And all the other nifty ways that browsers will hopefully interpret as directives to avoid caching. Is there a no-cache middleware or something similar that can do the trick with minimal code intrusion?
