As Frode suggested in his comment I'm leaving this as an answer. This can happen when using any flash script, not just uploadify. Any other flash uploader such as SWFUpload won't get the session unless user-agent field is the same. This happens when your server has suhosin patch installed but it seems that sometimes this problem doesn't occur even when setting suhosin.session.cryptua is enabled as alecgorge suggested. Although I am not convinced about that. Of course you can pass to flash this variable using php scripts to uncover user-agent of user browser and then flash can disguise himself as the same browser but it's not elegant solution and I don't know actionscript so I can't say if flash can actually do it. Very important: There are actually two settings that can fix this security patch. suhosin.session.encrypt suhosin.session.cryptua If the first one is disabled then session is not encrypted at all so problem won't occur. It's not recommended to disable this. If we disable only the second one then session will be encrypted but encryption won't relay on user-agent field. This means that any browser or http client can get any session. Therefore it's recommended to put some other security fields. Suhosin can handle also session ip protection so I recommend to enable suhosin.session.cryptraddr . Other settings can be found here: Suhosin configuration To resolve this issue I suggest: Check phpinfo() if suhosin is installed. If not then problem won't occur. If suhosin is installed and suhosin.session.cryptua and suhosin.session.encrypt are enabled then copy existing and working php.ini. It's on the top of php info page: Loaded Configuration File /public_html/php5.ini Create your own php.ini and set: suhosin.session.encrypt = On suhosin.session.cryptraddr = On suhosin.session.cryptua = Off
