To drag drop table rows using Javascript?

I am using a HTML table to show data, and I want that user can drag and drop the table rows to sort the data as per their need. The HTML code for the table: 1 2 3 I want that user can drag the rows and sort as per needed... in Javascript NOTE: Don't want answer using jQuery, Mootools or any other Javascript library, because I want to use classic Javascript (i.e. the core).
