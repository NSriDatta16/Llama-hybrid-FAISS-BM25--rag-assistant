Check constraint to make sure values in a character column are all digits

This is similar to CHECK CONSTRAINT of string to contain only digits. (Oracle SQL) but I want to do this for Sybase. I have a character column 'colExp' (8 characters). I want to put a check constraint to make sure values for this column are all digits. How can I do this? This will work but its not elegant colExp LIKE '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'
