First of all is this valid C++ or is it a microsoft extension? It is valid in C++, the relevant part of the standard is 5.3.4, with the first paragraph containing the grammar Is it guaranteed to initialize all the elements of the array? Yes. Paragraph 5.3.4/15 states that A new-expression that creates an object of type T initializes that object as follows: ... If the new-initializer is of the form (), the item is value-initialized (8.5) where value initialized for POD means zero-initialize. Also, is there any difference if I do new int; or new int();? Does the latter guarantee to initialize the variable? Yes they are different. According with the quote above new int() will zero-initialize the integer. In a previous block of the same paragraph: If the new-initializer is omitted: If T is a (possibly cv-qualified) non-POD class type (or array thereof), the object is default-initialized (8.5). If T is a const-qualified type, the underlying class type shall have a user-declared default constructor. Otherwise, the object created has indeterminate value. If T is a const-qualified type, or a (possibly cv-qualified) POD class type (or array thereof) containing (directly or indirectly) a member of const-qualified type, the program is ill-formed; so new int will not initialize the memory.
