I did some tinkering with a drag and drop list from here . When an item is popped out of the list to be moved around the cell space it occupied has it's height set to 1px (see line 238) so it appears "gone". I couldn't find a way to handle this better as setting height to 0 fails as does visibility GONE. That said, If you really want to get rid of a row less temporarily, it might be a good idea to change the backing of the Adapter and call notifyDataSetChanged() on it.
