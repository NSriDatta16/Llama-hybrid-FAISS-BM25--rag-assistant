I'd recommend Python 2.6 because it has some features of Python 3.x, but it still retains the same functionality found in Python 2.5. While some might argue that Python 3.x is better (quite possibly because of the immense amount of reorganisation and the fact that all strings are Unicode by default), most Python code in use right now is still for Python 2.x. I'd say stick with Python 2.6 until you need Python 3.x. :)
