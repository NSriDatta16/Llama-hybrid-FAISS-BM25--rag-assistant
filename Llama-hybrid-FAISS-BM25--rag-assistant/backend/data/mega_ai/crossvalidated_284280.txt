Is a skewed target variable bad for a linear regression model?

I'm currently learning linear regression with multiple variables using gradient descent (from a machine learning course on Coursera). My goal is to predict housing prices in a specific city. My model currently has an $R^2 = 0.83$, and it does an OK job at predicting prices. My question concerns the skewed form of the price data. When I plot the error residuals, they seem to follow a normal distribution. However, the original prices are heavily right skewed. I'm trying to understand if this is something I should adjust for, or if it doesn't matter. Should I use a logarithmic transformation or the like on my target variable (house price)?
