Silverlight 4 Drag and Drop Alternatives

I want to add the ability to drag a user control from one part of a Silverlight 4 page onto another user control on the same page (not talking about the new Silverlight 4 ability to drag a file from the OS onto the page). What approach is most straightforward? What approach offers the most flexibility? Here are some alternatives I found so far SO drag-and-drop-control-for-silverlight . Same question but answers apply to SL 2. Alex van Beek's DragManager . Written for SL3. Silverlight Drag Drop . Also written for SL3.
