Correlating noisy time series with a phase difference (lag)

I am trying to find the correlation (or any other indicator of "similarity") between a real-world time series (example: monthly sales of tractors - seasonal over the year) and some market index, like the S&P GSCI Agriculture Index ( link ). I am trying to figure out how to think about the problem and find ways to get real insight from both time series. Both time series would be expected to have autocorrelation, seasonal components, and systematic noise. Would you smooth both with some moving average then check for correlation for different lags? or decompose both time series and look at the trend correlation? What is your method of doing something like this? Thanks!
