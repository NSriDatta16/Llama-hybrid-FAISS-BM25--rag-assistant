Consider two time series $\{Y_1\}$ and $\{Y_2\}$ where $\{Y_1\}$ might be Granger-causing $\{Y_2\}$ . To examine whether that is the case, you can compare two models for $\{Y_2\}$ , one being a pure autoregression ( AR ) and another augmented with appropriate lags of $\{Y_1\}$ ( ARDL ). The latter model can also be seen as a single equation from a VAR model for both $\{Y_1\}$ and $\{Y_2\}$ . The augmented model will never have a higher in-sample RMSE (lower $R^2$ ), because in-sample RMSE can only decrease ( $R^2$ can only increase) when we add regressors, and we got ARDL by adding regressors to AR. However, if there is no Granger causality from $\{Y_1\}$ to $\{Y_2\}$ , then the difference in in-sample RMSEs ( $R^2$ s) between the two models will tend to be small. On the other hand, if Granger causality is present, the difference will tend to be larger. This insight leads to an $F$ -test which can employ the two $R^2$ values for testing for presence of Granger causality. Regarding out-of-sample RMSEs (root mean square forecast errors), the ARDL will still tend to deliver lower values than the AR in presence of Granger causality â€“ unless the effect of Granger causality is estimated with substantial error relative to the effect size (which may happen when the effect is small and/or the estimation sample is short or unlucky). Due to randomness in future realizations of $\{Y_2\}$ , there may be instances where the opposite is the case. Meanwhile, in absence of Granger causality, the ARDL will tend to deliver higher out-of-sample RMSEs. Again, due to randomness, there may be instances where the opposite is the case.
