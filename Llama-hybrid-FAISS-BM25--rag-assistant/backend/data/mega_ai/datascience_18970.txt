Pros and cons of pandas or R for longitudinal data?

Note: I believe this question is not off-topic because it meets all of the criteria for subjective questions that are allowed . I would be happy to rephrase or clarify if others disagree I'm about to begin a two-year project which will predominantly involve longitudinal panel data. I've found numerous questions and answers ( Pros and Cons of Python and R for Data Science ), and blog posts ( https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-data-analysis-R-or-Python | http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html ), about the relative merits of R and Python+pandas for data science but nothing that discusses longitudinal data. My question is therefore: Which environment (Python+pandas or R) would you use for longitudinal data analysis, and why ? For example, I would love to see answers that: Tell me how you have used one or both environments to solve a particular problem with longitudinal data Which environment or package(s) you found easier to work with, and why If you used a notebook such as beaker to work with multiple environments simultaneously. If so, which environment did you use for which step(s) in the data analysis pipeline, and why? If so, did this confer advantages over just using one language: would you use such an approach again? I am not asking which one is best (we all know that such questions are never constructive). I am more familiar with one environment than the other, but I'm not averse to learning new skills (and both share similar syntax anyway), so I'm not going to say which one: I want answers based on your experience, not my abilities.
