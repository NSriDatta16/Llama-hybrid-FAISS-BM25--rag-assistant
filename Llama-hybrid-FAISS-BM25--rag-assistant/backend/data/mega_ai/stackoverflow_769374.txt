My product uses layered windows to draw the little tabs I attach to each window. I used layered windows to get the smooth rounding without aliasing. The only nasty problem I have run into so far is that some OpenGL windows scribble on top of layered windows on Windows XP and Vista without DWM. Its a low level problem and Microsoft has not been terribly helpful. You can reproduce it by opening up Google Earth and dragging your application over the main rendering window, your layered window will disappear.
