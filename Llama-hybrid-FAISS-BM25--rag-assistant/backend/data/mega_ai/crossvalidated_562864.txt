How to Cluster Several Graphs?

I'm relatively new to Graph Theory, but I'm wondering if I have a set of Graphs {G1, G2, ..., Gn}, are there any algorithms that allow for clustering these graphs? taking into account the nodes and edges present in each graph and their properties. For example, having seven graphs, the output would be something like: Cluster 0: G1, G5, G6 Cluster 1: G2, G4 Cluster 2: G3, G7 In this case, the set of Graphs is the same kind (Undirected, Directed, etc.), and is there any open-source implementation with these algorithms? Or equivalent, are there any graph embeddings algorithms representing a whole graph like a k-dimensional vector? (fixed k for all graphs), so this embedding can be fed into classical algorithms like k-means, hdbscan, etc
