HTML/firefox/webkit weird behaviour of '#id' links that alters page visual content

Normal page looks like this: http://hell.orts.ru:8004/snapboard/threads/id/3/ However, if â€¦#fragment_id is used in the link, like http://hell.orts.ru:8004/snapboard/threads/id/3/#snap_post130 , browser doesn't just scroll the page to that element, but visually alters (breaks) content of the page. No javascript-effects, supposedly (at least the problem is still the same with NoScript). What di I understand wrong, what actually happens and how to fix it? Note: contents of the example links will certainly change in the future; I don't know where it would be appropriate to save them as more permanent examples. Source code that produces those pages is here: https://bitbucket.org/hoverhell/xmppforum/src/c38dc011d15 .
