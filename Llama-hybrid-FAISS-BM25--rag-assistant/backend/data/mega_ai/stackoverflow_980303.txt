Finally I managed it on my own ... So here are some common mistakes not to make when you make a chart on BIRT and wnat it to be interactive ... 1 Implement barely anything which need to be overriden I personnaly forgot to override getDesignTimeModel() and getRunTimeModel() comming with the ICallBackNotifier implementation ... 2 Do not nest your chart (or be prepared to nest most of your methods too) I had my chart not directly on my shell but nested in a bunch of composites widgets, canvas and such ... Therefore my canvas where hidding my shell which was the only one able to react in the way I wanted to my mouse controller. (Funny fact : I figured this all out when I (for no reason) tried to drag a small part of my shell which was not overlapped by the chart and drop it on my bars ... There the tooltip poped ... ^^ Funny way to understand how things work :p) 3 Do not be me ... It is to much work and pain for a barely acceptable result ;p Hope this help, dont hesitate to mail me if you face the same probleme, I'd be glad to help as much as I can ^^
