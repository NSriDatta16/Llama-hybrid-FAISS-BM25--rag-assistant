Bayesians are people who define probabilities as a numerical representation of the plausibility of some proposition. Frequentists are people who define probabilities as representing long run frequencies. If you are only happy with one or other of these definitions then you are either a Bayesian or a frequentist. If you are happy with either, and use the most appropriate definition for the task at hand, then you are a statistician! ;o) Basically, it boils down to the definition of a probability, and I would hope that most working statisticians would be able to see the benefits and disadvantages of both approaches. hint of skepticism regarding the chasm between lofty objectives, and arbitrariness in the selection of the prior distribution, or eventual use of frequentist maths after all. The skepticism also goes in the other direction. Frequentism was invented with the lofty objective of eliminating the subjectivity of existing thought on probability and statistics. However, the subjectivity is still there (for example in determining the appropriate level of significance in hypothesis testing), but it is just not made explicit, or often just ignored .
