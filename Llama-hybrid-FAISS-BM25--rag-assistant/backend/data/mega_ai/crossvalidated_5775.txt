From your follow up response to Peter Flom's question, it sounds like you might be better served by techniques that look at higher level structure in your correlation matrix. Techniques like factor analysis, PCA, multidimensional scaling, and cluster analysis of variables can be used to group your variables into sets of relatively more related variables. Also, you may want to think theoretically about what kind of structure should be present. When your number of variables is large and the number of observations is small, you are often better relying more on prior expectations.
