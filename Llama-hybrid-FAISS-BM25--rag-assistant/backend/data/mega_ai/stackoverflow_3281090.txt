SQL Server - Agent Proxy Error "CryptUnprotectData failed (1325)"

Job History: Message Unable to start execution of step 1 (reason: Could not get proxy data for proxy_id = 4). The step failed. Agent Log: [442] CryptUnprotectData failed (1325). Server: Microsoft SQL Server 2005 - 9.00.3080.00 (X64) Sep 6 2009 09:15:46 Copyright (c) 1988-2005 Microsoft Corporation Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows NT 5.2 (Build 3790: Service Pack 2) product_level - SP2 edition - Standard Edition (64-bit) I've done the setup following two different paths: replication setup wizard manually, specifically following these instructions: how-to-run-sql-server-agent-and-sql-server-jobs-with-least-privilege-in-sql-server-2005 SQL Agent and SQL Server both run under Local System accounts which are members of the local group, administrators I don't see this kb article as applying: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938086 not a high # of calls error messages aren't even close The account being pointed to by the credentials is also an administrator on the box. SSIS Package not running under proxy is not the case. Of course, changing the job step to run under the sql agent account works fine.
