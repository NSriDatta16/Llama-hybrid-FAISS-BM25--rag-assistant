Similarity measure for time series

How can I recognize patterns with different sizes in a time-series? Imagine that I have a template pattern and I need to find that pattern in a symbolic representation of the time-series (stock market prices). However, the pattern can appear with different lengths. I found dynamic time warping here , for example. Is this a possible solution?
