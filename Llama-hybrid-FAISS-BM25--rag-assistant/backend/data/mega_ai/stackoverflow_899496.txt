There's a special section of web.config you can add called connectionStrings. You add to web.config: Then in your C# code: string connString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["oracle"].ConnectionString; I know it's a little bit more complicated than the first example, but it helps keep the config file organized, specially as this file gets more and more complicated you'll learn to value this connectionStrings section. Good luck! Ricardo.
