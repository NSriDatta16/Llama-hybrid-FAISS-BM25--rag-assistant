Adding files to WP7 isolated storage from Visual Studio?

I'm working on an Windows Phone 7 app where I'm going to show ATM's nere your location with bing maps. I have an xml-file with addresses and gps coordinates. But how do I add this file to my program from visual studio? If I set BuildAction to Content and Copy to output directory to Copy always. The file still isn't in IsolatedStorage. Do I have to build a mechanism to download the information from the web? Or is there another way?
