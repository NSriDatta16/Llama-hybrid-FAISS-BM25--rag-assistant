Manage VSS to SVN migration

Our organization is making a migration from VSS to SVN. Now, due the lack of branching on VSS there's a folder with the source code from the last production environment code it was used like a queue where the new code was pushed to the top of the queue then it basically depended on a very manual thing and it was all or nothing scenario. To migrate a C# migration tool was used to upload the current code of the VSS to the SVN it worked ok and the file change history was kept. How to deal with this scenario? where the current VSS code was uploaded to the trunk, this because the file history it's required to be kept, and the code of the production environment will be a branch but with previous versions of the files and less functions than the trunk, and then be able to merge this 2 roots. Thanks for your comments. PD. The production code has a requirements change now, i cannot use the current trunk to make a new production code.
