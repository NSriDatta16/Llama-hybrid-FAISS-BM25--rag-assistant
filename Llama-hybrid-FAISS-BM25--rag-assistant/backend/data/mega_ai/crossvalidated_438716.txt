Reconstruction Error in PCA

I've read that if we have a data matrix $X$ and the eigenvectors $V$ of its covariance matrix $Cov(X) = X^{T}X$ , then whereas $$XV$$ gives us the projection of our data on low dimension, $$XVV^{T}$$ should give us a reconstruction ( $\hat{X}$ ) of our original data matrix. $X$ projected onto $V$ is easy to visualize, but what is the meaning of $X$ projected onto $VV^{T}$ ? I've read nearly every post by @amoeba on PCA in my bid to better understand it and I found this post particularly helpful . But what I can't seem to wrap my head around is, how can I visually illustrate that the projection $XV$ projected on $V^{T}$ (or $X$ projected on $VV^{T}$ , which ever interpretation is correct) is the reconstruction? Below, I only consider one eigenvector (k = 1). Is my interpretation drawn below correct..? What is the geometric interpretation of projecting onto the transpose of an eigenvector ( $V^{T}$ )?
