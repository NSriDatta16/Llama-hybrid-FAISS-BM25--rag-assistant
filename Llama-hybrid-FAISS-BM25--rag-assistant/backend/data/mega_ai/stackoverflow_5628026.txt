Best data structure to store an object indexed by a 3-tuple for fast retrieval along each dimension and low memory profile?

I want to store objects indexed by a 3-tuple of (String, String , DateTime). Lets call these Identifier,Category,Day Any object in the data structure is guaranteed to be unique by the 3-tuple (no duplicates) The data structure should support fast answers to questions such as: - What are all the unique identifiers? - What are the categories for identiifer "xyz"? - What are the days where identifier = "xyz" and category is "mycategory"? Removal is also possible. Would be great to maintain a low memory profile. As a baseline, I'm using Dictionary >> Theoretically this should give me O(1) retrieval, but I'm not familiar with the internals of Dictionary and generally I have a feeling that my solution is sub-optimal. I know there's probably no one right answer here and I could provide numerous usage details, but perhaps someone can just give me a few ideas to play with? Edit The only retrieval performed is with equality (i.e. identiifer = "xyz"). I don't use inequalities (greater-than, less-than, etc.)
