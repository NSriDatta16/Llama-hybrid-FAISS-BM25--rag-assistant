How can I find out what div a div is in with javascript?

I have a page which will contain 4 static divs with IDs. I will be adding scriptaculous dragable and droppable effects to allow interaction by moving many dynamically generated divs from one div to another. I need to be able to find out which of the static divs the dynamic divs are in. How can I get this information?
