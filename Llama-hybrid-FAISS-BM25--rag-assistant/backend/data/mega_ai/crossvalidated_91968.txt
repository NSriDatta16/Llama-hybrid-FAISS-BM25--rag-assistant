One reason I've used auto-correlation is to determine how often I should sample a time series. I run simulations that produce time series; I store the value of the output every so often so that I can determine, e.g., the mean of the time series. There is generally no point in storing consecutive values of the time series since consecutive samples of the time series won't be independent and so won't reduce my estimation error. Only if I wait until the series has decorrelated can I take an independent sample of the time series (possibly eliding some subtleties). Put another way, given that I've sampled a time series to calculate its mean, I need to know the auto-correlation time to determine how accurate my estimates will be: assuming that the standard error goes down like $1/\sqrt(N)$ will only work if the samples are independent.
