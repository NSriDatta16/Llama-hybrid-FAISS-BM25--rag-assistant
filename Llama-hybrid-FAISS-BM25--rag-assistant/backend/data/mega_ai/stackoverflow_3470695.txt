On what Standard version the Magento Enterprise version 1.8.0 is based?

I need a suggestion on what Standard Magento version the Enterprise version 1.8.0 could be based? Possible answers are: 1.4.0 1.4.0.1 1.4.1.0 1.4.1.1 We have one customer with a error related probably to one of the versions which can be found on forum. But to proof that it's related to certain error I need to know to what version 1.8.0 Enterprise version is related.
