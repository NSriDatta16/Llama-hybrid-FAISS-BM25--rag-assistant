You are training a random forest with the best hyperparameters you've found on the (X_concatenated, y) dataset, then testing it's performance using the (X_test, y_test) dataset. However, the second dataset is a subsample of the first one (see your call to train_test_split ), and as a result, observations from your 'test' set will be present in 'training' set. This is data leakage and the performance metrics on your 'test' set will overestimate the actual performance of your model.
