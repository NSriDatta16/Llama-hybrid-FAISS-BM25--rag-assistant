Training NNs is a practical task where you are only interested in well-performing neural networks. A learning session that ends up in a poor local minimum is quickly discarded as the solution is irrelevant for practical use. My advice is to train many neural networks with different hidden-node architectures. Pick the 3 best performing trained neural networks corresponding to each configuration, and compare their performance estimates across architectures. You should use your testset for this, while keeping the validation set aside. You can compare regression neural networks using different metrics.
