Doxygen latex fine-tuning?

I've got 2 questions concerning the latex output of doxygen: How can one organize the related pages (those created by \page) ? (They seem to be organized according to the title of the page) How to specify which latex stylesheet to use ? (i've found nothing in the Doxyfile) I would like to get rid of the paragraph numbers for the class members. thanks
