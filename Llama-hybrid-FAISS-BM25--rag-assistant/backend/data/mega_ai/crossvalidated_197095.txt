The approach using binary classifiers against multiclass data instead of methods designed especially for such data is commonly used in machine learning and implemented in multiple software packages. Clear description of such procedures can be found in Python's scikit-learn library documentation : One-Vs-The-Rest This strategy, also known as one-vs-all, is implemented in OneVsRestClassifier. The strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class. For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes. (...) One-Vs-One OneVsOneClassifier constructs one classifier per pair of classes. At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected. In the event of a tie (among two classes with an equal number of votes), it selects the class with the highest aggregate classification confidence by summing over the pair-wise classification confidence levels computed by the underlying binary classifiers. The approach that you mention For the choice of the predicted value, I was thinking that I would just predict whichever category corresponded to the highest probability. is a description of one-vs-rest classifier (see Wikipedia article on multiclass classification ). You can find more detailed description of these approaches in most of the introductory machine learning handbooks.
