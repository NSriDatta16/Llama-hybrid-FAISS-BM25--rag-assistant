The Domain in DDD does not need to be implemented in OO. In my experience an OO domain model is usually best, but there are very valid examples of situations in which it may not be. You might implement a domain in rules, with a rule engine (example in The Netherlands where this is done for a large mortgage application). Or you might do it in a functional language. The essence is that your domain, in however fashion it is implemented, is isolated from what I usually call the technical aspects of your application (or, as the previous answer calls it, cross-cutting concerns, although I think there may very well be cross-cutting concerns within a domain). An isolating layer, which may be implemented using adapters, makes the domain as much as possible, even completely, independent from the technicalities. This layer usually leverages patterns such as Facade and Observer.
