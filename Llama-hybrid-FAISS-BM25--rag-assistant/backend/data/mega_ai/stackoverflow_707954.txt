You need to limit each file from being included only once. You can do this in 2 ways. 1) At the top of your header files put: #pragma once Or 2) if your compiler doesn't support that, put at the top/end of your header files: #ifndef _MYFILE_H_ #define _MYFILE_H_ ... #endif Replace MYFILE with the name of your file, and replace ... with the contents of the header file.
