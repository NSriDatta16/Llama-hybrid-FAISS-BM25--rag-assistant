Importance of preprocessing in NLP

I have implemented a CNN model on text data for classification. The performance of model without preprocessing is better than model with preprocessing. The variation of the performance is nearly 3% What can we infer from this. Can we consider the model without preprocessing. Is it meaningful? Any kind reference is also helpful
