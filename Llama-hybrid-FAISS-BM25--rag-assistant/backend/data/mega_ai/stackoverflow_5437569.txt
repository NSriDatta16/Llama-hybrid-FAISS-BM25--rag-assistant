I was looking for the same thing a few weeks ago. gwt-dnd is good but I found the motherload with DragAndDropPluginForGWTDeveloppers . This is what you want?: http://gwtquery-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/droppable/demo/GwtPortletSample/GwtPortletSample.html Check out the project at: http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery-plugins/wiki/DragAndDropPluginForGWTDeveloppers It supports maven and GWT 2.2!
