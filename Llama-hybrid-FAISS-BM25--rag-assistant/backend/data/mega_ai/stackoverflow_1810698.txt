As many things in life: it depends. It depends on the scale we are talking about here. What are the characteristics of your shared-state? If it is a SPOF ("Single Point Of Failure"), then you'll be facing fault-tolerance issues as well as probably access issue (bandwidth, processing). If we are talking a small scale system with lesser concern given to fault-tolerance, then yes it might be easier just to use a central DB. Then again, I am a bit confused about the question: Message Passing deals with the communication aspects whereas a database is used to deal with storage aspects . Why do I get the impression these things get mixed up in your question? (it could be just me of course). On Message Passing robustness: what is the issue here really? The communication layer being TCP helps a lot albeit being imperfect as anything on this earth. If you are concerned about the overall complications of communicating between nodes, then this won't go away regardless of the platform / language you choose. Erlang just makes distributed communication a lot easier .
