Drupal views & to do list

Wondered if anyone can tell me whether the following is possible within views. I have installed To do module - http://drupal.org/project/to_do I then created my own view which lists all the tasks created in a particular Organic Group, which works lovely. One of the fields ive added as the to do button field which gives the user the ability to mark a task as finshed from the view listing. the problem I have is that all users part of that group can see that buton & has the ability to mark the task as finished. Is there a way I can use views to only show that button if the current logged in user is the author of that node( to do task).
