The most of the processes in real applications (including Financial Data) are not pure ARIMA Processes or they are not all. That is why using this model in forecasting of those series lead to poor results. Furthermore, this model has some important limitations: It can capture only linear dependencies with the past. It forecast the average value of the series. It assumes the error to be Independent and Identically Normally Distributed. It is an univariate model, namely it cannot take advantage from exogenous variables. It rely on strong assumption, such as stationary, invertibility, independence of residuale, and so on...
