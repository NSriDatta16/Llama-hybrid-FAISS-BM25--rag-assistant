You can make your documentation process easier by using several great add-ins. One of them is GhostDoc , a free add-in for Visual Studio which generates XML-doc comments. Also, if you use ReSharper , have a look at the excellent Agent Johnson Plugin for ReSharper, which adds an option to generate XML comments for thrown exceptions. Update: It seems that Agen Johnson is not available for R# 8, checkout Exceptional for ReSharper as an alternative... Step 1: GhostDoc generates the XML comment (Ctrl-Shift-D), while Agent Johnson plugin for ReSharper suggests documenting the exception as well: Step 2: Use ReSharper's shortcut key (Alt-Enter) to add the exception documentation as well: step 2 http://i41.tinypic.com/osdhm Hope that helps :)
