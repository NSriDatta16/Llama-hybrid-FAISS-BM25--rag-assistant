Try to add referrer , userip as described in the docs : An area to pay special attention to relates to correctly identifying yourself in your requests. Applications MUST always include a valid and accurate http referer header in their requests. In addition, we ask, but do not require , that each request contains a valid API Key . By providing a key, your application provides us with a secondary identification mechanism that is useful should we need to contact you in order to correct any problems. Read more about the usefulness of having an API key Developers are also encouraged to make use of the userip parameter (see below) to supply the IP address of the end-user on whose behalf you are making the API request. Doing so will help distinguish this legitimate server-side traffic from traffic which doesn't come from an end-user. Here's an example based on the answer to the question "access to google with python" : #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import json import urllib, urllib2 from pprint import pprint api_key, userip = None, None query = {'q' : 'матрёшка'} referrer = "https://stackoverflow.com/q/4309599/4279" if userip: query.update(userip=userip) if api_key: query.update(key=api_key) url = 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/language/detect?v=1.0&%s' %( urllib.urlencode(query)) request = urllib2.Request(url, headers=dict(Referer=referrer)) json_data = json.load(urllib2.urlopen(request)) pprint(json_data['responseData']) Output {u'confidence': 0.070496580000000003, u'isReliable': False, u'language': u'ru'} Another issue might be that seedterm is not properly quoted: if isinstance(seedterm, unicode): value = seedterm else: # bytes value = seedterm.decode(put_encoding_here) url = 'http://...q=%s' % urllib.quote_plus(value.encode('utf-8'))
