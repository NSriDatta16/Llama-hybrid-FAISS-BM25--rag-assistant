Using a big text file to store serialized (no matter what kind of serialization) means : No need to modify the schema to add / remove columns Ability to store pretty much anything you want BUT : you will not be able to work with those data on the MySQL side -- especially, you won't be able to use those in a where clause. Basically, this means using MySQL to store data -- and nothing more than storage If you only want to use those data on the PHP side, and never have to work with the on the SQL side, I suppose that storing everything a big text field is a solution. (and, in this case, I don't see why it would be slower than another solution)
