How can I revert a 'draggable' upon failed AJAX request?

I have a draggable div, that needs to be dropped on a droppable. If it is dropped correctly, the droppable calls an AJAX request. If the draggable does not have a valid id or the AJAX request fails, the draggable should be reverted to it's original position. Is that something that can be done with jQuery?! Any help is greatly appreciated!! $("div.draggable").livequery(function(){ $(this).draggable({ revert: 'invalid', distance: 20 }) }); $("#trash").droppable({ tolerance: 'touch', drop: function(event, ui) { var item = ui.draggable; var id = item.attr('id'); if (id) { $.ajax( { type: "POST", url: "delete.php", data: "id=" + id, success: function(html) { if (html) { item.remove(); } else { // FAILED AFTER AJAX // is it possible to revert the draggable from here?? } } }); } else { // FAILED BEFORE AJAX // is it possible to revert the draggable from here?? } } });
