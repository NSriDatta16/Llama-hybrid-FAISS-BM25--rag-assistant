For people just starting out in the business it probably makes sense to specialize, cause they need something in order to compete. For more experienced developers I agree with what The Pragmatic Programmer book suggests, namely that as a professional developer, you should always try to add more useful tools to your toolbox. E.g. they suggest picking up new programming languages on a regular basis etc. If you do that, you will obviously not become a black belt in all of these areas, but you will broaden your horizon and learn to look at problems from different angels, which is very useful imo.
