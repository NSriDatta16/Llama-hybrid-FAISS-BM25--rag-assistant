Random-Forest-based Similarity Matrix for clustering: how does it behave?

I am in the following context: Data : static, baseline health data at the patient level, 40 features, sparse (~ 25 binary features with many 0 or many 1 + other categorical features) Objective : to cluster instances into clinically meaningful sub-population or clinical context, to get a sense of at risk sub-populations (on a Follow-Up outcome) Considered approach (see this short blog article (2 minute's read) for its rationale): Fit a random forest on the Follow-Up outcome, using all features (no denoising or removing correlation) Use co-occurence in trees leaves to get a similarity matrix of the patients Turn in into a distance matrix Cluster patients with this distance matrix My questions are as follow: I have only found literature using this methodology for unsupervised clustering (i.e. RF is learned on random target variable) : Shi and Horvath 2016 and Dalleau 2018 (unpublished) . Does anyone have insights on those methods in general (other references, personnal experience...)? Do you know of any article written about the supervised use of RF to create similarity matrices (with or without mention of clustering)?
