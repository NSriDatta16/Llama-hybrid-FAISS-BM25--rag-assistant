Have you tried using recentf ? It should be provided with Emacs. I originally saw it via XSteve's Emacs power-user tips where he suggests binding it to F12, and provides an interactive interface: ;;recentf (require 'recentf) (recentf-mode 1) (setq recentf-max-saved-items 500) (setq recentf-max-menu-items 60) (global-set-key [(meta f12)] 'recentf-open-files) (defun xsteve-ido-choose-from-recentf () "Use ido to select a recently opened file from the `recentf-list'" (interactive) (let ((home (expand-file-name (getenv "HOME")))) (find-file (ido-completing-read "Recentf open: " (mapcar (lambda (path) (replace-regexp-in-string home "~" path)) recentf-list) nil t)))) [update]: whups, just saw your note about recentf awareness. True, it is for all opened files, so it included those currently in open buffers, too. Since I've only ever accessed it when I'm trying to track down a recently closed file, I never thought about that. Still, maybe filtering open files from that output might be easier than reinventing the entire wheel?
