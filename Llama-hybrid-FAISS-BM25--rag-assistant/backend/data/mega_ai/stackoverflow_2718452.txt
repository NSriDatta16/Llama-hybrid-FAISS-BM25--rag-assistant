Is there such a thing as a reverse CDN? (content 'retrieval' network)

Our clients upload a serious amount of data from all over the world and we'd like to do our best to make that as painless as possible. Our clients upload 2GB worth of files over their sometimes very 'retail' broadband packages (with capped upload speeds) that draw out upload times to 24-48 hours. At any given time we have 10 or more concurrent uploads and peek periods we can have 100 concurrent uploads. So we decided to consider ways to reduce latency and keep our clients traffic local... so just as a CDN has download servers in various locations, we'd like upload servers. Any experience or thoughts? We're not a huge company but this is a problem worth solving so we'll consider all options.
