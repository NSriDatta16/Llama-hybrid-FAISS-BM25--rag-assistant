pyHook seems to have done some of the work necessary, as it's hooked keyboard and mouse events. What I will probably do is keep a constant record of all the windows I care about, along with their positions. Then, on mouse up, I'll detect if any of the windows moved, and if so, and it's near where the mouse was let go, on the title-bar, I'll assume it was dragged there and snap it. Code to hook follows. import pyHook def mouseUp(event): if event.Injected: return True print "Mouse went up" return True hookManager = pyHook.HookManager() hookManager.MouseLeftUp = mouseUp hookManager.HookMouse() You also need a main loop, which I have since I'm using gtk already, or you can do: import pythoncom pythoncom.PumpMessages()
