Imbens (2000) and Imbens and Wooldridge (2009) outline a method of adjusting for treatment choice based on pre-treatment characteristics in situations where treatment takes on more than two values. This approach is termed generalized propensity scores. The first step is to predict treatment category using multinomial logistic regression and then you predict the model-based probabilities of being in each of the treatment groups. Iptw is based on the inverse of the probability value for the treatment condition each individual actually was in. As Dimitry mentions, there are baked-in Stata routines for doing this in the teffects set of programs. Imbens, G. (2000).
