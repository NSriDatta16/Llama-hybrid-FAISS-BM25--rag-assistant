Stacking and Ensembling methods in Data Science

I understand that using stacking and ensembling has become popular, and these methods can give better results than using a single algorithm. My question is: What are the reasons, statistical or otherwise, behind the improvement in results? I also understand that at a high level that combining these methods will combine the predictions from different algorithms. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, but not sure how combining them will actually improve the results. Here is a simple balanced example (50% of the labels are actually T and 50% are actually F), where I think stacking or ensembling algorithms will still give the same result as the original model. In this case, for the ties (1 F and 1 T), I decided to select T. The same problem would occur if I selected F instead. This is a little more complicated if I used the predict_proba, but think the same problem would occur.
