Groovy , parse html with XmlSlurper , how to get the html code in a node?

i am parsing an html page using XmlSlurper and HtmlCleaner, i have the GPathResult with def page = new XmlSlurper(false,false).parseText(xml) now i can use GPath to access the various nodes. In the html i have a paragraph like this one: some_text1 some_text2 some_text3 .... some_textN the problem is that now i don't know how to parse the text in the paragraph, i need to split the text inside the paragraph using the tag as separator and get a list like [some_text, some_text1, some_text2, .... ,some_textN] Having the node like def node = page.body.some_path.p[0] if i use text() i get all the text in the paragraph but without the so i cannot use the split method, and i don't find a way to get the real html inside the paragraph from the node. There is some way to parse this text? Thanks for the help.
