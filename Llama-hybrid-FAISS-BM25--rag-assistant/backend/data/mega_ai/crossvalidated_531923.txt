How to use data augmentation in the context of model evaluation in machine learning?

I'm trying to use data augmentation for training a model for a classification task. But I'm not sure about how to use data augmentation in a fair and meaningful way in the evaluation of a machine learning model. I have considered at least three different options for doing this and I would like to know which one is the best. Firt of all, let us suppose that we have a labeled dataset D. Option 1: -We can use a data augmentation approach over D, for generating a novel set of synthetic data S. -We can create a new dataset D2, which combines D and S. -With D2, we can use a 10-fold cross-validation approach, where: -We divide D2 into 10 random subsets (folds). -We use each fold as test data and the remaining 9 folds as training data. -This is repeated for each fold. -We obtain the average performance (on the 10 folds) for evaluating the model. Option 2: -We can use a data augmentation approach over D, for generating a novel set of synthetic data S. -With D, we can use a 10-fold cross-validation approach, where: -We divide D into 10 random subsets (folds). -We use each fold as test. -We create a set T including the remaining 9 folds. -We create a new set T2 that combines T and S -We use T2 as the training data. -This is repeated for each fold. -We obtain the average performance (on the 10 folds) for evaluating the model. Option 3: -From D, we can use a 10-fold cross-validation approach, where: -We divide D into 10 random subsets (folds). -We use each fold as test. -We create a set T including the remaining 9 folds. -We use a data augmentation approach over T for generating a set S of synthetic samples. -We create a set T2 that combines T and S. -We use T2 as the training data. -This is repeated for each fold. -We obtain the average performance for evaluating the model. What is the best option and why?
