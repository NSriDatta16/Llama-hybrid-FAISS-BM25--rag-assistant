12 firms and a total of 204 observations, can I use pooled OLS with firm-dummies or should I use fixed factor?

I am studying the effect of government ownership on firm performance, more specifically I am studying the effect of the government reducing their share in companies which are already partly privatized. I have collected relevant data for 12 firms where the state have reduced (or increased in some firms) their share since 1990. For a limited number of firms I have data from 1990, but for most of the firms the data starts in the 90`s (all firms have observations until 2013). So the data is unbalanced with a total of 204 observations. I want to estimate the effect of "STATE SHARE" on "ROS" where "INDEX" and "YEAR" will be control variables. My initial thoughts were to create dummies for every firm so that differences in the firm-averages would not influence my results. After trying to google the issue I have started to wonder if I should do a fixed-effects analyses, but I am struggling to understand the difference between just adding firm-dummies and doing a fixed effects regression where the firms are the fixed factors. How can I best study the effect of reduced government ownership with the dataset I have collected? All help will be highly appreciated.
