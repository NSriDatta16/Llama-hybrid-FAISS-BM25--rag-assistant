Add tables based on what you want to allow your users to do and the related data you need to store as a result. Some example tables: 'user_account': User account information (e-mail address, password) - referenced by user ID 'user_profile': Basic user profile information - referenced by user ID 'user_status': User status message - referenced by user ID I have the sense that this is your first major database application, and if so, you need to learn more about database design in general before you take on creating an application like this. There are many things to consider when designing a database schema and designing it well from the start is key. The core of your application will rely on how well your data is organized and accessible, so ensure you spend enough time developing a good design. Good luck!
