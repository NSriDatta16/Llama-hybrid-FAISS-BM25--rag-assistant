You could do this, but the results you would get would not be any more meaningfully interpretable than regression coefficients. The interpretation of a treatment effect in a linear regression model that controls for covariates is the same as the interpretation of a treatment effect resulting from a propensity score analysis. This method would not buy you anything and is not what propensity score analysis was designed to do. In addition, treatment effect estimates from propensity score analysis have more uncertainty than those from regression, so if your regression results are unstable, your propensity score results would be even more so. It might make sense to use a flexible machine learning technique that allows you to assess variable importance in a non-parametric way. I'm no expert on this so I can't make a more concrete recommendation than this. It's not immediately clear to me why penalized regression (e.g., elastic net) would not work well in this scenario. One thing I can think of is that because all the features are on the same scale, you should use the unstandardized coefficients in the loss function (rather than standardized coefficients, which is what's usually used in penalized regression to ensure the scaling of the variables doesn't impact their regression weights). But propensity score analysis is definitely not the right way to go about solving this problem.
