Reinforcement learning needs dataset?

Sorry for this dummy question based on the number of contents in the field that I am asking about but It seems that there are tons of texts and videos explaining what Reinforcement Learning is, and most of them are really copying what the first group did. Unfortunately, some of them are even copying the script which I can assure you that they do not understand each cell does what. I have a problem with optimization regarding an opening gate with respect to a condition to make it optimized for opening and closing in the best condition. I think my agent is the one who decides to open the gate and close it. My environment is the whole environment in that gate and my agent exists. Now the state is the situation after opening the gate and defining Rewards based on that. NOW my Question is, "Do I need a dataset of opening and closing the gate in order to train the agent?" Or in Reinforcement Learning the whole process is done using random numbers? I mean, what data is used for RL to train the AI-agent ? Given the fact, all the examples and videos are based on some prepared video games which are available on gym openAI , do you think everything for my case should be written from the scratch? If I have made mistake is terms of using the terminologies in the field please correct me. Many thanks
