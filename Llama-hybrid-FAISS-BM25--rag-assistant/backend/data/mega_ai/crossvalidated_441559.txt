compute standard deviation of wind direction angle

How would one compute the standard deviation of wind direction that can assume values between 0 and 360°? I have the wind information in u and v components and corresponding angle. Getting the average is possible to take the average of u and v and then compute the angle, while just averaging the angular information could result in averages of 180° when wind directions strays around 0°. If I took standard deviations of u and v, how would I have to compute them to get the standard deviation of the angle?
