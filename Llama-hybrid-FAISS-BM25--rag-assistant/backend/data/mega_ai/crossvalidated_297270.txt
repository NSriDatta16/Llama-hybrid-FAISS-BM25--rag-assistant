It is not often appreicated that there are several different ways of estimating $\tau^2$. As you state in your comment the method due to DerSimonian and Laird is probably the best known and has been widely used. However the series of simulation studies carried out by Wolfgang Viechtbauer and reported in hsi 2005 article entitled "Bias and Efficiency of Meta-Analytic Variance Estimators in the Random-Effects Model" suggests that no one method can be considered universally better than all the others. The REML method seems to have generally good properties overall and perhaps is the best choice. Of course you could always run the model using various methods and compare $\tau^2$ but although that might satisfy one's curiosity it is not clear what you would do with the answers.
