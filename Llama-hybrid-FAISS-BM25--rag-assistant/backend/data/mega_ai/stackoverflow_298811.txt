Why do I have an Issue with binding to an image from a control template?

I have a style for an items control that binds to an image in the target, it only appears if the target also binds to the image and I have no idea why.. can anyone shed any light on it for me? A simplified version of my style: My User Control: some useful information, dynamically updated action 1 action 2 action 3 --> And my model code (set as the data context for my user control) internal class StartPageViewPresentationModel : IStartPageViewPresentationModel { public StartPageViewPresentationModel(IStartPageView view) { HeaderImage = new BitmapImage(new Uri(@"Images/home_16.png", UriKind.Relative)) { CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.Default }; HeaderInfo = "Start Page"; View = view; View.Model = this; } public BitmapImage HeaderImage { get; set; } public string HeaderInfo { get; set; } public IStartPageView View { get; set; } } If I un-comment the tag in the user control then the image is displayed both in the control and the template area, if I comment it it doesn't appear in either. The text binding from the template works fine I am perplexed.. thanks Trevor
