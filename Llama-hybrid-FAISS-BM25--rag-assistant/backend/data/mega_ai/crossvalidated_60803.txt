R Time Series Issues

I would like to know more details about R issues mentioned in Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples . For e.g. the first problem still exists in R version 3.0.1 # generate an AR(1) with mean 50 set.seed(66) # so you can reproduce these results x = arima.sim(list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=.9), n=100) + 50 mean(x) [1] 50.60668 # the sample mean is close arima(x, order = c(1, 0, 0)) Coefficients: ar1 intercept *direct copy from the webpage Theoretical model of above simulation is: $X_t = 5 + 0.9 X_{t-1} + Z_t$, where $\{ Z_t\} $ is the white noise Is R following particular model convention or is R wrong? If it is wrong, it is still in R core package and I wonder why it isn't changed. Also, it would be very helpful if I get some hint on other five issues.
