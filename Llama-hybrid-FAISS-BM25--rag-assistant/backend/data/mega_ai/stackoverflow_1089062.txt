If you are only returning an int why are you trying to iterate through the results in a foreach? Lets say you have an Int marked as an output parameter you should be able to just do... AppDataContext app = new AppDataContext(); Int32? lookup = 0; app.spLookupFrom400(numberType, number, ref lookup);
