The sum standard deviation is, as the name suggests, the standard deviation of the sum of $n$ random variables. The standard error you're talking about is just another name for the standard deviation of the mean of $n$ random variables. As you noted, the two formulas are closely related; since the sum of $n$ random variables is $n$ times the mean of $n$ random variables, the standard deviation of the sum is also $n$ times the standard deviation of the mean: $\sigma_{X_{sum}} = \sqrt n\sigma_X = n \times \frac{\sigma_X}{\sqrt n} = n\times \sigma_\bar{X}$. In the first problem you are dealing with a mean , the average of twelve bottles, so you use the standard deviation of the mean, which is called standard error. In the second problem you are dealing with a sum , the total weight of 20 packages, so you use the standard deviation of the sum. Summary : use standard error when dealing with the mean (averages); use sum standard deviation when dealing with the sum (totals).
