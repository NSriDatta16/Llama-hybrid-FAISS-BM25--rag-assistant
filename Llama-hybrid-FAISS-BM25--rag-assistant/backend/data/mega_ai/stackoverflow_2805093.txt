MVC and jQuery data retrieval

I am using mvc and jQuery and I am trying to display someone's profile with some additional institutions that the person belongs to. I am new to this but I've done something like this in ProfileControler: public ActionResult Institutions(int id) { var inst = fr.getInstitutions(id); return Json(inst); } getInstitutions(id) returns Institution objects(with Name, City, Post Code etc.) Then in a certain View I am trying to get the data with jQuery and display them as follows: $(document).ready(function () { $.post("/Profile/Institutions", { id: }, function (data) { $.each(data, function () { var new_div = $(" "); var new_label = $(" "); new_label.html(this.City); var new_input_b = $(" "); new_input_b.attr("type", "button"); new_div.append(new_label); new_div.append(new_input_b); $("#institutions").append(new_div); }); }); }); $("#institutions") is a div where i want to display all of the results. .post works correct for sure because certain institutions are retrieved from database, and passed to the view as Json result. But then I am affraid it wont itterate with .each. Any help, coments or pointing in some direction would be much appriciated
