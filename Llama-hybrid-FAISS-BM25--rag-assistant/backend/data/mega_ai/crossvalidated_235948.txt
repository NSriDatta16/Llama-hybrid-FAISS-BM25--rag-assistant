How many features are in your original data? If it is not too many (say thousands), many clustering algorithm can work in your original data. By using PCA you are losing information. If you do not want to lose too much, you can use as many PC as possible. (assume you can afford the computational efforts and there are not curse of dimensionality problem ) If you want to check how much information you lose, you can check my answers to this post to see how to get how much information (variance) preserved by PCA. How to calculate how much variance a set of regressors explains on another data set using PCA transformation? To you comment: If you really want to use PCA, you can run clustering algorithm on the transformed data . In R with toy iris data. It is pca_out$x pca_out=prcomp(iris[,1:3]) pca_out$x PC1 PC2 PC3 [1,] -2.49088018 -0.320973364 -0.0339745251 [2,] -2.52334286 0.178400622 -0.2329011355 [3,] -2.71114888 0.137820058 -0.0025055723 [4,] -2.55775595 0.315675226 0.0670512306 [5,] -2.53896432 -0.331356903 0.0986154338 [6,] -2.13542015 -0.750523350 0.1367151904 [7,] -2.67669609 0.072944140 0.2311696738 [8,] -2.42912498 -0.162931683 0.0007979233 [9,] -2.70915877 0.572318127 0.0322430634 [10,] -2.44080592 0.123908243 -0.1318158483 [11,] -2.30049402 -0.641538592 -0.0654553841 [12,] -2.41545393 -0.015273540 0.1681603305 [13,] -2.56232620 0.242322950 -0.1666121092 [14,] -3.03215612 0.502494126 0.0604799584 [15,] -2.44677625 -1.179585963 -0.2360617554 [16,] -2.24724960 -1.353446638 0.1997840653 [17,] -2.50197109 -0.829777299 -0.0024222281 [18,] -2.49088018 -0.320973364 -0.0339745251 [19,] -2.00936932 -0.867984466 -0.1284528211 [20,] -2.42654485 -0.524077475 0.1997126274 Note I am showing first 20 data points after the transformation. You can use all 3 transformed features without information loss. OR you can use first 2 columns. Then your data becomes 2 dimensional but lose some information.
