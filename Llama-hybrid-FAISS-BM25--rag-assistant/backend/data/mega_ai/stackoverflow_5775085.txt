iphone draw over UIScrollView with MultiTouch

I'm creating methods to use multi-touch taps to draw shapes on top of an image inside a UIScrollView. I'm thinking that I should just create a new UIView subclass for the shapes and add them as a subView to the main controller that contains the scrollView. If so, can I simply use touchesBegan, touchesMoved, ... with the new UIView subclass? And if not how do I connect the touches to the drawing logic. Thanks!
