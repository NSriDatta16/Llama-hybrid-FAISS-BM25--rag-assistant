When a URI appears in a protocol element, the character encoding is defined by that protocol; without such a definition, a URI is assumed to be in the same character encoding as the surrounding text. Therefore 'ascii' in the line.decode('ascii') fragment should be replaced by whatever character encoding you've used to encode your text.
