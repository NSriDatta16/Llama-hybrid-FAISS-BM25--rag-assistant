matlab syntax errors in single layer neural network

I have to implement a single layer neural network or perceptron.For this, I have 2 files data sets , one for the input and one for the output.I have to do this in matlab without using neural toolbox.The format of 2 files is given below. In: 0.832 64.643 0.818 78.843 1.776 45.049 0.597 88.302 1.412 63.458 Out: 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 The target output is "1 for a particular class that the corresponding input belongs to and "0 for the remaining 2 outputs. I tried to do this, But it is not working for me. load in.data load out.data x = in(:1); y = in(:2); learning rate = 0.2; max_iteration = 50; function result = calculateOutput(weights,x, y) s = x*(weights(1) +weight(2) +weight(3)); if s>=0 result = 1 else: result = -1 end end Count = length(x); weights[0] = rand(); weights[1] = rand(); weights[2] = rand(); iter = 0; do { iter++; globalerror = 0; for(p=0; p Where is the mistake in this algorithm?? I am referring the example given in the link below:- Perceptron learning algorithm not converging to 0
