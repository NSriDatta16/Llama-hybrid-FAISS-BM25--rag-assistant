There is also Akelos Framework which is described as Rails in PHP. Django is not Rails, but they are quite similar: MVC (MVT in Django), nice ORM, migrations (in case of Django You have to use an external tool) etc., so maybe Akelos would fit You. Edit: I've just found Pluf . The site says: Simple, elegant and easy for people used to Django but in PHP5 so easy to deploy all over the world. I have never tried it so I cannot recommend it or not. Edit2: If You are looking for template system You may try Open Power Template . Some of the features: Advanced support for declarative programming - tell, what you want to see, not how it is supposed to work. Blocks - easy-to-write instructions evaluated at runtime. Components - creating HTML forms with templates never was so easy. Smart HTML escaping and XSS filtering syntax techniques.
