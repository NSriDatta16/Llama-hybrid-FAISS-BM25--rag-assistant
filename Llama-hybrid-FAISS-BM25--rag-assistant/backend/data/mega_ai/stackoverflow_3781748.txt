How do I set up a named route in rails 3?

This is a month long thing I've been putting off, and I can't for the life of me figure this bugger out. I'm tracking to access a file in website/admin/organizations/org_deals My routes look like this : map.namespace :admin do |admin| admin.namespace :organizations do |organization| organization.org_deals 'org_deals', :action => 'org_deals' end end rake routes | grep org_deals : admin_organizations_org_deals /admin/organizations/org_deals {:controller=>"admin/organizations/", :action=>"org_deals"} I made my link look like this admin_organizations_org_deals_path I mouse over the link I get http://localhost:3000/admin/organizations/org_deals I click on it, and I get : No such file or directory - /Users/daniellevine/Sites/hq_channel/app/views/admin/organizations/show.html.haml WTF? :D
