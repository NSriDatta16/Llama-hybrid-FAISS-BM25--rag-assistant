My impression is that your strategy is reasonable for obtaining the point estimates but some care is needed for obtaining standard errors that might be useful. betareg uses case weights and hence a weight of, say, 2 would be interpreted as two independent observations that have exactly the same y and x values. Thus, these would not just be averages from different observations but exact replicates. Therefore, if you fit a betareg where all observations have weight 2 the coefficients would be unchanged (compared to the default case with weight 1 ) but all (co-)variances would be halved. One strategy that you see sometimes used in practice when emulating proportionality weights via case weights is to make sure that your weights are scaled such that sum(weights) corresponds to the number of independent observations.
