is there an existing language model for calculating the probability of P(output|input), needed for aligning texts from OCR

I have a bunch of boxes containing texts from receipt OCR results, and I need to a way to align them properly. The attached photo shows part of a contrived receipt, but it illustrates the problem I need to solve. Because the receipt image is slanted, the Subtotal: box is more aligned with 25 instead of $23.00 , so if I just naively concatenate the boxes based on their horizontal positions, the output would be $23.00 Subtotal: 25 # items: while what I really want is Subtotal: $23.00 # items: 25 I am thinking of using a language model to predict the probability of p(25|Subtotal:) and p($23.00|Subtotal:) , and then compare them, to decide proper alignment in addition to heuristics based on their relative positions. Does anyone know if there is a such a model already trained on large corpus that I can use directly?
