Well, I have some of the problems. I did lots of modification to default/mystore/layout/something.xml but saw nothing happen in the frontend. Then I did the same modification in default/default/layout/something.xml and now changes where done. For now for me it seems that I can only modify template files in default/mystore/template but not layout files in default/mystore/layout. Maybe your issue is the same, that Magento is using the default files and not your theme files?
