CNN, which layer to choose for a similarity measure

I built a model (InceptionResnet v2) to classify images and I would like to use it to measure similarity between objects. One way to measure that similarity is to catch an intermediate layer's results from two vector and look their distance. I don't know how to choose the layer, my last layers are : Conv -> Flatten(98304,) -> Dense(256,) -> Dense (softmax) I hesitate between Flatten and first Dense, how to choose ?
