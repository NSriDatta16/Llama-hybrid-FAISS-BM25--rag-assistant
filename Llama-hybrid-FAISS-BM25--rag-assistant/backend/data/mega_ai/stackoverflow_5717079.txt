You can use a custom java class to load in a document and put the digital signature there e.g.: // Document node // User name, maybe for adding a signature label // Digital signature......... Within the custom Java class you can read the entries and do e.g. a FileInputStream and get the document. Just look at Content Transformers Here you should have enough info to code your own tranformer.
