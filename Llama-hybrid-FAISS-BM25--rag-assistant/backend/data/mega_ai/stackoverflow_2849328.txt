ok ... I see the flow of events being something like this: user drags and drops item to grid async process is kicked off user interface is updated to show "processing" callback handler gets response of async process async callback updates binding source async callback calls "databind" on the grid to refresh the view to contain the new data. I would use a thread rather than a background worker but im pretty confident working with threads. The background worker does simplify threading, that would be my recommended starting point if your are not confident. That way you update the source and the ui together and the user can continue using the application during processing.
