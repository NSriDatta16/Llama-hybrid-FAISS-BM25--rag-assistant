Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) of CTMC

Could anyone possibly advise me on how one would go about calculating the MFPT matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain? I've tried looking around online, but I can only find information on discrete-time Markov chains. Presumably it's more complicated than taking the exponential of the MFPT matrix of the transition matrix.
