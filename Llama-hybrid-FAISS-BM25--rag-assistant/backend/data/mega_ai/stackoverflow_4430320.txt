Value types are stored on the stack sometimes . It's a complex topic and usually the exact storage of a variable (stack or heap) is irrelevant for programming issues. The real difference between value and reference types lies in their behaviour (for example, value types are always copied by value ). Eric Lippert covers this issue in detail: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/04/27/the-stack-is-an-implementation-detail.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/05/04/the-stack-is-an-implementation-detail-part-two.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/09/30/the-truth-about-value-types.aspx
