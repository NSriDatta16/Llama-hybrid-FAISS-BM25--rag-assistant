Since having made my earlier post, I have also bought and read parts of Terence Parr’s book “Language Implementation Patterns.” It is excellent, though quite a bit more technical than Martin Fowler’s book (with some additional material it could be a “Dragon Book” for the new millennium). The examples are strongly based in Java and ANTLR, but the text is the main thing, so the book is useful regardless of one’s language development environment. Interestingly, there is little overlap between the two books. Martin Fowler’s book does a good job of covering the design and implementation of basic DSLs, such as those used for specification and configuration, while Terence Parr’s book is more technical and covers the realm extending all the way up through more sophisticated languages and byte-code machines. I recommend both if you can budget for them, otherwise, either is an excellent choice within its given domain.
