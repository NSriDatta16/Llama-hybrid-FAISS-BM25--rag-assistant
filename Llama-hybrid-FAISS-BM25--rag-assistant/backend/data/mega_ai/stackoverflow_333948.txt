A good WPF scrolling timeline control? (fancy datetime picker)

I'm looking for somthing I can use as a timeline control. A kind of "banner" the user can drag to the left or the right to go forward or backwards in time and then he or she should be able to select a point in time on that control. A fancy datetime picker :-) Any ideas?
