Elaborating what others have said, Joins are just cartesian products with some lipgloss. {1,2,3,4}X{1,2,3} would give us 12 combinations (nXn=n^2). This computed set acts as a reference on which conditions are applied. The DBMS applies the conditions (like where both left and right are 2 or 3) to give us the matching condition(s). Actually it is more optimised but the problem is the same. The changes to size of the sets would increase the result size exponentially. The amount of memory and cpu cycles consumed all are effected in exponential terms. When we denormalise, we avoid this computation altogether, think of having a colored sticky, attached to every page of your book. You can infer the information with out using a reference. The penalty we pay is that we are compromising the essence of DBMS (optimal organisation of data)
