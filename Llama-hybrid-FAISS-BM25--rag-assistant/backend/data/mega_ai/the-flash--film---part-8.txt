r and Gustin improvised much of their dialogue on set, such as Miller's version being inspired by Gustin's to use "the Flash" as his superhero alias. Guggenheim would not address whether the events of the Arrowverse event, which saw some universes destroyed, meant that Miller's Flash still existed, while Lee and Adam Schlagman, the vice president of film at DC Entertainment, ensured Guggenheim's scripts did not conflict with this film. In December 2019, Warner Bros. scheduled The Flash for release on July 1, 2022. Pre-production In January 2020, Muschietti said the film would still adapt elements of the Flashpoint comic book storyline, because the studio wanted that story to be used, but that it would tell a different version of it. This allowed for Batman to be featured in the film and for that comic's focus on time travel to be incorporated with the exploration of the Flash's origin story, in which his mother is killed and his father is wrongfully convicted for her murder. Muschietti compared the Flashpoint comic to the horror film Jacob's Ladder (1990) for its structure and likened the film's version of the comic story to a suspense film because of its build-up. He felt the Flash's prior appearances in the DCEU provided the audience with a greater understanding of the character, and that this allowed for a more emotional experience and story to be told. In April, the film's release date was moved forward to June 3, 2022, when Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Michael Keaton entered early negotiations in June 2020 to reprise his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman from director Tim Burton's films Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). The Flash was set to disregard the subsequent Batman films that did not feature Keaton—Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997)—and was reaffirmed to introduce the multiverse to the DCEU, with Keaton's version of the character originating from an alternate universe Barry creates in the film. Filming was eyed to begin in the first quarter of 2021, depending on COVID-19 protocols. Fisher discussed his role as Cyborg in the film with Muschietti that month before Warner Bros. set a two-week shoot for Fisher to film what was referred to as a cameo appearance alongside other Justice League actors. Fisher said the studio only offered to pay him a fraction of his traditional salary for reprising the role. In August, Keaton was confirmed to be appearing in the film, and Affleck agreed to reprise his version of Batman. Muschietti explained that the film would introduce the idea of the multiverse to general audiences by including multiple versions of characters and acknowledging past film franchises based on DC as alternate universes. It was important for Muschietti to include Affleck in the film since his version of Batman is the "baseline" for the DCEU, and he felt the introduction of Keaton's Batman would not work as well without first seeing the Flash's relationship with Affleck's Batman. Affleck chose to return after retiring from the role because he would have a smaller role in the film. During the virtual DC FanDome event "Explore the Multiverse" in September 2020, Barbara Muschietti said the film would feature many characters from the DC Universe and the Flash would serve as the bridge between them and their different timelines. She added that the film would be used to restart the continuity of the DCEU without disregarding the events of the prior films. Crudup, who left the film during the changes in directors, entered negotiations to rejoin the project a month later. Clemons's involvement was uncertain at that point. The film's release date was pushed back to November 4, 2022, due to further pandemic-related delays, and filming was set to begin in March 2021 in London. Warner Bros. had Cyborg written out of the film by January 2021 after Fisher refused to work on any project involving Hamada. Fisher said this was due to Hamada's handling of an investi
