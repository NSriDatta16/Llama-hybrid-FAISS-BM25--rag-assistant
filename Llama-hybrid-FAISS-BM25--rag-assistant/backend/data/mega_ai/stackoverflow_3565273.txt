Count() is thread-safe. Calling it twice at the same time, from two different threads will not harm anything. Now, another thread might change the number of items during the call, but so what? Another thread might change the number of item a microsecond after it returns, and there's nothing you can do about it. PopCall on the other hand, does has a possibility of threading problems. One thread could read fc , then before it reaches the SubmitChanges() , another thread may interceded and do the read & delete, before returning to the first thread, which will attempt to delete the already deleted record. Then both calls will return the same object, even though it was your intension that a row only be returned once.
