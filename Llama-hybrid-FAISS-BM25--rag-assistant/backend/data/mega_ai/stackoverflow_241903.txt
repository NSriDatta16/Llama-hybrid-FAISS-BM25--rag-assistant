NCover on 64-bit system

What do you suggest to use for code coverage on 64-bit environment. It seems that NCover supports 64-bit only in Enterprise version which seems to be quite expensive. Or isn't it? What are people using on 64-bit systems for .NET code coverage? EDIT: I am aware of the CorFlag workaround. I would like to know what others are doing/using. Are you using something else or are you using NCover (free edition) with CorFlag trick?
