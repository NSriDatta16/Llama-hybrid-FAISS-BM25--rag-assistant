These things are sometimes subjective if its borderline. It could be better but conversely you only get perfect clouds of data in textbook examples. If possible try and identify the points in the line with a shallow slope that increases with fit, the rightmost of which is the highest residual at approximately at $3.5x10*5$ You could plot studentized residuals, and this removes the unequal variances of the residuals caused purely by their position within the regressors. Wikipedia has a page on heteroskedasticity, on which there is a section on tests in regression. The Breuschâ€“Pagan test is quite straightforward.
