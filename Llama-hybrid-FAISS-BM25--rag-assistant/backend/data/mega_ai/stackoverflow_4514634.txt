Given that MySQL does not support user defined extensions, nor does it seem to support arbitrary extensions or plugins (just for storage engines), your best bet is to store it as a CHAR(17) as an ASCII string in standard notation (e.g., with colon separators), or a small BLOB and store the bytes directly. However, the string notation is going to be more friendly for most applications. You may want to pair it with a trigger that validates that it is a MAC address, since that is really the only way to enforce data validity without support for custom types.
