Combining multiple datasets vs combining regression models

I have 5 datasets, each one represent an observation for many countries. data1 = (y,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9,x10) as an observation at time t1. data2 = (y,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9,x10) as an observation at time t2. data3 = (y,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9,x10) as an observation at time t3. data4 = (y,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9,x10) as an observation at time t4. data5 = (y,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9,x10) as an observation at time t5. each observation measures the variable $Y$ and $X_i$, $i$=1,..10 for 140 countries. I want to fit a linear regression model to estimate a $Y$ variable with $X_i$ varibales. My question is how to fit the best model using the five datasets. There are two propositions: fit the linear regression for each dataset and combine the models. in this case, what's the technique to combine several regression models. combine all the datasets into one and fit one regression model. in this case, how to combine multiple datasets into one for fit linear regression). like concatinate them or take average, etc.
