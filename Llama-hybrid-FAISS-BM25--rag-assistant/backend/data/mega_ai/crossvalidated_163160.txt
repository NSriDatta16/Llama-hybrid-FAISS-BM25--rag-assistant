How do I split a normal distributed sample into groups of percentiles but with an additional random noise component for uncertainty?

I have a sample of students that I want to divide into smaller groups based on a their IQ but with a certain random noise component - how can I do that? I need to cluster the best, the average and the worst students into school classes based on their IQ but with an additional random noise component that gives a small amount of mix between the classes. How do I approach this task? I was thinking of beginning by drawing students to the class suited for the best students. Therefore the students with the highest IQ have higher probabilities to be drawn and put into this class. I just have no idea how to permutate the sample and add the random noise. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks Hans Chr.
