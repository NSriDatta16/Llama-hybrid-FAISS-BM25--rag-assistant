Definitely try and get your hands on the erlang book: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang The first section of the book is available free online and would make an excellent companion when you are just learning the language: http://erlang.org/download/erlang-book-part1.pdf If you are looking for something more advanced, or wanting to learn tips and tricks about the language/OTP then I would recommend "Erlang in practice" screencasts: http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice Although they are $40, they are high quality screencasts and I believe well worth the money.
