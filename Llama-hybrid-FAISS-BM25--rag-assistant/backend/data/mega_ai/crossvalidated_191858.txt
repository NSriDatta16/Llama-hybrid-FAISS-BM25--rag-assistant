CasualImpact is a great package for R to evaluate the dynamic impact of interventions in time series. Your data should consist of a response variable $y$ and predictors $x$, but the inference depends critically on the assumption that the predictors are covariates that were not themselves affected by the intervention. You can use nonstationary data, and in this case include nonstationary components on your model through the dynamic.regression argument of the impact function, but you need to make sure that the nonstationary structure remains unchanged across time. In Brodersen et al (2015) , page 263, they warn: It is worth emphasising that all preceding results are based on the assumption that the model structure remains intact throughout the modelling period. In other words, even though the model is built around the idea of multiple (nonstationary) components (i.e., a time-varying local trend and, potentially, time-varying regression coefficients), this structure itself remains unchanged. If the model structure does change, estimation accuracy may suffer. This result shoud be valid either for nonstationary and cointegrated data. So if your variables have different trends or cointegration relations across time the estimation of the impact may not be valid. In case your data has a linear trend that does not change across time you can still evaluate the impact correctly. Note that you can also include time-varying local trends in the impact function, as long as the specification does not change across periods.
