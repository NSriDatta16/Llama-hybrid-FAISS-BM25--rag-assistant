What is a fair hourly charge for routine site updates?

What do you consider a fair, yet profitable hourly wage for routine updates/management (ie - information, maintenance, database management) for your average site? What factors do you use to set that rate? As a reference...I usually quote around $25/hour...am I getting ripped? EDIT: Initially I was hoping for this to be a good reference for people in general as well...but since it was asked - I am in the Tucson, AZ area.
