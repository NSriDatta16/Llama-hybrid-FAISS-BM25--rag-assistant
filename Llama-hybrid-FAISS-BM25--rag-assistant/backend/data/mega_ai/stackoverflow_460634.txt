Mouse over events not fired when using jQuery ui.sortable

I'm using jQuery UI Sortables to sort items between lists and drag / drop items from one list to the other. The lists are collapsible with header DIVs that control the expand / collapse operations. I would like to have the lists expand automatically when hovering over their title DIVs with the mouse, but only when I'm currently sorting a list. The problem is that when currently sorting (when I'm currently dragging a list item), mouseover / mouseout events do not seem to be firing for any object on the page. Anyone has any idea why this happens / how to work around this? The general layout: title item 1 item 2 .... ... Thanks!
