What is the straightest line I can make using a linear combination of time series

I have 3 processes which generate an output in the form of a time series. I want to choose a linear combination of the processes that will result in the straightest line possible (I think this property might be called Sinuosity ) A trivial solution would be 0*A + 0*B + 0*C which will always give a straight line, but this isn't very useful. How can I calculate the non-trivial solution(s)? It feels like a Linear Regression problem but I can't see a way to reduce to that.
