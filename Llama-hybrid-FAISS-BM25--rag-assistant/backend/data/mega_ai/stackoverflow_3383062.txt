As far as feedback, I'd go with KISS - insert a new row in "Feedback" table only when actual feedback is populated. No need to pre-populate rows. Another option is to simply move feedback's "message" field back into "Event_RSVP" table; and update that field upon feedback. The downside here is that you can't have multiple messages within the same feedback if you decide you need that, whereas the separate feedback table can be much easier to change to accomodate multiple messages per feedback. Also, independently of feedback, I'd drop the user_id from the event if that was an attendee ID (if it was origanizer ID, I apologize and leave it in). Events should not contain lists of users. If you want to track who the invite was sent to, either create a new "Invites" table (event_id, user_id) or better yet simply track the invites via RSVP table, by inserting a new row upon the invite being sent and the update "rsvp_status" when user actually RSVPs.
