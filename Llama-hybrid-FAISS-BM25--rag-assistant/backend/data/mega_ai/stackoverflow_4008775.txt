It's not simple. xRotation += ( yDelta * 0.5f ); yRotation += ( xDelta * 0.5f ); This is not going to work. Either your x or y-axis won't be correct, these are the pitch and roll-axis(?). Not the x and y-axis. I think you'll need to remember the rotation matrix itself, not some x and y rotations. You better have only one axis you are rotating about. The axis of course depends on the direction of the MotionEvent. And the rotation amount on the total dragged distance. float xDelta = xEvent - xActionDown;//from starting point float yDelta = yEvent - yActionDown; float distance = sqrt(xDelta*xDelta+yDelta*yDelta); float xaxis = xDelta/distance;//normalized: 0.0 1.0 float yaxis = yDelta/distance; gl.glRotatef( distance, yaxis, xaxis, 0.0f );//x and y swapped! I am 100% sure the above is incorrect. You'll have to add some checks, a minus, etc. But I hope you get the basic idea?
