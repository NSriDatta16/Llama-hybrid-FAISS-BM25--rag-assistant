Creating aliases for Python packages?

I have a directory, let's call it Storage full of packages with unwieldy names like mypackage-xxyyzzww , and of course Storage is on my PYTHONPATH . Since packages have long unmemorable names, all of the packages are symlinked to friendlier names, such as mypackage . Now, I don't want to rely on file system symbolic links to do this, instead I tried mucking around with sys.path and sys.modules . Currently I'm doing something like this: import imp imp.load_package('mypackage', 'Storage/mypackage-xxyyzzww') How bad is it to do things this way, and is there a chance this will break in the future? One funny thing is that there's even no mention of imp.load_package function in the docs. EDIT: besides not relying on symbolic links, I can't use PYTHONPATH variable anymore.
