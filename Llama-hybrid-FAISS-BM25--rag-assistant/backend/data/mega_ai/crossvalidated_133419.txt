logistic regression test error rate in intercept-only model

I'm using logistic regression with LOOCV and am balancing the classes for the two responses. I noticed that with my model, the test error rate is decent (0.22) and the predictor variable is significant at alpha level of 0.001. However, when I was looking at the test error rate for an intercept-only model, it was 0.26. I would have expected it to be larger, given the classes are balanced and there are 45 samples in each class. Is the low test error rate a result of over-fitting the model? I thought that LOOCV was the best way to prevent over-fitting, since you are both training and testing on all of the available data. I would appreciate any insight into why the test error rate of the intercept model would be nearly as good as the model with a significant predictor. Should also mention the AIC was definitely lower with the model including the predictor variable.
