The problem is that AWT (and thus Swing) does not give us enough events - there are mouse-clicks, mouse-moves, and mouse-drags, but nothing like two- or more-finger movements which are used in modern touch applications. I think there might be some vendor-specific APIs to do that, but I don't know anything about them.
