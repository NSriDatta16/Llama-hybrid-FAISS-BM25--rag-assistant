First, you need to predict the future revenues based on previous data. For this you can try Time Series Prediction . Basically, you will have a recurrent neural network which works as a regression model and predicts the future revenues. Once the model is trained, we are ready to predict the future revenues. Feed the model all the data from the previous records and then generate a prediction. Using multiple if ... else statements, you can easily check whether in which category the predicted revenue value lies. Check out this and this .
