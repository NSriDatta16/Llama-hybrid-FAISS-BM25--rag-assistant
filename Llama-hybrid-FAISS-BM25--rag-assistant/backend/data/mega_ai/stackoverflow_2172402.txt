There is currently no easy way to do this elegantly, i.e. there are definitely no custom keyboards supported, only the ones supplied by the system. (Shouldn't be too hard to implement your own for nine buttons though). If you look carefully at some galleries of the new iPad, you can see that Numbers for iPad has a custom keyboard. I think this makes it quite likely that doing something like this will probably become easier once the next iPhone OS is out.
