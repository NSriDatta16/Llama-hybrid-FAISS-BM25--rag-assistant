How to monitor and log all the SQL insert commands

I am using Oracle SQL Dev 2.1.1.64 I work with application that uses oracle database for storage. Is there any way in SQL Dev. to monitor and log all the insert commands that are "coming" from the web application into database? Can you tell me how to do that?
