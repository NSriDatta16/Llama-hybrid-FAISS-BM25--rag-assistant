Probability Interval for F(x) with Parameter Estimates from Bayesian Analyses

Problem: I estimated the shape $\alpha$ and scale $\lambda$ parameter of the Weibull distribution using Bayesian methods. That gave me a marginal posterior distributions for both parameters. Calculating the highest posterior density (HPD) I got two credibility intervals and a point estimate for both paramters. Using the point estimates I can calculate the probability that a Weibull distributed variable $X$ will yield a value smaller than $x$. $F(x) = 1 - exp(- (x/\lambda)^\alpha)$ Now I also want to create a credibility interval for that probability. Question: How can I calculate the credibility interval for $F(x)$? Example Lets say that using the HPD I got credibility intervals for $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ that are [0.52 ; 0.74] and [156.3 ; 187.8] respectively. The point estomates are 0.61 and 175.5. Using the point estimates and $x = 25$ one gets $F(25) = 0.262584$ What I did so far: I used the credibility intervals of the parameters and calculated $F(25)$ for all possible combinations of the interval values and point estimates. 0.52 & 156.3 $\rightarrow$ $F(25) = 0.3199171$ 0.52 & 175.5 $\rightarrow$ $F(25) = 0.3044124$ 0.52 & 178.8 $\rightarrow$ $F(25) = 0.3019741$ ... 0.74 & 178.8 $\rightarrow$ $F(25) = 0.2080028$ I then used the minimum of these values as the lower probability interval and the maximum as the upper probability interval. But I don't know if that is a valid thing to do.
