You could register a custom converter for Class A, which gives you control over the msrshalling and unmarshalling. It's a pretty heavyweight solution, though, and makes XStream rather less attractive. It's because of cases like this that I tend to avoid XStream for everything other than very trivial situations, and never for situations where the XML might be persisted beyond the lifetime of the running application. It's just too fragile (and buggy). A more robust marshalling framework would be by choice, even if they take more up-front effort to configure.
