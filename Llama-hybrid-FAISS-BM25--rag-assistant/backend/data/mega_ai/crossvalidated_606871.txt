Clustering algorithm on undefined number of classes

Imagine we have a large system of images. We are trying to search for an image and images that are closer to it. One strategy I could think of is to embed the image say into a 100-dimensional vector. Then we can use a clustering algorithm like $k$ -means. However, our number of categories can grow as we might have a group of pictures for bikers, pedestrians, cars, bicycles, falcons, etc. That might not be an efficient use of $k$ -means. Would you suggest a better machine learning approach than $k$ -means, please? The purpose again is to do an image search given that each image is embedded in a 100-dimensional vector. In general, going with clustering algorithms does not feel right as the number of classes could grow as we don't have a predefined number of classes.
