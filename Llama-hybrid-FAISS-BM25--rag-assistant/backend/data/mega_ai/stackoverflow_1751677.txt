If you receive the UDP datagrams with a raw socket you can inspect the TTL (or anything else in the IP or UDP headers). There are lots of gotchas, though: Raw Sockets are non-native to Java (though at least one multi-platform 3rd party add-on is available: http://www.savarese.org/software/rocksaw/index.html ). On most operating systems, you must have root access or administrative privileges to use raw sockets If you wanted to use the UDP data also, you would have to do checksums and reassembly of fragmented datagrams yourself ...as well as possibly encountering different TTLs among fragments (as jambjo said).
