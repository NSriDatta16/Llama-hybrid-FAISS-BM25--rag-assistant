How many components to use when doing a PLS regression?

I'm doing a PLS regression with SAS. My man-a asked me to do find the numbers of principal components for the dataset I'm working with through SAS. As I've never done that before, I'm confused on how to do it. Should I run a PCA on my dataset then use the most relevant components found then use that numbers on my PLS or SAS has the ability to that? If so, how should I do it?
