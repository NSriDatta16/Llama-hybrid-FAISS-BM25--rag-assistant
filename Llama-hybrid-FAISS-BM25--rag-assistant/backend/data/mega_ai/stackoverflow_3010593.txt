How to include different resolution icons with Android App?

The Android docs indicate that I should ship with different icons for different resolution phone screens. http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#qualifiers res/drawable-ldpi/my_icon.png // icon image for low density res/drawable-mdpi/dpi/my_icon.png // icon for medium density res/drawable-hdpi/my_icon.png // icon image for high density This does not work when compiling with Eclipse for the Android. Does anyone has an example of a manifest file that works for multiple resolution icons? Thanks, Gerry
