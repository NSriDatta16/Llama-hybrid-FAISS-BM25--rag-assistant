Howto call an unmanaged C++ function with a std::vector as parameter from C#?

I have a C# front end and a C++ backend for performance reasons. Now I would like to call a C++ function like for example: void findNeighbors(Point p, std::vector &neighbors, double maxDist); What I'd like to have is a C# wrapper function like: List FindNeigbors(Point p, double maxDist); I could pass a flat array like Point[] to the unmanaged C++ dll, but the problem is, that I don't know how much memory to allocate, because I don't know the number of elements the function will return... Is there an elegant way to handle this without having troubles with memory leaks? Thanks for your help! Benjamin
