Thanks Paolo Bergantino. I discovered that I wasn't passing the initial hidden in with a # in front of the hidden field id, so $hidden was never getting set properly. It was difficult for me to debug because the the autocomplete is inside an ascx control as an embedded resource. Once I ensured that the value of hidden was including the # it worked properly.
