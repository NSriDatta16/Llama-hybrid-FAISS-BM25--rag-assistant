In all these answers no one bothers to tell you that the strict pragma enforces some more stringent coding practices in Perl. See its docs for the details. We explain it fully in Learning Perl too :) When you get a warning you don't understand, you can get more information with the diagnostics . Here's an example: use strict; use diagnostics; while( $href ) { 1 }; Here's the extended error message: Execution of /Users/brian/Desktop/t aborted due to compilation errors (#1) (F) You've said "use strict" or "use strict vars", which indicates that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using "my" or "state"), declared beforehand using "our", or explicitly qualified to say which package the global variable is in (using "::").
