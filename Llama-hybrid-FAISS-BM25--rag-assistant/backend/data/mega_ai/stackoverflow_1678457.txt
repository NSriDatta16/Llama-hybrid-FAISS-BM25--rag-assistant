Best algorithm for matching colours.

I have an array of around 200 colours in RGB format. I want to write a program that takes any RGB colour and tries to match a colour from the array that is most "similar". I need a good definition for "similar", which is as close as possible to human perception. I also want to show some information about matching accuracy. For example black-white: 100% and for a similar colour with a slightly different hue: -4%. Do I need to use neural networks? Is there an easier alternative?
