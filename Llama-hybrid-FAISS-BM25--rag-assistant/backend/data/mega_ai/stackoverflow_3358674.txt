Ajax replaces a bunch of HTML, how to update the associated jQuery actions like Drag And Drop?

So I've finally figured out a system for refreshing portions of the screen using Ajax, Taconite, and jQuery within Django, sortof like Ruby on Rails partials. I was pleased, but unfortunately, the code associated with clicking and drag and dropping is not executing. I'm replacing the html inside divs. How can I keep my code modular (separate pieces of content in refreshable divs), yet make sure my jQuery draggables, droppables, clickables, hoverables, etc get reactivated? Thanks! Update I setup a $(document).ready(callasetupfunction) [as recommended below] and it seems to be getting called after each AJAX call. Is that the expected behavior for .ready ? I've also noticed that i can bind multiple functions to the $(document).ready() . So I can do that (in other words it's a lot better than setting the onload huh?)
