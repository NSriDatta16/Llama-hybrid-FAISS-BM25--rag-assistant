Yeah, my question was not very clear. Here's a solution but rather than a single pass with a regex, I use a split and perform iteration. It works as well but isn't as elegant: string xpath = "//foo/bar/baz[1]/ns:foo2/@attr/text()"; string[] nodetests = xpath.Split( new char[] { '/' } ); for (int i = 0; i 0 && Regex.IsMatch( nodetests[i], @"^(\w|\[|\])+$" )) { // does not have a ":", we can manipulate it. } } xpath = String.Join( "/", nodetests );
