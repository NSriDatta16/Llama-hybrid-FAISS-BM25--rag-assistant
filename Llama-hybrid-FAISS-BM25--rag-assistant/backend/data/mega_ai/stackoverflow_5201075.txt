I did your homework, spend some attention on the comments: #include // you forgot to include string! #include using namespace std; // type definitions usually go outside the main function! struct list { string name; int age; double height; list *next; }; int main() { // mark the beginning with NULL! list *first = NULL,*temp,*temp2; for (int i=0 ;i > newlist->name; cout > newlist->age; cout > newlist->height; cout name age height next = newlist; } // set temp to the end of the list for next iteration temp = newlist; } // mark ending of list with NULL! temp->next = NULL; // creating extra node list *newlist1; newlist1 = new list; newlist1->name = "Steve"; newlist1->age = 23; newlist1->height = 2.3; // insert between 2 and 3 // temp2 holds node 3 temp2 = first->next->next; // set the "next" pointer of element 2 to the new node first->next->next = newlist1; // append the rest of the old tail to the new node newlist1->next=temp2; // delete node 4 // why 4? because 4 was the old 3 ! If we deleted the current node 3 // we would delete the node that we just have inserted! //temp2 holds node 4 temp2 = first->next->next->next; // link node 3 to 5 first->next->next->next = temp2->next; // delete node 4 delete temp2; // set to beginning of list temp = first; // separator cout name age height next; } }
