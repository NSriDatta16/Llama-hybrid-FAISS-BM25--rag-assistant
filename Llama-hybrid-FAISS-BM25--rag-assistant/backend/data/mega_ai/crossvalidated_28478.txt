Interpolation in multivariate time series

I have a problem in multivariate time series. The data consist of three time series related to foreign trade. Although my client is still doing research and attempting to find monthly data for all three series, she may only have quarterly data for some series. She has data for 10 years. I am considering interpolating monthly data from the quarterly data, and was wondering if this is a good approach, and what any drawbacks there are. Thanks
