I use this basically as a guide: http://www.hotpepper.ca/articles/semantic.shtml Also check W3Schools on definitions of the different HTML tags and what you need to use them for. For example, you wouldn't use the tag for something that isn't a caption, would you? Same thing for paragraphs, unordered lists, etc. One primarily bad example I saw from my former job was ordered lists. They used ordered lists to list down some users. That is good, but in the css, they hid the decimals. That means they could've have done with UN-ordered lists, which is what they should have used. Always ask yourself why you are using a tag before using it. "Do I really need to emphasize this text? If yes, I should use an tag." etc etc
