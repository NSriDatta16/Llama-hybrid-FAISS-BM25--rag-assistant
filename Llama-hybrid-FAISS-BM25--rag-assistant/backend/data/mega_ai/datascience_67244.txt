Knime for Retail prediction models

I am quite new to the data science field, and I was wondering if it is worth the effort to deep dive into Knime which looks quite powerful for many data science uses. I know python and scikit-learn but it seems very efficient that I can do most of my data science projects (business related) with a simple GUI interface and achieve similar if not better results than coding. The specific ways I will use Knime or the other: - Advising retail firms about association rules - Customer segmentation - Analyzing retail data to find patters in customer behavior Thank you, Dan
