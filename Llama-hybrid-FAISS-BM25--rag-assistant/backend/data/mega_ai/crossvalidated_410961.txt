Deep neural networks use Several hidden layers to hierarchically learn high level representation of a given picture, for example : first layer of your neural network might detect edges present in your given picture, second layer may detect curves present in your given picture and 3rd layer may detect your full face from your given picture,basically they try to bridge the gap between high level representation and low level features.so even if you keep on doing random initialization every time there is a possibility that first layer of your neural network might still detect something like edges present in your given picture over and over again,low level features are minor details of your picture, like lines,dots etc and these are typically caught by convolution filters... does it make sense?if you want your network to learn more features then increase neurons and hidden layers.
