If you have a disaster recovery machine for your OLTP, you might be able to use that for your warehouse. Another option is to go for two virtual machines on the same hardware. You can use the VM management to allocate min/max memory, CPUs etc. If one database needs an urgent patch, you don't have to worry about it affecting the other database. It also becomes simpler to move one off to its own hardware later, if it proves necessary. If you use a different server, what is your storage ? If they are coming off the same shared disks, they can still impact each other, even with separate CPU/memory.
