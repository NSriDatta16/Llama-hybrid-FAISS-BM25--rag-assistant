How can I edit a js file sent by the server before it gets to my browser?

During a normal browsing session I want to edit a specific javascript file before the browser receives since once it gets there it's impossible to edit. Is there are any tool for this? For what I need it I can't just save it and edit it on my disk. I'm ready to learn how to program it myself but if anyone can point out more or less what I have to do I'd be very grateful. I'd have to intercept the packets until I have the whole file while blocking the browser from receiving it any part of it, then edit it manually and forward it to the same port. I don't think I can do this by just using pcap, I've read a bit about scapy but I'm not sure if it can help me either. Thanks in advance.
