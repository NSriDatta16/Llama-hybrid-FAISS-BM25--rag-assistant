The SWF is loading just fine for me in Chrome 5.0.375.125, but the slideshow isn't loading. I suspect this may have to do with differences among how different web browsers are handling Javascript errors. I enabled script debugging for Internet Explorer (I highly recommend doing this) and opened your page, and I immediately got a Javascript error in what appears to be Flash ExternalInterface calls to Javascript functions defined in CU3ER.js. Sometimes browsers decide to stop running scripts altogether when encountering an error, and some just continue. Firefox is in the "just continue" camp. When clicking "ignore" for errors in IE, IE was able to load images but continued to cause Javascript errors. The Javascript errors appear to be occurring because CU3ER can't find itself in the DOM. This is based on the fact that this Javascript function call is emitted: __flash__addCallback(document.getElementById(""), "playCU3ER"); That emitted function is defined like this: function __flash__addCallback(instance, name) { instance[name] = function () { return eval(instance.CallFunction(" " + __flash__argumentsToXML(arguments,0) + " ")); } } The fact that document.getElementById was called with an empty string may mean that there's some missing flash variable that CU3ER requires. Check the documentation for the SWF and make sure you have what's required when embedding. Or it could be a relative vs. absolute URL issue as the others have mentioned.
