Model outcomes (such as forecast intervals) depend not only on functional form and autoregressive/moving average orders but also on the estimated coefficient values. While your model orders are clearly similar (only the MA order differs by one), perhaps the estimated coefficients differ by a lot, producing quite different behaviour in the different cases. Here is what the two models look like: Series: price ARIMA(2,1,4) with drift Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4 drift 0.1446 0.5170 0.2967 -0.4308 -0.3966 -0.4693 1.8511 s.e. 0.1104 0.0996 0.1150 0.0840 0.0923 0.0770 0.5307 sigma^2 estimated as 1086: log likelihood=-807.24 AIC=1630.49 AICc=1631.41 BIC=1655.33 and Series: price ARIMA(2,1,3) with drift Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 ma3 drift -1.0362 -0.4130 1.5536 1.2431 0.5722 0.6752 s.e. 0.1412 0.1267 0.1138 0.1417 0.0719 4.6976 sigma^2 estimated as 1152: log likelihood=-810.76 AIC=1635.52 AICc=1636.23 BIC=1657.26 The coefficient values are very different, so you may generally expect quite some discrepancy between the two models. Which is what you see in your graphs, of course.
