Attribute Error for strings created from lists

I'm trying to create a data-scraping file for a class, and the data I have to scrape requires that I use while loops to get the right data into separate arrays-- i.e. for states, and SAT averages, etc. However, once I set up the while loops, my regex that cleared the majority of the html tags from the data broke, and I am getting an error that reads: Attribute Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups' My Code is: import re, util from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup # create a comma-delineated file delim = ", " #base url for sat data base = "http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-08-28-sat-table_N.htm" #get webpage object for site soup = util.mysoupopen(base) #get column headings colCols = soup.findAll("td", {"class":"vaTextBold"}) #get data dataCols = soup.findAll("td", {"class":"vaText"}) #append data to cols for i in range(len(dataCols)): colCols.append(dataCols[i]) #open a csv file to write the data to fob=open("sat.csv", 'a') #initiate the 5 arrays states = [] participate = [] math = [] read = [] write = [] #split into 5 lists for each row for i in range(len(colCols)): if i%5 == 0: states.append(colCols[i]) i=1 while i tags line = re.search(">(.*) (.*) (.*) (.*) (.*) Any ideas regarding why this error suddenly appeared? The regex was working fine until I tried to split the data into different lists. I have already tried printing the various strings inside the final "for" loop to see if any of them were "None" for the first i value (0), but they were all the string that they were supposed to be. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
