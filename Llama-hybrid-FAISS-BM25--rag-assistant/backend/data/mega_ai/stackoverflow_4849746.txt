Putting the authors name in the songs table is not a form of denormalization and creating a new authors table is not normalization. My assumption is that either the song determines the author or the song determines multiple authors. In that case a key in the song table is a determinant for the author's name and so respecting Boyce Codd Normal Form or Fifth Normal Form the song table would be a pefectly proper place to put the authors name. On the understanding that there is no denormalization issue here, other considerations could still apply. There are too many variables to make assumptions about performance without knowing how the tables will be implemented in storage and indexes.
