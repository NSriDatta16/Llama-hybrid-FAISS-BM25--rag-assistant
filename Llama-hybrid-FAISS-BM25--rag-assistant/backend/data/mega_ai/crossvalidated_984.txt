You're not providing enough information. Why do you want to reduce the data points. A few thousand is nothing these days. Given that you want the same result each time you view the same data perhaps you want to simply bin averages. You have variable spacing on your x-axis. Maybe you're trying to make that consistent? In that case you would set a bin width of perhaps 50 msec, or 100, and then average all the points in there. Make the bin width as large as you need to reduce the data points to the size of the set you want. binw = 50 myRTBin = ceiling(myRT / binw) * binw - binw / 2 You could then just aggregate the RTs grouped by the RT bins. It's really a hard question to answer without a reason for why you're getting rid of data.
