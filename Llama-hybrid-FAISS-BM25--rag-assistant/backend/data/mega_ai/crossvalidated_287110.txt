If a sub-category column is available, is there ANY use to include the category column?

In machine learning training data, if a sub-category column is available, in THEORY is there any use to include the category column? For example, now given that the Item variable is there, should I exclude the Group variable? Price Group Item Response -------------------------------- 12 Fruit Apple Y 4 Fruit Banana N 545 Veg Carrot N 7 Fruit Banana Y 21 Fruit Banana N 111 Veg Onion N 5 Veg Onion Y 78 Fruit Apple Y 65 Fruit Orange Y 47 Veg Carrot N 112 Veg Tomato Y Think about this: Apple, Banana and Orange belong to Fruit; Carrot, Onion and Tomato belong to Vegetable. This piece of information will be discarded if I discard the Group variable. Does this information not help prediction at all?
