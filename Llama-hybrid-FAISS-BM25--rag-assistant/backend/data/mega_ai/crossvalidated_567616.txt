Feature with multiple attributes/properties

I want to build a machine learning model where each feature has further multiple attributes. Apologies for the lame example, but this will convey my doubt: Predict the animal on the basis of its fingers(let's say 5 fingers of one paw of that animal). In this case, 5 fingers are the features and each finger has its length, width, and nail-length as attributes. The following table describes one example. Let's say this example corresponds to lion. Length Breadth Nail-length Finger-1 3 cm 2 cm 1.5 cm Finger-2 4 cm 3 cm 2 cm Finger-3 3.5 cm 1.5 cm 2.5 cm Finger-4 xx cm xx cm xx cm Finger-5 xx cm xx cm xx cm Now, these 5-fingers are one set of information. How can I convert this to a feature without losing any information? I cannot split this information because for each finger the length, breadth, and nail-length are unique.
