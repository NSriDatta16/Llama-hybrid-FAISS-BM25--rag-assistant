onestop is right, you're looking to do survival analysis. In general, you can use a nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimator to plot the survival curve and then derive the "average time in service". The area underneath the survival curve works if you don't have any censored data (i.e. subscribers who are still active). Michael Berry had a nice and clear explanation of this in a blog post for a business scenario similar to yours: Why is the area under the survival curve equal to the average tenure? In your case, where you have censored data, the median time (0.5 quantile) is available as the "average time in service" -- as noted by @onestop. Harvey Motulsky's book has a nice discussion of this: Survival Curves
