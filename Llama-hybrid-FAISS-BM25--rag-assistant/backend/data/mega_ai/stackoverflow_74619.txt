Unfortunately there is no tag in the standard JSP/JSTL libraries that I know of that would allow you to do this date calculation. The simplest, and most inelegant, solution is to just use some scriptlet code to do the calculation. You've already stated that you think this is a clunky solution, and I agree with you. I would probably write a custom JSP taglib to get this if I were you.
