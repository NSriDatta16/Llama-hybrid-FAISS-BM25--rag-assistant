Individual User 'top 5' lists

I am aiming to produce a individual top 5 list for each user of my drupal site. now trying to work this one out has become quite difficult and hence why i am here. what im looking for is a top 5 list which allows the user to select nodes to be ranked by the user. so at anytime the user can edit the list and re-order the list. I am aware that this may require me creating my own module, however i believe there must be somebody who has done it before or have any information to set me along the right tracks. I am currently using views and flags to hold a number of 'favourite nodes' list which works brilliantly. however, being able to organise a top 5 list, is where I come up slightly short. any info much appreciated.
