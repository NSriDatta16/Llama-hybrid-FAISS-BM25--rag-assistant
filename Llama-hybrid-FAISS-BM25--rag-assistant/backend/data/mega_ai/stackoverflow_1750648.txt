This Just works on trunk ... JUnit 3 and 4 unit test are detected and Run As => JUnit test does the right thing. Oh, and BTW, the best way to get my attention on this sort of thing is to file a bug or enhancement ticket in Trac rather than posting messages to StackOverflow (even though it worked this time ;-)
