I guess this is why there's EmptyPanel . Without knowing about your code more I can only say that what I think you're doing is something I'd do with combination of some child of AbstractRepeater and Fragment . If you're willing to tell more about what you want to do and maybe provide some code too, I'll be happy to help as much as I can.
