That is called multivariate time-series. An input array (typically called X) needs to be constructed where each time point is a row and each feature is in a different column. One of the columns will be boolean values to encode promo/no promo for a given time point (typically called an indicator vector). To make future predictions, the Model.predict() method will be called on a new array. This new array will encode the new data, including promo/no promo feature column. It might be more straightforward to use the Prophet package which is designed for time series forecasting, including the ability to model holiday/promo days.
