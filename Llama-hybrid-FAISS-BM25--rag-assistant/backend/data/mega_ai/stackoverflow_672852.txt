SQL Server Agent - Can Job Ask Information About Itself

I don't suppose anyone knows whether a SQL Server Agent Job can ask information about itself, such as its own ID, or the path it's running from? I'm aware of xp_sqlagent_enum_jobs and sp_help_job but this doesn't help, because you have to specify the job ID. The idea is that we want code that we don't have to manage by being able to call a sproc which will identify the current job. Any ideas?
