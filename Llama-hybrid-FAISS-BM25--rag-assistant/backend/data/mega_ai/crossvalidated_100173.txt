Explanatory variables may bias predictions

I' m asking this question out of sheer curiosity, my teacher was not able to explain it. If I'm using logistic regression with categorical variables they are coded like {1,2,3}. I guess it wouldn't change my results if I used {4,5,6}. But what if linearity of coding wasn't kept? (say {4,10,99})? What I deal with is just the way of coding factor variables but is it possible that the statistical inference could be "distorted" this way? Or, worst case scenario, would I be able to draw nonsense conclusions from categorical data just because they are coded in some way?
