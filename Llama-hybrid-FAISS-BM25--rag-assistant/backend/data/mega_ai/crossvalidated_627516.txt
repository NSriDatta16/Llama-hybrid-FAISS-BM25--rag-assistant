Instance Segmentation: Categorisation of architectures (one-stage / proposal based / etc.)

I am currently working on the topic of instance segmentation. So far I have found three possibilities for categorising the architectures: one-stage / two-stage architectures proposal based / proposal free architectures detection followed by segmentation / labelling pixels followed by clustering Can anyone tell me the difference between these categorisations? For example, is one-stage also proposal free and based on labelling pixels followed by clustering ? Unfortunately, I can't specify this myself. Here are a few of my sources so far: Sharma, Rabi & Saqib, Muhammad & Lin, C. & Blumenstein, Michael. (2022). A Survey on Object Instance Segmentation. SN Computer Science. Hafiz, Abdul Mueed & Bhat, Ghulam. (2020). A survey on instance segmentation: state of the art. International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval. Carranza-García, Manuel et al. “On the Performance of One-Stage and Two-Stage Object Detectors in Autonomous Vehicles Using Camera Data.” Remote. Sens. 13 (2020): 89.
