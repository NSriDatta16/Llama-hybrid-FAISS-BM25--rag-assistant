Type of Anova test

My daughter has gathered data relating to rock pool populations of various entities across 5 months, on two sites, one with a lot of human interaction and one with little. She is starting to look at comparisons on a particular month between results in the two environments, so the data appears as: Species DisturbedMay UndisturbedMay Enteromorpha linza 22.30769 18.92857143 E. intestinalis 9.5 7.5 etc Thanks to this site we have found out the coding for a Levene test and run it, now her attention is going towards Anova. We are not sure a) if its one or two way we want (suspect the latter), and if so any hints on the R coding would be gratefully received (though please go easy on us, we understand little of R or stats)
