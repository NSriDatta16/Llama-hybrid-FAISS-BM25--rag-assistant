For isolation forest, here is a clue for validation reference. From the paper and sklearn lib,we know there are two key parameters: n_estimators and max_samples. when n_estimator = 100, the average path( score of outlier) is convergence. when max_samples = 256(the default parameter), the different dataset will be convergence similar auc. that means no need to spend time for bigger samples. According to the paper, they test difference n_estimator and max_sample to make sure the result is convergence. So, for you case, you may need use grid search to check which combination of n_estimators and max_samples could be quick reach convergence. In my case, I use titanic dataset. After scale raw data, the feature quantity is about 120. I used gridsearch and found n_estimator =200 and max_sample= 256, the outlier prediction begin to convergence. This is my way to validate unsupervised outlier detection. Hope it helpful.
