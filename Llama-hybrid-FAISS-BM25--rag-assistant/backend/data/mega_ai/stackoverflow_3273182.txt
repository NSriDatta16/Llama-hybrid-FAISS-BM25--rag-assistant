How to write properly formatted xml

I'm currently writing xml to xml doc in java but it's not properly formatted, its formatted like this : Ralls, Kim Midnight Rain Fantasy 5.95 2000-12-16 A former architect battles corporate zombies, an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen of the world. Instead of like this, what can I do to align it properly as the rest of the document? Ralls, Kim Midnight Rain Fantasy 5.95 2000-12-16 A former architect battles corporate zombies, an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen of the world. I've got a response about possible duplicate, that may be the case but in my case its not working here is my code : private void writeFile(File file) { Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes"); StreamResult resultStream = new StreamResult(new StringWriter()); DOMSource source = new DOMSource(getDocument()); transformer.transform(source, resultStream); BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file)); out.write(resultStream.getWriter().toString().trim()); out.close(); }
