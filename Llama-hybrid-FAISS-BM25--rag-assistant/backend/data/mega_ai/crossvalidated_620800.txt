Here mod_null is an intercept-only model. You could pass any features you like into that model and it will just ignore them, and return the same value it always does. Passing capital_gains into a null model doesn't change the output at all. You correctly observed that the results don't change. The plots look different because you are applying random jitter to the points. Note that your plot shows logistic regression values greater than 1 and less and 0, which is impossible. You're showing the exact same data twice with different random vertical offset applied to the points.
