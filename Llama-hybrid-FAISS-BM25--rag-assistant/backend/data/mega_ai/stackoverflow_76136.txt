I thought I'd summarise some of the great answers I've had to this question, together with my own thoughts now I've read them all :) There are two distinct issues here: Should I pre-populate the database with my special 'admin' user? Or should the application provide a way to set up when it's first used? How does one pre-populate the database with data? Note that this is a valid question regardless of the answer to part 1: there are other usage scenarios for pre-population than an admin user. For (1), it seems that setting up the first user from within the application itself is quite a bit of extra work, for functionality which is, by definition, hardly ever used. It may be slightly more secure, however, as it forces the user to set a password of their choice. The best solution is in between these two extremes: have a script (or rake task, or whatever) to set up the initial user. The script can then be set up to auto-populate with a default password during development, and to require a password to be entered during production installation/deployment (if you want to discourage a default password for the administrator). For (2), it appears that there are a number of good, valid solutions. A rake task seems a good way, and there are some plugins to make this even easier. Just look through some of the other answers to see the details of those :)
