Multiclass classification in a balanced dataset with one high-priority label

I have a balanced dataset for a multiclass classification problem with one high-priority label (this ought to be classified properly at all costs). How do I go about creating a workflow for this problem? What specific feature engineering/selection methods and classifiers should I be considering for this problem? To be more specific, the data I'm dealing with (including labels) is completely anonymized, so I don't have a clue as to what it actually stands for. Some approaches I am considering - Creating synthetic data points for the priority label through oversampling. Creating a highly non-linear model for prediction as accuracy is very important. Any help is much appreciated!
