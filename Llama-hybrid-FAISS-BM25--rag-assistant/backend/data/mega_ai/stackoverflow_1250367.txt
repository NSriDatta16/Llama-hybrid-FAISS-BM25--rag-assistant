How to pickle numpy's Inf objects?

When trying to pickle the object Inf as defined in numpy (I think), the dumping goes Ok but the loading fails: >>> cPickle.dump(Inf, file("c:/temp/a.pcl",'wb')) >>> cPickle.load(file("c:/temp/a.pcl",'rb')) Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in cPickle.load(file("c:/temp/a.pcl",'rb')) ValueError: could not convert string to float >>> type(Inf) Why is that? And moreover - is there a way to fix that? I want to pickle something that has Inf in it - changing it to something else will flaw the elegance of the program... Thanks
