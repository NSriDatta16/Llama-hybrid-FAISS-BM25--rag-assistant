Are priors in Bayesian inference similar to levels in mixed-effects models?

I often see a frequentist multi-level model (MLM) structure is defined like so (made up parameters): $$ \theta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(10, 2.5) $$ $$y_{i,j} \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta_i, 0.5) $$ But this is exactly how a NON-multi-level but Bayesian model is defined as well. Question: what sets a frequentist MLM apart from its non-MLM Bayesian counterpart (is prior a level)? By the same token, does a Bayesian-MLM model have additional "levels" compared to its frequentist counterpart due to the use of (hyper) priors?
