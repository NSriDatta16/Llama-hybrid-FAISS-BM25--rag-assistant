If you're really concerned about project organization, you should check out Matchbox . From the Matchbox Docs: Matchbox is a set of extended libraries that lets you organize your application in small components (modules). These modules have several advantages, the main one being portability. Modules are stored in their own folders and so they can be reused in other applications or shared between users by copying just that one folder. This allows you to really organize your content by placing related models and controllers in the same folder.
