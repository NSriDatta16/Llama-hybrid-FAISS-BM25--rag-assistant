Prof. Cribari-Neto was kind enough to suggest an article for this topic: F. Cribari-Neto and M. da G. A. Lima, “Heteroskedasticity-consistent interval estimators,” Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, vol. 79, no. 6, pp. 787–803, 2009. In this article he uses the normal distribution for the confidence intervals . As I wrote in my question this is also supported by my resampling study on the subject where the t-distribution gives considerable over-coverage (96-97 %) for samples $\leq 50$. A quick review of the t-distribution Unfortunately I’m not certain to exactly certain to why this is. From what I understand Gosset’s student t-distribution is based upon the uncertainty of the $S$ estimation of $\sigma$. A vital part to the t-distribution are these two formulas: $$Z = (\bar{X}_n-\mu)\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}$$ $$V = (n-1)\frac{S^2_n}{\sigma^2}$$ Where he noted that the $V$ follows the $\chi^2$-distribution. Now if we combine these two to get the t-value: $$T = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{V/v}} = \frac{(\bar{X}_n-\mu)\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}}{\sqrt{(n-1)\frac{S^2_n}{\sigma^2}/v}} = \frac{(\bar{X}_n-\mu)\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}}{\frac{s_n}{\sigma\sqrt{v}}\sqrt{(n-1)}}=\frac{(\bar{X}_n-\mu)\sqrt{n}\sqrt{v}}{s_n\sqrt{(n-1)}}$$ By working out that $ν = n − 1$ it further simplifies to: $$T = \frac{(\bar{X}_n-\mu)\sqrt{n}}{s_n}$$ I guess the $V$ estimation is changed in this case, if the uncertainty of the $S_n$ is less then we're left with the $Z$, in formula language: $$V = \lim_{S_n \to \sigma} (n-1)\frac{S^2_n}{\sigma^2} = (n-1)$$ Hmm... I hope that I got the formulas right, Wikipedia often has minimized the simplification sections and I thought it would be nice to have it here just to follow what exactly is happening (for us not working with maths on an every-day basis I find the connection between the raw form and the simplified a little hard to digest). It would be great if someone here could explain exactly why this happening with the HC-estimate.
