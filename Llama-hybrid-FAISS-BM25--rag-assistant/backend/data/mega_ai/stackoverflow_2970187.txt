A good question, but in practice I had no time such problem. If I use AddParameter then I also construct the string for the query in the same code fragment. So if I know, that now I should search for "@field2" equal to NULL I decide whether to construct string query = "SELECT * " + "FROM greatTable " + "WHERE field1 = @field1"; or string query = "SELECT * " + "FROM greatTable " + "WHERE field1 = @field1 AND field2 IS NULL"; and add only one parameter cm.AddParameter("@field1", "352515"); So I have no time the problem which you describe. UPDATED : What is the best (or the only correct) way is users input is NULL you should decide based on the context. In the most cases "AND field2 IS NULL" is not needed, but I read your question so, that in your special case the user can explicitly choose not "" (empty string), but a NULL value.
