Q1: Are there any improvements over my plan above? That depends. Mixture distribution residuals often result from doing silly things like specifying an unnecessary mixture distribution as a data model to begin with. So, my own experience suggests to at least specify as many mixture distribution terms in the output as there are in the model. Moreover, the mixture PDF's output are unlike the PDF's in the model. The Mathematica default search includes mixture distributions with two terms, and can be specified as a larger number. Q2: Is there already a comprehensive list of many analytically defined true PDFs with varying difficulties (including very difficult ones) that I can re-use here? This is a list from Mathematica's FindDistribution routine: Possible continuous distributions for TargetFunctions are: BetaDistribution, CauchyDistribution, ChiDistribution, ChiSquareDistribution, ExponentialDistribution, ExtremeValueDistribution, FrechetDistribution, GammaDistribution, GumbelDistribution, HalfNormalDistribution, InverseGaussianDistribution, LaplaceDistribution, LevyDistribution, LogisticDistribution, LogNormalDistribution, MaxwellDistribution, NormalDistribution, ParetoDistribution, RayleighDistribution, StudentTDistribution, UniformDistribution, WeibullDistribution, HistogramDistribution. Possible discrete distributions for TargetFunctions are: BenfordDistribution, BinomialDistribution, BorelTannerDistribution, DiscreteUniformDistribution, GeometricDistribution, LogSeriesDistribution, NegativeBinomialDistribution, PascalDistribution, PoissonDistribution, WaringYuleDistribution, ZipfDistribution, HistogramDistribution, EmpiricalDistribution. The internal information criterion uses a Bayesian information criterion together with priors over TargetFunctions.
