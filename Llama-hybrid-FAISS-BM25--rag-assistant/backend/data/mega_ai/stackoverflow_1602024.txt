I would think during QA testing you would keep track of the average length of time it takes a user to do a task on the site. With this average in mind you would adjust accordingly and figure out the standard deviation, using that to make a good timeout time. An example.. It takes a user an average of 5 minutes to perform a task. Let's say your SD is 2, so you'd have 5-2SD on the low end, so one minute, and 5+2SD on the high end, so that's 9 minutes. Take the high end and display a warning that the user is about to be logged off, then wait one minute and log them off automatically.
