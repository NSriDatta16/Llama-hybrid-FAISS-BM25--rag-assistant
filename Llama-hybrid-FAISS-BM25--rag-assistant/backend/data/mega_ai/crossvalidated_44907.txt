How to estimate peak load when volume increases

My company has a software system, which, amongst other things runs payroll for its client companies. In the near future, the number of companies running payroll will jump from 100 to 3000. I'm trying to investigate whether the system will be able to cope with the new load. I can do a bit of basic analysis on the logs and see that typically on the busiest days of the month, there are about 5x as many payroll runs as on the average day. The peaks could be because there is a group of companies which are connected and all run payroll on the same day, or it could be because if the numbers come out wrong, they have to make corrections and run payroll again until it's right. When the new companies come online, obviously the average load will increase by 2900%, as almost all companies only run payroll once a month. What I'm trying to estimate is how big the peaks are likely to be. Clearly as volume increases I would expect to see a smoothing effect, and the load charts to look less 'peaky'. Is there a good method for estimating the peak size, or a confidence value for the peak size, or can I only guess? Even just a point in the right direction would be great.
