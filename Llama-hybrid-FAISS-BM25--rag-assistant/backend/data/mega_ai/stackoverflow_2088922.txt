The following website (SS64.com) is INVALUABLE for batch script reference. There are excellent pages on SET , IF , you name it. The SET command is not very forgiving with extra whitespace. Also, set /a will apparently check all strings to see if they are a variable, so I don't think the %'s are required around maxA and minA. I assumed %random% was a special batch file variable that returns a random number, so I did not remove them from that. (though you might be able to) Change: set /a randA=(%random% %% %maxA%) + %minA% To: set /a randA=(%random%%%maxA)+minA And change: set agent_starts = %agent_starts% %randApos% To: set agent_starts=%agent_starts% %randApos% Doing that (and setting a minA=1,maxA=10,randB=5), I got this on my first run: "-A 3 4 3".
