LSTM, belonging to the family of RNN is best suited for this problem. Decision tree is not good in handling the sequencial data like stock compared to LSTM. LSTM network can be thought of memory networks which will store and process the previous data and pass it to till the last LSTM node to produce the output. In this case, LSTM can be used to store and process the information of past 3 days to predict the current stock price. Infact Stock prediction is one of the most successful application of LSTM. You can find a lot of resources in Google if you search for "Stock prediction using LSTM".
