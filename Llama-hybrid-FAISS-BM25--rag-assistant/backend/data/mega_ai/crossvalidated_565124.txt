Why does reversing PCA from SVD follow this formula?

In this answer the author writes: PCA is very closely related to singular value decomposition (SVD), see Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA? for more details. If a $n\times p$ matrix $\mathbf X$ is SVD-ed as $\mathbf X = \mathbf {USV}^\top$ and one selects a $k$ -dimensional vector $\mathbf z$ that represents the point in the "reduced" $U$ -space of $k$ dimensions, then to map it back to $p$ dimensions one needs to multiply it with $\mathbf S^\phantom\top_{1:k,1:k}\mathbf V^\top_{:,1:k}$ . The linked answer in the quotation says that such a reconstruction has the same dimensions $n \times p$ but lower rank. What does this term of "rank" mean in the context of PCA?
