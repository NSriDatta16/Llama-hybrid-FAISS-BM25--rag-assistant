In case you train with features x1, x2, x3 but only have one feature for prediction (say x1), you could make assumptions about x2, x3. Generally you need to specify all features used for training when making predictions. So what you can do is to say: okay if x2, x3 would look like this (make an assumption!), and given x1, the prediction is y. If this makes sense in your case is a question you have to answer yourself based on your data. But if there is a meaningful „average“ of x2, x3 or in case you can group this features in some way, you may be able to get a good idea of what will happen in the future. Note: using only one feature (such as time date) to train a model will likely not produce great predictions. However, ultimately you need to try.
