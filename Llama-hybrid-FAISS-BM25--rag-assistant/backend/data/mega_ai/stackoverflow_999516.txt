Subversion and CI build processes

Here at work we are using Subversion and CruiseControl.NET and as our source control and CI tools. Our Subversion structure is setup like the following: Project Branch Tag 1.0.0.0 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2 Trunk At present our process for creating builds is to create a tag from the trunk and a run batch file to build our solutions for the tag. The batch file also runs all of our MSTests and calculates our code coverage results. I was wondering if this is a normal practice or if it would be better to build form trunk and use CI (Hudson or similar) to automatically create the tag?
