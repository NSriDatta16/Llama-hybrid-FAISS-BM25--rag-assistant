Bing Maps - Javascript vs Silverlight

Currently, I am evaluating the creating of a map based system to plot data. This data would consists of shape layers (a grid - stored in a SQL 2008 Geography column) and multiple points (~5500 initially - Lat/Lon points in the same DB) that will plot the location of items on the grid. So, my question is - is there a large difference between the SilverLight Bing Map implementation and the JavaScript based implementation. Here is what I can gather from my research: SilverLight Pros Can handle large amounts of data more quickly API/SDK to tie directly to .NET application code JavaScript Pros Do not have to download/install Silverlight on client side Can leverage JQuery or other frameworks to pull data from webservice (I know SL can do this to using WCF, but I know JQuery rather well) I know from this list that it looks like I should go with Silverlight, however I also have 'NEVER' done a bit of coding using the XAML stuff. Most of my experience as of late is the .NET MVC stuff and I cannot help but to take that into account as well. Does anyone know the performance 'ratio' between SilverLight and Javascript or at what point JavaScript implementation will choke? One more thing, I have looked at the DataConnect project on codeplex, but it seems to be broken - I cannot get the WKT or XAML functions to work either on their live site or the downloaded project. If anyone out there has done a comparison/has words of wisdom for guidance/can add to my list for either of the two, I am all ears. EDIT I found a great Javascript/.NET MVC application example using SQL 2008 on CodePlex - Ajax Map Data Connector . It gives examples of pulling polygons, lines and points of interest from the database, placing them on the map using images tiles or the MS API as well as using intersection to determine items around a point or within a bounded box.
