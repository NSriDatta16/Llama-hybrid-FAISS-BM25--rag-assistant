performance counter in c# - calculate average of sample

hi i am grabbing frames from ip camera and want to export via perf counters the time diff between frames. and present it as # timediff / sec. i have created 2 counters one as PerformanceCounterType.AverageCount64 and the seconds as PerformanceCounterType.AverageBase i am adding them ine after the other (the base come second) for every frame i am calculating the diff and increase both counters e.g pc.increaseby(40) pcbase.increaseby(1) on second process i want to display the counter so when i am calculating Single numerator = (Single)s1.RawValue - (Single)s0.RawValue; Single denomenator = (Single)s1.BaseValue - (Single)s0.BaseValue; Single counterValue = numerator / denomenator; the basevalue is always 0 -> any ideas?
