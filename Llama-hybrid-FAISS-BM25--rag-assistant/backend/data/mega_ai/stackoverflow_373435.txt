The humility of seeing so much code, some good, some bad and then some that is just weird, that you recognize what you want to have where you work and what you don't want to have. For example, some like a "Cowboy" style programming while others are totally methodical and won't do anything with it being part of a plan that has been written up, vetted and signed off on by 3 upper management folks to have the blessing to do something that may take a couple of weeks. Getting better at organizing code and seeing where one can refactor to make something more generic so it has more uses or when to try to lock something down so it gets done as opposed to cosmetic changes done over and over again as the customer doesn't know what they want but they don't want the 101 prototypes they have seen.
