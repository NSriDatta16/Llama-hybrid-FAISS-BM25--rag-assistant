This may be confusing, as two different definitions are used depending on the context. In statistics, in the context of regression modelling we use $n-k$ in denominator. This is discussed in Wikipedia : In regression analysis, the term mean squared error is sometimes used to refer to the unbiased estimate of error variance: the residual sum of squares divided by the number of degrees of freedom . . . On another hand, in machine learning by RMSE people usually mean square root of averaged squared errors (i.e. $n$ in denominator). This is how it is implemented in every major machine learning software including scikit-learn , TensorFlow & others.
