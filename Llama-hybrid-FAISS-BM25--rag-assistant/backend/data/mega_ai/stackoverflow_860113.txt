I have the same problem and nothing seems to be faster than a ms, even the Sleep(0). My problem is the communication between a client and a server application where I use the _InterlockedExchange function to test and set a bit and then I Sleep(0). I really need to perform thousands of operations per second this way and it doesn't work as fast as I planned. Since I have a thin client dealing with the user, which in turn invokes an agent which then talks to a thread, I will move soon to merge the thread with the agent so that no event interface will be required. Just to give you guys an idea how slow this Sleep is, I ran a test for 10 seconds performing an empty loop (getting something like 18,000,000 loops) whereas with the event in place I only got 180,000 loops. That is, 100 times slower!
