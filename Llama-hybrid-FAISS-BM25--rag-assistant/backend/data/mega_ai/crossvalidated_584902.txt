Confusing presentation of survival model diagnostics in Tutz & Schmid (2016)

I am reading Tutz & Schmid "Modeling Discrete Time-to-Event Data" (2016) chapter 4 Evaluation and Model Choice section 4.2 Residuals and Goodness-of-Fit. I got stuck on p. 78: The first hurdle is the third paragraph ( In discrete survival one considers... ). What is a response? How come a single person $i$ generates a $k$ -long random vector? (I suspect $k=q$ .) It would make some sense if we had encoded the survival time $T=t$ by a $t$ -long binary vector $(0,\dots,0,1)$ where $0$ denotes survival and $1$ denotes failure, but the authors use a different notation $(T_{i1},\dots,T_{ik})$ for such an encoding elsewhere in the book. Also, then $n_i$ would only be equal to 1 if the individual failed in the first time period, but this is not what is implied in the last sentence of the paragraph. The second hurdle is Moreover, let $p_{it}$ denote the proportion of observations in period $t$ in subpopulation $i$ . What is subpopulation $i$ ? What is the denominator of the proportion? Initially I would guess $p_{it}$ were the estimand of $\hat\pi_{it}$ (and thus a population quantity), but that would make $\chi_P^2$ and $r_{P,i}^2$ unobservable, while I think they should be observable. So then $p_{it}$ should be an observed quantity. I am really confused.
