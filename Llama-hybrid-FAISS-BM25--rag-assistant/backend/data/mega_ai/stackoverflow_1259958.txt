If you change the top of the panel the order of visually panel change. Try this (all the panels aligned altop and with the same Height ): PANEL0 PANEL1 PANEL2 PANEL3 PANEL4 At OnClick event of all panels do this: TPanel(Sender).Top := TPanel(Sender).Top - TPanel(Sender).Height - 2; If you click on a panel it moves up one position. That's the idea. Change the Top X pixels. At the same, if you do this: TPanel(Sender).Top := TPanel(Sender).Top - (TPanel(Sender).Height * 2)- 2; The panel up 2 positions. ADDED: If you use Drag&Drop, this events return the position (X and Y); With the original position and end position you can calculate the wew top for asign to the panel. Excuse form my poor english. regards
