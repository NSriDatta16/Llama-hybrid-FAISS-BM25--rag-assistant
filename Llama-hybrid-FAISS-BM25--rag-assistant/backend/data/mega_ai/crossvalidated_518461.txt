How does Word2Vec CBOW softmax work with multiple context words?

I'm referring to following paper from Xin Rong - "word2vec Parameter Learning Explained" , to be precise the equation (4): $$ p(w_j|w_I) = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{v’}^{T}_{w_{j}}\mathbf{v}_{w_{I}})}{\sum_{j'=1}^{V}\exp(\mathbf{ v’}^{T}_{w_{j'}} \mathbf{ v}_{w_{I}})} $$ Simply said, do I understand correctly that wj describes my target word and wi is the single context word? Would the equation look different with multiple context words or does it remain the same because wi describes the average of all context words? Edit: Added the equation in TeX
