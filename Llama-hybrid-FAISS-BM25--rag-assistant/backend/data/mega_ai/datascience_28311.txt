Predict the next player's option for betting based on playing history?

I have a project which is to predict in next time, which option player will select for betting. This prediction based on his history. For example, the player have time series data, the last options they selected, how much money they spend, did they loose or win...ect. There are many options for one bet, around 300. Based on that data, I want to predict next time which option (or possibility of options) they will choose for betting. I don't know which kind of problem it is. Is it kind of product recommendation, multi-class classification or multi-label classification? Any keyword, or suggestion to solve this kind of problem? Thanks.
