HTML5 Canvas + select / drag-and-drop features in a JS lib?

I'd like to use HTML5 Canvas, but I'd like to use it in terms of shapes, texts and curves, able to attach traditional DOM events like onClick or drag-and-drop functions. Is there any Javascript library that is able to do that for me? I've seen that gwt-canvas is close to this approach, but haven't looked it in details. Thanks, Istvan
