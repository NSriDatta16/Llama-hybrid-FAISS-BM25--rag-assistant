Have you considered using GraphLab Create ? It's a Python tool for doing many different types of Machine Learning. General info about their Recommender System can be found here . A hands-on coding example can be found here . Using this product you should be able to create a Recommender System in as few as five lines of code. One downside, if you're using it for a commercial purpose, you'll need to get a license for the product. Although they do have a free trial period.
