Upperbound for Norm of Lagged Autocovariance Matrix

Suppose $X_t$ is a vector valued time series in $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Assume for the moment that $X_t$ is stationary with $EX_t=0$ , $E\|X_t\|^2 , and let $$ C_h = E[X_0 X_h^\top] $$ denote the autocovariance matrix at lag $h$ . What I wish to show is that $$ \|C_h\|_2 \le \|C_0\|_2, $$ or find a counterexample to this statement. Here $\|\cdot\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt Norm: $$\|A\|_2^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^d a_{i,j}^2. $$ So far all I can show is the weaker statement that $$ \|C_h\|_2 \le trace(C_0). $$ To see this, we have by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for expectation and stationarity that $$ \|C_h\|_2^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^d (E[X_{0,i}X_{h,j}])^2 \le \sum_{i,j=1}^d E[X_{0,i}^2]E[X_{h,j}^2] = \sum_{i,j=1}^d E[X_{0,i}^2]E[X_{0,j}^2] =[trace(C_0)]^2. $$ Part of me believes that this bound must be sharp (i.e. there is a counter example), but I really have no idea! Any help/advice is much appreciated.
