Take a look at pahole, short for Poke-a-Hole. It's one of the DWARF2 tools used to find holes in structs, holes being spaces between members due to alignment rules, that could be used for new struct entries or be reorganized to reduce the size. Read more about it in this LWN article by the author of the program, Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo. There's not many tutorials to be found on the net, but this wiki-page at CERN is somewhat helpful.
