Use the rGARMA function in the ts.extend package You can simulate an $\text{AR}(2)$ model using the rGARMA function in the ts.extend package (see O'Neill 2021 for details). This package allows you to simulate from the marginal or conditional distribution from any stationary Gaussian ARMA process. $^\dagger$ To use the function you need to stipulate the parameters of your model (and any conditioning values you want to use). Below I give an example of some code where you first stipulate the parameters of the model and then simulate $n=12$ vectors of $m=100$ values from the process. (By default the function uses a process with zero mean and unit error variance, but you can change these values if you want.) The generated object ERRORS is a $12 \times 100$ matrix showing the simulated time-series vectors. If you just want to simulate a single time-series vector you can set $n=1$ in the simulation. #Load the package library(ts.extend) #Set the model parameters AR The plot generated by the package shows each of the simulated time-series vectors; the points in the background are the points from all $n=12$ vectors. (If you want to get rid of these then just set background = FALSE when you call the plot.) $^\dagger$ The "GARMA" in rGARMA refers to the Gaussian Auto-Regressive Moving Average model.
