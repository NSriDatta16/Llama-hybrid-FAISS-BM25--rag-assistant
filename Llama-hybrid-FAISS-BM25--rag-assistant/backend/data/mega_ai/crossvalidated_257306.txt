Which distribution should be used to calculate prior mean from posterior mean?

I was reading Pattern recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop. There I found this equation, 2.21, which states how to calculate prior mean as the average of posterior mean. $$\mathbb{E}_{\theta}{[\theta]} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[\mathbb{E}_{\theta}{[\theta|\mathcal{D}]}]$$ where, $$\mathbb{E}_{\theta}{[\theta]} = \int p(\theta)\theta d\theta$$ and $$\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}[\mathbb{E}_{\theta}{[\theta|\mathcal{D}]}]=\int \Big\{ \int \theta p(\theta | \mathcal{D})d\theta\Big\}p(\mathcal{D})d\mathcal{D}$$ But I think the integration formula for $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}{[\theta]}$ is wrong. It should be, $$\mathbb{E}_{\theta}{[\theta]} = \int \int \theta p(\theta,\mathcal{D}) d\theta d\mathcal{D}$$ where $p(\theta,\mathcal{D})$ is the joint probability density of $p$ and $\mathcal{D}$. Otherwise the integration of both sides do not match.
