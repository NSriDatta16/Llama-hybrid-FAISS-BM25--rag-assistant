Data scientist vs machine learning engineer

What are the differences, if any, between a "data scientist" and a "machine learning engineer"? Over the past year or so "machine learning engineer" has started to show up a lot in job postings. This is particularly noticeable in San Francisco, which is arguably where the term "data scientist" originated. At one point "data scientist" overtook "statistician", and I'm wondering if the same is now slowly beginning to happen to "data scientist". Career advice is listed as off-topic on this site, but I view my question as highly relevant since I'm asking about definitions; I'm not asking about recommendations given my own career trajectory or personal circumstances like other off-topic questions have. This question is on-topic because it might someday have significant implications for many users of this site. In fact, this stack-exchange site might not exist if the "statistician" vs "data scientist" evolution had not occurred. In that sense, this is a rather pertinent, potentially existential question.
