Both components of the loss are important, but one cannot compare their numerical values a priori since they describe very different aspects, as in the proverbial apples and oranges. Consider the component related to the size of the bounding box: $$\lambda_\text{coord} \sum_{i = 1}^{S^2} \sum_{j = 1}^{B} \mathbb 1_{ij}^\text{obj} \left[\left(\sqrt{w_{ij}} - \sqrt{\hat w_{ij}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{h_{ij}} - \sqrt{\hat h_{ij}}\right)^2\right].$$ Here the widths and heights are fractional with respect to the dimensions of the full image. Imagine that instead of the original dataset, we trained the neural network on 50% central crops by area. Then all these $w$ and $h$ would get scaled by $\sqrt 2$ and this component of the loss would increase by factor 2. This indicates that the numeric value of the localization loss is not meaningful by itself. Instead, $\lambda_\text{coord}$ is a hyperparameter that controls its relative importance. I suspect that the authors of the YOLO paper have tried different values for it and found that $\lambda_\text{coord} = 5$ gave a good mAP on the PASCAL VOC dataset.
