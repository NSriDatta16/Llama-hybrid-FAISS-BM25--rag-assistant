You can use either Wordpress or DotNetNuke for that. These CMS (Content Management System) tools will allow you to easily create the forms UI, authentication, authorization,...etc. They contain these functions already implemented, you just have to organize and put then together to fit your needs. There is no a generic 1-click solution for your specific needs but these tools should make the journey a lot shorter.
