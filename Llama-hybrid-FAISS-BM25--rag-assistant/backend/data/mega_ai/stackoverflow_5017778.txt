What does Load mean in Magento Objects?

I m trying to learn coding a bit through Magento, and I have to admit that I'm a bit confused about this notion of object chaining in it. In fact I don't understand when to do a load and when I can avoid it. For exemple: $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($item->getProductId()); I would like to get the info of product from a product ID in this case; why do I need to load it? ( $item is the loop of all the products of an order) And here I don't need to do any load: $customer = $payment->getOrder()->getCustomer(); I'm sorry in advance for my stupid question: What does load do comparing to my second example? Thanks a lot and have a nice day, Anselme
