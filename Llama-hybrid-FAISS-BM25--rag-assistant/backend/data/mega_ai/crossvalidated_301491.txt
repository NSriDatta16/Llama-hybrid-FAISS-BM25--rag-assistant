Since calling any linear combination that is I(0) a cointegration relation is not in the spirit of the original definition I will stick to defining a cointegrating combination as one where none of the original variables are I(0). The case of two series: Two series of different orders of integration will never be cointegrated. Two series both being I(0) cannot be cointegrated. Two series both being I($d$) for $d\geq 1$ can be cointegrated, but they don't have to. The case of more than two series: Only I($d$) series with $d\geq 1$ can enter the cointegration relationship. Thus I(0) series will never belong in a cointegration relationship. At least two of the series must share the highest order of integration to cointegrate. E.g. three {I(2), I(2), I(1)} processes can cointegrate but {I(2), I(1), I(1)} cannot. All of this is basic material that should be found in most of the time series textbooks dealing with cointegration. But I understand that keeping track of the discussion in a textbook can be hard, so let this serve as a summary.
