Re-training deep learning models multiple times to be able to compare their performance?

Let us say I have two deep learning models that differ in their hyperparameters and I want to compare their performance to each other (in terms of acc/ROC for example). However, a single value from each model does not give me any way of statistical appraisal (eg acc_1 = 0.82 vs acc_2 = 0.84 does not really say much). Would it make sense then to re-train each of the models, say 20 times, and then use t-test to compare each metric between the two models?
