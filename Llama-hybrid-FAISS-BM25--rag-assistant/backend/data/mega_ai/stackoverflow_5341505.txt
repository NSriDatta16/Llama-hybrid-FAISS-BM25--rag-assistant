Updated google anaytics binding?

I'm having a hard time using the newest google analytics piece with the MonoTouch bindings that Miguel has here: https://github.com/migueldeicaza/monotouch-libs/tree/master/GoogleAnalytics I'm guessing that the interface has changed a bit in ways that are incompatible, but I'm not sure how to diagnose. At run time, I get this error: System.InvalidCastException: Cannot cast from source type to destination type. at GoogleAnalytics.GANTracker.get_SharedTracker () [0x00000] in :0 It appears that only two methods were added, so I attempted to add these to "api.cs" - but got a series of compiler errors that didn't seem to tie into the situation. [Export ("setCustomVariableAtIndex:index:name:value:scope:error"),Internal] bool _SetCustomVariableAtIndex(int index, string name, string value, int scope, IntPtr nsErrorPtr); [Export ("setCustomVariableAtIndex:index:name:value:error"),Internal] bool _SetCustomVariableAtIndex(int index, string name, string value, IntPtr nsErrorPtr); Has anyone else overcome this, and is successfully using the NoThumb version of google analytics with MonoTouch ?
