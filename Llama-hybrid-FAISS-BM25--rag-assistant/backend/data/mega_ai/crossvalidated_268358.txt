Factor Analysis - Rotation failed to converge in 25 iterations!

I am conducting a Factor Analysis using PCA. I have used Oblique and Orthagonal Rotations and when I am trying to analyse my results I get the message: "Rotation failed to converge in 25 iterations" So I had to adjust this - sometimes I get the results using 29 and sometimes more than 50. Is there an underlying problem with my results? As I have heard through tutorials on YouTube that it should not be more than 25 interactions!
