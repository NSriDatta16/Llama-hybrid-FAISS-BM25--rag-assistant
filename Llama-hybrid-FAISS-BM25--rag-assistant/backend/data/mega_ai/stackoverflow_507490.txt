Well i have list of workers in DB and there is this facility that if they want to mail to all or some of the workers then they can do it.I have completed this task using Microsoft Office now as a Add in we are providing the facility to perform the same task using Open Office. What they have to do is just select the List of workers and click on a button and it will automate the mailmerge using the field of those workers data from DB. The Code of mine is as shown below Public Sub OpenOfficeMail(ByVal StrFilter As String) Dim oSM ''Root object for accessing OpenOffice from VB Dim oDesk, oDoc As Object ''First objects from the API Dim arg(-1) ''Ignore it for the moment ! ''Instanciate OOo : this line is mandatory with VB for OOo API oSM = CreateObject("com.sun.star.ServiceManager") ''Create the first and most important service oDesk = oSM.createInstance("com.sun.star.frame.Desktop") ''Create a new doc oDoc = oDesk.loadComponentFromURL("private:factory/swriter", "_blank", 0, arg) ''Close the doc oDoc.Close(True) oDoc = Nothing ''Open an existing doc (pay attention to the syntax for first argument) oDoc = oDesk.loadComponentFromURL("file:///C:\Users\Savan\Documents\1.odt", "_blank", 0, arg) Dim t_OOo As Type t_OOo = Type.GetTypeFromProgID("com.sun.star.ServiceManager") Dim objServiceManager As New Object objServiceManager = System.Activator.CreateInstance(t_OOo) Dim oMailMerge As New Object oMailMerge = t_OOo.InvokeMember("createInstance", Reflection.BindingFlags.InvokeMethod, Nothing, _ objServiceManager, New [Object]() {"com.sun.star.text.MailMerge"}) 'com.sun.star.text.MailMerge"}) oMailMerge.DocumentURL = "file:///C:\Users\Savan\Documents\1.odt" oMailMerge.DataSourceName = CreateSource(StrFilter)''Function that will return the datasource name which will be a text file's path oMailMerge.CommandType = 0 oMailMerge.Command = "file:///C:\Mail.txt" oMailMerge.OutputType = 2 oMailMerge.execute(New [Object]() {})**---->I am getting Error here** End Sub
