How can I plot relationship between two variables with the constraint of initiating the S-shaped curve from (0,0) as depicted in the example below?

I don't want to run logistic regression or any such regression model. I have 8 to 10 pairs of data points and want to analyze the logistic growth model by fitting any function-generating S-shaped curve like tanh() or so on. I am using R for the assigned task. The blue points in the graph represent the data points and I want to fit the curve as depicted in the graph.
