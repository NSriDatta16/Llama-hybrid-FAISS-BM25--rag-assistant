Web service call with Query Ajax hangs

Before I start posting a ton of code I think I may be able to explain my situation more logically. I have eight drop downs on a page being populated in exactly the same way except they are using different stored procs. The ones that return a LOT of rows (around 44000 but each rows is only about an average of 5 characters) are the ones that don't work. I am using a web service calls to get the data. The service calls are being called with JQuery ajax. The calls when run directly in SSMS take about 2 seconds to run. When less records are returned everything works. So it's not a problem with the code logic, its an issue with the number of records. I know it's not a good idea to populate anything with this many records but this number of records is only returned in rare cases and I would rather not catch and avoid this situation, I would rather the program just run correctly. Is there some reason that these calls just hang? I have It seems to me that while it may be slow, or not great idea, that it should still be possible! I'll post my code if need be. Any ideas?
