HTTP authentication is not insecure over unencrypted connections as long as you're using the digest method. That said, the nonexistence of a logout mechanism is a serious downside and, together with minimal user-agent implemented interface for entering the credentials are the main reasons it's not used for user-facing pages. In your case -- a backend service --, moving from a simple stateless mechanism to a session-based one is much less compelling (there's typically no need for "logout" functionality), and I would recommend against it unless the authentication were very expensive on the server-side. If you want your service to be used by third-parties without the user providing his credentials to that third party, HTTP authentication is of course insufficient (though it could be still be used for the authentication part), but it also requires more complicated approaches (like OAuth) that I think don't fit in what you're thinking when you say "session-based system".
