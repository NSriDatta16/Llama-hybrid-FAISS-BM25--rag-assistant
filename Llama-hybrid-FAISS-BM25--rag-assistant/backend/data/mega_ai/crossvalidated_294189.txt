CNN where pixels are constituted by large, potentially sparse vectors

I'd like to apply a CNN to a problem where the image is essentially a matrix representation of a geographical map where matrix indices correspond to the locations of buildings and roads. Each location will have various features associated with it which would be represented by a sparse vector corresponding to a pixel. The reason I am applying a CNN to this dataset is that I think shape data is important to phenomenon I am trying to learn, however, I've only ever encountered vectorized pixels in the context of representing rgb values for colorized images. My questions are: 1) Is this a sensible approach to the type of data I am trying to learn from? Are CNNs a good fit or are there better options? 2) Are there any good examples of this sort of semi-pictoral approach working? Are there existing applications of CNNs where each training datum consists of a matrix of spatially arranged locations associated with a set of non-pictoral information, such as location-type (park, road, building, etc.)?
