Probably not the most elegant way, but it seems to work $ umask 0002 $ mv value.c value.c.tmp $ cat value.c.tmp > value.c $ rm value.c.tmp one could argue that it could be made bulletproof, but then someone brings along a RPG... If both of you need to chmod, I can not think of another way - if it is OK that YOU can chmod but no the other guy, you can chmod 6770 . or chmod g+s,u+s . in the directory (e.g. set SUID and GUID bits) so the one that owns the directory will always be the owner of the files. Unfortunately some (if not most), namely EXT2/3/4 ignore the SUID bit. Of course, setting the umask to 0002 will solve the problem by not making it mandatory.
