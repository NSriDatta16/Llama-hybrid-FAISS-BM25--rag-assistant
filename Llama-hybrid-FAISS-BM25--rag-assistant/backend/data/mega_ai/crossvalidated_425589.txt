Why do we report standard deviation instead of standard deviation of the mean in cross-validation?

I finished a statistics course and now I have some doubts about basic procedures used to train machine learning models. For instance, k-fold crossvalidation results are usually reported as: Mean +/- standard deviation But why is that so? Isn't it more appropriate to use the standard deviation of the mean to represent the spread of accuracy scores between folds?
