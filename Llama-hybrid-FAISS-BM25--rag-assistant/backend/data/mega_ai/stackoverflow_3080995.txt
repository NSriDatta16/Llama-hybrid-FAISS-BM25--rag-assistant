Change Magento subcategory style

In my e-shop I have two root categories and four subcategories: COMPUTERS ibm apple acer asus MONITORS When printing the names of the products in the computer subcategories, I'd like to add the logo to each product title. How do I know which category each product belongs to? Which file should I edit? Thanks
