Fantastic question. I'd love to see some best practices shown. I've got a lot of files that I distribute, so I've set up my project into several wxs source files. I have a top level source file which I call Product.wxs which basically contains the structure for the installation, but not the actual components. This file has several sections: ... s ... ... A bunch of these that The rest of the .wix files are composed of Fragments that contain ComponentGroups which are referenced in the Feature tag in the Product.wxs. My project contains a nice logical grouping of the files that I distribute .... This isn't perfect, my OO spider sense tingles a bit because the fragments have to reference names in the Product.wxs file (e.g. the DirectoryRef) but I find it easier to maintain that a single large source file. I'd love to hear comments on this, or if anyone has any good tips too!
