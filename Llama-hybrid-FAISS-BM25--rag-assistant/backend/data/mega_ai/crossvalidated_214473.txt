Of course when the values of A and B are known, the value of C doesn't give information anymore about A. The value of C becomes useful in the case value of A is unknown. That is the value of C tells some info about the value of A and further, tells a little bit about X. It can be said there's an active trail from C to X through A. If A is known the trail becomes inactive. And another note is that trails in Bayesian networks behave very differently from those in Markov networks.
