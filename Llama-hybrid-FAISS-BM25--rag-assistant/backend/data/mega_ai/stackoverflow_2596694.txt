MySQL is accessible from C using the Connector/C library. It appears that MS SQL Server is only compatible with ODBC and doesn't provide its own C library. MS has been subtly discouraging C development for a long time, so this isn't surprising. AFAIK, Oracle, PostGreSQL both have their own C libraries. All of these can also be accessed via ODBC (this includes MySQL) SQLite is primarily an embedded database written as a C library. This only supports a non-standard version of SQL, so it may not be what you want, but is excellent for storage of small amounts of data. The C API docs can be found here .
