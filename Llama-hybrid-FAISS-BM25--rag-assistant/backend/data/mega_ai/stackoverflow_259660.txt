Painless 'Analysis of Algorithms' Training?

I had a painful experience with the "Analysis of Algorithms" classes back in college but have recently found a need for it in the real world . -- Anyway, I'm looking for a simple-yet-effective crash course. Any ideas? Related Sidenote: It sure would be nice if there were a "Cartoon Guide to Algorithm Analysis", taught by Dilbert. UPDATE: A very similar question can be found at: How to get started on ALGORITHMS?
