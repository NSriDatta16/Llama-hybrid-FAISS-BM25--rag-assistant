You don't need pointers, at all. std::list myList; Enemy en; en.load("earth.png"); en.setPos(150,150); myList.push_back(en); typedef std::list ::iterator iterator; for (iterator it = list.begin(), end = list.end(); it != end; ++it) { it->move(); } I would also encourage you to fetch a book about C++ somewhere (for beginners), or about the STL if it's your particular hurdle. C++ is not, unfortunately, something you can experiment with without guidance (at first at least).
