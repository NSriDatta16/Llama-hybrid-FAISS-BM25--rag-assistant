Consider the psychological tendencies associated with sunk cost. That is, when you get to the second part of the equation, that laziness gene we all have makes us want to protect the work we have already done. The consequences? If you write the tests first... You tend to write the code to fit the tests. This encourages the "simplest thing that solves the problem" type development and keeps you focused on solving the problem not working on meta-problems. If you write the code first... You will be tempted to write the tests to fit the code. In effect this is the equivalent of writing the problem to fit your answer, which is kind of backwards and will quite often lead to tests that are of lesser value. Although I'd be surprised if 1 programmer out of 50 ALWAYS writes tests first, I'd still argue that it is something to strive for if you want to write good software.
