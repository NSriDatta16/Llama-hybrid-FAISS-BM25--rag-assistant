How to securely store a user's OpenID

I'm writing a web application that allows anyone to register (using their OpenID). When a user registers, their OpenID is saved in a MySQL database. My question is: In which format should I be storing a user's OpenID value? If someone were to gain access to my database (I'm planning for the worst case scenario) - would it be an issue that the user's OpenID can be viewed unencrypted? Should i be encrypting it when it goes into storage?
