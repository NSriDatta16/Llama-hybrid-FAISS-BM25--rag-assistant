HTTP: Pattern to partially update a resource (that accepts empty strings)?

If there's a resource of type Foo with unique ID 36 at location: http://example.com/foo/36 and a Foo contains several pieces of variable data ( var1 , var2 , etc.), some of them strings; What's the preferred pattern for updating a partial set of the resource's variables via HTTP (given that we may wish to set some to be empty strings)? (The problem being that a form value of an empty string is not considered "successful" by the W3C standard and is not required to be submitted by the browser. If the empty value is not sent, the server doesn't know that we wanted to set that variable to an empty string.) I've thought of the following options: POST to http://example.com/foo/36 with a list of name/value pairs for variables that have a "successful" value, and an extra parameter, the value of which is a comma-separated list of values that we wish to set to be an empty string. PUT to http://example.com/foo/36/var1;var2;var3 , specifying the complete set of values that we want to update as part of the URI. Any specified name not received as a PUT argument will be set to an empty string. Send separate PUT requests to each variable at http://example.com/foo/36/var1 , http://example.com/foo/36/var2 , etc. Expose every variable as a separate resource (very explicit, but involves lots of requests). But none of these seem intuitive, elegant or standard to me.
