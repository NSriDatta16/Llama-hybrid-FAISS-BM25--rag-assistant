How do you access Control.ViewState with a dynamically added Control subclass?

We have created a control that needs to persist data via the ViewState property of the Control class. Our class subclasses control strictly to get access to the ViewState property (it's protected on the Page object). We are adding the control to Page.Controls in OnInit, and then attempt to set the ViewState property in OnPreLoad. When we decode and examine the ViewState of the page, our values have not been written out, and are thus not available for later retrieval. Does anyone know how we can get our control to participate in the ViewState process?
