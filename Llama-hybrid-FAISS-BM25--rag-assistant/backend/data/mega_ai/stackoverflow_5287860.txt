I figured it out. Cassandra was NOT loading storage-conf.xml it was loading cassandra.yaml. When I ran bin/cassandra -f, I saw that was actually one of the first lines. I fixed the problem by using the bin/config-converter tool and replacing the cassandra.yaml with the output of the converter tool: cd [path to cassandra]/conf mv cassandra.yaml __old_cassandra.yaml ../bin/config-converter storage-conf.xml cassandra.yaml I then found that cassandra wouldn't start. I received this error: ERROR 05:58:03,117 Fatal exception during initialization org.apache.cassandra.config.ConfigurationException: Saved cluster name Test Cluster != configured name The way I fixed that was by going to the folder where Cassandra stores the system data which was: cd /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/ and deleting the contents rm -f *.* Then, Cassandra started fine. I repeated the steps on my second node. It worked. The command bin/nodetool -h localhost ring Reveals that I have two nodes up and running. Success. Now, my only question is--going forward--when I want to modify storage-conf.xml will I have to copy it again to a yaml? Or will Cassandra automatically load my changes?
