Nice to hear people are working with Japanese. I think you're spot on with your assessment of the problem difficulty. I just asked one of the Japanese guys in my lab, and the way to do it seems to be as you describe: Take a list of Kanji Infer (guess) the yomigana Sort yomigana by gojuon. The hard part is obviously step two. I have two guys in my lab: 高橋 and 高谷. Naturally, when sorting reports etc. by name they appear nowhere near each other. EDIT If you're fluent in Japanese, have a look here: http://mecab.sourceforge.net/ It's a pretty popular tool, so you should be able to find English documentation too (the man page for mecab has English info).
