The ~ folder represents the users home directory. So your folder would be ~/Library/Application Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My Templates . In response to your comment: I am not sure if this is possible. You could try ln from Terminal. It is a utility for making links. But I think it just converts ~ to the actual path of your home directory when you use it. And I think you would have to make a symbolic link as apposed to a hard link, which some file systems might not support (All macs should though). Another possibility would be to make a simple Applescript droplet that uses a shell script to move the file you drag onto it to the path you want. Paste the following code into script editor and save it as an Application or Application Bundle (doesn't matter which): on open thefile do shell script "mv " & POSIX path of thefile & " ~/Library/Application\ Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My\ Templates/" end open When you drag a file to the application you made it will move it to your directory. You could change the icon by right clicking on the app and selecting "Get Info", then pasting the new icon on top of the old one, to make it look more like a folder.
