Binary Logistic Regression with the LASSO objective function

I am working on my MSc. Statistic which is on the Penalized Logistic Regression with the LASSO penalty. I am trying to understand the difference in two objective functions: argmin { $\frac{1}{n}$ $\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-{\beta_0}-\sum_{j=1}^p {\beta_j}X_ij)^2+{\lambda}||{\beta}||_1$ } argmin { $\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-{\beta_0}-\sum_{j=1}^p {\beta_j}X_ij)^2+{\lambda}||{\beta}||_1$ } as you can see in the first formula we have $\frac{1}{n}$ while in the 2nd we don't when $n$ represent the sample size. Does anyone know why is this?
