Visualizing time series regression results in a causal framework

Suppose I have a set of independent variables that I believe to, collectively, cause the observed level and changes in the value of the dependent variable, and I have the results of a regression of the latter on the former. Is there a good way of visualizing these time series multivariate regression results? Specifically, I am looking for some form of visualization that can show how the independent variables differentially affect the dependent variable over the period of my sample, i.e. something showing changes in the relative importance of the various independent variables with the passage of time.
