All you need to know about stepwise is that it's ambiguous, inefficient, and a bad approach to feature selection. You begin by defining a selection criterion (oft neglected in the discussion of stepwise), but we can safely assume that AIC is the best choice. AIC is a likelihood / complexity tradeoff that is used to evaluate competing models of vastly different applications (when standard likelihood testing would not be appropriate). Stepwise regression successively adds (forward) or subtracts (backward) model terms iteratively (huge risk for local minima compared to best subsets regression) until an apparently optimal AIC is obtained, and that is called the target model. As a note, none of these terms are specific to logistic regression. It's just that logistic regression is especially well-suited to estimating a binary classifier and its associated uncertainty.
