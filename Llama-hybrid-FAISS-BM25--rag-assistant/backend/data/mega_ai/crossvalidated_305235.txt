While Djib2011 answer is correct, I understand your question as more focused on how the image quality/properties affect neural network learning in general. There is only little research in this topic (afaik), but there might be more research on it in the future. I only found this article on it. The problem at the moment is, that this is more a problem appearing in practical applications and less in an academic research field. I remember one current podcast where researchers observed that even the camera that was used to take a picture could have a big effect.
