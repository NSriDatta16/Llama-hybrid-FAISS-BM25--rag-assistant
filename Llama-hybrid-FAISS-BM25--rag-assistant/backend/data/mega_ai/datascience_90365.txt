Questions about adding metadata to a CNN using keras

I have a convolutional neural network and would like to include some metadata. My metadata is in a multiple csv files that correspond to each class and it contains a bunch of geometric properties (about 8 numerical measurements), specifically revolving around size and volume that would help classification of similar looking images but have varying size and volume. I am currently using Keras to build my models. What I am unsure of is where and how to add metadata into my model? Do I need to combine all csv's, do I keep them separate similar to to training images file folders or something else? What happens to the metadata when the I shuffle the images? What happens to the metadata when I augment the images?
