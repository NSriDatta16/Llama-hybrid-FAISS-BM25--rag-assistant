Your question is difficult to understand due to everything being in sentence-fragments, but I think you're basically just looking for a way to be able to send SQL statements to your SQL database from Java, specifically an insert statement? If this is the case, Java has an sql package. You can create a connection to your database, create a statement, and execute it. This will then return a ResultSet which is the result of the executed statement. Start here perhaps? http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#createStatement%28%29 And there is part of an example on the documentation for ResultSet http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html What do you mean by "i want to show the insert sql in the browser"? Do you mean you want to show what the result of the executed statement is?
