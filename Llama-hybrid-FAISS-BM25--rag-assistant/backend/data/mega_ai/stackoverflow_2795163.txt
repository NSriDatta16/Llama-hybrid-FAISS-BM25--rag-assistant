Trying to get a number within an array that is twice the average

I have been assigned to set up an array with points. I am told to get the maximum value, average, and within this same array, if any point in the array is twice the average, I should cout an "outlier." So far I have gotten the average and maximum numbers in the array. but i am unable to set the programme to cout the outlier. Instead it gives me a multiple of the average. here is the programme; int main() { const int max = 10; int ary[max]={4, 32, 9, 7, 14, 12, 13, 17, 19, 18}; int i,maxv; double out,sum=0; double av; maxv= ary[0]; for(i=0; i out) { cout
