interesting question. have you thought about just not displaying the thumbnails for certain pics? or is storage a concern? another option would be to create two models - one called Pic which doesn't define any thumbnails and then one called PicWithThumbs, which extends the Pic class, and does define thumbnails. Then in your controller you could do an 'if' statement that checked the params for a value called 'create_thumbs' (boolean) - if :create_thumbs is true, then create an instance of PicWithThumb, else create a Pic I know, it smells a little, and I'm a bit of a noob, so feel free to shoot me down. I'm interested in seeing what the best solution is though...
