From the changelog for version 1.3: THIS VERSION ADDS BLOB SUPPORT WHICH BECOMES DEFAULT LEAD IMAGE STORAGE IN PLONE4. MIGRATION TO BLOB IS NOT PREPARED YET! DON'T USE THIS VERSION IF YOU ARE MIGRATING TO PLONE4. IT IS SAFE TO USE IT ON PLONE3 OR PLONE4. This basically means that you could either: try pinning the version to 1.2 and do not use blobs while waiting for someone else to address the issue or, write the migration and contribute it back. Have a look into the plone.app.blob migrations to see how it's done. I had contributed an example to do that exact thing, haven't tried it out since p4 is out so your mileage may vary: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/example.blobattype
