The scikit-learn (now sklearn ) should meet several of the criteria you described (speed, well-designed classes for handling data, models, and results), including targeted applications (L1/L2 penalized regression, SVM, etc.). It comes with a rich documentation set and a lot of examples . See also its description in a paper published in the JMLR. An alternative framework in Python is Orange , which can be used through a gentle GUI or on the command line directly. For collaborative filtering, pyrsvd might be interesting but I've never tried it. However, Apache Mahout might certainly be used for collaborative filtering .
