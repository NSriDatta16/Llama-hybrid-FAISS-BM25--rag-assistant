touchesEnded:withEvent: How to work around the delay before it fires

On iPhone OS, -touchesEnded:withEvent: fires quickly when you left a finger, unless there was a drag. If -touchesMoved:withEvent: has fired, then there is about a 0.6 second delay before you get touchesEnded:withEvent:. I verified this in a new project, no scrollView, no multi-touch. I want the user to drag an object around, and then have a method fire as soon as he lifts a finger. The 0.6 second delay is unacceptable. Any thoughts on dealing with this? Edit: The only code I have written in the test project is this: @implementation MyView // startTime is an ivar - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { startTime = [NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"%f", [NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate] - startTime); }
