Why is it bad programming to use a stateful webservice and why would it be allowed?

I have a need for a stateful webservice in our organization. However, everywhere I read online says that building a stateful webservice is bad programming but nothing ever says why. I guess I don't understand what is so bad about it. I also don't really understand why they would give a work around to allow you to have state in a webservice. So I guess that my question is, why is it bad programming to use a stateful webservice and why would it be allowed?
