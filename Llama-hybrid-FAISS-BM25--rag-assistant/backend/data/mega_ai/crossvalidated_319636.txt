If I correctly understand, each of your data samples can be viewed as a matrix of [time points $\times$ features]. What you could possibly do is the following approach for each class separately: calculate the median time-series correlation for each feature across all pairs of samples. A feature that is informative should have a high median, because different samples from the same class should display the same time series Vice versa, a feature that is uninformative should have a low median correlation Rank the features according to median correlation and reject the ones with low correlation Instead of correlation, you can of course take DTW as a distance measure as well. Alternatively, perhaps you could also do some Supervised dimensionality reduction using LDA to map the data to a lower-dimensional discriminative space.
