Is it possible to create a predictive model for a dataset that consists of only positive occurrences of the dependent variable?

Lets say I want to predict earthquakes. My dataset would only contain data about earthquake occurrences and no data about non-earthquake occurrences as that would basically be any other period of time which is not kept in the dataset. In that case, I assume a decision tree or logistic regression would not work as we don't have a dichotomous dependent variable (as the occurrence only gets into the dataset if an earthquake occurred). Are there any models which would suit this situation, or is a different approach needed?
