Is there a web site that does XSLT transformations and provides a URL as a result?

I would like to use Foursquare API XML results and transform them using XSLT to a RSS feed. I was wondering if there's any web site that has that functionality and generates a URL that returns the final transformation. Something like: From URL: http://foursquare.com/myapicall + XSLT transformation I get a new URL: http://transformer/url=http://server.com/myapiresult&xlst=XXX that returns the resulting transformation Any other ideas to achieve this are welcome! Thanks a lot
