The single best tool is probably server-side compression. You can enable this globally in Apache using mod_deflate . Just make sure mod_deflate is loaded, and stick this in the bottom of your httpd.conf file: # mod_deflate for server-wide output compression. SetOutputFilter DEFLATE # Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Don't compress images SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-gzip dont-vary # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content #Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary All static and dynamic content will then be served compressed to browsers that support it. Other modern web servers will support this as well I'm sure, you'd just have to take a look at their docs to find out how to enable it.
