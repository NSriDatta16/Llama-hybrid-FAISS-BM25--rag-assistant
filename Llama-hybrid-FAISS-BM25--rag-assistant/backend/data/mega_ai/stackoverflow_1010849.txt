SQL - Multiple rows into single column

I would like to take the data output from the query below and join all of the email addresses together separated by a semicolon grouped by the employee name. SELECT DISTINCT p.email , e.name FROM PERSON p INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.agentofrecord_id = e.employee_id WHERE dbo.GetPersonMember(p.person_id) = 1 AND (p.isactive = 1) AND p.email <> '' ORDER BY name
