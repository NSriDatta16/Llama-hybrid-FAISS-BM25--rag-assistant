A way I use to help me interpret is to create a table with the two variables I'm looking at - the dependent and the independent I'm focusing at that moment. In a regression, the other independent variables may change this relation a bit, but usually I can get a good idea regarding what's going on. Following your example, I could have a table with conditional frequencies by row like: $$ \begin{array}{c|cc} Area \backslash Smoke & Yes\ (1) & No\ (0)\\ \hline 1 & 60\% & 40\% \\ 2 & 50\% & 50\% \\ 3 & 30\% & 70\% \\ \ldots & \ldots & \ldots \\ 10 & 55\% & 45% \\ \end{array} $$ Of course that we could also use conditional frequencies by column. By looking at the table, we could say that the smokers were more likely to have an aneurysm in areas $1$ and $10$ and that the non-smokers were more likely to have an aneurysm in area $3$ . Edit: If you have a logistic regression, you could look at the odds ratio ( $OR$ ) or at the coefficients ( $B$ ) to reach a similar conclusion from the reverse path. By the way, $OR = e^B$ . For instance, if the 2nd category is the reference category for the area variable (I admit that I chose the $50\% - 50\%$ category to make my life easier), and non-smoking is the reference category for the smoker variable, we could observe that $OR_1=1.4$ for area $1$ , $OR_3=0.44$ for area $3$ , and $OR_{10}=1.1$ for area $10$ (I've made up some numbers). This would mean that the smoking individuals, when compared to the non-smokers, were more likely to have aneurysms in areas $1$ and $10$ and less likely to have aneurysms in area $3$ . By looking at the $p$ -values for each coefficient, you could also say in which cases the $OR$ is significantly different from $1$ . We compare the value of the $OR$ with $1$ because $OR_j=1$ would mean that the odds of finding a smoker in category $j$ would be the same as the odds of finding a smoker in category $2$ , i.e., being a smoker would have the same odds of having an aneurysm in area $j$ or in area $2$ .
