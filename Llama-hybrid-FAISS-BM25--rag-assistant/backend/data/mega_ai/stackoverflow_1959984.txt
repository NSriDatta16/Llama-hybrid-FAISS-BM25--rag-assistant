little late maybe... bda.ldap ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bda.ldap ) wraps again python-ldap to a more simple API than python-ldap itself provides. Further it transparently handles query caching of results due to bda.cache ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bda.cache ). Additionally it provides a LDAPNode object for building end editing LDAP trees via a dict like API. It uses some ZTK stuff as well for integration purposes to the zope framework (primary due to zodict package in LDAPNode implementation). We recently released bda.ldap 1.4.0. If you take a look at README.txt#TODO, you see whats missing from our POV to declare the lib as final. Comments are always welcome, Cheers, Robert
