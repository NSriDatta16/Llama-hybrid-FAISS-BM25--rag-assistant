XGBoost Calibration

I have an imbalanced dataset and am using XGBoost to create a predictive model. xgb = XGBClassifier(scale_pos_weight = 10, reg_alpha = 1) Although my recall and specificity are acceptable, I would like to improve the calibration curve. When I try using isotonic regression to calibrate my model, my predictive performance (recall and specificity) decrease dramatically. Any thoughts on how to maintain my metrics while improving calibration. calibrated = CalibratedClassifierCV(xgb, X_train, y_train, cv=5) calibrated.fit(X_train, y_train) scores = cross_val_score(calibrated, X_test, y_test, cv = 5, scoring ='recall') print(np.mean(scores)) #prints 0.17 xgb.fit(X_train, y_train) scores = cross_val_score(xgb, X_test, y_test, cv = 5, scoring ='recall') print(np.mean(scores)) #prints 0.74 Thanks in advance!
