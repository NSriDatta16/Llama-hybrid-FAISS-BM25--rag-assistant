Simplest Azure Storage Manipulation possible

I have the need to integrate some blob storage into an existing ASP.NET Mvc site my hope is to be able to just add some references and then just do puts and gets but I cannot find any simple example for how to do this (that hasn't been deprecated to the point it no longer works) I have tried using StorageClient but CreateCloudBlobClient() doesn't seem to work.
