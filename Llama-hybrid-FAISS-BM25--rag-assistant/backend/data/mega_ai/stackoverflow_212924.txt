The most pragmatic/action-oreinted way to think of it (IMHO) is: as an inheritance chain, or method lookup/resolution order. This picture might help http://www.klankboomklang.com/2007/11/25/modules-part-i-enter-the-include-class/ This is r 1.9, contrasting builtin and user-defined classes: i'm still digesting this one. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/sumim/20080111/p1 Also, i htink a confusing use of the term is "Singleton object", which is different concept. A singleton object comes from a class which has its constructor/instantiator method overridden so that you can allocate only one of that class.
