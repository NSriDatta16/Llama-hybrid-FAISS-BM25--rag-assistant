I can't see how JPA would be permitted, but Hibernate wouldn't. That doesn't make a lot of sense, given that Hibernate is a JPA implementation. Would another JPA implementation be OK, such as OpenJPA? You haven't mentioned if you have an existing server, or will be installing your apps on a yet-to-chosen server. Has this decision already been made? If so, that may dictate your choice. A full, up-to-date JavaEE server will come with EJB3 and JPA implementations already. If the server isn't an EJB3-enabled server, then EJB3 is much less compelling. But if sensible technologies such as Spring and Hibernate have been ruled out, there always simple frameworks like iBatis that allow you to combine POJOs with JDBC.
