So really what you are doing has nothing to do with a database. You have configuration parameters that vary depending on the situation. This data storage documentation provides an overview of different ways of storing data in Android. I'm not sure when/why exactly your config parameters change, but generally shared preferences are a good model for saving a bunch of primitive type data that needs to be accessed through the app. You also don't say how exactly you are processing the preferences files now, but you might also get performance improvements by caching the data, so you only have one long load pause.
