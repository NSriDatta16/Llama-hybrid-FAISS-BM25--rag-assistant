All single-tree methods involve a staggering number of multiple comparisons that bring great instability to the result. That is why to achieve satisfactory predictive discrimination some form of tree averaging (bagging, boosting, random forests) is necessary (except that you lose the advantage of trees - interpretability). The simplicity of single trees is largely an illusion. They are simple because they are wrong in the sense that training the tree to multiple large subsets of the data will reveal great disagreement between tree structures. I haven't looked at any recent CHAID methodology but CHAID in its original incarnation was a great exercise in overinterpretation of data.
