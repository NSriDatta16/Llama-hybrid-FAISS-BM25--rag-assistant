OLS, phenomenon { alpha = - mean(beta_2*x_orig)} : coincidence?

as suggested in the title, when with some data I perform this model: y ~ alpha + beta_1 * x_1 + beta_2 * (x_1)^2 + error term with OLS I SOMETIMES fall into the situation in which alpha ~~ - mean(beta_2 * (x_1)^2) this means that, on average, my model is equivalent to: E(y) ~ E(beta_1 * x_1) this, to me, is huge.(Edit based on asagen comment) in order to better understand what I am implying at, please look at the attached graph now, statistically I can't think of anything of relevance but, the economic implication of such phenomenon in my study is game changing stuff. thus I am wondering whether I am doing something seriously wrong (any number of input is appreciated) and there is some property in the data for which this stuff happens. from an economical point of view, I am very suspicious of such result thus I am seeking to add some statistical soundness in order to make order.
