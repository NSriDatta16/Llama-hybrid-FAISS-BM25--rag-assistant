After some further digging, I was able to figure this out. You need to set the transformX and transformY to the stage coordinates (NOT the local ones) from the MouseEvent . protected function imgLogo_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { scaleImg.transformX = event.stageX; scaleImg.transformY = event.stageY; transformer.play(); } And modify the declaration for the Scale like so
