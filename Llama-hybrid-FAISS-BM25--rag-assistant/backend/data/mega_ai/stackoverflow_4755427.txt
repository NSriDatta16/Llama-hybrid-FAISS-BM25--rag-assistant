Wrapping linq-to-sql function signatures

I have a stored function, such: CREATE FUNCTION RegionContains ( @RegionX float, @RegionY float, @RegionRadius float, @ObjectX float, @ObjectY float ) RETURNS bit AS BEGIN DECLARE @IsContained bit DECLARE @ObjectRadius real SELECT @ObjectRadius = SQRT(POWER(@ObjectX - @RegionX, 2) + POWER(@ObjectY - @RegionY, 2)) IF @ObjectRadius It takes 5 float parameters -- but the thing is, I have objects in my C# project which represent these values. So I open up visual studio and drag the stored function into the DBML designer, and I get a magical function signature which has all of these double parameters. Is there a way to create a wrapper for this that won't break when I update the DBML? I want to create a function which takes two typed arguments, that extracts the relevant values from those objects and then sends them to the stored procedure -- while still being allowed to call that wrapper function from a linq query. Does VS support this?
