ML algorithm for Music Features

I am a newbie in machine learning topic and I need to create model from music data. It contains features of the songs but it is not labeled. How can I create a model from that ? Do I need to use unsupervised learning algorithms ? Which one is better or is it better if I use deep learning methods. Data is looking like this: danceability loudness valence energy instrumentalness acousticness 136 0.795 -8.334 0.578 0.409 0.000000 0.684000 442 0.502 -4.556 0.720 0.912 0.000173 0.000025 92 0.713 -14.590 0.560 0.258 0.006060 0.877000 67 0.505 -14.951 0.723 0.782 0.930000 0.921000 127 0.470 -6.740 0.490 0.809 0.006710 0.272000
