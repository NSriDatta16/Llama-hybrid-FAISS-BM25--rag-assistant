Save jquery json data in database

I have a big problem, I need to save an AJAXed ordered list as a menu, I found a script here: http://www.prodevtips.com/2010/03/07/jquery-drag-and-drop-to-sort-tree/ it works great, except that I need to save it to my database and the author says you can do it with JSON. Here is the part he says can process and save the data. $("#save").click(function(){ /* var tree = $.toJSON(parseTree($("#tag_tree"))); $.post("@saveTags", {tags: tree}, function(res){ $("#printOut").html(res); }); */ $.debug.print_r(parseTree($("#tag_tree")), "printOut", false); }); the debug outputs an array like : '0' => "Economics" '1' => "Blogging" '2' => "General Dev" '3' => "Japan" '4' ... '0' => "Productivity" '1' ... '0' ... '0' => "Humanities" '3' => "CMS" What I need is to be able to save the id, parent id and the order. It seems that i'm not able to save them into the database. I know i need a php file to save the data to the database but i don't know how to pass the data to that php file. This is with what i need help, how can i pass the data to a php file in this case? Thanks, Dan
