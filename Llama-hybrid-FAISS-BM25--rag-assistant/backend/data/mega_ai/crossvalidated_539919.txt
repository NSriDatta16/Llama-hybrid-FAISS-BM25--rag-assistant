Can we change the algorithms used for computing trends when decomposing time series?

Classical decomposition consists of the following steps for additive or multiplicative decomposition: Compute trend via a moving average (MA) De-trend the series to get seasonal variation (either by subtraction or division if additive or multiplicative respectively) De-seasonalize the series similarly to get the residuals. Technically, does it really matter if the in the first step we change the algorithm to a weighted MA or a triangular/Gaussian MA or even simple exponential smoothing? The STL/LOWESS decomposition has a different way of computing the trend by local clustering/weighting/regressing. We could then proceed to further decompose in additively or multiplicatively, right? (I currently lack the insight into the decomposition steps of LOESS and am only extrapolating.) Thus, in theory, we should be able to switch the algorithm for computing the trend and then continue on with either an additive or multiplicative decomposition IMHO (or a mix of both?). Is this commonly practiced? Is there a reason why we can't mix and match the decomposition steps by choosing the most relevant ones that best address the situation? For my purpose, the decomposition graphs are a useful tool for monitoring purposes only and was curious if there were any rules being broken if I did something like that?
