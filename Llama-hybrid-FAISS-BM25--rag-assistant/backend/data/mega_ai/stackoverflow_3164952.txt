I'd imagine you would get it from the android git repository? Web interface: https://android.googlesource.com/ SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Details on how to access it: https://source.android.com/source/downloading Note, the repository contains the current version so the above is likely uninteresting to you. I found this though: Andriod 1.5 (cupcake): http://androidforums.com/android-developers/1045-source-code-android-jar.html Via: http://java.dzone.com/articles/android-zip-download-cupcake
