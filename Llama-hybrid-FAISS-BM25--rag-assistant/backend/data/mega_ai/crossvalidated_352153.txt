Do major statistics/machine learning journals accept article submission without data access?

I work for a health insurance company and am planning on conducting a predictive modeling analysis on our claims data. I'm thinking about publishing any interesting findings. However, since the data contains personal health information from our patients, it's unlikely the data could be made available to reviewers or interested readers. Will this make my article submission a non-starter for journals?
