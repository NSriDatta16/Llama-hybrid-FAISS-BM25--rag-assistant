Viewing source will always show the source, as fetched from the webserver. If you want to view a serialization of the current state of the DOM, then you will need a DOM Inspector. Firebug has a good one (for Firefox), Opera has Dragonfly , and other browsers tend to have them built in. That said, you should probably be using getScript anyway. Will I also need to remove the current JS file with this function and then load the next one? So long as you override every function, there shouldn't be any issues but watch out for race conditions and event handlers holding copies of previous versions of the functions.
