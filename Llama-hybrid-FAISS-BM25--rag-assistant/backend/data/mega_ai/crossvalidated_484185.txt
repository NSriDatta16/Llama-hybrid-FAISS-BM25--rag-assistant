Is there an algorithm for placing 2-dimensional embeddings into a grid so they can be displayed?

I’m using PCA to reduce images down to 2d embeddings and I’d like to display the images in a grid. The Pudding did something like this with book covers , using tsne and a library called RasterFairy, by Quasimondo , but I was hoping to find an algorithm, rather than just relying on a black-box library. Here's an example how this might work: I have 1,000 images with the dimensions 224 x 224 x 3 I then flatten those images so my dataset is 1,000 x 150,528 then I use PCA to reduce each image's dimensions from 150,528 to 2 then I'd use this algorithm to sort these 1,000 data points into a 100 x 100 grid. Here's a gif from RasterFairy's github repo that will hopefully help demonstrate what I mean:
