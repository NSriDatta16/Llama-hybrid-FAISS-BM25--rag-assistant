One option is this -- every time a bug comes up, write a test to help you find the bug and solve the problem. Make it such that the test will pass when the bug is fixed. Then, once the bug is resolved you have a tool that'll help you detect future changes that might impact the chunk of code you just fixed. Over time your test coverage will improve, and you can run your ever-growing test suite any time you make a potentially far-reaching change.
