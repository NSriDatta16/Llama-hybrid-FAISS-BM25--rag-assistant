How to identify variables with significant loadings in PCA?

I have following example of principal component analysis using first 4 variables of iris data set (code in R): > res = prcomp(iris[1:4]) > res Standard deviations: [1] 2.0562689 0.4926162 0.2796596 0.1543862 Rotation: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 Sepal.Length 0.36138659 -0.65658877 0.58202985 0.3154872 Sepal.Width -0.08452251 -0.73016143 -0.59791083 -0.3197231 Petal.Length 0.85667061 0.17337266 -0.07623608 -0.4798390 Petal.Width 0.35828920 0.07548102 -0.54583143 0.7536574 It appears that Sepal.Width has a very small contribution to PC1. How do I know if it is a significant contribution? Is there any significance test for this? Similarly, I want to determine significance for all values in above matrix. Also, is there any package in R that does it?
