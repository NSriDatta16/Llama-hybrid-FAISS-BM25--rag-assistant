How to deal with big strings and limited memory

I have a file from which I read data. All the text from this file is stored in a String variable (a very big variable). Then in another part of my app I want to walk through this string and extract useful information, step-by-step (parsing the string). In the meanwhile my memory gets full and an OutOfMemory exception keeps me from further processing. I think it would be better to process the data directly while reading the inputstream from the file. But for organizational aims, I would like to pass the String to another part in my application. What should I do to keep the memory from overflowing?
