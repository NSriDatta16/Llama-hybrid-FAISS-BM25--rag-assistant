A page flipper control - like the android home screens

Anyone know of a library or method I can use to emulate the way the Android homescreens work? What I mean is this: A control that will take any number of sub-Views. It will only show one of those Views at a time, however, when the user drags their finger over the screen, it'll switch to the next or previous view, depending on which way the user dragged their finger. I've seen a few examples (SwipeGestureListener comes to mind), but they don't work in the way I'd like. They require a swipe gesture, which means the widget doesn't move unless there is an actual swipe. For this reason, it's not readily obvious that the pages are switchable using this method. Any information would be great.
