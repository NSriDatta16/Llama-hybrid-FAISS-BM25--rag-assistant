Bayesian Information Criterion -- what is the base of the logarithm?

Apologies in advance for a very basic question! On Wikipedia , I see that the Bayesian Information Criterion evaluates a model using $$ BIC = k\ln(n)- 2\ln(L) $$ where $k$ is the number of parameters, $n$ the sample size and $L$ the (maximised) likelihood. In the original paper , however, I see instead the expression $$ BIC = k\log(n)- 2\log(L) $$ Can I check that 'log' here means 'ln' (i.e. base $e$ not say base $10$ )? Or does it somehow not matter?
