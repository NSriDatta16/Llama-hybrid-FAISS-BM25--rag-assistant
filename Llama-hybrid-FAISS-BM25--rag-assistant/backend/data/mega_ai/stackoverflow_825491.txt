I use the RadioInfo class to check if there is a connection and if the radio is turned on before trying to make a connection. Then you can just display a message to the user or turn the radio on (if it's off) before trying to connect, makes for a much better user experience. Try using: if (RadioInfo.getState() == RadioInfo.STATE_OFF) OR if (RadioInfo.getSignalLevel() == RadioInfo.LEVEL_NO_COVERAGE) To check connection status before connecting.
