Can't give you specifics since I haven't used hibernate. but the general truth that applies to almost everything like this is: "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler." -- Albert Einstein So my opinion would be to use the minimal connections possible to keep the system well defined. And avoid trying to connect everything because it'll bite you in the back (remember the principle of loose coupling in programming)
