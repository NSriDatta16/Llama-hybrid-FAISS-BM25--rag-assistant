This is a tentative answer. One can try to determine first the relative importance of each feature (eg by Factor Analysis or Principal Component Analysis , ..) Once the more significant features have been identified (or guessed perhaps), then one can try combinations of scores with these features. Take simply the average as a composite score. Do a linear regression and use the coefficients as the weights of the composite score.
