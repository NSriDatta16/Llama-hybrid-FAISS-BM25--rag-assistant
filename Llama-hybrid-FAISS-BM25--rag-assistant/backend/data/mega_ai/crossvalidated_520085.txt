What is the best way to forecast a univariate monthly time series with a forecast horizon of 5 years?

I have a monthly time series dataset starting from 2014 January until past month (2021 March as of today). I need to forecast monthly values for it with a 5 year forecast horizon so basically forecasting 60 data points into the future. Please note that my data is univariate, with columns DATE and VALUE . I need to perform this forecasting exercise for 2 datasets wherein one is a stationary time series and other one is non-stationary time series. Historical date range: 2014 January to 2021 March Forecast required: 2021 April to 2026 March Since I don't have too many historical data points, such forecasting might seem unreasonable. But I would like to seek suggestions from our community to know what approach / model might be my best shot at getting this done.
