There are a ton of ways to do this, and much of machine learning focuses on such a probability prediction. The easiest way to do this would be to fit a logistic regression to your data with height as the predictor of gender. Then you input the new height and get a probability of being male vs female. Depending on how gross your distributions are, you may want to use a more complex model. For instance, if your male and feline heights have the same mean but different variances (let’s assume normality), then you might want to include a quadratic term in your logistic regression. If the distributions are all kinds of funky, you may have no idea what the function should be, so you might want to let a neural network run wild and find some nonlinear features (which is more or less what’s going on behind the scenes of neural nets).
