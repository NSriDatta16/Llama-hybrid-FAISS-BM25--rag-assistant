suggested database schema for photos website

i am trying to organize my photos and create some ajax front end. I have lots of photos and an existing hosting site that is paid for that has lots of disk space so i dont want to pay to store on picasa web or alternative. I am creating an asp.net site to view these photos but i an trying to determine best schema to store then. A have a few fundamental questions: Photos Albums Tags (maybe) A few questions: 1. do i have a seperate table for each album or all photos in one Photos. the seperate tables would be identical so i trying to determine if there is any benefit to this seperation 2. is there any major benefit of using SQL server versus MYsql (these are my choices in this case) for this schema. I dont think i am doing anything to fancy.
