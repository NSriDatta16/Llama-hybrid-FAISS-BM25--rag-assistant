It looks to me like all your show/hide links are calling the same function ( show_details() etc), which shows/hides all posts (because of the loop), not specific ones. Rather than defining a function for each one a more elegant way to solve this would be something like this: ', {duration:0.3});" %> That's of course not unobtrusive, but it's a start. EDIT I just noticed your links that you want to showhide for each div as well. Well, you could throw that right after the Blind effect: ', {duration:0.3});$('hide_details_link_ ').style.display = 'inline';" %> etc. Or you could make a javascript loop in the document onload function which finds all the divs and binds a function to each of them, but that's getting more complex than I want to demonstrate, especially as you don't appear to be using Prototype (although you are using Scriptaculous? That should give you access to .show()/.hide() helpers...) Also, why use the divs? You can but ids right on the links (see the options on link_to_function)
