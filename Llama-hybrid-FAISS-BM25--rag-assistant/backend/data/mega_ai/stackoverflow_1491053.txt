The problem is because of memory space. You see, .NET stores its memory inside the CLR. This means , you cannot drag drop anything from .NET into another application running in a different memory space using the .NET dragdrop. You have to use an interprocess drag-drop. WINOLEAPI DoDragDrop( IDataObject * pDataObject, //Pointer to the data object IDropSource * pDropSource, //Pointer to the source DWORD dwOKEffect, //Effects allowed by the source DWORD * pdwEffect //Pointer to effects on the source ); If you wrap the object you want to drag drop within your own implementation of IDataObject, you can drag drop into any application. I would post an example, but i cant find one in my source which is "clean" enough to post as an example. Google around. Look for drag-drop implementations using C++ COM. Use that instead of the .NET built in drag drop.
