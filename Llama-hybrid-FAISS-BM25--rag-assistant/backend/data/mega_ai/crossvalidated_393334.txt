Mixed logit random parameters for individual specific variables

It is my understanding that in a mixed logit model there can be two types of variables, alternative specific and individual specific. For example, in a dataset for choices of fishing modes like this (long format): id altern price catch income choice 1 beach 157.93 0.0678 7083 0 1 boat 157.93 0.2601 7083 0 1 charter 182.93 0.5391 7083 1 1 pier 157.93 0.0503 7083 0 2 beach 15.114 0.1049 1250 0 2 boat 10.534 0.1574 1250 0 2 charter 34.532 0.4671 1250 1 2 pier 15.112 0.0451 1250 0 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlogit/mlogit.pdf the variables price and catch are alternative specific (they vary across alternatives) and the variable income is individual specific (do not vary across alternatives). Most of the examples of mixed logit that I have seen use random parameters only for alternative specific variables ( R example , Stata example ). Is it possible or does it make sense to use random parameters for individual specific variables? For example could I use a random parameter in a variable such as "income" in the example above? Based on the very helpful comment of @RobertLong below, it is clear that since there is no variation in income at the subject level, the random effects will not be identified and there will be either convergence problems or singular fit. However, for income we will have 3 coefficients: boat:income , charter:income and pier:income (assuming beach as base alternative). In the following R code, I show how it is possible to estimate a random parameter for boat:income for example. However, I am not sure if this random parameter can be interpreted as the heterogeneous effect of people's income on the choice of boat. Or in other words, is such random parameter meaningful at all? library(mlogit) data("Fishing", package = "mlogit") Fish Output: Call: mlogit(formula = mode ~ price + catch | income, data = Fish, rpar = c(price = "n", catch = "n", `boat:income` = "n")) Frequencies of alternatives: beach boat charter pier 0.11337 0.35364 0.38240 0.15059 bfgs method 7 iterations, 0h:0m:18s g'(-H)^-1g = 5.67E+04 last step couldn't find higher value Coefficients : Estimate Std.
