Implementing own Session Management in PHP

What options are there to implement an own session management in PHP? Is there a nice way to implement a component which performs all session tasks? How can i construct a class which receives the HTTP Request and Response during one request process? I only found the option "session_save_handler" which seems to define the storage handler. What I need is to replace the whole session management. Is there another way using the PHP configuration or do I have to implement my own controller which receives all requests and calls my session management? Thanks for your help Regards Michael
