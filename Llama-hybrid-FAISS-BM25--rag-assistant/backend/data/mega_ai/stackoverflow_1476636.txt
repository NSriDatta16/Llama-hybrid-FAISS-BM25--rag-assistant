to store this unstructured data As you said, MongoDB is best suitable to store unstructured data. And this can organize your data into document format. These RDBMS altenatives called NoSQL data stores ( MongoDB , CouchDB , Voldemort ) are very useful for applications that scales massively and require faster data access from these big data stores. And the implementation of these databases are simpler than the regular RDBMS. Since these are simple key-valued or document style binary objects directly serialized into disk. These data stores don't enforce the ACID properties , and any schemas . This doesn't provide any transaction abilities. So this can scale big and we can achieve faster access (both read and write). But in contrast, RDBM enforces ACID and schemas on datas. If you wanted to work with structured data you can go ahead with RDBM. I would choose MySQL for creating forums for this kind of stuff. Because this is not going to scale big. And this is a very simple (common) application which has structured relations among the data.
