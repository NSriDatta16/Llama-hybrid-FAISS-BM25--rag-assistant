Training on classes in sequence

What is the effect of training my data, lets say with 5 classes (a,b,c,d,e), we train in mini-batches and we train the model on all the data for class 'a' then 'b' and so on. I'd like to know the general effect of this when using DNN's, ACAM's and RNN's? I expect an answer will be "it's not worth the risk when randomizing data is so easy"... so let's say that (hypothetically) due to time considerations I'm likely to receive the data for each class, day's apart and training on each class takes a day and the sooner this thing is done the better.
