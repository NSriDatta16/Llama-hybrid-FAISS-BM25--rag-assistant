This isn't possible in the general case because there's no guarantee that an element in a list (or even a series of elements shorter than half the length of the total result) will be unique. If we put the constraint that any text fragment will only appear once, we can simply search the original list for the text and see where it occurs (though this will be inefficient). In general, the best solution would be to attach a reference to the original fragment to the stripped-down version. If you're doing the transformation with Javascript, this is very simple â€” just have the transformation function wrap each result sentence in a span and set thisSpan.original = 3 or whatever.
