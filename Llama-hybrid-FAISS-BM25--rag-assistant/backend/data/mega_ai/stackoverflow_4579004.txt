Given a word, how do I get the list of all words, that differ by one letter?

Let's say I have the word "CAT". These words differ from "CAT" by one letter (not the full list) CUT CAP PAT FAT COT etc. Is there an elegant way to generate this? Obviously, one way to do it is through brute force. pseduo code: while (0 to length of word) while (A to Z) replace one letter at a time, and check if the resulting word is a valid word If I had a 10 letter word, the loop would run 26 * 10 = 260 times. Is there a better, elegant way to do this?
