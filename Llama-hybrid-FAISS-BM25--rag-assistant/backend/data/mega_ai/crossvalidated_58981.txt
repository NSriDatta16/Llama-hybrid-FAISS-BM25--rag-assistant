Welcome to CrossValidated, Marco! If I understood you correctly, you are using Least Squares Estimator (LSE) for your regression problem. In order to operate effectively, LSE indeed requires normally distributed residuals. A good way to check this is to have a look at so-called Q-Q plot : you draw the quantiles of your obtained residuals versus theoretical normal quantiles. If you see something as a line in the Q-Q plot - you are done - the assumption of normality is fulfilled. But I want to encourage you to be careful, you also have to check other assumptions required for LSE: independence of the residuals and homoscedasticity . Hope it will help!
