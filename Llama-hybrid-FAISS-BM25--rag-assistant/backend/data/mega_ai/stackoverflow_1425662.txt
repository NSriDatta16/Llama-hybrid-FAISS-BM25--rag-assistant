Remove signing of dll in Visual Studio with script

We have a C# solution with ca. 55 projects, including test projects. Since part of the project is sharepoint all dll's are signed. We would like to run unit tests with code coverage. We then get the problem the code coverage cannot instrument signed dll's. We therefore need to unsign the dll's, run the tests, and then resign them. With the large number of project files this is cumbersome. Question is: Is it possible to automate this in any way? (To resign I can just do an undo checkout)
