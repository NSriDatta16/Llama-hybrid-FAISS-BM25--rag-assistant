A lot of this depends on what question(s) you are trying to answer. The 3rd model with the quasibinomial family, I don't know what question it really answers. Smarter people than me have spent more time than me trying to figure that out and have not worked it out yet (yes it gives an answer, but what does it mean?) so I tend to avoid the quasi families. Model 2 is the logistic regression, it simplifies the data by just looking at if the value if greater than or less than 10000, in the process it throws out much of the detail and so may not give as much information. It will treat a diamond with price 9999 exactly the same as one with price 1, but differently from one that is 10001 (even though that is only a difference of 2), but it will not be affected by nonlinearity in the carat/price relationship that could affect the linear model. Which is really more important to you? The final model with the poisson family is appropriate when the values of price are discrete (you can have a price of 1 or 2, but not 1.5 or other values between) and non-negative, which is probably the case here. But for a Poisson with a large mean the distribution can be well approximated by a normal distribution, so you probably will not see a lot of difference between the linear model and the Poisson model unless the variability is much different. The Poisson model (with default options) does posit a relationship between the mean and the variance and a certain form of non-linearity, so it could gain you there. What is most important are the assumptions you are willing to make based on the science behind the data (not the data itself) and what questions your are trying to answer.
