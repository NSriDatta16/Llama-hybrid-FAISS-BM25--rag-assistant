Detect mobile browser (not just iPhone) in python view

I have a web application written in Django that has one specific page I'd like to implement a mobile version of the template (and slightly different logic) for. I'd like to be able to implement it ala this sudo code: def(myView) do some stuff if user-is-on-a-mobile-device: do some stuff return (my mobile template) else: do some stuff return (my normal template) I don't have a huge amount of time and I'm pretty early on in my coding learning curve :) - I found what looks to be a very powerful pluggable app called bloom for getting mobile device capablities - http://code.google.com/p/django-bloom/wiki/BloomDevice However it seems to make a request via JSON to get lots of device specs I don't need, which seems a bit inefficient to me. Does anyone have a suggest simpler method? My detection doesn't need to be 100%, just iPhone, iPod, android, and mainstream devices... Does the http_user_agent string have some kind of mobile flag I can check for?
