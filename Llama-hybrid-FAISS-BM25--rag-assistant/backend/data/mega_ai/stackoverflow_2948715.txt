If you want to get information of the customer in your winform application there is actually two ways of doing that, by going to the SQL server database directly and query filtered views, or by going through webservices. If you want to open a customer record, simply get the GUID the same way, and open the page /OrganizationName/sfa/accts/edit.aspx?id=The Guid of the Account for Account, and /OrganizationName/sfa/conts/edit.aspx?id=The Guid of the Contact for Contacts. For more information on querying filtered views, check out Filtered View Sample Code and for webservices to use webservices CrmService Sample Code to query a record check Use Condition Operators in a Query
