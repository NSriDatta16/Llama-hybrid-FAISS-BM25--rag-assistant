Not sure if this is something you would consider a best practice or convention but I would start with a map of your web site. What kinds of pages are you going to put up there, how will you organize them and how will you construct the navigation. I always start with questions like "What do I want this web site to do?" and "Who is going to be looking at this site?" and go from there. Also consider how important this site is. Do you plan to focus on it until completion or is it something you are doing just for fun or when time allows? If the latter consider starting small. All to often I see people start personal web sites and never complete it (including me). The worse is when I see people put up a page or two and then have 10 pages of "coming soon".
