One way to figure out what an existing activity does is to use hierarchyviewer and examine the activity's contents. Another way to figure out what a native Android activity does is to look at the source code . In this case , it would appear that the buttons are inside of a horizontal LinearLayout with style="@android:style/ButtonBar" to give the silver sheen. That style , in turn, uses @android:drawable/bottom_bar as its background. That image can be found in your SDK installation -- go to the platform directory of your choice, then data/res/drawable-hdpi and data/res/drawable-mdpi for the two versions.
