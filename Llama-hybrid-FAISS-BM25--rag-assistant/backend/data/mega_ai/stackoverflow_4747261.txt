The pause is for the underlying MediaPlayer to refresh its buffers. How long that will take will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside your control (e.g., speed of CPU, speed of on-board flash storage). One you can control is to get your video out of the resource and into the filesystem. Resources are stored in the APK, which is a ZIP file, so extracting the video this way probably takes extra time. You may need to switch away from VideoView and use a SurfaceView with two MediaPlayers , alternating between them -- one is playing while the next is preparing, so when the playing one ends you can switch to the new player. I have not tried this, and so I do not know what the ramifications might be. However, I know that this technique is frequently used for audio playback to transition from one clip to another.
