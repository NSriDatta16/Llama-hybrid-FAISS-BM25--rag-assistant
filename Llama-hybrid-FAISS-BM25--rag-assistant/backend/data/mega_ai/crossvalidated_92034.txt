Understanding and Implementing a Dirichlet Process model

I am trying to implement and learn a Dirichlet Process to cluster my data (or as machine learning people speak, estimate the density). I read a lot of paper in the topic and sort of got the idea. But I am still confused; here are a series of question, 1) What is the different between Chinese Restaurant Model and DP ? 2) What is the different between Infinite Mixture Models and DP ? To fully understand everything, I have implemented Chinese Restaurant Model, Polya Urn model and Stick-breaking; But it seems, implementing DP from scratch is a hard thing to do ! I can read and write python, R, Matlab. 1) Is there any code you recommend to read and improve to fully understand/work/develop DP ? 2) Based on my research, codes, for Dirichlet Process were not easy to read ! really long, lengthy (probably since the efficiency were more important that clarity). 3) However, there is more code on Infinite Mixture Model than Dirichlet Process. If these two methods are not far from each other can I use IMM ?! Basically, I want to build up my new model, and I don't want to re-invent a wheel. I appreciate your comments UPDATE since a lot of people have recommended Edwin Chen's tutorial on "Infinite Mixture Model with Non-parametric Bayes and the DP" ; This tutorial has a misleading title; It only covers various representation of DP, specificity, CPR, stick-breaking, Polya-Urn Model; and at the end he is using a Mixture Model from scikit and make a couple of histogram on each cluster;
