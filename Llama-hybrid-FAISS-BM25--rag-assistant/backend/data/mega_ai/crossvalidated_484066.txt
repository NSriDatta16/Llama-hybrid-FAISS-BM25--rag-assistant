A PCA is reducing the dimensions of your data. If you reduce your data to 2 or 3 dimensions, that allows you to represent graphically your dataset - the principal componets are your new variables, instead of your original ones. For example, imagine you had a dataset with three variables A, B and C: if you scaled your dataset (between -1 and 1, for example) and represented that data graphically with your three variables A, B and C in the three axis, you would be able to identify which observations were not similar to the other observations according to those variables - outliers. PCA works in the same way: the dimensions are reduced, your data is scaled, and your new variables are the Principal Components, which allows you to identify observations that are unlike the rest according to those principal components (the outliers).
