The prescribed way of doing localization for WPF, is to create localized BAML in satellite assemblies; this is achieved by adding the x:Uid attached property to elements you wished to be localized. There is a nice WPF Globalization and Localizatio n section on MSDN describing the techniques. Another approach I would suggest would be to create a static 'Localization Dictionary' type, and to implement ICustomTypeDescriptor , to redirect incoming property binds to strings in your dictionary. You could end up doing something like this: And you could continue to leverage existing technologies such as RESX + Satellite assemblies.
