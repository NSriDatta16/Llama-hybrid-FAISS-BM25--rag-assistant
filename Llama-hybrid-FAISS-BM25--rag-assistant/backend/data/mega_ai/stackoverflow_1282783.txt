I think this excerpt gives the answer: Modifying the mouse pointer to indicate how a control will respond if the data is dropped onto it involves two steps: determining what type of data is in the DataObject object using the GetFormat method, and then setting the effect argument of the OLEDragOver event to inform the source what drop effects are allowed for this control. The OLEDragOver Event When a target control’s OLEDropMode property is set to Manual, the OLEDragOver event is triggered whenever dragged data passes over the control. The effect argument of the OLEDragOver event is used to specify what action would be taken if the object were dropped. When this value is set, the source’s OLEGiveFeedback event is triggered. The OLEGiveFeedback event contains its own effect argument, which is used to provide visual feedback to the user on what action will be taken when the selection is dragged — i.e., the mouse pointer is changed to indicate a copy, move, or "no drop" action. alt text http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/3531/dragseqdrag.gif
