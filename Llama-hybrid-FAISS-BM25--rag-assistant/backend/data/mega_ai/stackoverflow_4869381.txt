I have fixed this by initializing the modal dialog inside the success function of the ajax call ('#editInfo').live("click", function () { $('#dialog').dialog('open') $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: '../info/edit', data: {}, success: function (response) { $('#dialog').html(response); $('#dialog').dialog({ autoOpen: true, modal: true, draggable: false, resizable: false, height: 450, width: 550, }); } }); return false; }); This allows the dialog to close when the submit callback fires which solves the problem I posed in my question. However, I am having issues with the form being submit multiple times in conjunction with the modal being opened multiple times....I.E. the form is submitted once for each time the dialog has been opened/loaded. This happens in spite of me explicity destroying the dialog within the form callback. I may need to open a new question for this issue unless someone has a quick fix... form submit callback... function infoUpdate(response) { $('#dialog').dialog('destroy'); $('#info').html(response); }
