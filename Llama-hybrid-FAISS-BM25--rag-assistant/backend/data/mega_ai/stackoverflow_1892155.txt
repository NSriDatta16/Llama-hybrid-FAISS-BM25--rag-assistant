Take a look at Ragel . And at Mongrel for a real-world use. Though I found the mail parsing example that is enclosed with ragel to be a fun small one to experiment with, too. Though, depending on your protocol, just a check on the first byte might get you down to a single subsequent memcmp() just to verify that your verb is indeed the correct one. 'C', 'L', 'G' are all different values.
