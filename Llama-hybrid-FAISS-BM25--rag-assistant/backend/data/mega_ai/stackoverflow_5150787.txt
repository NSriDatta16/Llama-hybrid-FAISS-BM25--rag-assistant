Cassandra use PHP SimpleCassie get all keys

Is it possible to get all keys in a column family using SimpleCassie? I looked at SimpleCassie's google code, but do not figure out. Another issue is that I used following code to access column value. $price = $cassie->keyspace('ToyStore')->cf('Toys')->key('Transformer')->column('Price')->get(); echo $price; It always complains "object of cassandra columnorsupercolumn cannot be converted to string". Is it possible to print out the column value?
