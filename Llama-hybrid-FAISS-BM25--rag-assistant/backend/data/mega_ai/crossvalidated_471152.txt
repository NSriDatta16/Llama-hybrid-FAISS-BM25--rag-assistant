Research area about - Forecasting time series with added items

I'm wondering is there any time series research area about the change of forecasting with added items. For example, in the prototype below, when we check each recommended item, the forecast about sales will be updated. I know how to do time series forecasting. But for forecasting with added items, I'm looking for more advanced research methods. Do you know which research direction I can go?
