Instead of calling a private method, you can send a message: myobject.send(:method_name, args) This should avoid any problems accessing the private method. Perhaps more elegantly, if you're using rSpec you can do this: before(:each) do MyClass.send(:public, *MyClass.protected_instance_methods) end and then in your tests you can call the method normally.
