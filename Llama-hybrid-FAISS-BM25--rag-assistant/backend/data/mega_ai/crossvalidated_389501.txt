Find Conditional probability distribution given conditions - Bayes Network

I'm taking a course on bayesian statistics and I'm having trouble with one assigment, it goes like this: Construct an example in which two variables have a common effect, and the presence of one of the variables makes the other more likely. More precisely, consider a v-structure X → Z ← Y over three binary-valued variables. Construct a CPD P(Z|X, Y ) such that: • X and Y both in crease the probability of the effect, that is P(Z = T|X = T) > P(Z = T) and P(Z = T|Y = T) > P(Z = T). • each of X and Y increases the probability of the other one, that is P(X = T|Z = T) For what I understand, if I draw this V-structure the like it says, X and Y are independent and therefore if I apply Bayes rule on the first condition: P(Z = T|X = T) = P(X = T|Z = T)P(Z = T)/P(X=T) > P(Z = T) and if I cancel terms: P(X = T|Z = T) > P( X = T ) but the v-structure of the graph tells me that X is independent of Z... And the other condition also bothers me, as it states that for example P( X = T ) but again the graph states independence between X and Y ( or I'm wrong? ) And introducing this dependence with and edge between X and Y will induce a loop in the graph. I tried to think with the variables being X = Burglary , Y = Have a broken window, and Z = Alarm. In the sense that having a broken window increase the change of a burglary, and having a burglary increase the chance of having a broken window ( second condition ) and any of those events increase the change of the alarm being triggered. Well, any help in sorting this out ( finding the CPD given the conditions) is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance
