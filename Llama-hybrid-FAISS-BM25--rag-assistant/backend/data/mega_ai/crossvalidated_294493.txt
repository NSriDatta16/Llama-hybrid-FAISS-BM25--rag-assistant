Comparing estimated and true values

I am beginner with statistics, so I guess my problem is not difficult. I want to test a java program for estimation of age from surface of pelvic bone (it is based on regression). So now I have estimated age and true age (which I know) and I dont know what should I do next. I was able to compute only the average age distance. Thank you for any ideas! A.
