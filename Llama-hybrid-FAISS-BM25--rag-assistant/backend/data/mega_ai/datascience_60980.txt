It seem that the textbook "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective" uses input and output in a opposite way, is it?

Chapter 1 of "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective" by Kevin Patrick Murphy says We now consider unsupervised learning, where we are just given output data, without any inputs. The goal is to discover “interesting structure” in the data; this is sometimes called knowledge discovery. post this post Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. I saw this kind of explanation more times than the one in that book. It seems that the book uses the terms in a opposite way, where the dataset is viewed as the output of some input, is my understanding right?
