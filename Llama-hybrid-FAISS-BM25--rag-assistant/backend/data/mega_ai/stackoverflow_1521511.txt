For me, knowing the exact algorithms has been... nice as background knowledge. However, the thing that's been the most useful is the more general background of having to pay attention to how different pieces of an algorithm interact. For instance, there can be places in code where moving one piece of code (ie, outside a loop) can make a huge difference in both time and space. Its less of the specific knowledge the course taught and, rather, more that it acted like several years of experience. The course took something that might take years to encounter (have drilled into you) all the variations of in pure "real world experience" and condensed it.
