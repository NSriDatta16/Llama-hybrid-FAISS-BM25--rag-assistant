Is there Widow Orphan protection using Prawn for Ruby on Rails?

I have a question about using Prawn for Ruby on Rails. I'm using a bounding_box for variable length content. When the content overflows to the next page I would like to have some sort of widow/orphan protection in place. Is there a recommended solution for this? Is there a way to break the content from the previous page at the last paragraph break, then carry that paragraph to the next page? Or perhaps take the last x lines from the previous page so that there are at least x+1 number of lines in the new page? Thoughts? Suggestions?
