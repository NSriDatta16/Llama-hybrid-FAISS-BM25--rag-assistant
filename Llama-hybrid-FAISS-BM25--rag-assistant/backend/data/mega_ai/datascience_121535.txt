Time Series STL decomposition

I am novice in time series analysis. I used statsmodels STL to decompose my time series into trend, seasonality and residuals. The problem is that the trend seems to be noisy. I want the trend to be linear because I believe the nature of the time series I am having will have a small linear growth. Instead i get a very jigsaw trend. Are there any python packages where i can specify how the trend is supposed to be?
