The reason that Lisp is associated with AI is that when AI when really new, there weren't as many people doing it, and the other languages of the day were not appropriate. Now there's a lot more variety in the AI field, and most languages have at least caught up to 70's-style LISP. So there is no one dominant language. If you're interested in AI, stop worrying about language and start learning techniques. The language doesn't matter. Miscellaneous notes: I am at Indiana University studying computational linguistics (which is an area of AI that often uses machine learning techniques), and Python is the most popular choice for prototypes at IU. But not overwhelmingly so. Overall, computational linguistics doesn't have any dominant language for research. A lot of software is released in Java and C/C++ because these languages are fast and portable. (I'm running a couple of Java-based parsers in the background as I type this.) I only know of one or two groups still using Common Lisp. I haven't heard of anybody doing AI research with Clojure, but there very well could be. As for other new functional languages, F# is used by Microsoft for development of AI-esque things, but not necessarily research. I personally use Haskell for a lot of things, but it's not a common choice, as far as I know.
