Apparently the only information you have is the numbers of days and the number of news articles published on the feed. I think what you are really asking is "Is this news feed worth my effort to poll?" and the desired answer is "Yes or No". Therefore, you are actually wanting to perform a logistic regression . The result of logistic regression is a probability and in your case, the probability of whether you should poll the news feed. After you make your model, you then need to decide your threshold for action: Perhaps for Feed A (which is really important), you want to poll it if the probability is > 75% but for Feed B (maybe it is not so important) you may decide to have a higher threshold, maybe poll it only if the probability of a new feed is > 90%. In your case, you have one additional component - time dependent data that you think are involved in this whole process. I would suggest creating moving window logistic regression (like this example for linear regression ). You of course would have to tune the number of days you want to incorporate on your model based on some modeling you would do ahead of time, and of course you would have to evaluate your model periodically!
