Okey, I will try and start this list. Have you considered... JAAS? Should include the GSS API, but was very cumbersome the last time I tried it. that some authentication must take place anyway and that VNC only exports the view to a running program, so a VNC session cannot transport tickets? a browser based solution with an embedded Java VNC client? At least the IE is able to carry out kerberos authentication, I don't know about the other browsers, or HOW the IE does that. the case when two users log in the same time? Will they see the same app? Or will this be forbidden? just using an X Server on your local host and export the clients applications windows? EDIT: More considerations: When using the X Server variant, use Xmove to move the programs to the X Server. You can use SSH authentication with private/secret keys and let the user enter one passphrase to connect all your servers. SSH agent is the keyword. With the existing SSH connections, start XMove on all the machines, collect all GUIs and send them to the client. You could even write a little MainWindow, with Buttons for each app, and when clicked, export only one of the apps, so it seems like they have been started from the main GUI.
