Is there a more elegant way of handcrafting serialised Javascript in .Net?

I receive this error when I try to use "{" to generate Javascript objects server-side to pass back to the browser: "Input string was not in a correct format." This happens when I do the following: builder.AppendLine(String.Format("ID{0}: { ", application.Key.ToString())); // Does not work: But not when I do the following: builder.AppendLine(String.Format("ID{0}: {{ ", application.Key.ToString())); The cause of the error is that String.Format uses "{" as mark-up. Is there a more eligant way of handcrafting Javascript serialisation in .Net? EDIT: We only have up to .Net 3.5 Framework installed on the server
