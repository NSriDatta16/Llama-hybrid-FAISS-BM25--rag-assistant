I'm a C# developer, believe me, there are more choices in Java than in .Net. The obvious advantage in .Net, though, is that in any job you land uses the same IDE (Visual Studio) and (in most cases) uses the latest .Net framework (except for maintaining legacy apps). There may be some subtle differences in different employers such as them using Enterprise Libraries, MVC versus Forms, WPF, etc.; But if you're a seasoned C# developer, you can adapt easily depending on your fundamentals. Some developers in my field who did not learn any other programming languages tend to be lazy and simply drag-n-drop objects to accomplish tasks 80% of the time (some of them even believe that object-oriented programming is simply code with objects). If you are familiar in C++ or any C based language, you will definitely have the upper hand but that is not a requirement. I'd suggest learn the best programming practices, never put all your eggs in one basket (even though god did that to us men), and be open to other languages other than C#. If you learn one C-based language, learning other major languages won't be as hard rather than starting with VB.Net. Either way, both of them are well paying jobs and you won't regret if you choose either one. my 2 cents.
