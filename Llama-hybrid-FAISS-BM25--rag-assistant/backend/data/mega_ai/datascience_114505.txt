What data can I obtain from this H5 file?

I created a CNN model and it is saved in h5 format. I used the Netron app, where I obtained the model architecture, however batchnormalization was not present. Is there a method to determine whether this h5 model has a batchnormalization layer or not. Again, is it possible to know the learning rate?
