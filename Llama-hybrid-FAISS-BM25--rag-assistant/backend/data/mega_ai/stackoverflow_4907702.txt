I don't know of any particular script to do this, but it wouldn't be difficult to construct a custom one. I did this using jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/brianflanagan/3KyRm/ I kept this fairly simple to demonstrate as a proof-of-concept. I wouldn't recommend building a quiz that includes the answers in the source code as it would be far too easy to cheat. :) A better solution would incorporate a form submission or AJAX handler.
