JSON ( J ava S cript O bject N otation) and AJAX ( A synchronous J avaScript a nd X ML) are two completely different concepts, one is used as a storage medium for data (JSON) while the other is used to retrieve data from a HTTP or FTP web server (AJAX) which is not dependent on the format of the data to be transferred, it can be text, binary, XML or JSON, which is pretty much everything. You can use AJAX with JSON, by retrieving some data in the JSON format from the web server, using AJAX, then using JavaScript to parse the JSON data into a form accessible by the scripting engine.
