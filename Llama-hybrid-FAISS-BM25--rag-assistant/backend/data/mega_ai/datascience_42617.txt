Hesitate to drop a feature

I used to tried making a fake correlation in my mocking dataset and found that if the score is more than 0.5 I can reduce feature to avoid singularity In the given example they are many correlated variables. Therefore I am thinking about dimensionality reduction. The one feature here that I plan to remove is Hum-6D05 because it has strong correlation between Hum-6D12, Hum-6F04, and Hum-6F14 Question: Am I correct? Any comment or advice are welcomed
