How does the Identity connection in ResNets work

I am currently going through the Research paper "Deep Learning for Image recognition" by Kaiming He . I don't quite understand the concept of shortcut connections. Suppose the input to the residual learning layer shown below is an image of size 32x32. As per my understanding, after the two convolution layers shown in the figure the dimension of the output will decrease to 28x28. How is then the element wise addition of this 28x28 image and the 32x32 input image possible? Is the convolution mentioned in this layer not the same as in CNN?
