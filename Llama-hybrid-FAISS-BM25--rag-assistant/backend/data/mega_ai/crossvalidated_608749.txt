1. The CLT certainly doesn't solve all problems. For example: (a) There are distributions for which the CLT doesn't hold. Here's an example: This density is a mixture of a symmetric 4-parameter beta and a $t_2$ . There's a normal distribution that looks visually pretty close to it (e.g. in the way that a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic measures distance, largest absolute difference in cdf), but this distribution does not have a finite variance, and the ordinary central limit theorem fails to hold for this seemingly unremarkable-looking case. (While it is close in the stated sense to a normal distribution, I did not spend time getting it as close as possible; there are examples that look even closer to a normal, indeed it can be as close as you like.) (b) There are distributions for which the CLT does hold, but for which even averages of a million observations are not really close to a normal. There's an example discussed here , a lognormal distribution with sufficiently large shape parameter ( $\sigma$ ). That number ( $n= 10^6$ ) can be pushed up, beyond any fixed value. That is, there's really no "large enough" that's sufficient to make the distribution of standardized sums or means 'close to normal' for every distribution among the set of distributions for which the CLT does hold. (c) There are tests that assume normality but which do not involve means. In those cases the CLT isn't necessarily of any direct relevance. 2. None of this is an argument for using formal tests of assumptions. That doesn't really answer the right question. There's a nice discussion of that point (in relation to testing normality) in Harvey Motulsky's answer here . Much more could be said about testing but that's perhaps not the direct issue here, so I won't labor the point further.
