Should we address multiple comparisons adjustments when using confidence intervals?

Suppose we have a multiple comparisons scenario such as post hoc inference on pairwise statistics, or like a multiple regression, where we are making a total of $m$ comparisons. Suppose also, that we would like to support inference in these multiples using confidence intervals. 1. Do we apply multiple comparison adjustments to CIs? That is, just as multiple comparisons compel a redefinition of $\alpha$ to either the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR), does the meaning of confidence (or credibility 1 , or uncertainty, or prediction, or inferential... pick your interval) get similarly altered by multiple comparisons? I realize that a negative answer here will moot my remaining questions. 2. Are there straightforward translations of multiple comparison adjustment procedures from hypothesis testing, to interval estimation? For example, would adjustments focus on changing the $\text{CI-level}$ term in the confidence interval: $\text{CI}_{\theta} = (\hat{\theta} \pm t_{(1-\text{CI-level)/2}}\hat{\sigma}_{\theta})$ ? 3. How would we address step-up or step-down control procedures for CIs? Some family-wise error rate adjustments from the hypothesis testing approach to inference are 'static' in that precisely the same adjustment is made to each separate inference. For example, the Bonferroni adjustment is made by altering rejection criterion from: reject if $p\le \frac{\alpha}{2}$ to: reject if $p\le \frac{\frac{\alpha}{2}}{m}$ , but the Holm-Bonferroni step-up adjustment is not 'static', but rather made by: first ordering $p$ -values smallest to largest, and then reject if $p\le 1 - (1- \frac{\alpha}{2})^{\frac{1}{m+1-i}}$ , (where $i$ indexes the ordering of the $p$ -values) until we fail to reject a null hypothesis, and automatically fail to reject all subsequent null hypotheses. Because rejection/failure to reject is not happening with CIs (more formally, see the references below) does that mean that stepwise procedures don't translate (i.e. including all of the FDR methods)? I ought to caveat here that I am not asking how to translate CIs into hypothesis tests (the representatives of the 'visual hypothesis testing' literature cited below get at that non-trivial question). 4. What about any of those other intervals I mentioned parenthetically in 1? 1 Gosh, I sure hope I don't get in trouble with those rockin' the sweet, sweet Bayesian styles by using this word here. :) References Afshartous, D. and Preston, R.
