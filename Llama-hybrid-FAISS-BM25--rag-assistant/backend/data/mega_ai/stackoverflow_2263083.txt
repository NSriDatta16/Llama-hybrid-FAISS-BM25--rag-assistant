There are certain aspects to consider: Does your application depend on 3rd party plugins/gems? If so than you should check if those are already Rails 3 compatible . You're probably gonna find libraries which are incompatible as yet but there is a big chance that these are gonna "get fixed" sooner or later. Also, it really depends on what kind of application you are talking about. Personally I'm porting one of my 2.3.5 based sites to Rails 3 but only for preparing and learning purposes. Since Rails 3 is only public beta as yet, IT IS DEFINITELY NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PRODUCTION READY . You can download it, use it and play with it but that's pretty much it for now. If you decide to upgrade one of your existing projects (which I'd encourage you to do) than have a look at Geoffrey Grosenbach's screencast which will guide you through the upgrading process. There's also an official plugin which contains a handy script that you can use to find out which parts of your application need to be upgraded.
