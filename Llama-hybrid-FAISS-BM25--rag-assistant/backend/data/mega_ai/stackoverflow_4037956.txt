They are not comparable imho. jQuery UI is just a combination of a couple of widgets which can be used together but are not really integrated or anything. Quite extensible, quite fast, but not a complete widget toolkit. ExtJS is a full-blown widget toolkit Web App framework that is comparable to most GUI toolkits in terms of features. yes it's useful, but it's also very complex and very large/slow. So imho it depends on what you need. For a normal frontend I would never use ExtJS since it's way too large and slow. But for an Admin panel or something large where it actually adds a lot of usability, yes please. Just try and create something like this with jQuery UI: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/grid/totals.html Also, with ExtJS you can even design your interfaces with a drag and drop interface these days: http://www.sencha.com/products/designer/download.php Size comparison: jQuery: jquery-1.4.2.min.js : 70.5KiB jquery-ui-1.8.5.min.js : 199.5KiB Total: 270KiB Ext: ext-all.js : 697.7KiB ext-base.js is 26.5KiB Total: 724.2KiB
