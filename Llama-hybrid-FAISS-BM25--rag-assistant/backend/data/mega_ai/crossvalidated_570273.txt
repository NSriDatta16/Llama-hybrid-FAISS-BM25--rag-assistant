How to compute Cohen's d and p-value for comparison of least squares mean from two different mixed models?

I have two randomly assigned treatment interventions (A and B), and two subgroups of individuals (X and Y). This is a longitudinal study with dropout. I want to test whether the outcomes of individuals treated with B are different in subgroups X vs. Y. I know how to compute the "least squares means" and average treatment effects (which account for missing data) for A vs. B. These are computed with a mixed model with fixed effects for timepoint, the baseline value, treatment group, timepoint*baseline, timepoint*group. So one option is to run the mixed model on subgroup X (some of whom received A, and others B), and again on subgroup Y. That gives me LS means and standard errors for all four subsets (A+X, A+Y, B+X, B+Y). At this point, how do I compare the B+X and B+Y groups? I would like to compute a Cohen's d and p-value. Possibly relevant question: Pairwise comparison of least squares means from two separate generalized linear mixed-effects models
