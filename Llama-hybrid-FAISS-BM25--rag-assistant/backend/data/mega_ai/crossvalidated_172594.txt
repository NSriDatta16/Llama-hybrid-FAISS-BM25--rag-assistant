Etymology of "cluster" in the context of cluster analysis

I'm trying to track down the origins of the word "cluster" and its usage in the context of cluster analysis. Please, does anyone know when and by whom it was first used? Perhaps there was a paper or a book which coined these terms? Alternatively, maybe there is some literature describing the beginnings of the fields which work with the term "cluster" such as machine learning or statistics of some kind?
