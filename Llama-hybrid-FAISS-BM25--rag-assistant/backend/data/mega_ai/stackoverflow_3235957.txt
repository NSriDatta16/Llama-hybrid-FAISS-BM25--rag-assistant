No - different phone browser have different levels of HTML compliance. Compare iPhone/Android browser with, say, a 3 year old Nokia phone (that most corporate users probably have to use) No - there are far too many browser/device/operator combinations for you to write individual web apps. This is known as the mobile web fragmentation problem. Luckily yes - have a look at http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/ or http://deviceatlas.com/ . These frameworks let you write one web app (within some limits). These frameworks will recognise the browser (through the User Agent) and output the most appropriate HTML for that device. They can also deal with issues like resizing images for lower end devices.
