Discrete, high dimensional optimization techniques

Suppose we have a binary vector of length 1000 where we can switch each element on or off. Each of the $2^{1000}$ different settings reveals a reward. The goal is to find the setting with the maximum reward in a finite amount of time. Obviously, a random search will be completely useless because the space to be explored is simply too large. Are there optimization techniques (Bayesian or non-Bayesian) that show good empirical performance in these types of problems? I'd appreciate if someone could point me into the direction of some literature.
