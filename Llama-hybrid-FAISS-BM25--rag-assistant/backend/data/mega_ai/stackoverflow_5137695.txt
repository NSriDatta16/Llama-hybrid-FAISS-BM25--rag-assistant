is it possible to foreach $this->input->post(); in codeigniter?

I am writing a library for CI and I have a method I call to gather all possible post variables. I would somehow like to leverage the xss and security classes built into the codeigniter input class. Is that possible? Here is the working method without any use of the CI input class. private function parse_options() { foreach($_POST as $key => $val) { $options[$key] = $val; } return $options; }
