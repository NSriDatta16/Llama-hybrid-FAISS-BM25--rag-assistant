The trouble is that you declared a pointer on the stack but it isn't clear where "amit" is supposed to be stored. You want the string on the stack too and the easiest way to do that is to allocate the storage for it by changing p from a pointer to a character array. Change your code to this: main() { char p[] = "amit"; p[0]='s'; printf("%s",p); }
