On Mac OS X, you can define LoginHook and LogoutHook scripts to run as part of the login/logout process; see Apple's documentation and Mike Bombich's notes and examples . Another possibility would be to create a LaunchAgent -- the main difference would be that a LaunchAgent will run as the user, inside their login session, while LoginHook and LogoutHook scripts run as root. Most of Apple's docs about this concentrate on LaunchDaemons, but LaunchAgents are very similar except that they run within user login sessions, while LaunchDaemons run as root (but independently of login sessions, making them unsuitable for what you want).
