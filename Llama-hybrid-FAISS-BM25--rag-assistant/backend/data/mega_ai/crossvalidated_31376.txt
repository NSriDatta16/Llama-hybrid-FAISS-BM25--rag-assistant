Exponential smoothing is just a special case of an ARIMA model. If there is a benefit to fitting a general ARIMA model it is because of its generality and not that it handles gaps in the data any better than exponetial smoothing. I don't see any reason for throwing out February 29th. Individual dates would not have any appriciable effect on seasonality if there is some periodic component to the series. The time unit for time series analysis can be whatever time unit you measure the data in (it could be days weeks or years). You can cumulate data to create longer time intervals for the time series model. The fact that a date in one year falls on a different day of the week than in another year has nothing to do with its utility. If there are weekly effects this can show up in a 7 day periodic component. Gaps in the data does hurt your ability to fit the model. But if a single ARIMA model would have fit well to the complete series you probably can identify it piecing together the available portions of the series keeping count through the time index of the number of days missing at each gap. I don't understand why you can't have days as the time units. Is there a problem with having a long series because it seems to me that the time unit only affects the number of time points im the series?
