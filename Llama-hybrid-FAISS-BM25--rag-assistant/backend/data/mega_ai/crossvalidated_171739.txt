From the lovely book Introduction to Statistical Learning : We tend to refer to problems with a quantitative response as regression problems, while those involving a qualitative response are often referred to as classification problems So, no Linear Regression should not be called a classifier. I guess you can't be much more specific than referring to all methods that solve some kind of learning problem as machine learning algorithm or statistical learning method .
