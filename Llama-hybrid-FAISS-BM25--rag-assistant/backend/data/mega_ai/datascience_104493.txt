How to learn common sense constants? Look in body for detail

If I wanted to learn constants for example week -> 7 days, chicken -> 2 legs, day -> 24, 1km -> 1000 meters hours, and so on, would it be possible to extract this information from a BERT model trained on the right dataset like Wikipedia words? If not, what model would I have to use?
