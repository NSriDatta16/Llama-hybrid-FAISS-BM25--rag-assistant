How to get http://mysite.com/ indexed in a search engine, not http://mysite.com/index.php, and nothing more?

In only one search engine I want to get... http://mysite.com/ indexed, not... http://mysite.com/index.php I only want to allow indexing of the main page of the website, and nothing more. I do not want the bot to follow any of the links on the main page. My meta tags include the following:: My robot.txt includes the following:: User-agent: Googlebot Allow: /index.php Disallow: / User-agent: * Disallow: / Will this achieve my desired result? Thanks in advance!
