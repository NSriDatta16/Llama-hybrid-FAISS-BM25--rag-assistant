I suggest you take a quick look at hypothesis testing concepts if you already had not done it for understanding what is meant by confidence. In hypothesis testing, you make the distinction that your observed sample is a realization of your data generating process and is susceptible to random deviations from the exact function. Consequently, your estimation of the coefficients could be off due to random errors as well. Confidence, in this context, usually refers to the unlikeliness of your sample being deviated by random errors. You basically want to say that, given this sample, there is a X% chance that I did not observe this sample (and my conclusions) by random error. In order to be able to say this, you have to make an assumption on the distribution of errors so that you can calculate the distribution of your estimations. If your function is: $$ appleLiking = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \epsilon $$ then you can answer both of your question if you know the mean and variance of your $\beta_1$ estimation. For your first question, you are interested in how close your estimated $\hat\beta_1$ is to $0$, given your estimated $\hat\beta_1$ variance. This is commonly referred as the significance of $\hat\beta_1$. For your second one, you are interested in how close your estimated $\hat\beta_1$ is to $Y$, given your estimated $\hat\beta_1$ variance. Luckily, once you assume the distributions, the estimations are relatively straightforward statistical procedures. You calculate the confidence levels by common p-values using standard normal distributions. For the estimation procedure, since you are asking a time-series, you may go with ARIMA estimations to account for autocorrelations in error term. If you are using R, the following will provide an estimation: appleLiking = as.ts(c(0.044, 0.041, 0.055, 0.063, 0.054, 0.060)) auto.arima(appleLiking, xreg=1:length(appleLiking)) Notice the standard errors displayed. Those values are the ones you need for confidence calculations. See the answers here for more details on time series issues.
