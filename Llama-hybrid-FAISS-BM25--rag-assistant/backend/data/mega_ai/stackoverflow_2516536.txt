IIS 6+ASP.NET - many temp files generated

I have a ASP.NET + some .NET web-services running on IIS 6 (win 2003 server). The issue is that IIS is generating a lot (!) of files in "c:\WINDOWS\Temp" directory. a lot of files means thousands of files, which get to more than 3G of size so far. The files are generated by this command: C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\inetsrv> "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe" /t:library /utf8output /R:"C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\Temporary ASP.NET Files\vfagt\113819dd\db0d5802\assembly\dl3\fedc6ef1\006e24d8_3bc9ca01\VfAgentWService.DLL" /R:"C:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Web.Services\2.0.0.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a\System.Web.Services.dll" /R:"C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\mscorlib.dll" /R:"C:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Xml\2.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089\System.Xml.dll" /R:"C:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System\2.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089\System.dll" /out:"C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\9i_i2bmg.dll" /debug- /optimize+ /nostdlib /D:_DYNAMIC_XMLSERIALIZER_COMPILATION "C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\9i_i2bmg.0.cs" The files in the temp directory are pairs of *.out & *.err, where the *.err file is zero size, and the *.out file contains the compilation output messages. What is causing IIS to generate so many files? How can I prevent it? UPDATE: The problem is that the command i described above (csc.exe) is being executed many (many) times, causing the .out & .err to be generated so many times, until it consumes the disk space. So - my question is: what is causing this command to run so many times? (i don't have that many .aspx & .asmx files in my web app). Thanks, Moe
