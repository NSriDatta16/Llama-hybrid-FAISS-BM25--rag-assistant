How to pass a parameter to SSRS report from SSIS package?

I'm writing my first SSIS pkg and I'm stuck. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I'm running a sql agent job that kicks off a SSRS report. (The job was generated via a scheduled subscription.) This report relies on 2 stored procs which require the parameter 'When' (date type) and it dumps a PDF of the report to a file share. My execute sql task runs this: EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_start_job N'myJobName'; How can I pass a value for the parameter 'When' into the report?
