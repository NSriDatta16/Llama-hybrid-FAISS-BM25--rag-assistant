Website as storage for multimedia needed

I've developed an excellent social network in Flash. Now I need a site for downloading/uploading of photos and video. Of course, all uploading must take place on my web site, well, so does downloading. Could you recommend such a site or sites that will let me do the job in return for advertising their site on mine or for money (but not too much, as I only need their site as a storage for my multimedia). Thanks in advance. And merry Christmas to you!
