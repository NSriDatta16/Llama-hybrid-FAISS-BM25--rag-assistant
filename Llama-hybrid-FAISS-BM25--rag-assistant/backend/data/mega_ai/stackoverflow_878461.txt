More fine grained sorting of methods using Eclipse Ganymede: Is there a good plugin available?

These are the options we have out of the box: I would like a more fine grained sorting when it comes to methods. I would like to: Have all methods with a name which does not start with get , is or set first. Then have the accessor methods (with names starting with get, is or set). Individually the methods in [1] and [2] above could be sorted in alphabetical order. Apart from my devision of normal methods into two parts I like the existing sort order. I find this order (with the accessor methods last) better as I'm more likely to find the non-accessor methods interesting when I'm maintaining a class and I need to fix a bug etc. Is there a plugin I could use? If there is none, would it be hard to create this kind of plugin myself? (I have never created a Eclipse plugin.)
