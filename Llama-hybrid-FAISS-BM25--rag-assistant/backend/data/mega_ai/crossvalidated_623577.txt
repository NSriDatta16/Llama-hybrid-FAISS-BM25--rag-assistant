Bias and Variance of a Honest Random Forest

I am trying to read the paper Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests . In the section 3.1(Theoretical Background), page 13 paragraph 2, The authors have estimated the bias and variance of a honest random forest for a specific type of data and sub-sampling size. I don't know how. Details: In the paper Mentch and Hooker [2016] the authors have showed that the bias of Random forest using sub-sampling approaches Gaussian distribution if the sub-sampling size grows slower than $\sqrt{n}$ . In the Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests the authors say that estimate will not be in general asymptotically unbiased using an example below: Given ( $X$ i , $Y$ i ) $\in$ $[$$0$ , $1$$]$$^d$$\times$$R$ and $d$$=$$2$ , $\mu$ ( $x$ ) $=$$\mathbb{E}[Y|X=x]$ and $\mu$ ( $x$ ) $=$$\lVert x \rVert$ 1 , for this if honest forest is evaluated at x=0 they say that the bias of the random forest decays as $1/$$\sqrt{s_n}$ and variance decays as $s$ n $/$$n$ . I don't how they got this bias and variance decay rate. Could someone please explain. Thanks in advance.
