You can't really have an infinite number of accounts since there aren't an infinite number of people. In fact, you really are limited in the number of accounts that you can have (if you choose to store the value in a single database column) since any finite storage mechanism for countable things has a limit. I'd suggest, with @Tor Haugen, that the best way to do this is to use the limit imposed by the system (whatever maximum integer or long your language provides). That way you won't have to worry about any special cases for your comparisons. Additionally, I'd use a database constraint to prevent storing negative values in the field. A 64-bit integer will certainly hold a number big enough to be practically unlimited for your application.
