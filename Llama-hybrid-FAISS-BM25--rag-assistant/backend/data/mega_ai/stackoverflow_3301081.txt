Having worked at a medical office doing data entry, OCR will almost certainly not work. Our forms had special text boxes, with a separate box for each letter, and even for that the software was correct only about 75% of the time. There were some forms which allowed freeform writing, but the result was universally gibberish. I would recommend going the meta-data route; scan everything, but instead of trying to OCR each form, just store it as an image and add meta-data tags. My thinking is this: the goal of OCR in this case is to enable all forms to be read from the computer, thus making data retrieval simpler. However, you don't really need OCR to do that here, all you need to do is find some way which would allow someone to find a form really fast, and get the right info off the form. As such, even if you store each form as an image, adding the right meta-data tags would allow you to retrieve whatever you need whenever you need it, and the person running the search could either read it right off the stored form, or print it and read it that way. EDIT: One fairly simple way of executing this plan could be to use a simple database scheme, where each image is stored as a single field. Each row could then contain something like the following, depending on your needs: image name patient ID date of visit ... Basically, think of all the ways you'd want to search for a given file, and make sure that it's included as a field. Do you look up patients by Patient ID? Include that. Date of visit? Same. If you aren't familiar with designing a database around search requirements, I suggest hiring a developer with database design skills; you can end up with a very powerful, yet quick, database schema which includes everything you want and is powerful enough for your indexing needs. (Bear in mind that much of this will be highly specific to your application. You'll want to optimize this to your situation, and ensure set it up as well as you can at the outset.)
