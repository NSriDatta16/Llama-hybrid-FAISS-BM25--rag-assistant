For the NFL theorem , you're right. I think it doesn't contradict and they mean something like this: if you design your ML algorithm for your specific task, it'll succeed on it, and possibly fail on many others; which is in parallel to what the original paper by Wolpert says according to wiki: "any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems". So, it basically states the importance of exploiting the properties of the particular problem of interest and not chasing for a generally better (in terms of possible problems) one.
