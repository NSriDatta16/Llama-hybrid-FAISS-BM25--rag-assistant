Using mod_rewrite to convert paths with hash characters into query strings

I have a PHP project where I need to send a hash character (#) within the path of a URL. ( http://www.example.com/parameter#23/parameter#67/index.php ) I thought that urlencode would allow that, converting the hash to %23 But now I see that even the urlencoded hash forces the browser to treat everything to the right as the URL fragment (or query). Is there a way to pass a hash through, or do I need to do a character substitution prior to urlencode? Edit to add (Sep 19 2017): It turns out that I was asking the wrong question. My issue wasn't with using the hash character within the path (encoding it does work), but in using mod_rewrite to convert it over to a query string. I had failed to re-encode it within the RewriteRule. I'll edit the title to match. Here is the rewrite rule I was using: RewriteEngine On # convert path strings into query strings RewriteRule "^(.*)/(.*)/hashtags.php" /hashtags.php?parameter_1=$1&amp;parameter_2=$2 [QSA,L] As soon as I added the B tag, it worked correctly: RewriteEngine On # convert path strings into query strings RewriteRule "^(.*)/(.*)/hashtags.php" /hashtags.php?parameter_1=$1&amp;parameter_2=$2 [QSA,L,B]
