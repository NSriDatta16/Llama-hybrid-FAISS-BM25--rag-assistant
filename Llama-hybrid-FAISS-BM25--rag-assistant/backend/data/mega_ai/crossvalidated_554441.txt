Based on visual inspection your time series might have a discernable wave every 1 to 3 months. If you include longer period terms in your model this will create an extrapolated mean estimate and prediction interval that is more "wiggly." It's not critical, but it might improve the point predictions. As you currently have it the vast majority of the observations in the test set fall within the prediction intervals. MAPE stands for mean absolute percentage error. It is the average multiplicative effect between each estimated mean and the observed outcome. RMSE stands for root mean squared error, i.e. standard deviation. While they both summarize the variability of the observations around the mean, they are not in the same scale so don't expect the values to be similar. I suggest using RMSE as this is the basis for how the model is fit to the data.
