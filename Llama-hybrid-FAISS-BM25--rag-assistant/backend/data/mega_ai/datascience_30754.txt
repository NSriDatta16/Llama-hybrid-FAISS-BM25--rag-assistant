Anomaly detection using RNN LSTM

I'm trying to detect anomalies in an univariate time series. I trained a RNN LSTM and currently I get one-step-ahead predictions. Could someone explain if it's possible to output a confidence interval (or maybe a prediction interval) with RNN LSTM instead of just a predicted value. When I want to flag observations as anomulous on real-time data I think I need more information than just the predicted and observed value for point x (f.e. I need a predicted confidence interval). Please point me into the right direction. Currently I'm using an Adam optimizer, MSE as the loss function and a Dense output layer with a linear activation function.
