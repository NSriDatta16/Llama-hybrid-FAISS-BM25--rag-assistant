On a tangential note, you might want to look at Oracle's partitioning here and here . Partitioning enables tables and indexes to be split into smaller, more manageable components and is a key requirement for any large database with high performance and high availability requirements. Oracle Database 11g offers the widest choice of partitioning methods including interval, reference, list, and range in addition to composite partitions of two methods such as order date (range) and region (list) or region (list) and customer type (list). Faster Performance—Lowers query times from minutes to seconds Increases Availability—24 by 7 access to critical information Improves Manageability—Manage smaller 'chunks' of data Enables Information Lifecycle Management—Cost-efficient use of storage Partitioning the table into daily partitions would make archiving easier as described here
