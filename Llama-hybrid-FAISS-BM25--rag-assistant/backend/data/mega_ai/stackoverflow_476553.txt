You need something that you need/want to accomplish. Sit down and create it. While you are creating it you will have to figure out the things you don't know. It's probably the best way to identify what those things are. When you are done and have something working you look back on it and think about what you could have done differently to organize it better. Do some research about those specific things and possible ways to approach it. Create something else and reflect on that. Repeat until you have an a-ha moment. For me my first a-ha moment was being taught Honeywell assembler during my 3rd week of training and finally realizing how the computer really worked. My OOP a-ha moment was during a Real Time Relay Ladder Logic course and I decided to make a library to simulate the Texas Instrument hardware that we had to write our programs against. It let me write/test my programs for the class without having to go to the school and use the real hardware. It opened my eyes to OOP. I believe the a-ha moment happened because I was able to model (with code) something that was real.
