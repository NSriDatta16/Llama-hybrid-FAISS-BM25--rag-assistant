How do I launch an application from a .sh script?

Help me please with a bash script of a few lines. I have a MyApplication executable in some folder, and I need to make a launcher script to call that application from it's folder when I click it from a grafical interface . (I need this because I need my application to be launched from it's folder, so that Qt::currentPath() will return the current folder the executable is in) Please help me, I just had to power off my linux machine two times in a row, I made fork bombs instead of launchers :(. P.S. I'm a linux newbie, trying to figure out scripting. EDIT More about my current problem: Qt how to open a file in current dir ? or what's wrong with this? Details: MyApplication is a GUI project compiled in Qt-Creator. It uses .xml files for storage. If I cd manually to the folder the executable is in, and run it, everything works fine, the application knows the path to the .xml files (current directory). But, if I just click the icon of the application it launches from $HOME, and my application is not able to find those .xml files. That's why, I suppose, I need a .sh launcher, to call it from it's directory when I'll click it.
