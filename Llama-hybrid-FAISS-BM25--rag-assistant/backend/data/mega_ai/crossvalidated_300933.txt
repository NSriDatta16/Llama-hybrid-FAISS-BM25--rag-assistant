What is "closed form PPCA"?

I found a phrase "closed form PPCA" with reference to the paper Tipping, Bishop - Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis . What does it mean? What is the difference with "normal" PCA? Does modern libraries like Python's sklearn calculate PCA or PPCA ? Python's documentation refers to the paper of the same authors and close content .
