How to Validate a Monte Carlo Simulation

I have historical data of a production process, and I've being asked to build a simulation model to predict its performance in the future. Using the historical data, I've being able to obtain the process parameters like the following: A probability distribution of the number of work packages A probability distribution for the workers productivity I've also being able to plug those parameters into a Monte Carlo simulation and obtain some predictions. However, so far I'm not sure how to be sure if my simulation is really reflecting reality . In machine learning we have cross validation and test-train splits and see how effective the prediction are, and I was wondering if there is a similar approach for simulation models. UPDATE: The historical data available correspond to work orders produced from 2003 to 2015. Per each work order, we have the lifecycle information: When it was created, every status change and when it was ready for delivery.
