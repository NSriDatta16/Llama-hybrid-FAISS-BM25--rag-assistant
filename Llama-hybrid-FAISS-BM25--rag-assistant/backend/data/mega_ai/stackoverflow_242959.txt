Well, int64 uses 8 byte of memory storage, while int uses 4 byte... however, you pointed out most of the disadvantages already. Of course calculations performed will also be slower on many systems (a 64 bit system running in 64 bit mode can perform operations on 64 bit as fast as on 32 bit, but a 32 bit system needs to perform extra work, that means adding two 64 bit numbers is performed by two 32 bit adds plus some extra code - other math operations will be equally broken down into 32 bit operations). However unless you store millions of these numbers and perform tons of operations with them, I doubt you will see any performance difference, though, neither in CPU time nor in memory.
