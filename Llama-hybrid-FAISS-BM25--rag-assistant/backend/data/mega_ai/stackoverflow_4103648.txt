I always hated psudocode in classroom settings for this very reason. How much do you write? What am I allowed to leave off, or in other words, what are we taking for granted here? As far as the overloaded function, it looks as though you understand it just fine. Here is your default constructor that doesn't take any arguments: public Employee () And here is your other constructor that does take arguments. public Employee (id : integer, salary : integer) So, to answer your original question, you are correct. An overloaded constructor is simply having multiple constructors that take different arguments. In your case, I can create the class by calling the constructor two different ways: Employee myEmployee = new Employee(); OR Employee myEmployee = new Employee(12, 64500); In programmer speak you have an overloaded constructor. As for the rest of your code: One thing you are doing wrong is that you have not declared "numberofaccidents". Like so: private employeeid : integer private employeesalary : integer private numberofaccidents : integer Think of accessors and mutators as "getters" and "setters". You might want to change "setCustomeraget" to "setCustomerId" though. Also, there is no "setnumberofaccidents". Try and pair up your getters and setters so that you can always tell if you are missing one. Something like this: public num getSalary() return employeesalary public void setSalary(integer salary) employeesalary = salary
