Why don't Bayesian methods require multiple testing corrections?

Andrew Gelman wrote an extensive article on why Bayesian AB testing doesn't require multiple hypothesis correction: Why We (Usually) Donâ€™t Have to Worry About Multiple Comparisons , 2012. I don't quite understand: why don't Bayesian methods require multiple testing corrections? A ~ Distribution1 + Common Distribution B ~ Distribution2 + Common Distribution C ~ Distribution3 + Common Distribution Common Distribution ~ Normal My understanding is that the Bayesian approach shown above accounts for the shared underlying distribution by all the hypothesis (unlike in a frequentist Bonferroni correction). Is my reasoning correct?
