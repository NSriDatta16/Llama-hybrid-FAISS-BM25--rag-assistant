I don't think this is unreasonable, though I'd mention two thoughts. First, I think it is a good thing to assign the click handlers dynamically rather than actually putting "click=" into the HTML (this is the heart of "progressive enhancement"). Hoerver, you may want to use a different type of selector. Finding a group of elements by class is one of the slower ways to define elements, especially if there may be many pages. You could put them all within a div and do $("#myDiv span").click(). That should be much faster. Second, making the assumption that the page number will always start at the fourth character of the span id seems a bit fragile. It might be better to just make the id be the page number by itself.
