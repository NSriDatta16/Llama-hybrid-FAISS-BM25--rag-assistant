The PCA uses only linear algebra to find "best" components to explain the variance. See this answer for longer explanation on PCA. Therefore if your dataset already has linear relationships between its variables, you'll get best linear models without any non-linear transformations on raw data. You could ask your question again using exp or tanh or any non-linear function instead of log and you could expect similar effect. You are basically worsening linear relations between variables when you apply logarithm (or any function) on a variable. Usually it is good to have some theoretical basis to log-transform a variable.
