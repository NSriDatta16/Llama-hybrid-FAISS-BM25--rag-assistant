Sounds like you are doing supervised classification, where the classes are "will buy" and "won't buy", and the features include number of visits, time between visits, and other information you have about customers. To keep things simple, I would start with older data and assume that after some period of time, if someone has not bought, they won't. Later you can come back to dealing with censored data (using methods from survival analysis). I would start with logistic regression, then possibly try KNN or a random forest classifier. One other consideration is how to many models to build. You could have one model that you train with data from the first visit, and use to make a prediction after the first visit. Then a second model for the second visit, etc. Or you could make a single model with number of visits as a factor. I am leaning toward the first option, but I might try both. Hope that helps!
