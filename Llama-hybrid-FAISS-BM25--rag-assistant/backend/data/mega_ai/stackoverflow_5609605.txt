Get his iPhone device UDID. Then create a distribution profile for ad-hoc distribution and add his UDID to the profile. Create a distribution build of your app and sign with that distribution profile. Send over the build .app and the .mobileprovision (provisioning profile) to him. He will have to install the profile first via iTunes (drag and drop to Library section and then sync) and then similarly he can install the app once the profile is successfully installed.
