Approximation/sampling of complex Likelihoods

I would like to ask a quite vague question, in order to gather references and ideas about that topic. My question is the following: In cases where the computation of Likelihood in Bayesian framework is complex or computational inneficient, what other methods/approximations exist in order to either calculate/approximate the Likelihood or take samples from it.
