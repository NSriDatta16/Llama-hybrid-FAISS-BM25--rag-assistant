Assuming that you are referring to Servlet programming .... There's no direct way to get from a POJO to the Session. You need to get the Session from the HttpServletRequest object. There are 2 popular solutions that I've seen for dealing with this. First option is to create a context object of some sort that contains the Session. This context is then passed along down into your business layer so that your POJOs can get this information if they need it. Second option is to leverage ThreadLocal storage. Often the session is placed on ThreadLocal storage by a filter or interceptor. Then any object in your system can fetch it from the thread. This pattern shows up in a lot of the web frameworks like Spring and Struts.
