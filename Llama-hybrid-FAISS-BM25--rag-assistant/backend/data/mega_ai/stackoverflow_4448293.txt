Windows phone 7 button "borders"

By default WP7 buttons are surrounded by a black space of 5ish pixels. I'd like to remove this, but I've tried setting the Margin, BorderThickness, Padding properties to be a Thinkness of zero, but this seems to have no effect on this mysterious space. Any clues what exactly this spaces is and how I might get rid of it. Thanks, Robert
