As you state, you're fresh out of college and have just been intensely indoctrinated in The One True (Object-Oriented) Way. If on the other hand you had learned declarative programming, database design, and set theory, you'd realize that the relational model is a perfectly adequate approach, well grounded in theory, while OO is a more pragmatic approach that was invented mostly in industry rather than academia. As it happens, most interesting research and development on database problems is being done by people with more of a math background, for whom the relational model is the more natural way to work with data. As a result, RDBMSs tend to be more stable, scalable, and trusted than their object-oriented counterparts. Object-oriented databases, much like XML, are often used in an ill-advised attempt to make data conform to the programs that use it, instead of the other way around.
