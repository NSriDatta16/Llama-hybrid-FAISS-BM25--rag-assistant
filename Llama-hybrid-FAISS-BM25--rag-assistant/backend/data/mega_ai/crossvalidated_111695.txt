To me this means the expected value is take my x value , subtract the mean, and then multiply it by the y value minus the y mean. No, you're dealing with covariance here. So the covariance is "take my x value , subtract the mean, and then multiply it by the y value minus the y mean"... then take the expectation of that. What I don't get is what in this equation says to do this for every pair of xy values I have? You must take great care not to conflate sample values and results for random variables themselves (notionally population quantities, in effect). You wrote an expression for the covariance of univariate random variables $X$ and $Y$ . Roughly speaking, when dealing with the sample quantities, replace expectations with sample averages, which are scaled sums. Also looking at the using a 4 sided dice, lets look at the expected value of our roll. Here I have multiplied each possible value by its probability of occurring. This is what I understood an Expected value to be, but I don't get how this relates to $\text{E}((x - \bar x)(y -\bar y))$ ...?? Here you're confusing expectation with covariance. If you want a covariance, what two things do you want the covariance of ?
