In fixed-income finance, you can observe the term structure time series of an asset. Concretely, for credit default swaps, how much you have to pay to get insured against a company's default for $t$ years. This price is directly linked to the probability of default of the company. At instant $t=0$ the probability of default is $P(t=0) = 0$, at instant $t=\infty$ the probability of default is $P(t=\infty) = 1$, in between it is nondecreasing. You thus have a cumulative distribution function, and by derivation a probability density function. Since you can observe this curve on a daily basis, you have a time series of PDF which may have interesting dynamics. Tell me if you are interested by a more detailed story about that.
