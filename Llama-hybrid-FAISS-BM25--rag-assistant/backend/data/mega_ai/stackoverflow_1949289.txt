If you want to overwrite all of the existing fields of an object with the values from another instance, there is no easy way to do it. It can be done if you're willing to write some wacky reflection code to visit each field of the object and copy the values. But it would be fragile and messy. Furthermore, to do it correctly, you would need to walk the inheritance tree of the object and perform the same assignment operations as well. Finally, if the object contains readonly field, it may be impossible to copy the exact state of another instance, and you will be forced to decide whether inconsistent copies are an acceptable outcome of the copy.
