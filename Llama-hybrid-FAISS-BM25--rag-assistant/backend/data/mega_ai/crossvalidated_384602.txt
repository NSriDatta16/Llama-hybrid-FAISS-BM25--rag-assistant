Are you looking for datasets for training autonomous driving cars? or are you looking for a tutorial/source of knowledge to learn how to train autonomous driving cars? For datasets , the following 2 are free to download: Berkeley dataset - 100,000 HD video sequences of over 1,100-hour driving experience across many different times in the day, weather conditions, and driving scenarios BDD100K - I'm not sure if it isn't the same as the first one (no personal experience). Nuscenes dataset - Full sensor data (multiple sensor types and positions). Their site also include a tutorial of how to use their dataset. I'm sure you can find more in the following link: 50 Free Machine Learning Datasets: Self-Driving Cars For knowledge/tutorial : As I mentioned before, the last dataset contains a tutorial. There is also the MIT tutorial . You can also read DeepDriving: Learning Affordance for Direct Perception in Autonomous Driving , it is a paper from ICCV2015 and they include their source code. I'm sure there are many more sources.
