For my two cents I think you are going to run into more problems than pros by throwing everyone into a single installation of Magento with everyone bumping into one another. Not to mention Customer X on Website Y cant seem to figure out why he can't create an account on Website Z that he has never been to before (that is a configuration issue, but it could happen) What I would recommend you do is setup a git repository that has your "base" Magento installation and then have all your clients on different versions setup that you could clone from that main install. This will give you only one real code base to update (database changes are a different story) and everyone is separate.
