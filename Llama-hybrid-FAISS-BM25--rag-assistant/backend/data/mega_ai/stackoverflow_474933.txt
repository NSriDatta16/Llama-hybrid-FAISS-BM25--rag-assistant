Way to infer the size of the userbase of a site from sampling taken usernames

Suppose you wanted to estimate the size of a userbase of a site which does not publicize this information. People are more likely to have acquired different usernames with different probabilities. For instance, if the username 'nick' doesn't exist on the system, it's likely to have an extremely small userbase. If the username 'starbaby' is taken, it's likely to be a much larger site. It seems like a straightforward Bayesian problem. There is the problem that different sites may have a different space of allowable usernames. The biggest problem would be the legality of common characters such as spaces, I imagine. Another issue that could taint the prior distribution is whether the site suggests names when the one you want is taken, or leaves you to think of a more creative name yourself. How could you build a training set of the frequency of occurrence of usernames across different sized systems? Is there a way to use Bayes to do numeric estimation rather than classification into fixed-width buckets?
