If you're concerned about clustering it's usually to help improve data retrieval. In you example, you're probably going to want all records for a given customer at once. Clustering on customerID will keep those rows on the same physical page rather than scattered throughout multiple pages in your file. ROT: Cluster on what you want to show a collection of. Line items in a purchase order is the classic example.
