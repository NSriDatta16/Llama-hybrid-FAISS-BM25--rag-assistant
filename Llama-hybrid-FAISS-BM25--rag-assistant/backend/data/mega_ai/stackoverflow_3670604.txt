If you really have some time and are truly interested in offering your services then you should start looking at what is available in your home town. There are numerous small non-profit organizations in every town that would love to have someone helping out. chances are the help they need barely qualifies as technical support (helping manage lists in Excel, running an online survey using a third- party tool, etc...) but you can be sure that your help would be appreciated. Non-technical people are intimidated by the Internets and any assistance can only help. Putting together a resource to help non-profits hook up with designers is a great idea but it is also quite ambitious. If you could pull it off, I'm sure it would be something the community would love to participate in. However, in the meantime, just call up local groups and ask if they need help. It is almost guaranteed that they do.
