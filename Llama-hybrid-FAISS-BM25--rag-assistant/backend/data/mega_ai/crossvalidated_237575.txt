If your features are not overly predictive, then your predicted probabilities won't be very high. For instance, if you are classifying people as having a particular disease or not, and all you have is their temperature, the predicted probability that someones suffers from this particular disease will be small - after all, a high temperature could be due to any number of other diseases. Work on getting better predictive features - in the disease example, blood tests, a look down the patient's throat etc. It doesn't make sense to transform the predicted probabilities from a logistic regression that does not cleanly separate the classes. Alternatively, your final classification can use a different threshold than 0.5. Nothing is stopping you from classifying samples with a predicted probability of 0.3 as being in the target group. What probability threshold you use should be governed by the relative costs of Type I and Type II errors.
