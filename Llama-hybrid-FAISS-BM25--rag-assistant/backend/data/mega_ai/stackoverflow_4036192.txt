I am kind of finalizing on the i18n stuff for my application and my design is based on below assumptions) 1) Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en","US")); is bad as you are changing the default locale for the JVM and not just for your app. So it is better to pass the locale around the app on a per request basis (may be threadlocal) 2) Handle all i18n formatting/parsing at the application level. DB should only handle comparisions (optionally), sorting (optionally) and storage. So just set the NLS_CHARACTERSET, NLS_COMP, NLS_SORT and NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS. By the way comparision and sorting at the db level means creating locale specific indexes thus slowing down the inserts/updates
