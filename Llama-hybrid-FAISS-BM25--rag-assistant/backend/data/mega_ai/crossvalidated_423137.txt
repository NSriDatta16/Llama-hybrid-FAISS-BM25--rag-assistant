As mentioned by others, you cannot compute the AUC for a linear regression model because there are no true or false positives. However, AUC is concerned with ranking, more specifically the probability that a randomly-chosen positive sample is ranked higher than a randomly-chosen negative sample. Our predictions are of course numerical and can therefore be ranked, the idea of a positive or negative observation doesn't exist but for a randomly selected pair of predictions there will be a clear positive and negative in that one value will be higher than the other, this is also true in our ground truth values (excluding pairs of identical values). Hence each pair of predictions can be evaluated as being ranked correctly/incorrectly by whether or not they are in the same order as observed in the ground truth. Repeating this for a sufficient number of predictions and taking the mean number of correct evaluations will provide you a "ranking accuracy" analogous to ROC AUC. A ranking accuracy of 1 means that if you were to order your data points by their predicted value they would be in exactly the same order as if you were to order them by their ground truth value. A ranking accuracy of 0 would mean that the two sequences would be exactly opposite. Important to note is that the actual error on the predicted values could be huge and this metric would not necessarily capture that, for example if all of your predictions were exactly 100x their ground truth values you would observe the maximum ranking accuracy of 1. This ranking approach to evaluating continuous predictions is used by Rendle et al . in BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback (2009) [ Arxiv ] in deriving their optimization criteria. Section 4.1.1 of that paper demonstrates mathematically the analogies between AUC and this approach. An interesting metric, useful if the final value is not as important as their relative values (such as in recommendation where the intended output is usually an ordered list).
