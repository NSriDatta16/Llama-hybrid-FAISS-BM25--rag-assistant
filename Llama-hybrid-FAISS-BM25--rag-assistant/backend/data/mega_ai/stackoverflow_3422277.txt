When you want to be the Drop Target , you need to enable dropping on the form: AllowDrop = true; At that point, you need to wire up some of the event handlers: ItemDrag DragOver DragEnter DragLeave DragDrop So if you had a listbox and wanted to list the files dropped, something like: private void listBox1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { foreach (string fileName in (string[])e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop) ) { listBox1.Items.Add( fileName ); } } To be the Drop Source , slightly more work and works best if you actually have a file-name to a real file (see the MSDN link), there is a complete series that describes all of the tricks Shell Style Drag and Drop in .NET which provides a complete library for you to use. Some sources: Drag and Drop Using C# Drag and Drop using C# - another one with the same title.
