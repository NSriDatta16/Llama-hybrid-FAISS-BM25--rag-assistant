EDIT : I am not sure the equations below work because for the components of principle component analysis to be uncorrelated, the data has to to be centred first: $$ y_t^i = \sum_j \Gamma_{ij} (x_t^j - \bar{x}^j) $$ which leads to vanishing averages: $$ \bar y^i = 0 \, . $$ /EDIT The following gives a detailed solution based on Aksakal's answer as a future reference (for me and maybe others). Let $y_t^i$ be the components of a principle component analysis with $$ y_t^i = \sum_j \Gamma_{ij} x_t^j \, , \qquad x_t^i = \sum_j \Gamma_{ij}^{-1} y_t^j = \sum_j \Gamma_{ji} y_t^j \, . $$ Then the time average $\bar{x}^i$ of the $i$th series is $$ \bar{x}^i = \frac{1}{n_t} \sum_t x_t^i = \frac{1}{n_t} \sum_t \sum_j \Gamma_{ji} y_t^j = \sum_j \Gamma_{ji} \bar{y}^j $$ and with that, the total average $\bar{\bar{x}}$ is given by $$ \bar{\bar{x}} = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_i \bar{x}^i = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_i \sum_j \Gamma_{ji} \bar{y}^j \,. $$ Since the $\bar{y}^k$ are not correlated by design, $$ \mathrm{Var}(\bar{\bar{x}})=\sum_k \left(\frac{\partial \bar{\bar{x}}}{\partial \bar{y}^k}\right)^2 \mathrm{Var}(\bar{y}^k) = \frac{1}{n_i^2}\sum_k \left(\sum_i\Gamma_{ki}\right)^2 \mathrm{Var}(\bar{y}^k) \, . $$ The $y_t^i$ are still auto-correlated in terms of $t$, thus, $\mathrm{Var}(\bar{y}^i)$ is calculated similarly to $\mathrm{Var}(\bar{x}^i)$ in the original question.
