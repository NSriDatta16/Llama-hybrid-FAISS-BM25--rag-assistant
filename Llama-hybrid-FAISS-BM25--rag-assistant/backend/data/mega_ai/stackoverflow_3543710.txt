List set index c#

I am using a List construct to handle the sequence in which images are drawn in "OnPaint". Now if my images are re-ordered (e.g. "brought to front" or "..to back"), I'd need to reposition them in my List. I have trouble doing so, because List doesn't support a method similar to setIndex() . So what I am trying to do is basically: private List activeImages = new List (); public void addActiveImage(BitmapWithProps image) { activeImages.Add(image); } public BitmapWithProps getActiveImage(int index) { return activeImages[index]; } public void removeActiveImage(int index) { activeImages.RemoveAt(index); } public void removeActiveImage(BitmapWithProps item) { activeImages.Remove(item); } public void swapActiveImageIndex(int sourceIndex, int destIndex) { // what would the code look like in here if I were to swap // the 2nd item (1) with the 4th one (3) in a 5-item-List (0 - 4) } I want to be able to swap an index.. sort of. I could "insert" a new item into the List at the index it should go to and assign the value and then delete the other "source". However it doesn't seem elegant in any way. I'd be glad for any hints and please excuse me if I overlooked a thread - I did search though, before asking. dS.
