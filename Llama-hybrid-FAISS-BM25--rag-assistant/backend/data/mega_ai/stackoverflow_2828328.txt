The Dizzy game is probably using a tile-based system. The game world is made up of a palette of tiles that are repeated throughout the level. Each tile would have three elements - the image drawn to the screen, the z-buffer to allow the main character to walk behind parts of the image and a collision map. The latter two would be implemented as monochrome images such that: colour | z map | collision -------|--------------------|--------------- black | draw dizzy infront | collide white | draw dizzy behind | don't collide Storing these are monochrome images save a lot of ram too. You would have an editor to build level that would display a grid where tiles can be dragged and dropped.
