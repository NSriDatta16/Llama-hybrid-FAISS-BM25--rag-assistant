Django - selecting distinct values from a ForeignKey

There's probably an obvious way to do this that I'm missing, so sorry for the noobish question. I've got models like this: class Speaker(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=50) class Talk(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=50) speaker = models.ForeignKey(Speaker) How can I elegantly get a list of all speakers who've given talks? At present I'm doing horrible things with getting the list of all Talks and looping through them, because I can't see an easy way of doing it using Django's ORM.
