Using ad spend (or any marketing instrument) in a model predicting unit sales is pretty standard. To your very good point, it is almost always endogenous, e.g., ad spend is frequently a percentage of sales revenue as in the A/S ratio. The statistical solutions are to create and model HAC residuals for the DV and then run the usual tests for endogeneity, e.g., Durbin-Wu-Hausman or simply correlate the model residuals with the predictors (Wooldridge's test). If the tests suggest that endogeneity is still a problem, then the next step would be to run a 2SLS to further control for it. That said, these solutions are far from perfect as endogeneity can be very difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate. Lots of references out there about it, e.g., Wooldridge's Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data or Hanssen and Parsen's Market Response Models: Econometric and Time Series Analysis .
