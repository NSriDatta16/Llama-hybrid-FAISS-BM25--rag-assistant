There is simpler and more elegant method. If the each of view the models you describe would take form $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k + \varepsilon $$ then just use dummy variables to encode the cities and define single regression model similar to the above, but with extra interaction terms with the dummies $d_i$ $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k + \beta_{k+1} d_1 + \beta_{k+2} d_1 X_1 + \beta_{k+3} d_1 X_2 + \dots + \beta_{2k+1} d_1 X_k + \dots +\beta_{(m+1)k+1} d_m X_k + \varepsilon $$ In such case, beyond the global terms, as in individual models, you would have intercepts $\beta_i d_j$ and coefficients $\beta_l d_j X_p$ for each of the cities. To test for the differences, just look at the significantly of each of the terms. Of course, depending on your problem, you may choose to define interaction terms only for some variables, if it makes more sense. Interpretation would be the same, as for any other regression model with dummy variables and interaction terms.
