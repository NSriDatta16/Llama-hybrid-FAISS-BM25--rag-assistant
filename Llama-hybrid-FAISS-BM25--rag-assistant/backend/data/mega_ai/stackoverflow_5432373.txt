Flex 4 spark - Best way to monitor change of a component's displaylist?

I'm working on a drag-drop solution, and acting when a item is dropped on the current target (let's say an "intelligent chess-board") is a breeze, as the board fires DragEvents when items are hovering over on dropped on the it. What I'm looking for is a way to make the board act when an item is dragged OFF the itself. Of course - when the item is dropped somewhere else, I could fire an event there and tell the board that change has been done. But this is what I want to avoid. I wonder if there is some way to monitor a change in the displaylist of the "board", so it fires an event when a child/element is removed from "outside"?
