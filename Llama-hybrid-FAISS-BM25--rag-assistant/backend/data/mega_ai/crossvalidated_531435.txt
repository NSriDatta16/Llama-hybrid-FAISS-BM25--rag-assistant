According to the gambler's fallacy shouldn't it be expected the same probability for the scoring and not necessarily more likely close to 50? No. You trapped in Gambler's fallacy . Assuming large enough number of question asked in the second time, the ratio of their success will still remain the same for high scorers from the first test. Your expectation that second test's average would be as high as their previous test for high scorers from the first test, sequence of random events, is a Gambler's fallacy itself. Because you expected that the difference between frequent events should balanced out, so that that second test should averaged high too. Meaning, "if they average 80 in the previous test, they should average close to 80 in the second test" is a gambler's fallacy itself. There is no law of averages but regression to the mean is there. For example, in coin-toss, the difference between number of head and tails will increase over time, not balanced out, that's the fallacy.
