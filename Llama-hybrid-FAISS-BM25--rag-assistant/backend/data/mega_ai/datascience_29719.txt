How to set batch_size, steps_per epoch, and validation steps?

I am starting to learn CNNs using Keras. I am using the theano backend. I don't understand how to set values to: batch_size steps_per_epoch validation_steps What should be the value set to batch_size , steps_per_epoch , and validation_steps , if I have 240,000 samples in the training set and 80,000 in the test set?
