Another option would be to compute a logistic regression using fail (or pass) as the dependent variable and day as the independent (covariate) variable. Computing a logistic regression will give you a coefficient $B=-0.149$ , $p=0.009$ (I used SPSS 25.0). Since $e^B=0.862$ , it means that, on average, each day that passes will have a lower odds of failing, with a daily decrease of around $13.8\% = 100\% \times (1 - 0.862)$ . So, on day $d$ , the odds will be smaller than the odds of the previous day, and be given approximately by $odds_d = 0.862 \times odds_{d-1}$ . It might be interesting to also look at a related question What does “linear-by-linear association” in SPSS mean? Using the linear-by-linear association also results in $p=0.009$ .
