i usually use save for web mode that exists in photoshop. obviously the lower size is best. The sizes that you talking about (100-150) are good or not in relation to the dimension of the image. Anyway i advice you to use sprites and when possible in jpeg format. something like 75-80% quality are good enought to a good quality of image And please pay attention to the cmyk mode, that cause problems in some browsers
