You're correct that logistic regression is only for binary response data, which is not applicable here. What you may be wanting to do is simply apply the logit transform to the response data (i.e. the $Y$ values) and then use linear regression on the transformed data. Then apply the inverse logit transform to predictions to put them back on the original scale. However, if you are trying to forecast a time series, simple linear regression may not be the best approach. It may be better to fit a time series model to the data (after applying the logit transform to the response) and use that as a basis for prediction.
