Java GUI Crash happens over VNC!

I have a Java GUI based Application. When I run it on Windows it works fine. But when I am in vnc session to a Linux Box without X11 graphics enabled. Out of 20 runs of the software on an average 1 run fails to bring up the GUI in two different ways, The GUI shrinks to a small square . The GUI doesn't appear at all.
