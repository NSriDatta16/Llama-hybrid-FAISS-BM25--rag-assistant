Just a suggestion, you might consider using this little library: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/Univar.aspx It has a server side implementation of the cookie whereby all cookies can be stored on the server while asp.net authentification is used to identify the user. It supports encryption and is also very flexible making it very easy to switch from one storage type to another.
