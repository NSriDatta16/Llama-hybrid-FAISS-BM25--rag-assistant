Are neural networks better than SVMs?

For some time now I have been studying both support vector machines and neural networks and I understand the logic behind each of these techniques. Very briefly described: In a support vector machine, using the kernel-trick, you "send" the data into a higher dimensional space where it can be linearly separable. In a neural network you perform a series of linear combinations mixed with (usually) non linear activation functions across several layers. So far I have seen that neural networks tend to provide the best predictive results among machine learning alternatives. Of course, compared with other more classical tools like multivariate regression, they have some drawbacks, like providing little (if any) interpretability of the variables, while in regression the interpretability of the variables is immediate. My question is: Neural networks seem to provide better predictive results than support vector machines, and both provide the same amount of interpretability (which is none ). Is there any situation in which using a support vector machine would be better than using a neural network?
