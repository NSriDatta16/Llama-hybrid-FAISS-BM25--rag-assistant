I have personally used: Practical Neural Network Recipes in C++ http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Neural-Network-Recipes-C/dp/0124790402/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b/179-4083507-8029219 The author in my opinion does not fully utilize the more powerful functionality of C++, in many cases it reads more like traditional C with classes. The book is also a little dated by now. HOWEVER - if you need explanations of the algorithms and techniques used in neural networks, explained in a way that an intelligent layperson could understand, so that you can go away and try these things for yourself, then I would certainly give this book a try. Not much navel-gazing goes on here, which is what I liked. It takes you through all the main things needed to program a neural network - how to compare the actual output with the desired in order to obtain an error signal, and then use this error signal in conjunction with back propagation algorithms to modify the network link connection strengths, doing this iteratively so that gradually the neural network 'learns' the task.
