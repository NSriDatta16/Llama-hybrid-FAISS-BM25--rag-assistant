You should put it in a separate file. That way it's easier to swap in a different implementation, or make the interfaces (the API of your system) available for others to code against without knowing the details of your implementation, or having to drag in related dependencies. e.g. implementations of common Java APIs - e.g. servlets - will have an implementation coded against the package of interfaces provided by Sun (in this case javax.servlet ) How can you use it from your implementation ? By importing it. This is unnecessary if it's in the same package and you're compiling all your interfaces/implementations at once. Note that an interface compiles down to a .class file in the same way as an implementation (what you define using class ).
