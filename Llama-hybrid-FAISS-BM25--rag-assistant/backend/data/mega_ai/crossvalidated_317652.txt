One perspective is estimation theory provides a unified view for estimation where as mean square error can be chosen as a loss function, a metric for describing a state. A maximum likelihood estimator is similar to the most probable Bayesian estimator given a uniform prior distribution on the parameters. A central concept in estimation theory is probability distributions of parameters (e.g. theta and x's) both prior and posteriori.
