Is it possible to get a covariance matrix of fitted values for a GLM model in R?

I would like to get a covariance matrix of fitted probabilities for a logistic regression model in R. I would like to do this because I want to find the variance of the difference between the two fitted probabilities ($\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$). Here is my attempt: x This gives me the standard errors of the fitted probabilities but not the covariance. I am aware of the delta method to find the distribution of a function of a normal distribution but I would really like to avoid using the delta method if possible because my actual code needs to be extremely flexible. It'll be difficult to implement the delta method properly in my actual situation.
