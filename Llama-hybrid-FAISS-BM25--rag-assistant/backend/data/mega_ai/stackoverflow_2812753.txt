Jquery draggable persistence either through mysql or saving cookie in the database?

I want to know that how can I persist the divs dropped on a draggable. I have been trying since long but stuck at this point. Actually you can see the demo here. I have to save the user designed wedding floor. So whenever user logins next time he/ she is able to see the last design saved. The code is shown below: $(document).ready(function() { $("#droppable").droppable({ accept: '.draggable', drop: function(event, ui) { $(this).append($(ui.draggable).clone()); $("#droppable .draggable").addClass("objects"); $(".objects").removeClass("ui-draggable draggable"); $(".objects").draggable({ containment: 'parent', }); } }); $(".draggable").draggable({ helper: 'clone', tolerance: 'touch', cursor:'move' }); });
