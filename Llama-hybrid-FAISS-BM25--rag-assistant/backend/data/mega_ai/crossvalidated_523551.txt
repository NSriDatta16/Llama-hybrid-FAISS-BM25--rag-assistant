Logistic regression models the log odds as linear $$ \log\left( \dfrac{p}{1-p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \cdots $$ The coefficients you see are the $\beta$ in the model above. If you do the algebra, a one unit increase in the predictor leads to the following change in the log odds $$ \log\left( \dfrac{p(x_1+1)}{1-p(x_1+1)} \right) - \log\left( \dfrac{p(x_1)}{1-p(x_1)} \right) = \log\left( \dfrac{p(x_1+1) (1-p(x_1))}{p(x_1)(1-p(x_1+1))} \right) = \beta_1 $$ So the coefficients describe the log odds ratio ; how much the log odds change when the predictor changes by one unit. If we exponentiation the coefficient, we get the odds ratio. The interpretation is how much the odds change (on a multiplicative scale) when we increase the predictor by a single unit. It isn't as easy to make inferences about how the coefficient changes the probability because changes to the odds depend on the baseline risk. If you want to know how changing the EXT changes the probability, you will need to compute the risk for a reference case under each EXT measure.
