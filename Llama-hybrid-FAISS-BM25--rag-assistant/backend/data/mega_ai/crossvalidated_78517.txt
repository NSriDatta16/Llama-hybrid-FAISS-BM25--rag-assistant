How to correctly assess the correlation between ordinal and a continuous variable?

I'd like to estimate the correlation between: An ordinal variable: subjects are asked to rate their preference for 6 types of fruit on a 1-5 scale (ranging from very disgusting to very tasty) On average subjects use only 3 points of the scale. A continuous variable: the same subjects are asked to quickly identify these fruits, which results in an mean accuracy for the 6 fruits. Is Spearman rho the best method to analyze these data and/or are there other good methods I could consider?
