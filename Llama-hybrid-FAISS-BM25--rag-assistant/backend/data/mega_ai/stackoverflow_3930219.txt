For general Ruby workings, look at the Pickaxe book ( The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide ). For reference about Ruby objects and functions: http://ruby-doc.org/ For the precise questions, you may want to take a look at a list of predefined variables . $: is the load path, an array containing directories where libraries are searched for. It's a less readable version of $LOAD_PATH . For arguments to the interpreter, you may want to look at the Unix manpage for Ruby (use ' man ruby ', or look at http://linux.die.net/man/1/ruby if you don't have a Unix system in handy). Specifically: -c checks the syntax of the script without running it. -e takes a string that is used as the script, instead of reading the script from a file.
