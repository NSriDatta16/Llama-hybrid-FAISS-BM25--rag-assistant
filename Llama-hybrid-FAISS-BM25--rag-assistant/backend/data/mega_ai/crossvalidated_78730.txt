Markov chain separation element and message

From Bishop's book I know an observed variable in a Markov Chain does work as d-separation element. What I am more uncertain about is what happens to the message itself. In the sum-product algorithm, instead of summing over that specific variable, I just use the observed value for the potential function multiplied by the incoming message, but how does this make what is after independent with what is before? Won't the input message still be the summation on the previous variable of the potential function multiplied by its incoming message? $$\circ_{x_1} - \circ_{x_2} - \bullet_{x_3} - \circ_{x_4} - \bullet_{x_5}$$ and I'd like to proof that $$x_2 \perp x_5 \mid x_3.$$ I can write $$p(x_2)=\frac{1}{Z}\mu_\alpha(x_2)\mu_\beta(x_2),$$ where $$\mu_\alpha (x_2)=\sum_{x_1}\psi_{1,2}(x_1,x_2)$$ and $$\mu_\beta (x_2)=\psi_{2,3}(x_2,\hat{x}_3)\mu_\beta(\hat{x}_3).$$ The demonstration ends by saying that the only contribution of $x_5$ would be about the normalisation constant $Z$. Why? Won't that $\mu_\beta(\hat{x}_3)$ be computed using $x_4$ and $x_5$ recursively? I'm missing something... :/ I don't see how the observation is "separating" anything. I try to explain my self more clearer. Let's say $x_3$ is unobserved, so that: $$\circ_{x_1} - \circ_{x_2} - \circ_{x_3} - \circ_{x_4} - \bullet_{x_5}$$ Let's then evaluate $\mu_\beta(x_2)$: $$\mu_\beta(x_2) = \sum_{x_3}\psi_{2,3}(x_2,x_3)\mu_\beta(x_3),$$ $$\mu_\beta(x_3) = \sum_{x_4}\psi_{3,4}(x_3,x_4)\mu_\beta(x_4),$$ $$\mu_\beta(x_4) = \psi_{4,5}(x_4,\hat{x}_5)\mu_\beta(\hat{x}_5),$$ $$\mu_\beta(\hat{x}_5) = 1.$$ This means that $$\mu_\beta(x_4) = \mu_\beta(x_4,\hat{x}_5)$$ and $$\mu_\beta(x_3) = \mu_\beta(x_3,\hat{x}_5),$$ hence $$\mu_\beta(x_2) = \mu_\beta(x_2,\hat{x}_5),$$ which tells me $x_2$ is dependent of $x_5$. Now, if $x_3 = \hat{x}_3$, I will have that $$\mu_\beta(x_2) = \mu_\beta(x_2,\hat{x}_3,\hat{x}_5)$$ so, to me, it still looks as dependent of $x_5$... Please help.
