Linear probability model: Why do lm() and glm() not give the same results in R?

I know about the disadvantages of linear probability models. However, while trying to understand glms I've stumbled over this: When I estimate a linear probability model using the base lm() command, I receive different estimates than if I use the glm() command with family = binomial(link = "identity") . Here is an example: a According to "An introduction to categorical data analysis" by Agresti, a linear probability model is a generalized linear model with binomial random component and identity link function. I do realise that R does not specify binomial(link = "identity") as a family object for models. However, it does not give an error or warning message when I use it. So I have two questions: What does R do differently when it uses glm and not lm for estimating the linear probability model? Which of the two commands ( glm or lm ) should be used when estimating a linear probability model? I know that the pragmatic answer to this question would be: "Why do you care about linear probability models?". However, I would like to understand the difference between the two commands for pedagogical reasons.
