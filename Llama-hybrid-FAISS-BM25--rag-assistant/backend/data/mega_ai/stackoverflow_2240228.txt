How to display pretty fractions in Crystal Reports generated PDF

I'm exporting a report to PDF using Crystal Reports bundled with VS2008. I need to display non-standard fractions so that they look nice instead of just something like 26/32. I have turned html interpretation on for the field so &frac12; and other standard html fraction entities display nicely, however, because CR does not understand and tags I cannot format non-standard fractions to look pretty. Anyone have any ideas? ** edit ** The fractions I'm displaying are passed to the Crystal Report as a string via a dataset in the format "xx/yy" or "xx yy/zz" and represent a product dimension. After thinking about it some more I could probably pass the numerator and the denominator as separate fields and format them in the report that way, but I'm hoping there's a more elegant way.
