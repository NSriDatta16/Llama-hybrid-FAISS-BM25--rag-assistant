In the case of string storage (with "potentially" XML safe encoding) your could gain even more efficiency with ASCII 85 as it is a 5/4 bloat instead of 4/3 for base64. But it is even harder to "read" then base64. And not many applications support it so often you have to write your own classes/functions to do the encoding and decoding.
