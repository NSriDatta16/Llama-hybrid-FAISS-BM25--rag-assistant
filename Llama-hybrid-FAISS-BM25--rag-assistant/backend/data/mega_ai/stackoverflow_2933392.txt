Email notifications of exceptions happening in a Python app?

UPDATE: This is a Django web app Hi folks, I want to set up email notifications when there is an error happening in my application. In ruby, there is a very elegant solution called ExceptionNotifier, which wraps around the exception handler and uses the built-in mailer to send an email. What is the best way of doing this in Python? I know that this is a very common issue, so would love for any tips that you folks can share! PS: Code samples, pointers to modules would be AWESOME! Thanks!
