As @Julian Drago wrote it does not seem that you are having overfitting. To have a better glance you can plot your predicted values against your measured values and color your points according to the subset they belong to (train and validation). If the model is overfit the training point would be much closer to the 45 degrees line. I attach an example from one of my projects, here the model is not overfit. what it is indicated as test is corresponding to your validation set
