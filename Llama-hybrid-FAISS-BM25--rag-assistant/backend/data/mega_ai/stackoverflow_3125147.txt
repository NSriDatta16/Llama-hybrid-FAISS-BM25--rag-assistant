In Chrome and Firefox, you have to cancel the ondragover event for the ondrag event to fire. I would also recommend canceling the ondragenter and ondragleave events just to be sure. http://jsbin.com/itugu/2 ContentEditable This is editable content This is not editable content This behavior isn't a bug; in the HTML5 specification it says that ondragover must be canceled for ondrag to fire. It doesn't make any sense to do it this way, so I hope they change it soon. See http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html
