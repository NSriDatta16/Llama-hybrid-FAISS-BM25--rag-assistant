I nearly always use the built-in aliases, such as int/short/long. They are easier to read, and do not require you to import System or to type System.Int32 everywhere, etc. The language clearly defines them, and gives them a specific meaning, so I do not see any harm. However, this is 100% a personal choice. That being said - the one place where I do explicitly use Int32, Int16, etc., is if I'm dealing with binary storage or transfer, especially to or from a custom binary format. In this case, having the explicit bitsize of each member going into and out of the file makes the code more readable and understandable, IMO.
