Boruta Algorithm for Logistic Regression?

Is it okay to use a Boruta algorithm to select features for a logistic regression? I read several sources, including the source package as well as this site explaining what Boruta does. My understanding is that it basically takes existing variables, creates a new 'shadow' column with those variables shuffled in a random order, and then performs a random forest and calculates the variable importance of a Random Forest. Variables that are below the best 'shadow' variable are considered bad, and variables that are relatively close in score to the best 'shadow' variable are considered tentative. It does this many times to get the overall selected features. I'm wondering if such a method would be okay to use for a logistic regression. Thanks!
