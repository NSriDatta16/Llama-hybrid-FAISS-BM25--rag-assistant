We used Tall Components TallPdf to create the PDF and have found that it matches extremely well. To get a close match using the TallPDF component we had to: Play with the MultilineTextShape.LineSpacing to get a match between the WPF textblock and the PDF Use the specific system font files for bold, italics, etc. (such as timesbd.ttf) instead of the Fragment.Bold (or Italics, etc.) properties of the Fragments. Make sure the font size are in points (the WPF Textblock had font sizes in pixels, the same goes for the width or the textblock too). After accounting for these items, the PDF textblock matched the WPF Textblock exactly.
