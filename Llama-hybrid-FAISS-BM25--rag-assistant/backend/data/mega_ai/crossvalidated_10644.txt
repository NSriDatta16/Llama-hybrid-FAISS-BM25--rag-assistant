Using kurtosis to assess significance of components from independent component analysis

In PCA eigenvalues determine the order of components. In ICA I am using kurtosis to obtain the ordering. What are some accepted methods to assess the number, (given I have the order) of components that are singificant apart from prior knowledge about the signal?
