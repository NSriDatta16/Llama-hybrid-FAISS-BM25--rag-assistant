The effect size of difference

I have this interesting data where I would like to estimate possibly a parameter of the difference (between $A+B$ and $A+C$, inference using both) that would allow me to infer the development of $A$ (whether there is a propensity to decrease or increase). Any hint as to how to approach it included type of modeling/estimation procedure? Here is part of the data: The data itself is a rate of observing number of species in days. These have been calculated in R based on this formula for $A$: A = obs / mean(obs.window) The values of $B$ and $C$ in R are based on the formulas: B = obs / min(obs.window) and C = obs / max(obs.window) where obs is a observed number of species per day and obs.window is a average value of a sliding window of $10$ days (moving average). x And here some adjustment: data EDIT: I'm interested in estimation of the relationship of the interval and its overall with A as an idicator. However, I was thinking using Beta distribution and simulation on rolling window of 20 days , would this be anyhing meaningful? windw
