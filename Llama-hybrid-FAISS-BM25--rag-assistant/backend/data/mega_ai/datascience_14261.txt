CNN tagging such that each input could have multiple tags

Thanks in advance for reading my question! I've been using CNNs to classify text using Keras and TF. My data is strings "I read the news" or "I read machine learning news" and my labels are tags: Data Science, Reporter, Child... My issues is that each text can have multiple labels attached to it. How should I construct my target such that I can capture each of those multiple outputs? Description, Tag "I read the news", Child "I read the news", Reporter "I read machine learning news", Data Science "I read machine learning news", Reporter
