conditional display for multiple fields - JSF 2.0 / Primefaces

What is the best strategy for conditionally displaying multiple elements (for example a list of fields that depends on a bean value)? Possible solutions I thought of: JSTL clause. From what I understand using JSTL with JSF is discouraged Using the "rendered" attribute of most components. Unfortunately when I have to deal with a lot of fields it becomes clumsy to set them on each one... Putting the elements on a container and setting the rendered attribute on the container Option 3 seems the most sensible but I don't know what component to use to wrap those fields. It needs to be a component that doesn't affect the layout... I could use a span as a wrapper and set a CSS visible property, but the fields will still be rendered, just invisible. Any thoughts? Update: Here's some actual layout code. I've tried both & . Using any of those tags will put all my fields in a single , which I admit, it makes sense because I'm putting a single top level element in my panelGrid . The only thing that works the way I want is #2 from the list above.
