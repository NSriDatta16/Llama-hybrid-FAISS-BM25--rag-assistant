An individual should be able to take a leadership role and be able to talk with strangers, to be a good candidate for a veterinary technician career. Those who want to become veterinary technicians must have good communication skills and have the ability to work well with others. They must also be well-organized and be able to pay attention to detail. They must be of above average intelligence and have a good understanding of math and science. It is necessary that a veterinary technician be dependable since an animal’s life may rest in their hands when treatments must be delivered in a timely manner. A veterinary technician’s job can be very demanding. He or she must be able to spend hours on their feet and have the ability to lift and restrain animals. Unfortunately, being bitten is part of the job. It does not occur often, but a veterinary technician must realize that it is a real possibility. Due to the possibility of emergency situations, a veterinary technician must be able to handle stress well. From the results of the self test, you have many of the characteristics needed to work in this field, but you may need to do some more research before you go any further.
