The C++ FAQ calls this problem DBDI , Dynamic Binding During Construction . Mainly, the problem is to avoid the Evil two-phase construction advocated in other answers here. It's sort of "my" FAQ item -- I convinced Marshall to add it. However, Marshall's take it on it is very general (which is good for a FAQ), while I was more concerned with the particular design/coding pattern. So, instead of sending you to the FAQ I send you to my own blog, the article "How to avoid post-construction by using Parts Factories" , which links to the relevant FAQ item, but discusses in depth the pattern. You can just skip the first two paragraphs... I sort of rambled there. :-) Cheers & hth.,
