Displaying an Image in an activity using URI

I'm writing an application that uses Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE) to capture and image. On the process of capturing the image, I noted the output of the image's URI. Right after finishing the camera activity, I wish to display the image using this specific URI. The method I used to capture images is: private void saveFullImage() { Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "test.jpg"); outputFileUri = Uri.fromFile(file); intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, outputFileUri); startActivityForResult(intent, TAKE_PICTURE); } Which is a method taken from Reto Meier's book Professional Android 2 Application Development. The method works fine, and I assume that the URI of the picture I just took is stored in the outputFileUri variable. Then at this point of the code is where I want to display the picture: @Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) { if (requestCode == TAKE_PICTURE) { //I want to display the picture I just took here //using the URI } } I'm not sure how to do it. I tried creating a new layout object and a new ImageView object using the method setImageURI(outputFileUri). My main layout (xml) did not have a ImageView object. But even when I set the contentView to the new layout with the ImageView attached to it, it doesn't display anything. I tried creating a Bitmap object from the URI and set it to the ImageView, but I get an unexpected error and forced exit. I have seen examples from here here which creates a Bitmap from URI, but it's not displaying it? My question is just how to display an image in the middle of a running activity? Do I need to get the File Path (like this ) in order to display it? If I make a Bitmap out of the URI, how do I display the Bitmap? I'm just probably missing something simple...so any help would be a greatly appreciated! Also additional question for thought: If I were to take multiple pictures, would you recommend me to use the SimpleCursorAdapter instead? Thanks!
