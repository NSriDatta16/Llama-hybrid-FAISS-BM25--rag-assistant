Sounds like you should be using logistic regression. Then you model $log(\frac{\pi(x)}{1-\pi(x)}) = \beta_0 +\beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2$ where $\pi(x)$ is the probability of wanting to legalize pot, $X_1$ is sex (dummy coded, for instance) and $X_2$ is SES. The only problem is dealing with the ordinality of $X_2$; I do not know of ways to do that. But regular logistic regression can be done in any statistics package. Which one are you using?
