To add my own brick to the wall. Each header needs to be self-sufficient, which can only be tested if it's included first at least once One should not mistakenly modify the meaning of a third-party header by introducing symbols (macro, types, etc.) So I usually go like this: // myproject/src/example.cpp #include "myproject/example.h" #include #include #include #include #include #include "myproject/another.h" #include "myproject/specific/bla.h" #include "detail/impl.h" Each group separated by a blank line from the next one: Header corresponding to this cpp file first (sanity check) System headers Third-party headers, organized by dependency order Project headers Project private headers Also note that, apart from system headers, each file is in a folder with the name of its namespace, just because it's easier to track them down this way.
