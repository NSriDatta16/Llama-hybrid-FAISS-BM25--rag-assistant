One of the books I have seen this explained in details is Pagano's Principles of Biostatistics, in the chapter of "Simple Linear Regression." The standard error of that particular predicted y, given a certain value for x, is: $$\hat{se}(\hat{y}) = s_{y|x}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(x - \bar{x})^2}{\Sigma^n_{i=1}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$
