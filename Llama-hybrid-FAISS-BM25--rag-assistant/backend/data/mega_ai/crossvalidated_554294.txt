I think both terms in the context you give refer to the same bias in assignment mechanism of groups in potential outcome framework. For example, if you use observational dataset to analyze effectiveness of aspirin in treating headaches: people who decide to take aspirin suffer overall more severe headaches and perhaps chronical, and still feel the headaches after taking the treatment people who do not take aspirin may recover since their headaches are light Since people make their own decision to take treatment, this assignment mechanism creates difference in covariates among the two groups, and you may have a significant bias on the average treatment effect estimate from this observational dataset. You can call this bias a selection bias as only severe patients are selected for treatment in the natural setting. You can also call this a composition bias since the distribution of covariates of the treatment group significantly differ from that of the control group. But it all boils down to bias in assignment mechanism of the groups. Interesting reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model#The_perfect_doctor
