Deep Learning Book - deriving sigmoid units for Bernoulli output

In the paragraph before equation 6.20, the book says: "...If we begin with the assumption that the unnormalized log probabilities are linear in $y$ and $z$, we can exponentiate to obtain the unnormalized probabilities..." With this assumption, we proceed to equation 6.20, and onwards to derive the sigmoid output unit. My question is, why is assumption reasonable? The book seem to provide no justification.
