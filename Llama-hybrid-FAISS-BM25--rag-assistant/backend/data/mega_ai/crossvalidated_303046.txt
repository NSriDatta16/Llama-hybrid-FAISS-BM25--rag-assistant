Regression with nonlinear function (almost logistic)

I'm doing a nonlinear regression that involves $y=A+B\cdot \text{erf}(\frac{C-x}{\sqrt{2}w})$ . Parameters $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ (the one I really care about), all need to be estimated and $x$ is a vector of around 20 elements (samples). Now, erf is pretty similar to sigmoid (the usual logistic function that people seem to use as a basis). I'm not too familiar with logistic regression, so I'll ask a really open-ended question: do any logistic regression experts see any method or advantage to framing this more as a logistic type regression? I imagine the best thing to do is to stick with least-squares cost function and an L2 (i.e. ridge, tikhonov, etc.) regularizer, my planned course, but don't want to discount the similarity to a whole other field.
