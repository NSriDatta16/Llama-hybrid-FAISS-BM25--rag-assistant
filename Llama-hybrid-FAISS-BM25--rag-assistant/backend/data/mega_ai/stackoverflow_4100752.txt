Whats the best tool to build a visual workflow manager

Wondering if anyone had any ideas on the best tool to build a visual workflow manager. Envisioning a bunch of 'blocks' that can be dropped and then connected together in order to build workflow, IE: Send email -> wait 4 days -> if email answered send this email > if not log to db each action would be a block with properties associated with it. The user would be able to drag the blocks around and connect them. I want to keep it uber simple. Cross modern browser compat is important but we can ask that clients install software if necessary (silverlight). Some ideas that pop into mind jQuery silverlight SproutCore
