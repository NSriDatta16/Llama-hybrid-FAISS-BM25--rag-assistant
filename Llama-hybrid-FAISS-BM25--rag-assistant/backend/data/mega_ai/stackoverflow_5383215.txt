I use Yaam (Yet Another Android Market) in addition to the official Android Market. It allow me to do thing that cannot be possible with the official solution, like discount or special offer to a particular person, but it doesn't bring me a lot of new customers. Also a 3rd party market owner can change the sells condition when he want, it can be a little frustrating. This is also true for Google but they pay more attention on their customers.
