Magento not saving variables or custom blocks in CMS page

I'm trying to add {{block type=”core/template” template=”page/home.phtml”}} Into a CMS page but it's not saving the code when I go back into the page the code has gone, it also happens when picking a defualt variable Any help? Actually if it's any help, it's something to do with my local install - seems to be fine on live. - Strange
