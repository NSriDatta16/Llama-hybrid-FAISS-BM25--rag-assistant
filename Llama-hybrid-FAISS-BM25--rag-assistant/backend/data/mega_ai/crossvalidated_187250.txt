Simulating a time series including a shock

I want to simulate a time series in R, following an ARMA(1,0) model in the form $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$, shocking it at time 20. In a few words, I therefore have to input $\epsilon_{20} = 30$ (the shock magnitude). Now, I am using the arima.sim function as it is the one I'm familiar with for simulating a time series, but I am not sure on how to implement a shock into it. Let's start with a standard simulation, based on 250 observations: shocksim How can I input the shock in such a simulation?
