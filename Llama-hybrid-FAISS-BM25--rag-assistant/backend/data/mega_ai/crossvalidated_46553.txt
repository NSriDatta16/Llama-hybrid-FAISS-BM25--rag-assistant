Assumptions for Hurst exponent calculation

Are there any general assumptions for the calculation of the Hurst exponent ? Does the signal need to be stationary, for example? Does it depend on the method? What about the length of the time series, is longer better? I am interested in using implementing it for the analysis of an EEG signal. I have read many articles but can't find answers for these questions.
