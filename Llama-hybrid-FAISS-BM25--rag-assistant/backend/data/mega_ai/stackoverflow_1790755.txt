SQL Server 2008 Auto Backup

We want to have our test servers databases updated from our production server databases on a nightly basis to ensure we're developing on the most recent data. We, however, want to ensure that any fn, sp, etc that we're currently working on in the development environment doesn't get overwritten by the backup process. What we were thinking of doing was having a prebackup program that saves objects selected by our developers and a postbackup program to add them back in after the backup process is complete. I was wondering what other developers have been doing in a situation like this. Is there an existing tool to do this for us that can run automatically on a daily basis and allow us to set objects not to overwrite (without requiring the attention of a sysadmin to run it daily).
