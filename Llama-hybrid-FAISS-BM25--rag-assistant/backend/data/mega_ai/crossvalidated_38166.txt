The Moore-Aronszajn theorem guarantees that a symmetric positive definite kernel is associated to a unique reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (Note that while the RKHS is unique, the mapping itself is not.) Therefore, your question can be answered by exhibiting an infinite-dimensional RKHS corresponding to the Gaussian kernel (or RBF). You can find an in-depth study of this in " An explicit description of the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Gaussian RBF kernels ", Steinwart et al.
