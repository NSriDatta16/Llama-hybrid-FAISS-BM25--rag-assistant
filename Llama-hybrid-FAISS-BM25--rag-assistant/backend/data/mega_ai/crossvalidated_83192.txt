Longitudinal k-means sample data

Having finished the Coursera's Machine Learning course, I would like to put the theories into practice. Thanks in advance on guiding a newbie! In particular, I am looking forward to some guidance how to: Some sample longitudinal data that would illustrate k-means grouping how to include time dimension into the analysis? Say if I collected 10 days worth of data, capturing long/lat every 5 minutes, I would expect at hour x every day there is a pattern.
