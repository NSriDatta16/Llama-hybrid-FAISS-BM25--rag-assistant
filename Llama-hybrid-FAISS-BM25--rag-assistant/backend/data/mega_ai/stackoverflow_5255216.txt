I'm not sure how you would write a split that knew which commas to split on there, honestly. Unless it's a fixed number each time in which case, just use the String.Split overload that takes an int specifying how many substrings to return at max If you're going to have comma-delimited data that's not always a fixed number of items and it could have literal commas in the data itself, they really should be quoted. If you can control the input in any way, you should encourage that, and use an actual CSV parser instead of String.Split
