Using Pragma-s of SQLite in C#

I posted a question: "My Projects has c++ dll in which a db is created in Sqllite with share deny = none. This dll will insert data into Db and I have a c# exe which must access the db and display it. Display needs to be done asynchronously. So is there any way while launching connection to sqlitedb I can lock the table or db. If possible, can anyone give me links or a sample of how it can be done? " For this, I got a reply to use Pragma -s. Can anyone tell me how to implement PRagma-s of SQLlite in C#?
