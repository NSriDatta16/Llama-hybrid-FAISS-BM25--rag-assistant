t-test on regression slopes using python

As an exercise, I am calculating an OLS regression on time series data. I would like to compare the slope from the regression (trend) to a value I specify. For example, if I take a time series of temperature, I would like to compare the trend of this data, to say the global average temperature trend. I am a bit new to stats, so sorry if these answers are obvious. I currently am estimating the regression with the 'statsmodels' package, I am not sure how to use statsmodels or scipy.stats to do this calculation. Below is what I have so far, but I believe this assumes a null of zero. model = sm.OLS(np.arange(0,len(temp.index)),np.asarray(temp.values)) results = model.fit() slope = results.params[0] p_value = stats.t.sf(results.tvalues[0], results.df_resid) Thanks!
