Code coverage is a metric, showing how "well" the source code is tested. There are several types of code coverage: line coverage, function coverage, branch coverage. In order to measure the coverage, you shall run the application either manually or by automated test. Tools can be divided in two categories: - the ones that run the compiled code in a modified environment (like the debugger), counting the required points (functions, lines, etc.); - the ones that require special compilation - in this case the resulting binary already contains the code which actually does the counting. There are several tools for measuring and visualizing the result, they depend from platform, from source code's language. Please read article on Wikipedia To provide you tools, please define for which OS and language do you use.
