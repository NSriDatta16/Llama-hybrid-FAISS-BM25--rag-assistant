Well, Google is really my friend, after a long search, i found this script from Ericson Labs (?!) https://labs.ericsson.com/apis/eventsource/ From their page : The EventSource enabler allows you to use the upcoming Event Source API in any current web browser. Simply include the enabler library in your page, and you are able to use the API. When user agents implement the Event Source API themselves, your application will immediately and transparently start using the native implementation. However this solution requires an API key from Ericsson, and cannot be used for a commercial application, which is not the best solution for me :( So if you have a better approach..
