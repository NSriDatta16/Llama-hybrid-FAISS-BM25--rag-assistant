Online advertisement performance

I want to find a mathematically-based way to decide wether or not to pause a keyword belonging to an online advertisement campaign. A keyword might make a user click my ad which might lead to a sale. If, during the last 90 days, a keyword didn't generate any sale, I have to consider pausing it. In that case, I use the average performance of the campaign to make the decision: $P=\frac{N_{sales}}{N_{clicks}}$ Then, the question is: has the keyword performed far from the campaign (on average) because it's a bad choice (and should be paused) or because it's not been given enough time (not enough clicks, in consequence)? The method I thought of is as follows: Do a Chi-Squared test with some significance level (e.g. 5%) and find the needed number of clicks. $90$ $days \rightarrow 89$ $DOF$ $\chi^2_{critical} = 112.022$ ($@p=0.05; DOF=89$) On average, we expect the keyword to generate $\frac{N_{sales}}{90}$ sales each day. So: $\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{90}\frac{(0 - \frac{N_{sales}}{90})^2}{\frac{N_{sales}}{90}}=N_{sales}$ Which yields: $N_{sales}=P*N_{clicks} $N_{clicks} Now, is it correct to say that if we had a number of clicks as big as or bigger than $\frac{112.022}{P}$, the keyword is actually a bad choice and should be paused?
