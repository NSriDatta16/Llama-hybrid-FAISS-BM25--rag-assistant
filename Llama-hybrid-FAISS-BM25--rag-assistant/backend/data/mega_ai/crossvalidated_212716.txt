I hope this image will help you to understand the idea of local connectivity in CNN: . Neurons of the same color use the same kernel filter and share the same weights. And, neurons of different color corresponds to different feature maps. So, here we have local connectivity since one blue neuron is connected to only a small region of the image. (P.S. to produce a feature map, you need more than one blue neuron).
