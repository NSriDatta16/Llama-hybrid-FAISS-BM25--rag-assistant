Understanding p values in ordinal logistic regression in R

I'm trying to wrap my head around ordinal logistic regression outputs in R. I've seen some similar posts before and read many tutorials, but I feel like some things are missing. What I'm looking for is a complete non-math heavy breakdown of the output so any explanations with formulae please explain what the math means in laymans terms. Here is the code I use to get the output #install if not already installed and load package if (!require('ordinal')) install.packages('ordinal'); require('ordinal') if (!require('carData')) install.packages('carData'); require('carData') #load in the WVS dataset from carData data(WVS) #run the analysis propodds_coves_nwu=clm(poverty ~ age, data=WVS) summary(propodds_coves_nwu) The output is like this > propodds_coves_nwu=clm(poverty ~ age, data=WVS) > summary(propodds_coves_nwu) formula: poverty ~ age data: WVS link threshold nobs logLik AIC niter max.grad cond.H logit flexible 5381 -5332.58 10671.16 5(0) 2.52e-10 4.0e+04 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) age 0.013172 0.001522 8.656 My main question is how is the p value even calculated here and what does a significant p value mean in terms of hypotheses here? This data is taken from the World Values Survey. The outcome variable poverty is asking "Do you think that what the government is doing for people in poverty in this country is about the right amount, too much, or too little?" The estimate is positive but does that mean as age goes up every .013 units people are more likely to think the government is doing too much to reduce poverty? In addition what are these "threshold coefficients" referring to? Threshold coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Too Little|About Right 0.60346 0.07377 8.18 About Right|Too Much 2.33749 0.08094 28.88
