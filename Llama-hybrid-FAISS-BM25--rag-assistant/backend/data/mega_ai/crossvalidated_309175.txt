In terms of directly outputting prediction intervals, there's a 2011 paper ' Comprehensive Review of Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals ' They compare four approaches: 1: Delta method 2: Bayesian method 3: Mean variance estimation 4: Bootstrap The same authors went on to develop Lower Upper Bound Estimation Method for Construction of Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals which directly outputs a lower and upper bound from the NN. Unfortunately it does not work with backprop, but recent work made this possible, High-Quality Prediction Intervals for Deep Learning . Alternative to directly outputting prediction intervals, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) model uncertainty in a NN's parameters, and hence capture uncertainty at the output. This is hard to do, but popular methods include running MC dropout at prediction time, or ensembling .
