How to create predictive model in R when outcome variable has more than 10 classes?

I have a dataset for vehicles and trying to predict what will fail. Here is my data set vId, MileageSincePartLastReplaced, AgeOfPart, TypeOfVehicle, Failure x,100000,200days,Truck,Alt Belt y,200000,600days,PCar,Transmission Belt z,140000,230days,Van,Fan Belt Failure is outcome variable with 20 different types of failure categories. What I am looking for is given mileage driven and age of the part which one is likely to fail? I am unable to figure out which model/models I should be looking for? I was looking into multinomial regression & ordered logistic regression but was not sure. Any help around how to go about this and which package I could use? Note: I asked same question in Stack Overflow and was suggested to move to this forum.
