In my next rails project I'm going to need blogging functionality. I'm wondering whether anyone has any good suggestions, or should I just role my own? (Probably not in 15 minutes) I wouldn't recommend rolling your own blog system. You should look into using Radiant CMS with a blog extension. I think the most important feature will be to display code samples elegantly. For this I can recommend looking into SyntaxHighlighter .
