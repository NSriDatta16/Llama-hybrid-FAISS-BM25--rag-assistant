Yes, the Session ID gives someone access to the corresponding session. You could store the IP used during login in the session and when the IP changes require the user to login again. Additionally (not sure if that's done automatically though) you could do the same for the User Agent - not really increasing safety against malicious attacks though, just against dumb users giving away their sessionid accidentally if it's passed via GET and not a cookie.
