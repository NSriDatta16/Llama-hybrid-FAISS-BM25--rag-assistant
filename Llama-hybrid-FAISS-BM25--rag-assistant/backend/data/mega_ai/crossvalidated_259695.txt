A simple Monte Carlo approach could work. This method approximates the distribution using a finite set of samples, then computes the median based on the samples. Draw $n$ independent samples of $X$ and $Y$ from the joint distribution: $\{(x_1, y_1), ... (x_n, y_n)\}$. I'll explain how do do this below. This gives samples of $U$: $\{u_1, ..., u_n\}$, where $u_i = |x_i - y_i|$. Take the median of these samples. Accuracy will increase with $n$, which you could easily set in the thousands or millions. Your problem has special structure that makes it possible to sample $X$ and $Y$ directly from the joint distribution. $\log X$ and $\log Y$ have a bivariate normal distribution from which you can easily sample using a multivariate Gaussian random number generator (using the appropriate mean and covariance matrix). This blog post describes how to do this in R. Once you have samples of $\log X$ and $\log Y$, exponentiate these values to obtain samples of $X$ and $Y$. It's not always possible to sample directly from a given distribution, in which case methods like MCMC algorithms can be used. Luckily, this isn't necessary in your case.
