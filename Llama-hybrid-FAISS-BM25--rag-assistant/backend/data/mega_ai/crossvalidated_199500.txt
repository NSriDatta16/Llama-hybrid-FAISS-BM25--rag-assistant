handling missing input variable for machine learning

In building feature-sets for a machine learning algorithm, I'm facing a situation where the input variable - which is a numeric variable, may or may not appear. What I mean is, the data set I'm getting is very chaotic, and in many situations the input value may not be available. How to represent such a value? To give an example: Age Days Likes 45 5 3 33 6 0 Now, suppose I've a situation where Age is not available, but Days and other variables are available like this- Age Days Likes NotA 4 1 Here NotA is just saying Not Available. Now, if the machine learning algorithm handles only "numbers" (not categories/factors as in R), and if I cannot neglect such rows or instances as there are too many of rows where Age is not available, how do represent it in numbers? Could this be an option? AgeYes AgeNo Age Days Like 1 0 45 5 3 1 0 33 6 0 0 1 0 4 1 What other options I have? What would be best way to handle such data?
