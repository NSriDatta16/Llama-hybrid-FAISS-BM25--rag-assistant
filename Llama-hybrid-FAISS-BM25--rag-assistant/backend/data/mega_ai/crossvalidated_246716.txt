If metabolic syndrome is an ordered categorical variable with six levels (0, 1, ..., 5) then a model for ordinal logistic regression would be better than purely doing $\chi^2$ which is responsive to any deviation whereas you want to know if the patient group have higher odds of having a worse metabolic syndrome profile. You can then add sex into your model as a covariate. I have no idea whether you can do this in SPSS but I imagine an online search for SPSS ordinal logistic regression will turn up something.
