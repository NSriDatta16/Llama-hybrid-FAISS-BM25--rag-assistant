How to compare nonlinear regression vs piecewise linear regression?

We have time series of plant growth (length vs time) and we can reasonably model these with two approaches: With a nonlinear model length(time)=length0*exp(r*time) where length0 is lenght at initial time and r0 is a good initial guess for r (relative growth rate), like in Reference: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00155.x This approach uses length as a proxy for biomass and models the growth of the plant as a whole through time. length0 = 0.8532 r0 = 0.01 model1 With a piecewise linear model with the package 'segmented', where psi is a guess for the breakpoint. This approach assumes constant absolute growth rate per stage and two growth stages. library(segmented) model2 Plot: Red - nonlinear, Blue - piecewise linear Is it rigorous to select one of this two models with AIC (lower is better)? AIC(model1) AIC(model2) If not with AIC, how? The data of this example is: time
