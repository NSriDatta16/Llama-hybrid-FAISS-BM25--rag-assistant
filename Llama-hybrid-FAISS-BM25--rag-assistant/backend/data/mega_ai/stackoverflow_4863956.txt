Not knowing much about your application, you could also allow an Agent to "know" about a certain portion of your world (possibly defined as the maximum area within which movement can be executed, constrained by some rules you implement about how far the Agent can move in any one call to .Move). So the agent might contain a reference to a "Clip Region" of the greater world (this concept stolen from the "Clip Rectangle" used in .net GDI+ Graphics Object). In a more general sense, I agree with the others: it makes complete sense for the Move method to be defined on the Agent Class, and that it is acceptable for the agent Class to posses an awareness of it's surroundings. While OOP tends towards minimizing unecessary dependencies, when it makes sense, it makes sense. A person in the real world is aware of their surroundings, and is able to initiat the action required to move within those surroundings from one location to another.
