To select the most different rows, you would need to define first what you consider different. For ages and scores, subtracting values would work, for example: Row1 Age is 38 Score is 0.2 Row2 Age is 87 Score is 1.0 Difference by numeric feature: Age Diff is 49 Score Diff is 0.8 Those values could be normalized or weighted to account for different importances between features. For titles, youâ€™d probably need to use a text similarity metric, such as tf-idf with cosine similarity or embedding vector distance. The most different ones are the ones with higher score/age difference and lower title similarity.
