Does not using more filters in deeper CNN creates more images?

For example, we have applied 32 filters to a single image. Then it created 32 different images (stack of convolutional values). And in the second layer, if we apply 64 filters, are all these filters going to be applied on all those 32 images? If so, then it will create 64*32 numbers of output or I am understanding wrong? I have become confused because when I studied keras documentation, it says that using 64 filters it will create 64 outputs. If anybody enlights me on how the second or deeper layer works in CNN briefly it will be helpful for me.
