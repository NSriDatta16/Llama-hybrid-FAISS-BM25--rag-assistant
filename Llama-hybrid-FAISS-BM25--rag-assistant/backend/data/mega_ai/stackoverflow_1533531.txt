@Byron is right, return HTTP 404. You want to leverage all of the capabilities of HTTP, and these include response status codes. So if there is a client error, return a 4xx error code, and if your server code has an internal problem, return a 5xx error code, etc. Richardson and Ruby's RESTful Web Services (O'Reilly) has a good discussion of this, and an appendix with all the most important HTTP error codes and when to use them.
