MAE estimation for k-fold cross-validation

I have code that estimates RMSE for k-fold cross-validation and I think it is correct (from book: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron) scores = cross_val_score(forest_reg, a, b, scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", cv=10) print(pd.Series(np.sqrt(-scores)).describe()) So what about MAE? Should I use (with sqrt ): scores = cross_val_score(forest_reg, a, b, scoring="neg_mean_absolute_error", cv=10) print(pd.Series(np.sqrt(-scores)).describe()) or this (without sqrt ): scores = cross_val_score(forest_reg, a, b, scoring="neg_mean_absolute_error", cv=10) print(pd.Series(-scores).describe()) Also for MAE estimation, it should be -scores or scores ?
