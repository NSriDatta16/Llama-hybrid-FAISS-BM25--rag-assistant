To a Bayesian, does a trick coin with two heads have 50% chance of flipping heads if they don't know that it has two heads?

And to expand on this idea, would uncertainty and complexity be the same thing to a Bayesian? For example, games with much randomness like poker and games that are more complexity based like chess -- would we treat what makes them "interesting" (I know there are other interesting aspects to these games) as the same sort of thing?
