Discarding Observations during time series analysis

I'm studying Economics and we use SAS as our programming software. What I did notice is that with the AR and MA process we usually work with 250 observations. What confuses me though is the lecturer always discards the first 50 observation when he wants to simulate an time series process. He said he does it to limit the influence of the starting values of the series. My question is why the first 50 observations would influence the data and why we would want to discard them to make our analysis more accurate.
