Pacf lag axe , is not an integer

I'm trying to use ARIMA process to predict the behaviour of a time series, the probleme I face is that I can't get the order of each component of ARIMA, the lag is between 0 and 1, same goes for the acf. The time series has no tendency, and I guess no seasonality. My question is : Does this mean that ARIMA orders are all 0s, and if so, is the HoltWinters a good (or the best) solution for modelling this kind of TS ?
