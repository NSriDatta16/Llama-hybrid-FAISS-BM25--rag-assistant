If you want to make an inference on an order where a categorical variable was not seen in the training data, you could train the model on a hash bucket representation of that variable. If using tensorflow, you can leverage: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_hash_bucket Or implement yourself.
