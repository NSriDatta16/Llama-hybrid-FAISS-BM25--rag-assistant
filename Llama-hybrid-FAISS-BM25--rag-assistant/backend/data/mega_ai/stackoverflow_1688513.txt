HttpCachePolicy and SSL

I have an application that allows the user to download a csv. This works great when not using SSL. However, when using a secure connection I get the "Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet Site". I know that the problem has to do with my HttpCaching policy. The following MS Support document explains the issue: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316431 However, I cannot seem to get it to work. Any ideas? HttpCachePolicy cachePolicy = Response.Cache; cachePolicy.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private); cachePolicy.SetNoStore(); cachePolicy.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(0L)); cachePolicy.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches); I have tried a combination of different HttpCacheability types.
