GUI freeze while loading data in BackgroundWorker

I have a ListView control receiving data from BackgroundWorker through ReportProgress . The worker dumps about a hundred rows in a quick succession. Each chunk of data fires ProgressChanged event and GUI thread adds a new item to the ListView . As the data retrieval operations run on a separate thread, the GUI is supposed to update on every change. But for some reason it doesn't happen - the interface remains frozen until the worker is completed. Any ideas? Also, the tests are done on very fast machine, so I don't think computer performance is an issue. It's a WinForms application.
