UserControl doesn't appear on page if dynamically added in Page.Load

I have a custom ASP.NET user control that is added to a panel on a web page in the Page.Load method. The control contains some Labels and a GridView. I'm adding it to the page with this code: ReportingControl rc = new ReportingControl(this.Username, this.SoaContext, transactionId, p.PaymentTypeRequestKey); this.pnlPB.Controls.Add(rc); For some reason, the controls that are added aren't actually showing up on the page. I also noticed that the controls within the control are all null but I don't know if that is part of the problem or if they are created at a later time. Any ideas?
