How to calculate the posterior probability with bayesian theory?

The Bayesian formula is given as the following simple way. $${\mathsf P}(a\mid x) ~=~ \dfrac{{\mathsf P}(x\mid a)~{\mathsf P}(a)}{{\mathsf P}(x)}$$ A factory makes pencils. prior probability: defective pencils manufactured by the factory is 30%. To check 10 pencils ,2 defective pencil found. a is event : defective rate of pencils. x is sample to check the pencils. prior probability : P(a) = 0.3 P(x|a) follows binomial distribution, expressed in R. n P(x|a) =0.233 How can get P(x) to calculate the posterior probability ${\mathsf P}(a \mid x)$ in this example with the Bayesian formula?
