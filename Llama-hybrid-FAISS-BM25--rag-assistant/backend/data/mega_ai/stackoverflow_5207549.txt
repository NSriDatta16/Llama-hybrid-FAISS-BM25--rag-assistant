In the developer portal you should: Enter your app and give it a name. Add the app to a provisioning file. Download the provisioning file Drag that file into Xcode. In the organizer-window in Xcode - add the provisioning file to your phone. This might not be necessary since Xcode can automatically download a team provisioning file. That was from the top of my head. Try search for a guide or tutorial for it, there's plenty of them :)
