There are so many things that could be better with this program. Here are a few: Don't use a global ( coll ) Don't use bad variable names ( i , l , x ) Don't use List when int [] would work as well or better. Use join to print out your list. Some things that would make this program faster Don't recurse, iterate. (Hint - an abstract stack object or abstract set object would help.) Don't sort so much, should not matter and in fact might slow you down. Prune your temporary storage as you go -- waiting till the end to do the distinct just means you have done WAY TO MANY of the same thing multiple times. Before you add it to the collection check if it is already there.
