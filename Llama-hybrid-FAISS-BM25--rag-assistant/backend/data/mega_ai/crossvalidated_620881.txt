Ð¡an a subset of features perform better than the base set

I have a theoretical question.. I have a model, let it be random forest I take 100 candidate features and train the model I select all the features that are important from the point of view of the model (important features from the random forest). Let the model select 40 features. I'll call it the basic feature set My question is: Can it be that the model will work better if I choose some subset of the basic features set of in 5-10-20 features? Is it worth looking for a subset of features in the base feature set, or is it already the best set by default?
