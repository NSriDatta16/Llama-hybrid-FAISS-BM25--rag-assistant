It really depends on your data context. Normally you will have an object for each table in your database. So for example if you have a database that has an orders table you will have an Orders object in your DataContext (created by dragging the table into your dbml file in the designer). So for a new order you woud do the following: using (var ctx = new MyDataContext()) { ctx.Orders.InsertOnSubmit(order); ctx.SubmitChanges(); } And to save an order passed to your client and modified ther you do: using (var ctx = new MyDataContext()) { ctx.Orders.Attach(order, true); ctx.SubmitChanges(); }
