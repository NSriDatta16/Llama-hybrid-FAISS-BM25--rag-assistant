This is the "Composite Application" pattern; the heart of a Service Oriented Architecture. That's what the ESB vendors are selling: a way to put additional business logic somewhere that creates a composite application out of existing applications. This is not simple because your composite application is not just routing. It's a proper new composite transaction layered on top of the routing. Hint. Look at getting a good ESB before going too much further. This rapidly gets out of control and having some additional support is helpful. Even if you don't buy something like Sun's JCAPS or Open ESB , you'll be happy you learned what it does and how they organize complex composite applications.
