Copy sources files into target directory with SBT

I recently decided to use SBT to build an existing project. In this project I have some .glsl files within the scala packages which I need to copy during the compilation phase. The project is structured like this : - myapp.opengl - Shader.scala - myapp.opengl.shaders - vertex_shader.glsl - fragment_shader.glsl Is this file structure correct for SBT or do I need to put the .glsl files into an other directory. And do you know a clean way to copy these files into the target folder ? I would prefer not putting these files into the resources directory since they are (non-compiled) sources files Thanks
