I think you're on solid ground. Another useful thing to do is to call up a loading plot ('/plot rotation'), then to reanalyze using varimax rotation and again ask for a loading plot. But I hope you're analyzing objective data and not opinion data: using PCA on the latter is well-known to be a mistake, because it treats as part of an underlying dimension some information that should be treated as unique to particular variables, or even as measurement error.
