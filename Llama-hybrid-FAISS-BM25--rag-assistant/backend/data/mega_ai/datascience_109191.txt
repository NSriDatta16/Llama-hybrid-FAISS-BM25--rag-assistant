One way to deal with the situation is to investigate the differences between the training and A/B testing. Here a couple of common differences: The modeling training process optimizes a machine learning loss function. A/B test optimizes a business value. The loss function and business value could diverge. Data distributions are different. The machine learning model is trained on older data. The A/B test is on newer data. The older and newer data come from different distributions.
