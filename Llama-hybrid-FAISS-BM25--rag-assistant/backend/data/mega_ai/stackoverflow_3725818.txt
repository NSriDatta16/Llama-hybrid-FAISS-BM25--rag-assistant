Objective c - Rotate wheel using radians

I am trying to make a circle image which rotates when the user drags the wheel This is my code: CABasicAnimation *rotationAnimation; rotationAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"transform.rotation.z"]; rotationAnimation.toValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:angleRadians]; rotationAnimation.duration = 10; rotationAnimation.cumulative = YES; rotationAnimation.repeatCount = 1.0; rotationAnimation.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut]; [self.layer addAnimation:rotationAnimation forKey:@"rotationAnimation"]; The main issue I am having though, that the image is being reset when it is finished. Any help please?
