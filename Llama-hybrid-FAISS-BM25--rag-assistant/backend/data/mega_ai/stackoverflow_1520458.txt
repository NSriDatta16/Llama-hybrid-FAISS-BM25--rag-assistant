How to change how a User Control is dragged and dropped into source pane

In Visual Studio 2008, if I wanted to drag a user control (that I have created) into the current page/control, I have to switch to Design view before dragging it into the pane. If I try to do it when the document is in Source view, it sends the markup as a hyperlink and not as the with the where I dragged it to. Is there a way to change this behavior on the Source view?
