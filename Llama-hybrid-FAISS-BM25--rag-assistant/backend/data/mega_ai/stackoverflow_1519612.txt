Unit testing using NDBUnit framework

Am writing unit tests for an app that has matured a lot with time..We are using NDBUnit as the test cases become independent of each other..while we started the development of this app the DB schema was pretty manageable and hence dragging and dropping the tables on VS designer to create an XSD was never an issue. Well, with my current DB schema the XSD that is generated is more than 3MB in size. On slow dev machine VS goes off to sleep when one tries to open the XSD. Hence keeping the DB schema and the XSD in sync has become very challenging. Is there a way i can get rid of the manual step of modifying the XSD? Do you suggest that i should consider other unit testing frameworks? Spring.Net will definitely give me wt i need, but we don't have interfaces and hence integrating it will be a tedious task.
