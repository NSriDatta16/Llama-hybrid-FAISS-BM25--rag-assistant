Is 0.1542 Mcfadden's Pseudo R2 acceptable in general?

I am conducting logistic regression and got 0.1542 as pseudo R2, and it is based on Mcfadden's. I've searched materials about this, because this is my first time that modelling logit models, and found that it has been mentioned 0.2~0.4 means 'excellent fit'. Then can I think that it is very difficult getting high value of pseudo R2 compare to that of R2?(for example, ofc it depends on the field, but as we generally we talk about 0.6 has great fit...) And if it's true, isn't there any matter if I think this is acceptable enough, although it is not that excellent? Or is there any table or materials that tells which pseudo R2 correspond to which R2?
