On the off chance you're actually serious... Colors are usually stored via their pixel values via their Red, Green, and Blue components ( RGB ), as that's how our displays work. (Print work is often handled by storing Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK pixel values, in the CMYK mode.) Regardless of color depth , whether it is 15 bit, 16 bit, 24 bit, or 32-bit, it takes the same amount of memory to store black (0x000000 for 24-bit) as white (0xFFFFFF). Both can compress equally well, too. (Any solid color background can compress very well; limited-color backgrounds can compress well.) My guess is your friends prefer black because it is easy on the eyes. (At least, that's why I prefer black backgrounds, black background colored terminals and text editors, etc.)
