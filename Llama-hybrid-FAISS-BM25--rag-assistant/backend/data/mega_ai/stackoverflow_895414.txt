You can sample randomly from your set (" population ") to get an average (" mean "). The accuracy will be determined by how much your samples vary (as determined by " standard deviation " or variance). The advantage is that you have billions of observations, and you only have to sample a fraction of them to get a decent accuracy or the " confidence range " of your choice. If the conditions are right, this cuts down the amount of work you will be doing. Here's a numerical library for C# that includes a random sequence generator. Just make a random sequence of numbers that reference indices in your array of elements (from 1 to x , the number of elements in your array). Dereference to get the values, and then calculate your mean and standard deviation. If you want to test the distribution of your data, consider using the Chi-Squared Fit test or the K-S test, which you'll find in many spreadsheet and statistical packages (e.g., R ). That will help confirm whether this approach is usable or not.
