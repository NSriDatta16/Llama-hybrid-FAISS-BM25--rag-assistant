I'm not sure what you've done to try to solve it, but here's what I'd do, retrying between each step: If you have that path but don't have the file, get it from someone (I'll volunteer). I'm guessing it's not that easy, though. :) Delete and reinstall Xcode. Go to the Xcode Organizer and plug in your device, and let it authorize and download the 4.2.1 stuff. Do you even have a directory like that? I don't have those subdirectories (I don't have a 4.2.1 (8C148) directory but I do have 4.2.1 (8C148a) ) there. Under DeviceSupport/Latest/ I have those subdirectories and files.
