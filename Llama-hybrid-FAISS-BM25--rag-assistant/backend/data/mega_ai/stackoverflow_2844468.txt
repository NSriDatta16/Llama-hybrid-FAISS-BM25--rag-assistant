I'm a code person myself, and to be honest, it doesn't matter. Even if you don't know anything about graphic design, you can still use the editor in visual studio to design an UI. The designer features an drag&drop designer as Win Forms does, so that doesn't really pose a problem. Even though I'm a code person, I have no problem with xaml, as it is, in some way, code again. I had problems with the xaml at first as well, but I got used to it, and stuff I had to do in code in Win Forms was quite easy in xaml. Databinding simply rocks, you don't have to care about getting the data to the UI, you simply have an ObservableCollection or similar, and one Property in the xaml code and everything gets done for you. Want to format the data? Simply add a formatting property to the binding. Want to color the text according to the value? Template Selector class with 15 lines of code, Binding and Template selection in the xaml code of about 10 lines. I'm really growing to love it, and with time (as with any other new technology) you get used to it, and produce good looking stuff.
