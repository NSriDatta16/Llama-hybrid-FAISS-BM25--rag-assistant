How can I set environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix TeamCity build agent?

I use TeamCity to build c++ on Unix (Solaris). TeamCity invokes make, and within my makefile I need to call svn . For this I need to modify PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH . I could set these within the makefile but the locations vary from server to server. does anyone know a way to set these for each TeamCity build agent, e.g. by editing conf/buildAgent.properties ? I could set them in ~/.login etc for the TeamCity build account, but I would prefer not to as it is a shared account. -thanks, Barney
