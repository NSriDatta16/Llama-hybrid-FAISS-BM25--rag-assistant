Question about paper on Bayesian Shrinkage Estimation

I am reading the paper Bayesian Shrinkage Estimation of the Relative Abundance of mRNA Transcripts Using SAGE , and I am trying to work out the calculations for the complete conditionals for the Gibbs scheme presented in Section 3.5 (the prior structure is described in Section 3.1). I am confused about how to calculate the full joint probability model and how to derive $p(\lambda \mid X, ...)$ , $p(\pi^* \mid X, ...)$ , $p(q_A \mid X, ...)$ , and $p(q_S \mid X, ...)$ . Is the below expression for the full joint correct? \begin{align*}p(\pi^*, q_A, q_S, \lambda, X) &\propto {(\pi^*)}^{\sum_{j=1}^{|A|} \lambda_j} (1-\pi^*)^{\sum_{j=|A| + 1}^{N} \lambda_j} \prod_{j=1}^{|A|} q_{A_j}^{\lambda_j} \prod_{j=|A|+1}^N q_{S_j}^{\lambda_j} \cdot \prod_{j = 1}^{|A|} q_{A_j}^{\theta_A - 1} \prod_{j = |A| + 1}^{N} q_{S_j}^{\theta_S - 1} \\ &\cdot \frac{1}{B(a_{\pi^*}, b_{\pi^*})} (\pi^*)^{a_{\pi^*} - 1}(1 - \pi^*)^{b_{\pi^*} - 1} \cdot P^{\lambda} (1 - P)^{1 - \lambda}\end{align*} I'm not sure where to go from here to calculate $p(\lambda \mid X, ...)$ , so I'd appreciate any help. Thanks in advance! Edit : I was thinking of defining $A_1 = \{j : \lambda_j = 1\}$ and $A_0 = \{j : \lambda_j = 0\}$ with $M_1 = |A_1|$ and $M_0 = N - M_1$ . Then we assume WLOG that $\lambda_j = 1$ for $j = 1, ..., M_1$ and $\lambda_j = 0$ for $j = M_1 + 1, ..., M_1 + M_0$ . Then would the joint be \begin{align*}p(\pi^*, q_A, q_S, \lambda, X) &\propto {(\pi^*)}^{\sum_{j=1}^{M_1} \lambda_j} (1-\pi^*)^{\sum_{j=M_1 + 1}^{N} \lambda_j} \prod_{j=1}^{M_1} q_{A_j}^{\lambda_j} \prod_{j=M_1+1}^N q_{S_j}^{\lambda_j} \cdot \prod_{j = 1}^{M_1} q_{A_j}^{\theta_A - 1} \prod_{j = M_1 + 1}^{N} q_{S_j}^{\theta_S - 1} \\ &\cdot \frac{1}{B(a_{\pi^*}, b_{\pi^*})} (\pi^*)^{a_{\pi^*} - 1}(1 - \pi^*)^{b_{\pi^*} - 1} \cdot P^{\lambda} (1 - P)^{1 - \lambda}?\end{align*} Edit 2 : I am still stuck on calculating the conditional posterior for $\lambda$ and $\pi^*$ . Would it make sense to evaluate the joint at $\lambda_j = 1$ and $\lambda_j = 0$ ? I realize that there is a factor to consider in $p(q_A) = Dir(q_A \mid a_\lambda,\ldots,a_\lambda)$ for $\lambda_j = \lambda$ .
