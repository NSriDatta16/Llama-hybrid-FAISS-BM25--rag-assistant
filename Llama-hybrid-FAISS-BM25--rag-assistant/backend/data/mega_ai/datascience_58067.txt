Face detection for different poses more robust than MTCNN?

I am using the MTCNN model described on machinelearningmastery here: MTCNN ipazc But it won't detect certain orientations, ie. somebody lying on the ground so the top of the head points to the right of the frame and their chin to the left. Thus, I am going to cv2.flip on the y-axis and also rotate using the method described on pyimagesearch here: rotation of images to try the detect() method on at least 8 different orientations of the same frame and then output the one with the most detections. This may or may not work very well on video when faces and objects need to be detected on every frame. Thus, I am looking for links to pretrained model zoos for MTCNN and other face detection, object detection and face recognition algorithms.
