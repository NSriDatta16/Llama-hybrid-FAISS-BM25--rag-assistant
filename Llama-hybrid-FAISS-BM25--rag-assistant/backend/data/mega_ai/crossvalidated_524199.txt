You could calculate the metrics you want to compare (i.e. Shannon-Weiner and Simpsons indices) for each site, and then take an average of those metrics for the sites that were sampled on multiple occasions, before carrying out your comparisons to other sites. Of course this does lose some of your information, by summarising the multiple samples into a single metric - but that is what you asked to do. If I were you I would consider presenting the results from all your sites separately - showing the metrics you obtain from multiple re-samples of the same site could be interesting. For instance, you might get different results because you sampled at different times of year. It would be interesting to know, for example, if Site B was more diverse than Site A in summer and Site B in winter.
