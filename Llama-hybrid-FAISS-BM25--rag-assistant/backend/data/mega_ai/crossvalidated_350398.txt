I've seen feature hashing and embedding mentioned in comments. Apart from that you can try clustering players by IDs if you have some additional data. Another approach which is suitable for categorical data with many level is mean encoding . Mean encoding (also sometimes called target encoding) consists of encoding categories with means of target (for example in regression if you have classes 0 and 1 then class 0 is encoded by mean of response for examples with 0 and so on). There are some answers on this site on that which provide more detail. I also encourage you to see this video if you want to get more about how it works and how you can implement it (there are several ways that to do mean encoding and each has its pros and cons). In Python you can do mean encoding yourself (some approaches are shown in the video from the series I linked) or you can try Category Encoders from scikit-learn contrib.
