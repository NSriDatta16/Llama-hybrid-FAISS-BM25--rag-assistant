Inferring a Markov chain from its invariant measure

Given a probability measure $p$ on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ assumed to be the invariant measure of some irreducible ergodic Markov chain with unknown transition matrix $P$, i.e., $p = pP$, what (if any) problems about inferring a unique/optimal $P$ have been considered? Examples of side conditions that might be in the literature somewhere to adequately specify a solution: requiring $P$ to be as sparse as possible along with some other condition like a few specific entries are known, or the sparsity pattern itself is completely known, or that $P$ is the exponential of some sparse (obviously embeddable) generator matrix, etc. NB. I am aware that there are many stochastic matrices with a given invariant measure, that the invertible ones form a Lie semigroup, etc. Generic answers along these lines (i.e., that do not have some pointer to the literature or an actual special case that's been considered or solved or some such) are not helpful.
