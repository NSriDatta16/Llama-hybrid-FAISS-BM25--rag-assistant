How do I tell cmake to do these two steps to use winpcap?

Quoted from here : If your program uses Win32 specific functions of WinPcap, remember to include WPCAP among the preprocessor definitions. If your program uses the remote capture capabilities of WinPcap, add HAVE_REMOTE among the preprocessor definitions. Do not include remote-ext.h directly in your source files. Has anyone managed to use winpcap with cmake?
