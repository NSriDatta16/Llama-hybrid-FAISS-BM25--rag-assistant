Which of these are the best Data Science courses for an recent graduate economist?

I have recently graduated from college in my country with a bachelor's degree in economics. In my country (Paraguay, a Latin American country) there is a big lack of data scientists/statiscians. I have now the temptation to enroll at the National University of Asunci√≥n (the best public university of my country) in order to pursue a bachelor's degree in statistics coursed fully online. However, with all the problems that education at every levels here in my country, I feel that studying a new bachelor's degree won't be worth it. I think that it would be nicer to move at the same pace as the world moves right now. I'm looking toward to two data science certificates/degrees online that are offered through udacity.com and statistics.com The first one which I saw (Udacity.com Nanodegree in Data Science) made me an impression that it was designed in order to be prepared to land a job in Silicon Valley or Wall Street. The second one (Statistics.com Certificate in Analytics for Data Science) made me an impression that it had more theoretical content in it's program, but it looked very well designed too. But I have a very big doubt in choosing some of this kind of programs. The Statistics.com certificate is far expensive than the Udacity.com nanodegree (5 times more expensive). And I do not want to be frustrated for paying too much money and time for something that cannot be really worth it. So, what do you recommend me to do? I trust in the expertise of the people here.
