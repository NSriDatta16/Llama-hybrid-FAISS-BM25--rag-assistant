Adding hour data to Date feature in time series prediction

I'm a noobie with regards to working with time series data. I have a time series data which has date column in YYYY-MM-DD and a hour column containing 0 to 23 representing hour of the day and the value containing a value between 70 to 100 which is what we need to predict. Models I tried: I checked for Stationarity of the data and I split the dataset based on time(oldest 80% train and newest 20% as a test) and tried two models: AR and ARIMA. AIC score for ARIMA was around 2500.0 My questions are: Earlier I discarded the hour feature and built models with only Date feature. So Will Adding hour data improve my model? If I'm adding hours, Should I keep it as a separate column or should I include the hour in the YYYY-MM-DD date feature? Thanks in advance
