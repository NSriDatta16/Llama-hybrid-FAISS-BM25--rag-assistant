I would model this problem using a multilevel Poisson regression. $CopiesSold_{i} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{i})$ $\lambda_{i} = \alpha[artist_{i}] + X_{i}\beta$ With this structure the intercept is changing based on the artist and other variables' effects are captured by $X\beta$ . Of course you can make this even more complicated by adding non-linear effects, making the effects random, adding overdispersion or trying Negative Binomial likelihood instead of Poisson. I would fit this model using a Bayesian framework in JAGS or Rstan. glm in R could do it as well.
