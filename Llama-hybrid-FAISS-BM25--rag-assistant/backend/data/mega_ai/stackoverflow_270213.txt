The Microsoft Framework Design Guidelines discourage the placement of multiple statements on one line, except where there is direct language support, such as in the for statement. Since there is explicit language support for multiple assignment, int a, b, c; a = b = c = 0; is permitted. On the other hand, code of the form used in your example is discouraged. How about this one, people? while ((packetPos = Packet.FindStart(buffer, nextUnconsideredPos)) > -1) To avoid the inline assignment, you would have to factor redundantly, like this: packetPosition = Packet.FindStart(buffer, nextUnconsideredPosition); while (packetPosition > -1) { ... packetPosition = Packet.FindStart(buffer, nextUnconsideredPosition); }
