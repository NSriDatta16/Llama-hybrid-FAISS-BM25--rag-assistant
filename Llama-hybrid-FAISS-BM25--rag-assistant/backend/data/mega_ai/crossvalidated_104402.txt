What is the justification for unsupervised discretization of continuous variables?

A number of sources suggest that there are many negative consequences of the discretization (categorization) of continuous variables prior to statistical analysis (sample of references [1]-[4] below). Conversely [5] suggests that some machine learning techniques are known to produce better results when continuous variables are discretized (also noting that supervised discretization methods perform better). I am curious if there are any widely accepted benefits or justifications for this practice from a statistical perspective? In particular, would there be any justification for discretizing continuous variables within a GLM analysis? [1] Royston P, Altman DG, Sauerbrei W.
