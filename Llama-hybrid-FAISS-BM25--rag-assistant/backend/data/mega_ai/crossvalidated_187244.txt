It is not correct to average probabilities because that would not represent the predictions you are trying to validate and involves contamination across validation samples. Note that 100 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation may be required to achieve adequate precision. Or use the Efron-Gong optimism bootstrap which requires fewer iterations for the same precision (see e.g. R rms package validate functions). ROC curves are in no way insightful for this problem. Use a proper accuracy score and accompany it with the $c$-index (concordance probability; AUROC) which is much easier to deal with than the curve, since it is calculated easily and quickly using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic.
