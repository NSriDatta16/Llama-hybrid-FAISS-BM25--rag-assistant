Stationarity Testing on different time series data

For linear regression modeling, I have macroeconomic data that goes from 1985-2016 which i will use as my independent variable. My dependent variable data ranges from 2002-2016. My question is for stationarity testing do I run those tests on macroeconomic data from 1985 onwards or from 2002 onwards since that is what i would be using to model. The reason as to why I am asking this question is because what if a series is stationary from 1985 to 2016 but is non-stationary from 2002-2016.
