C++ Function call as a parameter, not working

http://pastebin.com/CsViwQFg I'm using an SDK known as DragonFireSDK and there's a function called TouchAdd() that let's me add a function as a parameter (in this case: MoveLeft() and MoveRight()). The only problem is, if the function is in a class (in this case, the Player class), I get the following errors: Player *player; void AppMain() { player = new Player(20,20,10); tleft = TouchAdd(0,0,180,480,player->MoveLeft,0); tright = TouchAdd(180,0,180,480,player->MoveRight,0); } The error: error C3867: 'Player::MoveLeft': function call missing argument list; use '&Player::MoveLeft' to create a pointer to member error C3867: 'Player::MoveRight': function call missing argument list; use '&Player::MoveRight' to create a pointer to member
