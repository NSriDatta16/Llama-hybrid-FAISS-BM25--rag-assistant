Regular expressions to pull links from HTML

Hi im trying to use regular expression to pull out links from a pice of html as follows: some random text link text some more random text. The reg expression I am using is: preg_match_all('/( ([\d\D]*?) )/', $content, $matches); Which works fine until part of the link has a carrage return in the middle of it due to a line wrap as follows: some random text link text some more random text. The carrage return can be anywhere within the link and means that the link doesn't get matched. Can anyone suggest a way out of this either buy tightning up the reg expression or by doing something to remove the carrage return befor the reg expression acts on the text.
