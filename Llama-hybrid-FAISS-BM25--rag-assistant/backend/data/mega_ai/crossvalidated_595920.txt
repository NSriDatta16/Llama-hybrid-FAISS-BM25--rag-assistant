Proof that leverage points are between 0 and 1 inclusive

I would really appreciate it if anyone can guide me through this. I have a $n \times (p+1)$ matrix $X$ . The projection matrix $P = X(X'X)^{-1}X'$ . I want to prove that $P(i,i)$ is in $[0,1]$ , where $P(i,i)$ is a leverage point. How can I prove it using the idempotent property of the projection matrix. I have no idea where to start.
