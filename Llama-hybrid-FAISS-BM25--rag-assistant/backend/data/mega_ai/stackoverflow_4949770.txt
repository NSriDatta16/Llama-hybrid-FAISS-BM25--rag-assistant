.net mail classes vs SQL sp_send_dbmail

We have applications that need to send out email notifications from time to time. We have been using the .net mail classes but recently we are running into the problem of some virus checkers blocking port 25. To me the correct solution is to set up the correct exclusion rules to allow our app to keep working. However, some are afraid that this may become a huge hassle in the future, especially as new organizations come on line, and would prefer to use SQL dbmail instead. I don't particularly like this choice, I would much rather have the application handle this aspect but I'm not sure if it's worth the fight. Are there any real advantages of using .net mail over the SQL mail?
