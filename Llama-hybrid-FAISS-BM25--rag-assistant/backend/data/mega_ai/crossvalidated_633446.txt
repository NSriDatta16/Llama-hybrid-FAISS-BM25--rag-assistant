Computing Z scores AP Psych

My report is looking at the effect of belief in conspiracy theories and critical thinking abilities, on engagement in politics. I've basically got to do a factorial ANOVA and my IV's are: Conspiracy beliefs Critical thinking abilities My DV is: Engagement in politics The IV's have been converted into high/low groups based on median average etc. I'm already stuck on my first part of wrangling the data. I have to compute z scores. Do I have to compute them for all of my variables? I am using Jamovi.
