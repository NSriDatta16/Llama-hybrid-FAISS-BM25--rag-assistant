I am not a statistician so what I say is based on what I have read in various statistical sources, including at this site. These comments are general not related specifically how to improve your model. I would try using auto.arima to estimate the ARIMA/SARIMA. The classical approach you try supposedly does not work well with mixed P and Q (or may not work well anyhow). The rule of thumb is you need 50 monthly data points at a minimum probably more. My guess is 4 months, your hold out sample is also too little to test your model, I use 12 although I know of no rule of thumb. Just because you difference the data once does not make it stationary. I would test the differenced data for stationarity. The various stationarity tests have weak power, so look at the data itself for trend and use multiple tests of stationarity. There are many reasons you may not be able to predict the future. Things can change between the past and the future where you estimate results. ARIMA makes assumptions such as linearity that may not be true. You have to remove all serial correlations and it appears that you have not based on your box ljung test. You might want to consider exponential smoothing in addition to ARIMA and possibly mix various models - which has been shown to improve results. I run 6 ESM models, am going to add an ARIMA model to this, and pick the best three to average as result of a 12 month hold out sample. Even then I don't expect it will always work, there are to many uncertainties.
