Monitoring storage space on windows mobile

In a native(c++) windows mobile app. There are ways to be notified of low memory, WM_HIBERNATE , and low power, RequestPowerNotifications() . Is there any way to be notified when storage space is running low? Or must an app just poll regularly with GetDiskFreeSpaceEx() ?
