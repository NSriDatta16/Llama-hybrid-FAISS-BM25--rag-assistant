There is no XHTML 5. Currently there is HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0. There will be no XHTML 2.0 . There will only be HTML 5. HTML 5 is not an XML standard (meaning an HTML 5 document is not an XML document). Perhaps you're looking at HTML 5 + XML = XHTML 5 . I guess you can express HTML 5 as XML but as far as I know this is non-standard. More specifically, this is just a serialization method for the document tree rather than a standard. To clarify this issue, take a look at HTML 5 and XHTML 5 - one vocabulary, two serializations . Even from the title it says "one vocabulary, two serializations". And Conversation With X/HTML 5 Team : The XHTML 5 spec says that "generally speaking, authors are discouraged from trying to use XML on the Web". Why write an XML spec like XHTML 5 and then discourage authors from using it? Why not just drop support for XML (XHTML 5)? Some people are going to use XML with HTML 5 whatever we do. It's a simple thing to do â€” XML is a metalanguage for describing tree structures, HTML 5 is a tree structure, it's obvious that XML can be used to describe HTML 5. The problem is that if we don't specify it, then everyone who thinks it is obvious and goes ahead and does it will do it in a slightly different way, and we'll have an interoperability nightmare. So instead we bite the bullet and define how it must work if people do it. XHTML 1.0 was a standard. It differed to HTML 4. XHTML 5, if you can call it that, is nothing more than representing HTML 5 documents in XML form.
