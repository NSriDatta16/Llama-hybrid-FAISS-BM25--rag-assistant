Delphi - Create a custom TToolBar component

I want to create a custom toolbar control (descendant TToolBar) which should have some default-toolbarButtons. So I've created a simple constructor which creates 1 default button: constructor ZMyToolbart.Create(AOwner: TComponent); var ToolButton : TToolButton; begin inherited; Parent := Owner as TWinControl; ToolButton := TToolButton.Create(Self); ToolButton.Parent := Self; ToolButton.Caption := 'Hallo'; end; The problem is, after draggign the custom control on a form, the toolbar-button is visible, but it's not shown in the object inspector as a part of the toolbar. If tried to assign the button via the button property of the toolbar, but this doesn't work. Maybe somebody has an advice how this could be done? thank you!
