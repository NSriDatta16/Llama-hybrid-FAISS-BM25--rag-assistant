I would usually choose one of two different approaches: An overridden constructor taking some kind of object which either contains all items, or know how to get them (e.g. an enumerator) A property with a setter for the same kind of object This way, the logic of how to get the objects can be tucked away some where else. (Now, it may be that this is what you already do, but the name 'LoadData' makes me believe that your fame is actually going to load data from some kind of storage repository instead of just displaying the data some one else has previously fetched...)
