Copy an entire row from one sheet to another based upon a single word, within a paragraph, inside a cell

I'm looking to copy a row from one sheet to another based upon having a specific word in the cell. I have a sheet one, called "data" and a sheet two called "final". Here is an example of the data A B C D john mary 555.555.4939 initial reply to phone conversation Jim jack 555.555.5555 floor estimate for bathroom jerry kim 555.555.5553 initial response to phone call I'd like to copy the entire row from sheet "data" to a sheet "final" if the data in column D contains either the word "reply" or the word "response".
