PCI Compliance + Magento + PHP version

I'm trying to get PCI Compliance for my dedicated server (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), which is running Magento. When I first installed Magento on the server, I realized that RHEL comes with a PHP version which is too old for Magento (5.1.6). So, I found a separate repo with PHP version 5.2.11, which got everything running fine, but now I'm in a bind. My PCI Compliance test says that since my PHP version is I realize this is terribly convoluted, but if you have any suggestions/tips I'd be happy to hear them. Thanks.
