Why is BigDecimal returning a weird value?

I am writing code that will deal with currencies, charges, etc. I am going to use the BigDecimal class for math and storage, but we ran into something weird with it. This statement: 1876.8 == BigDecimal('1876.8') returns false. If I run those values through a formatting string "%.13f" I get: "%.20f" % 1876.8 => 1876.8000000000000 "%.20f" % BigDecimal('1876.8') => 1876.8000000000002 Note the extra 2 from the BigDecimal at the last decimal place. I thought BigDecimal was supposed to counter the inaccuracies of storing real numbers directly in the native floating point of the computer. Where is this 2 coming from?
