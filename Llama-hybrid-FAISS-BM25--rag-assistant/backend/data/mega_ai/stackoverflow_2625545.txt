Performance implications of storing 600,000+ images in the same folder (NTFS)

I need to store about 600,000 images on a web server that uses NTFS. Am I better off storing images in 20,000-image chunks in subfolders? (Windows Server 2008) I'm concerned about incurring operating system overhead during image retrieval
