Finding mean and variance of t-distribution to solve for constant c

Suppose that 5 Random Variable X1, X2,... X5 are independent and each has standard normal distribution. A constant C such that the random variable $$C\frac{X_{1} + X_{2}}{(X_{3}^2 + X_{4}^2 + X_{5}^2) ^ {\frac{1}{2}}}$$ will have a t-distribution? I began to solve this by taking the mean and variance of the above random variable(lets call this RT). Given the following: $$E(t) = 0$$ and $$Var(t) = \frac{\vartheta }{\vartheta -2} = 2 $$ Taking the variance of the random distribution RT $$Var(RT) = C^{2}\frac{(var(X_{1})+ var(X_{2}))}{(var(X_{3}^2)+ var(X_{4}^2+ var(X_{5}^2))^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$ which is equal to $$Var(RT) = C^{2}\frac{1+ 1}{(3+3+3 )^{\frac{1}{2}}}\ as \ Var(X^2)=3\sigma^2 \ and\ Var(X)=1$$ Therefore equating the above to 2 gives $$C^{2} = 3\ and\ C = 3^{1/2}$$ Is my answer correct?
