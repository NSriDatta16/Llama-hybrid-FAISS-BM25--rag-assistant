The following graph quantifies the amount of information that a Bayesian attacker can gain after seeing the result of an $\varepsilon$ -differentially private algorithm, for different values of $\varepsilon$ . The $x$ -axis is the prior that the attacker has on some property of their target user, and the $y$ -axis is the posterior. This answers your question somewhat: If $\varepsilon$ is very close to $0$ , an attacker gains almost no information. For $\varepsilon=1$ , an attacker which starts with a prior of 50% can at most increase it to 66%. For $\varepsilon=7$ , the privacy level is already very low: in the worst case, even an attacker with a small prior knowledge 5% can increase it to more than 95%. The blog post that the graph is taken from explains this in more detail.
