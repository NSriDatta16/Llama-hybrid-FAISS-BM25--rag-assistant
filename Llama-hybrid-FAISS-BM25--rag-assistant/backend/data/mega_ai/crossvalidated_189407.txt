If you exponentiate your formula, you get: $$ L(\theta;x) = \frac{1}{2^n}\prod_{i=1}^n(1+\theta x_i) $$ which is a polynomial of degree $n$ w.r.t. $\theta$. I let you prove that the maximum is for the 0 of the derivative (it's pretty straighforward but there's a line to write down to be precise ;) ). But the derivative of a polynomial of degree $n$ is a polynomial of degree $n-1$ which indeed has at most $n-1$ roots. Finding the roots is not easy though (especially if $n>6$ where you cannot have any analytical solution for the roots). But implementing a program to find the roots is pretty "easy", it's just a root retrieval algorithm.
