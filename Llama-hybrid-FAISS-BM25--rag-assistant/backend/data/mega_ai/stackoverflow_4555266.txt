The default or generic simulator is to display the general functions and may not be specific to any present or future model in the final form. Only authorised developers, manufacturers and industry organisations like OHA the open handset alliance are permitted to develop for specific models as some of the internal hardware including the processor may be proprietory or patented for use in specific countries and open access to the internals could be a breach of rights protection. When using API and APP type environments as application programmers and hobbyists then the development kit can be specific to models and is provided by the brand name or manufacturer by download or on CD and is a concession to the user community.
