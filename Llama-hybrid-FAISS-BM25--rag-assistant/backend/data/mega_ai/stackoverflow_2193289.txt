Are you on windows? There is a Low-fragmentation Heap available there that can be used as a preventative measure. It only takes a few lines to set up and should help with these issues. You use HeapSetInformation to set it. Something like this should do the trick: ULONG hi = 2; HeapSetInformation( (HANDLE)_get_heap_handle(), HeapCompatibilityInformation, &hi, sizeof(hi));
