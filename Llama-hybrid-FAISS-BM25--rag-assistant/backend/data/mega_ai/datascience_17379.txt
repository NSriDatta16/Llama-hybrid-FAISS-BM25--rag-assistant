How can I promote my work?

After a half year of working as a data scientist, I found myself tend to clone my previous work (in machine learning, like predictive modeling, EDA, data preprocessing etc.) in the new project and the work becomes a repeated style. I need new directions to lift my work with some innovative pieces. That is a key incentive to my work and also make me feel fresh and confident. Could anyone put forth advice for me? Cheers
