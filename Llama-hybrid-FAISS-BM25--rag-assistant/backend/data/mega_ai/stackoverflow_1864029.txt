How do you keep the console from closing after the program is done in C?

Possible Duplicate: What is the Best Practice for Combating the Console Closing Issue? How do you keep the console from closing after the program is done in C? When I try to search for it I find lots of stuff about C++ and other languages, but nothing for C. Also, even for C++ there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer. So could someone please let me know what the simplest way (doesn't need to be super elegant) way to keep the console open after a C program is done running?
