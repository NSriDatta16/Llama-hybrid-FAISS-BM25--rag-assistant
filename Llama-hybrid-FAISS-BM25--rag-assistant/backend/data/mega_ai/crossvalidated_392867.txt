Based on your description, you could start from a model that contains as fixed effects the sex and the attribute, where sex is a factor with levels male and female, and attribute a factor with levels P1-P4, and random effects for ProductID and RaterID, e.g., something like y ~ sex * attribute + (1 | ProductID) + (1 | RaterID) By including the interaction, you could test your specific hypothesis of interest by using suitable contrasts. An additional important point is what type of mixed model you will use. If I understood correctly, you have an ordinal outcome (i.e., 5-point scale). There are not that many options with regard to software for proportional odds models. However, you could use the continuation ratio model instead that requires a couple of extra data management steps, and fitting the model with a mixed effects logistic regression.
