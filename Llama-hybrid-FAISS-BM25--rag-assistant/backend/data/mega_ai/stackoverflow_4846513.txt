Big-Oh notation for code fragment

I am lost on these code fragments and finding a hard time to find any other similar examples. //Code fragment 1 sum = 0; for(i = 0;i I'm guessing it is O(n^4) for fragment 1. //Code fragment 2 sum = 0; for( 1; i I am very lost on this one. Not sure how does the if statement affects the loop. Thank you for the help head of time!
