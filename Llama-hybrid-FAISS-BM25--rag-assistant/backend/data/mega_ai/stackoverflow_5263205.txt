How to serve static content dynamically in Struts2

in Struts2 it is possible to serve static content like images, JS or CSS files by putting them into resources/static. From this point Struts2 takes care for serving them on HTTP request and everyone, especially my JSPs, are happy. Now I have to retrieve all this static files from a DB; I get them as byte[] . The purpose is to exchange the files without redeploying the web application. Do you have any suggestions how to serve them elegantly? Can I overwrite e.g. some static resource provider? Alternatively, should I provide an action for that? I'm mainly concerned about caching. Is there something else I should be concerned about? Thanks in advance, any hint is appreciated! :) Gregor
