Based on your big-picture description it sounds like you have a dead-end design. If you are able to get it working right now, it'll most likely be very fragile and it won't scale at all. I'm guessing that if you have no control over the external service, then that external service might not be happy about getting hammered by your script like this. Have you approached them with your general plan? Do you really need to do all users every time? Is there any sort of timestamp you can use to be more selective about which users need "updates"? Perhaps if you could describe the goal a little better we might be able to give more specific advice.
