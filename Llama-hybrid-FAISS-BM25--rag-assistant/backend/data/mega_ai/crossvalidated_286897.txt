random forests variable importance plot - interpretation in R (VarImpPlot)

I have constructed two variable importance plots in r using random forests regression the dependent variable is wheat yield and the independent variables are topographic and vegetative parameters. I am wanting to know which topographic/vegetative variables have the most importance influence on wheat yield. I have done this for two years of data. The variable importance plot is shown below for both years. How do I interpret this? the node purity for the two years is different? Also, how do I know which plot is most accurate? The variation explained in 2015 is 70%. while the variation explained in 2016 is 40% (the graph for 2016 looks more accurate though?) - please correct me if I am mistaken. library(randomForest) rf1
