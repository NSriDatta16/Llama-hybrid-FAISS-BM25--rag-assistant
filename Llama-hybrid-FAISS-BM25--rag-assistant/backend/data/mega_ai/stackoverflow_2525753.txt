The iPhone “phone” doesn’t have the provisioning profile with which the application was signed

I have tried everything to fix this provision problem and nothing is working. I've reformated my Mac, reinstalled the iPhone, I've also dragged the provisions (developer and distribution) onto the Organizer, iTunes, and Xcode. In iTunes people say to drag the provisions to the iPhone icon but that doesn't work; it's only able to go under Library (it shows a blue rectangle for me to drop it there). I just have a newly created dummy app with a 57x57 icon. I've also setup the project with the distribution thing with its distribution provision. When I build I get this: The iPhone “myphone” doesn’t have the provisioning profile with which the application was signed. Click “Install and Run” to install the provisioning profile “distribution” on “myphone” and continue running “helloworld.app”. and it has a button "install and run" ive clicked on that hundreths of times and nothing. in orgranizer I see a tab called Console. I've cleared it and rebuild the app and there is some output that I dont understand. I'm thinking its my problem whats it mean?
