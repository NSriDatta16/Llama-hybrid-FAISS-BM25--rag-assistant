That's a political question, not a statistical one :-) Historically, statistics and machine learning were two distinct communities, with little interaction. ANNs were developed by the machine learning community. Today, the lines might be somewhat blurred, with some statisticians counting ANNs to statistics, while some machine learners count logistic regression and even linear regression to machine learning. Needless to say, some members of the opposite camp beg to differ. So, there is no simple answer to your question. Calling ANNs statistical method might be seen as justified by some and objected to by others.
