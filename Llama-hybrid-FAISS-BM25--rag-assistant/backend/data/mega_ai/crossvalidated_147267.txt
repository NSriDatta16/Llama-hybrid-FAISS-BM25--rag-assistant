Suppose we have an $M+1$-state irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain, with states $m_j$, $j=0,1,\ldots, M$, with a doubly stochastic transition matrix (i.e., $\sum_{i=0}^M P_{i,j}=1$ for all $j$). Then the limiting distribution is $\pi_j=\frac{1}{M+1}$. Proof First note that the $\pi_j$ is the unique solution to $\pi_j=\sum_{i=0}^M \pi_iP_{i,j}$ and $\sum_{i=0}^M\pi_i=1$. Try $\pi_i=1$. This gives $\pi_j=\sum_{i=0}^M \pi_iP_{i,j}=\sum_{i=0}^M P_{i,j}=1$ (because the matrix is doubly stochastic). Thus $\pi_i=1$ is a solution to the first set of equations, and to make it a solution to the second normalize by dividing by $M+1$. By uniqueness, $\pi_j=\frac{1}{M+1}$.
