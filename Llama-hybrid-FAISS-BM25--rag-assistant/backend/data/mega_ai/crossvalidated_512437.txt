Regression models with special categorical variables

I need to build a regression model. I have 3 features: x1, x2, x3. Based on those 3 features I want to predict 3 dependent variables: y1, y2, y3. So far I created 3 separate models (Polynomial regression) based on the same features with different output variables. But additionally I have 3 categorical features (x4, x5, x6) which tell about the ratio of those 3 dependent variables to each other, for example: x4=3, x5=1 x6=2 (ratio 3:1:2) which means that y1 should have the biggest value, y2 smallest and y1 medium value. So those categorical features can improve results of those 3 models. What is the best type of model to use those categorical features? Should I build 3 models and final 1 that is using those categorical features or should I build 1 general model that includes everything? Can I build maybe some simple neural network with additional nodes that are somehow increasing one of the output variables when a specific categorical feature is high and decrease it when itâ€™s low? Or create some custom loss function? PS. The type of problem is rather convex.
