Escaping only what is necessary, is that possible?

I am working with a team of developers on a website. The website will be using classes. I am in charge of creating the data access layer for the classes. There is an understanding that all user input will be escaped upon retrieval (from the post or get). Having little control over the input level (unless I personally review everyone's code), I thought it would be cool to throw in escaping on my end as well (right before it hits the database). The problem is that I don't know how to use mysql_real_escape_string without adding even more slashes. Since user input may very well contain a slash I can't check to make sure there are slashes in it. I might be able to check for all the things that need escaping and make sure they have a slash in front of them, but that doesn't seem like the best way to do it. Any suggestions?
