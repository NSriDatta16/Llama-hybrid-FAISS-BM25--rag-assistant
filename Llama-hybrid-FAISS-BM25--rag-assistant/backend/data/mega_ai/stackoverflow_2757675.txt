Not only the Content-Disposition header is incorrect, but you're incorrectly using JSP instead of a Servlet for this particular task. JSP is a view technology. Everything outside the scriptlets will be printed to the response, including whitespace characters such as newlines. It would surely corrupt binary files. You could trim the whitespace in the JSP file, but scriptlets are discouraged since a decade and nowadays considered bad practice . Raw Java code belongs in Java classes, not in JSP files. The real solution is to use a HttpServlet for this. Create a class which extends HttpServlet , implement the doGet() method, move the Java code from the JSP file into this method, map this servlet on a certain url-pattern and your problem should disappear. You can find here a basic example of such a servlet.
