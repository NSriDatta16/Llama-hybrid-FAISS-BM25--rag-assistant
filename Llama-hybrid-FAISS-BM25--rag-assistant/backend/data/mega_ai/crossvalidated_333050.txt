Why are IV with odds ratios =1 included in the model?

I am running a logistic regression where the outcome is sale success. I include different IVs, and variables such as talk time to the customer and the amount a customer is paying receive an odds ratio of 1. Which means both outcomes are equally likely. In how far do these 2 variables contribute to the model? What is the value added?
