How to disable c++ strong type checking in VS

When porting unix project developed in C language to windows and compiling it with VS 2005, compiler reports errors related to incorrect type conversion like " can not convert 'const char*' to 'char*' ". Is it possible to disable this strong checking through compiler options. -Thanks for attention
