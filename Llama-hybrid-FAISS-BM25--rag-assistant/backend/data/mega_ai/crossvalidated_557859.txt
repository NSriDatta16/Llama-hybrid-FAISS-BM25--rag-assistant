Identification High Leverage for Logistic Regression

As seen below from Piet De Jong, Generalized Linear Models for Insurance Data, for linear model, we can identify high leverage, if the value of leverage>2p/n (or hii > 2p/n) then the indicates the case is unusual in the space of explanatory variables. If I have a Logit Regression/Logistic Regression, does anyone know can I use the rule of thumb that $h_{ii}>2p/n$ to identify large leverage? Or does anyone have references for the rule of thumb for $h_{ii}$ (to identify which case is unusual in the space of explanatory variable) in logistic regression?
