Working with first difference or not

I have a time series, AW1, with 365 daily observation, but I ignore if I should build my model taking the time series as given or taking the first difference. (I know many questions approach this problem, but I'm still confused as the time series presents different aspects. ) I rejected the null of a unit root, and hence it should be a stationary series, but looking tat the graph, I don't know if I should rely on the ADF test because of the presence of volatility etc,... So here are the graphs of the series , the first one without first difference while the second one is with first difference. My ADF test gave me a value of -17,69. Any advice on that?
