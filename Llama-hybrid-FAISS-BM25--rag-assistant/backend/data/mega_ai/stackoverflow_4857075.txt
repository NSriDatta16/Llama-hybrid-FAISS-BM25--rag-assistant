Magento filter product collection by tier price for current customer group

How do I filter a product collection by looking at whether a tier price for the current customer group has been set? I think I need to look at the catalog_product_entity_tier_price table to see if there is an entry for the current customer_group_id for each product in the collection (if there isn't, the product should be excluded / filtered from the collection), but I can't figure out how to make that happen. Background: Some products are not available to certain customer groups, and we are using tier price to make that determination (i.e. if a tier price exits, include in collection and display, if not, exclude and don't display). Any help is much appreciated
