p-value and the base rate fallacy

The first section of this article provides some intuition on base rate fallacy with p-values. In particular, it uses as example a cancer test. Suppose I am testing a hundred potential cancer medications. Only ten of these drugs actually work, but I don’t know which; I must perform experiments to find them. In these experiments, I’ll look for p It then calculates a hundred hypothesis tests and concludes that Because the base rate of effective cancer drugs is so low – only 10% of our hundred trial drugs actually work – most of the tested drugs do not work, and we have many opportunities for false positives. The whole argument makes sense to me but I am not sure if I entirely understand how it relates to a single hypothesis test. I.e. how does the base rate fallacy creep in a single hypothesis test? Say we have setup a hypothesis test to check if the average height differs between males and females for a specific sample we collected.
