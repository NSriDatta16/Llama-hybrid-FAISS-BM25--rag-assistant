declare can have type hints, so it is possible to declare a var that "is" the type which has not been defined yet but contains data about the structure, but this would be really clunky and you would have to do it before any code path that could be executed before the type is defined. Basically, you would want to define all of your user defined types up front and then use them like normal. I think that makes library writing somewhat hackish. I didn't mean to suggest earlier that this isn't possible, just that for user defined types it is a lot more complicated than for pre-defined types. The benefit of doing this vs. the cost is something that should be seriously considered. But I encourage anyone who is interested to try it out and see if they can make it work!
