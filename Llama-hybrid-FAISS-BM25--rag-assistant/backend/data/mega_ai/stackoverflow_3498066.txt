I am by no means an expert with time series data, but this code worked for me: #The binning by month, saving as a date x$month With my suggestions, you end up highlighting zero with a line, and the y-axes are symmetrical around 0. I changed the x-axis minor gridlines to "month", because the bar for each month extended a few weeks in each direction, which isn't actually meaningful for how the data is aggregated. Edit: Of course, most of this code was just to create the monthly sums. If your date data is in a date format, the date scales are automatically used for the axes. To change up the major x breaks and their format, you do so with scale_x_date() p + scale_x_date(major = "month", format = "%b") #or p + scale_x_date(major = "month", format = "%B %Y") See ?strftime for details on what the format strings mean.
