Manage out-of-JVM agent pool and communication

I need to managed a pool of agents from my application. All are written in Java but the agents need to run in their own JVM. I wrote a proof of concept that starts the subprocesses and uses the stdout/stdin to send commands and keep-alive information. I also open a socket connection for data transfer. I guess that some connection pooling libraries should be able to help in the management of the agents. What about the communication between the agents and the main process ? Using TCP with XML messages (JAXB) is not really as reliable or convenient as I would like. Any suggestion for a better library to assist here ? I could very well write what I need myself but I'm sure other people have done that way better already.
