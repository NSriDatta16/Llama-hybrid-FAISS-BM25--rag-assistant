I don't think you can override the check on whether the certificate name matches the server name. Some agents allow you to manually override after the warnings, but unless WCF has a setting to disable certificate validation with all the dangers that brings. SSL is designed first and foremost for the client to be able to validate which server it is talking to, otherwise you will be open to all sorts of vulnerabilities (including man-in-the-middle and fake servers).
