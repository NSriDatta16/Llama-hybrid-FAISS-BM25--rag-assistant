If you're representing beliefs coherently with numbers you're Bayesian by definition. There are at least 46656 different kinds of Bayesian (counted here: http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf ) but "quantitatively updating beliefs" is the one thing that unites them; if you do that, you're in the Bayesian club. Also, if you want to update beliefs, you have to update using Bayes rule; otherwise you'll be incoherent and get dutch-booked. Kinda funny how the one true path to normative rationality still admits so many varieties though. Even though Bayesians have a monopoly on 'belief' (by definition) they don't have a monopoly on "strength of evidence". There's other ways you can quantify that, motivating the kind of language given in your example. Deborah Mayo goes into this in detail in "Statistical Inference as Severe Testing". Her preferred option is "severity". In the severity framework you don't ever quantify your beliefs, but you do get to say "this claim has been severely tested" or "this claim has not been severely tested" and you can add to severity incrementally by applying multiple tests over time. That sure feels a lot like strengthening belief; you just don't get to use that exact word to describe it (because the Bayesians own the word 'belief' now). And it really is a different thing, so it's good to avoid the possible terminology collision: what you get from high severity is good error control rates, not 'true(er) beliefs'. It behaves a lot like belief in the way it is open to continual updating though! Being picky about not calling it 'belief' is purely on the (important) technicality of not dealing in states-of-knowledge, distinguishing it from the thing Bayesians do. Mayo writes and links to plenty more on this at https://errorstatistics.com/ Sounds like you might enjoy "Bernoulli's Fallacy" by Aubrey Clayton: it's pretty accessible popsci but really cuts to the roots of this question.
