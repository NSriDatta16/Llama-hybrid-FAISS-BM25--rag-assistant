I believe the assumption you've made is incorrect (the whole row being anomalous or not). To explain this thoroughly, you would need to know which algorithm you're using in order to detect whether or not the final label is 0 or 1 . For anomaly detection, you can approach the problem as a Supervised (pretty much classification problem), Unsupervised or Semi-Supervised. Assuming from your data, you've chosen the unsupervised approach. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection An unsupervised anomaly detection has a plethora of algorithm subsets; Distance Based, Statistical, Classification, Angle Based, DBscan, Neural Networks and more. Under those subsets lie algorithms that can help detect anomalous values such as unique NN architectures etc. Some algorithms (most of the ones I've used) have some form of dimensionality reduction such as PCA. Due to that fact, its a lot more difficult to grasp whether a specific column (e.g Sensor 1 is anomalous on its own) A better way to wrap your head around how/why a datapoint is tagged anomalous or not would be to plot a t-SNE graph. If you're interested in me editing my answer to create an anomaly detection model that tags data points as anomaly or not (along with the anomaly score for you to be able to set your personal threshold) and plotting a t-SNE graph, let me know.
