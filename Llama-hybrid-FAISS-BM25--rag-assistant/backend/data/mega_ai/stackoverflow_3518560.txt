how can I parse a UDP packet in .NET?

how can I parse a UDP packet in .NET? I'm using PCap.Net to capture packets, in this case UDP packets, which I can access from the PCap.net object via (PcapDotNet.packets.Ethernet.IpV4.Udp). How can I take the results, the Udp packet, and parse this? In particular to unbundle DNS requests and responses that occur that are housed within a UDP packet. Is there a library that could help here? EDIT : To be more specific what I want to be able to do is extract the IP address from the DNS response, and based on examination using Wireshark it would be by: (a) Input: Payload of a UDP packet that is a DNS response (b) Processing: Parse out the DNS response portion of the UDP packet. Find the Answers portion, within this find the answer record for which the type is A (Host Address) [not a CNAME record], then with this answer record get the IP address. (c) Return: The IP address from the DNS response.
