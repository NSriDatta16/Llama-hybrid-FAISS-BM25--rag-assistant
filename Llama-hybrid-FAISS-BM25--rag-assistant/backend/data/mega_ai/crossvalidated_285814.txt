How to determine whether a variable has a positive or negative effect on the model?

I was told that gradient boosting and random forest cannot determine this using the feature importance score. What is the best way to figure this out? And just to make sure, if a variable had a very large negative effect on the model, would it still show up as having high feature importance?
