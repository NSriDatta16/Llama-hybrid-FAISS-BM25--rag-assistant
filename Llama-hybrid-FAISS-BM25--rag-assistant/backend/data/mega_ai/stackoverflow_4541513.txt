1) customer reports problem with application Several ways this can be done. If your customer is external to your organization, you'll probably want a custom web front-end that ties into creating workitems via the API. Otherwise, you can use Work Item Web Access, which is included with your TFS installation. 2) application of the appropriate version is installed on a virtual machine For this, you're probably looking at Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate and the Test and Lab management piece. Getting set up to use this is probably outside the scope of a SO response. 3) developer repros bug attaching to process on virtual machine and leveraging source server (symbol server?) on corporate domain. Again, Test / Lab management. 4) developer pinpoints problem fixes bug in workspace. TFS 5) developer performs a dll swap on VM to test changes? (side topic, not sure on this) Development branch build with automated deployment. May be able to do this with Test/Lab management, or may have to do some scripting within your build. Scripting installs is relatively straightforward with TFS custom actions. 6) normal development/source control workflows. TFS source control and work items. Installation and initial configuration of TFS is relatively straightforward with TFS 2010. Best practices will probably require a lot of reading and a mentor / consultant or two to get you through it.
