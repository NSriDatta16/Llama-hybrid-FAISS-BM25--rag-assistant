Pay attention to the tests' null hypotheses. The Durbin-Watson test only looks at autocorrelation at lag $1$ , while the Breusch-Godfrey test looks at all autocorrelations up to lag $h$ . If you can rule out autocorrelations beyond order $1$ a priori (which may or may not be the case depending on your application), the Durbin-Watson test will be sufficient. Otherwise, only the Breusch-Godfrey test will provide you the relevant flexibility.
