Yes, vector is designed so you can do this, use &myVec[0] to get an int* . You can also use vector's iterator type, which behaves similarly. (Pointers are valid random-access iterators.) That you're using the default allocator, or any other allocator, doesn't change any of this, it's a required part of vector's interface. Vectors are guaranteed to use contiguous storage. In particular from those many results, check this one from Stroustrup himself.
