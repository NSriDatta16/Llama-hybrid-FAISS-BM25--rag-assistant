How to evaluate a histogram?

Let's say I have the histogram above which reports performances of some neural networks. The y axis is the bin size, while the x axis is the error, so low errors = high performance. Out of these 15 networks, how would I go about selecting the best one? Looking at the mean or the median error comes to mind, but I can think of many cases where mean and the median could be misleading. Is there a way to pick the consistently high performing network? Here it is obvious that MLP 10 has the best performance, but sometimes evaluating a network becomes much harder. The data is not necessarily normally distributed.
