When plotting predictions over linear predictors, what's a "informative" range for linear predictor values?

When plotting predictions over linear predictors, what's a "informative" range for linear predictor values? The reason to ask is this: This is a very common plot in logistic regression, but isn't the range of -4 to 4 a bit uninformative? Like what does e.g. lin. predictor == -4 mean? So is this the only way to plot this? Is the x-axis inferable in some "informative" way?
