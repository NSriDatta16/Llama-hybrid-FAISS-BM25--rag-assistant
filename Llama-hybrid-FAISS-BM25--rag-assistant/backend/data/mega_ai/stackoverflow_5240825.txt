well you could hack it yourself (if I understand what you need correctly) $text = "hello, I am text and this is another paragraph, please do some cool stuff with this (this is after a line break) last apragrahp..."; $text = str_replace("\r\n","\n",$text); $paragraphs = preg_split("/[\n]{2,}/",$text); foreach ($paragraphs as $key => $p) { $paragraphs[$key] = " ".str_replace("\n"," ",$paragraphs[$key])." "; } $text = implode("", $paragraphs); echo $text; That will actually output this: hello, I am text and this is another paragraph, please do some cool stuff with this (this is after a line break) last apragrahp... Notice how it's missing all the newlines etc. now...
