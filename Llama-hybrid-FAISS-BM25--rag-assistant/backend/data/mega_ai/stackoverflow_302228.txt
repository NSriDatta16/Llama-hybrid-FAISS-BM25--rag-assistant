If you were using C# 4, you could make use of the new dynamic functionality to achieve an interesting alternative. I'm not saying this is better, in fact it seems very likely that it would be slower, but it does have a certain elegance to it. class Thing { void Foo(A a) { a.Hop(); } void Foo(B b) { b.Skip(); } } And the usage: object aOrB = Get_AOrB(); Thing t = GetThing(); ((dynamic)t).Foo(aorB); The reason this works is that a C# 4 dynamic method invocation has its overloads resolved at runtime rather than compile time. I wrote a little more about this idea quite recently . Again, I would just like to reiterate that this probably performs worse than all the other suggestions, I am offering it simply as a curiosity.
