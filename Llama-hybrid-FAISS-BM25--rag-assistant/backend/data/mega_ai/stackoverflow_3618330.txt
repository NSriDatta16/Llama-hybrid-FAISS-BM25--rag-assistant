What is the format of svn-settings.xml for use with Maven SCM plugin?

I'm trying to externalize my username and password but it seems the format of svn-settings.xml is incorrect. I can't find any resources on the web except this post here and following that gives an error. In my pom.xml I got org.apache.maven.plugins maven-scm-plugin 1.4 ... scm:svn:http://my_hostname/im-tools-repos/trunk ${project.build.directory}/checkout/im-tools In C:\Documents and Settings\my_uid.scm\svn-settings.xml I got my_uid my_pwd When I run Maven it fails with these messages: C:\Documents and Settings\my_uid\.scm\svn-settings.xml isn't well formed. SKIPPED.Unrecognised tag: 'user' (position: START_TAG seen \r\n\t ... @2:7) [INFO] Executing: cmd.exe /X /C "svn --non-interactive checkout http://my_hostname/im-tools-repos/trunk C:\test\bamboo\agent\target\checkout\im-tools" [INFO] Working directory: C:\test\bamboo\agent\target\checkout [ERROR] Provider message: [ERROR] The svn command failed. [ERROR] Command output: [ERROR] svn: OPTIONS of 'http://my_hostname/im-tools-repos/trunk': authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (http://my_hostname) So, what should I use instead of ?
