Some good ressources are: The Cucumber Wiki https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/ The Cucmber Wiki contains a lot of information on how to write Gherkin specifications (resp. examples like some BDD-jargons would call them) The RSpec Book http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book This book has some very concrete tips on how to use Cucumber, a lot is applicable for other Gherkin- or BDD-tools in general. Book: Bridging the Communication Gap On Amazon , Book Page A great book by Gojko Adzic about the concepts and the process of Specification by Example Upcoming Book: Specification by Example The new book of Gojko Adzic containing detailed information and experiences about applying "Specification by Example" in the real world.
