You probably need to point the qTip plugin to an url that will return an html fragment containing a link to the image and not directly to the image. The fragment might look like this: I don't think that qTip supports fetching images directly. Think of it: an AJAX request is sent and if the server returns a binary array representing the image using javascript this binary array cannot be shown (unless you use the data uri scheme which is not very common).
