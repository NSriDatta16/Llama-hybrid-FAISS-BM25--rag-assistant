You can fake your menustrip, for example using a panel with a label instead. And then you can handle this manually: when the user clicks the label, a popup menu will open, and when the user drags the label, the window will move. But I would advise against such workarounds, because it's not a standard GUI behavior, and you might get your users confused.
