Increase and decrease in depth of CNN blocks

Please see the image below as an example. To my understanding, the 1 n n image is converted to 500*n~ * n~ with the help of 500 kernels applied on the same image. What I am confused about is how in the next step our output gets to be with depth from 500 to 200. Can someone please guide me of the operations involved. Thanks in advance
