GPS signal cleaning & road network matching

I'm using GPS units and mobile computers to track individual pedestrians' travels. I'd like to in real time "clean" the incoming GPS signal to improve its accuracy. Also, after the fact, not necessarily in real time, I would like to "lock" individuals' GPS fixes to positions along a road network. Have any techniques, resources, algorithms, or existing software to suggest on either front? A few things I am already considering in terms of signal cleaning: - drop fixes for which num. of satellites = 0 - drop fixes for which speed is unnaturally high (say, 600 mph) And in terms of "locking" to the street network (which I hear is called "map matching"): - lock to the nearest network edge based on root mean squared error - when fixes are far away from road network, highlight those points and allow user to use a GUI (OpenLayers in a Web browser, say) to drag, snap, and drop on to the road network Thanks for your ideas!
