Just to make sure I understand Requirements: 1. Store user specific settings for your application in a file or in a database 2. From time to time, you may add additional properties. Is this web based? win forms?, wcf? My initial thought is to include a version number when persisting. Each time you update the settings class, create a new settings class that inherits from the last version. Add your new properties and update the version number. Storage: In a DB, two fields: 1- version 2- serialized settings data. In a file, two entries 1- version 2- serialized settings data. When serializing , make sure to include the settings class version number. When deserializing , use a Factory to retrieve the correct version of the settings class. One thing to keep in mind is that you would have to account for older settings instances in your application. If you add a "Background Color" property today, none of the settings files from before today will have access to it. You'll need to ensure the application can handle that situation. So if the Factory finds an older version of the settings class, it can use the saved data to create the newest version of the class and fill the new properties with default values. Good Luck, Patrick
