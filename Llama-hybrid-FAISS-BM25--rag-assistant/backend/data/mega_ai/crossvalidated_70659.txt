do a spectrum estimate(How? depends on your process, you might need some multi tapering method.) and fit your function to it. use wavelet, calculate wavelet variance, which is like spectrum but integrated over a band, then fit the integrated line to it. Similar to wavelet, but make use of the fact that wavelet approximated de-correlats, different frequency band for stationary process, figure out the approximated likelihood function to your process by assuming Gaussian, and do a maximum likelihood estimation. All of these can be found in the book Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis by Percival and Walden.
