The ActionScript 3 spec says all public names from the package will imported if you use the '*'. So there is a hit, although it may not be a large one depending on the package size. The ActionScript Design Patterns book also discourages this due to excess baggage, as well as some Adobe ActionScript tips . That being said, I took one as component in an app I wrote and import mx.containers.*; import mx.events.*; import mx.managers.*; Instead of the single class names. My size increased by 3 bytes. Now, the entire app is 935kB, so I probably have those classes imported elsewhere, and the hit wasn't very big. I bet the smaller your application is, the larger the impact on your compile size will be(percentage wise).
