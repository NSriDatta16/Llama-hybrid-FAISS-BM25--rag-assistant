Random Forest predictions in R

I'm trying to wrap my head around why I get different predictions in R for the following situation: Model 0.007752 predict(Model, type = 'response', newdata = MY_DATA[1,]) 0.007887 Shouldn't these lines produce the same result since they're predicting from the same variable values?
