Help me organize my rubies

So I think I have a bunch of rubies scattered around here. I want to install rails 3 and watch the railscast online and the person uses rvm to manage ruby versions. I went to install rvm and followed the instruction. I got to the point where I need to do rvm install 1.9.2 EDIT: and I did rvm 1.9.2 However after the installation, I try ruby -v and get ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [universal-darwin10.0] I also go and do which ruby and get /usr/bin/ruby How do I set up my path so that I can use the ruby that is installed using rvm? inside /Users/denniss/.rvm/bin I have the ruby-1.9.2-rc2 and my .profile looks like export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/android/tools" export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/rubystack/apache2/bin" export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" export PATH="/Users/denniss/.rvm/bin/:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
