Logistic Regression inversely proportional correlation

This is more of a clarification question than anything else, but I am familiar that when dealing with regression algorithms it is useful to eliminate features that are highly correlated. I have been reading that this stays true for both highly +/- features. In a data science interview question video I saw a few months back asked a question on inversely correlated features and I believe the answer was that if two features are inversely proportional then they can both be fed into a logit model. Is this true?
