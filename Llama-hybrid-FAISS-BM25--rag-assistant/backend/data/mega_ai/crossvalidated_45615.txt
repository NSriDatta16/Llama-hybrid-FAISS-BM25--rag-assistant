Is $\sum_{m}P_{M|A}(m,a)$ the probability mass function of random variable $A$?

Suppose I have a conditional discrete distribution $P_{M|A}(m,a)$. If I take sum over $m$, i.e. $\sum_{m}P_{M|A}(m,a)$, do I get $f_A(a)$, where $f_A(a)$ is the pmf of the random variable A? Thanks for clarifying. I am trying to read about graphical models from http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec2.pdf . Here are the equations I am confused about: \begin{align} &∑_e∑_a∑_{mp}E(e)p_B(b)p_{A|EB}(a,e,b)p_{J|A}(true,a)p_{M|A}(m,a) \\ &\qquad = ∑_e∑_{ap}E(e)p_B(b)p_{A|E}B(a,e,b)p_{J|A}(true,a)∑_mp_{M|A}(m,a) \\ &\qquad = ∑_e∑_{ap}E(e)p_B(b)p_{A|EB}(a,e,b)p_{J|A}(true,a)ψ_A(a) \end{align} I am assuming $ψ_A(a)$ is pmf of $A$, and there comes the question, that how to marginalize a conditional density function. Ideally, $\sum_mp_{M|A}(m,a)$ should be equal to 1. What am I missing? (I have asked this as a new question here: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/45622/marginalizing-a-conditional-distribution-for-bayesian-networks .)
