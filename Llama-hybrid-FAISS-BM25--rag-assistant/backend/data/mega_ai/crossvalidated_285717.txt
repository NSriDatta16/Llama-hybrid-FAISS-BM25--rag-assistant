To use the information you have, you can create a classifier whether it is the last visit or not. A recurrent neural network may be a very good choice. Input data: sequences of times of visit. Output data: was/wasn't it the last visit. Having that classifier, you can examine e.g. the ROC or precision-recall curves and set the threshold according to your expectations.
