Binary classification statistical significance

Consider a binary classification task and a trained model (e.g. logistic regression) gives predicted labels. The predictions can be done on a hold out test set or obtained using a cross-validation scheme. My question: is it possible to put a statistical significance on the prediction performance? Two possibilities come to mind, either using Fisher's exact test or the McNemar's test (as the labels are paired) on the confusion matrix. Any of these make sense? Note that this is a different problem than comparing models as described here for example. EDIT Found permutation tests in this direction: Permutation Tests for Classification
