We are advising to work with roles as it has a couple of advantages a. You can setup the complete configuration based on roles. For instance you might have a workflow transition 'validated' which can only be executed by someone who is a tester. You have the choice to add a transition condition 'user is in group tester' or 'user has the role tester'. If you are working in an organisation where users have different roles in different projects, choosing the first transition condition (user is in group tester) will not work (or you would need a new workflow for each project) The same applies for notifications. You can configure a notification on the 'issue resolved' event, specifying that the 'users in group tester' get notified or 'users who have the role tester'. When using roles, adding someone to a project is very simple - just check what role the person has in the project, add them in the project configuration (view members) and you are done. He will have the right permissions, get the right notifications ... b. Configuration When you use roles for configuration, you don't need system administration rights to add someone to a project. The project lead will be able to add the user. No need to bother the system admin. Looking at your description, I would have A project role 'employee' A project role 'customer' A group 'employees' configure the project role such that the group employees is a default member of the project role employee This way you can use the same permission scheme for all projects. When adding a new project, you just need to add the client specific userid to the client role. When a new employee start, you add him to the employees group. The day that you have a specific, ultra secret project, where only a couple of employees need to have access, you can remove the group 'employees' from the role 'employee' and add the specific users to the role. Hope this helps Francis
