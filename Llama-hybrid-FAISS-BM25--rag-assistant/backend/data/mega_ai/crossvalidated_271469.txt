Which machine learning algorithms can do multi-categories classification?

as a ML Newbie, I'm interested in which machine learning algorithms can do multi-categories classification? Are there different techniques for fewer categories (3) and more categories? And what are the preprocessing required in R or python packages, is it necessary to turn everything into numerical? Thanks.
