Primary Key Change Force Foreign Key Changes

I have an issue I am working with an existing SQL Server 2008 database: I need to occasionally change the primary key value for some existing records in a table. Unfortunately, there are about 30 other tables with foreign key references to this table. What is the most elegant way to change a primary key and related foreign keys? I am not in a situation where I can change the existing key structure, so this is not an option. Additionally, as the system is expanded, more tables will be related to this table, so maintainability is very important. I am looking for the most elegant and maintainable solution, and any help is greatly appreciated. I so far have thought about using Stored Procedures or Triggers, but I wanted some advice before heading in the wrong direction. Thanks!
