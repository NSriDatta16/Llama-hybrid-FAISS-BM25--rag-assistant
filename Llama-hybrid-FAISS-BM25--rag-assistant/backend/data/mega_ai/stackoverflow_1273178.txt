I did some benchmarking with Oracle express edition 10.2.0.1.0 I used this script to fill table ticket with 1179648 rows: create table ticket (id,assigned_to) as select 100, 'raju' from dual union all select 101, 'raju' from dual union all select 102, 'raju' from dual union all select 103, 'anil' from dual union all select 104, 'anil' from dual union all select 105, 'sam' from dual union all select 106, 'raju' from dual union all select 107, 'raju' from dual union all select 108, 'anil' from dual / begin for i in 1..17 loop insert into ticket select id + (select count(*) from ticket), assigned_to from ticket; end loop; end; / commit; SQL> select count(*) from ticket; COUNT(*) ---------- 1179648 Rob van Wijk's select statement takes 1.6 seconds on average, Mesays's select statement 2.8 seconds on average, Micheal Pravda's select statement 4.2 seconds and Andrew from NZSG's statement 9.6 seconds on average. So a pipelined function is slower in Oracle XE. Or maybe someone has to improve the pipelined function...?
