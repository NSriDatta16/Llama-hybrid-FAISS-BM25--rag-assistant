Is a C++ preprocessor identical to a C preprocessor?

I am wondering how different the preprocessors for C++ and C are. The reason for the question is this question on a preprocessor-specific question where the paragraph of the standard that addresses the question has a different wording (and a different paragraph number) and also are difference concerning the true and false keywords in C++. So, are there more differences or is this the only difference. An extension of the question would be when is a source file emitted differently by a C++ preprocessor and a C preprocessor.
