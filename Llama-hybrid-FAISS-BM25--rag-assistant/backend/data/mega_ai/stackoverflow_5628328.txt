My understanding is that if you want simple support for a recent version of OpenGL you'll have to leave Windows-land, so try take it in stride when getting started is ... complicated. I think OpenGL is probably the right choice. You might also want to consider DirectX (which is better supported on Windows), but I'm personally not a big fan of it. You could also learn C# and use XNA, but if you want to learn C++ it just defeats the purpose. (I also can't help mentioning there's a good chance you could make it fast enough without C++) I have to agree with the others that NeHe's tutorials are pretty much classic. You might also want to consider the OpenGL Red Book , but that costs money. Regarding the 3rd paragraph, GLUT is old (and for that matter so is GLU), but if you see a good tutorial that uses them, I don't see anything wrong with them. Once you have your feet wet you might want to consider ditching GLUT and using SDL which I believe is a lot more 'alive'. As far as GLEW goes, I've used it with success and it's nice if you want to do something fancy like shaders on Windows. However, I would say don't worry about it at first, because it will increase your setup time and keep you from getting to the fun stuff :)
