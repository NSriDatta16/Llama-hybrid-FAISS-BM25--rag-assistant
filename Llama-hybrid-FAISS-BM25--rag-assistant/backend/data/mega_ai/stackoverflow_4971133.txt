I don't think blob storage is suitable for caching. It can still be used in certain situations, but generally you wan't your cache to be as fast as possible. You should use appfabric cache or memory cache. Memory cache might sound bad in multi instance environment, but there are certainly cases where you can use it, depends on what exactly you need. About that code.. you are making 3 transactions here (in case that blob exists). You could try to call getBlobData immediately and in case of NotFound error return false. I don't know how good is php with exception handling, but I doubt it is slower than whole request to blob storage.
