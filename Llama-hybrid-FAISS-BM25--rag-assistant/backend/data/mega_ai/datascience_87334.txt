I have been frequently using both the platforms and could straightaway point a few differences: Kaggle gives NVIDIA Tesla P100 PCI based 16GB GPUS for approximately 9 straight hrs in a single commit, whereas Colab provides NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU 12 GB for 12hrs. Kaggle has a limitation of 5 GB hard-drive space vs Colab's storage could vary from 30GB to 72GB as per the availability. Kaggle provides TPU v3-8 with whereas Colab has not disclosed its TPU version anywhere. I almost never required to install any third-party package for any of my data science work, whereas in Colab it gets frustrating sometimes (Broken dependencies and package incompatibilities). Kaggle cons : Weekly limit to GPU and TPU usage. (Although this limit is almost sufficient for basic training) Limited storage (If you go above 5GB, you will face a kernel crash) Colab cons: Not consistent in performance as it changes hardware resources as per the availability in the pool. I have also faced issues where if you use your notebook kernel for above 12hrs, Colab reduces the hardware grant in further commits and degrades the performance. The only best thing in Colab is the drive mounting facility which is very handy at times. Kaggle on the other hand if very handy if you adapt to the interface and its API.
