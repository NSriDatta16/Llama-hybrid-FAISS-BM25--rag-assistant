This is a peculiar property of your transition matrix, but it doesn't have to be that way. If your system satisfies $\pi_A P(B|A) = \pi_B P(A|B)$ for all states $A$ and $B$ , your system is said to satisfy the property of detailed balance . Transition matrices that satisfy this property, are called reversible . But there are Markov chains with stationary distributions that don't satisfy this property. E.g., you could try to find a chain that has as stationary distribution the uniform distribution but a transition matrix that is not symmetric. That means, find a transition matrix where all rows and all columns sum to one, but that is not symmetric. A simple example would be: $$ T = \left[\begin{matrix} 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.8 \\ 0.2 & 0.8 & 0 \\ 0.7 & 0.1 & 0.2 \\ \end{matrix}\right]. $$ Clearly, the stationary distribution is the uniform distribution $\pi_U = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$ , and this Markov chain is not reversible. A good, short introduction to Markov chains can be found e.g. in Bishop, Christopher M., and Nasser M. Nasrabadi. Pattern recognition and machine learning. Vol. 4. No. 4. New York: springer, 2006.
