After having read the paper again in-depth, I found the answers to my questions: Answer to first question Yes, it's (much) better to use the 1. formula, that is, calculate the macro F1 as average over class-wise F1 scores . The other macro F1 formula (harmonic mean over class-wise precision and recall averages) can lead to overly-optimistic scores because it is quite easily biased by specific particularities of the error type distribution. The 1. formula does not suffer from this issue. Answer to second question Quite surprisingly to me, the maximum difference is 0.5 on a scale [0,1], or, equivalently, 50 on a scale [0,100]. This means that the two macro F1 formulas can lead to extremely different scores when evaluating classifiers .
