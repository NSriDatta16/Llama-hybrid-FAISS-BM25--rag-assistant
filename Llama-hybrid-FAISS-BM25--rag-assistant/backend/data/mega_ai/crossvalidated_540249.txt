How should you use scaled weights with svydesign() in the survey package in R?

I am using the survey package in R to analyse the "Understanding Society" social survey. The main user guide for the dataset specifies (on page 45) that the weights have been scaled to have a mean of 1. When using the svydesign() function, I am passing the weight variable to the weight argument. In the survey package documentation , under the surveysummary() function, it states: Note that the design effect will be incorrect if the weights have been rescaled so that they are not reciprocals of sampling probabilities. Will I therefore get incorrect estimates when using functions such as svyglm() etc? This came to my attention because, when using the psrsq() function to get the Pseudo R-Squared of a model, I received the following error: Weights appear to be scaled: rsquared may be wrong Update: this has been answered here
