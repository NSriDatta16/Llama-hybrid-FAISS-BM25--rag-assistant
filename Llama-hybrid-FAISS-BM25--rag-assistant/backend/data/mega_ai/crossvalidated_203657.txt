From what I understand, Frequentists interpret probability as the long-run average of this value. Well, isn't that what the expectation is? Okay - frequentists interpret probability as the expectation for that value. No. If $\Pr(X=x_i) = p_i$, then expected value of $X$ is $$ E[X] = x_1 p_1 + \dots + x_n p_n $$ As you can see, expected value is defined in terms of random variable $X$, not of some value $x_i$. If you were interested in "probability of the random variable itself", then it does not have much meaning since it leads to $$ \Pr \left(\bigcup_i x_i \right) = \Pr(\Omega) = \sum_i \Pr\left( x_i \right) = 1$$ by Kolmogorov's axioms of probability . As you can see, this has nothing to do with expectation. Moreover, probabilities need to be bounded in $[0, 1]$, while random variables can have any values (e.g. for normal distribution $x \in \mathbb{R}$).
