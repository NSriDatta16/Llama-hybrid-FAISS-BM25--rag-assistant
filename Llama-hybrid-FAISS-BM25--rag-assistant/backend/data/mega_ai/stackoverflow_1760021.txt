OK. I think I find a way to pass parameters to my script and debug in PowerGUI. It is not visible from menu items. However, if you click on customize toolbar, you will find out one from "ScriptsParameterCommand" command. You just drag it to the toolbar. Then type in any parameters in the "input script parameters here" toolbar icon, a text box. Type in parameters. Finally press enter key. I run my script in debug mode and it does stop at the debug points! Actually, I got this help from this article: Features of PowerGUI Script Editor
