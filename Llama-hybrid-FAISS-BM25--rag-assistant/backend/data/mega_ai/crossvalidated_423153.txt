Cyclicality in time series

The high amount of cyclicality in the lynx time series makes it very difficult to model with ets and auto.arima . library(forecast) library(fpp2) data(lynx) train Questions: Are there other methods that I should try in the forecast package? How do I change the legend in autoplot() and autolayer() to show "ARIMA Forecast" and "Actual"?
