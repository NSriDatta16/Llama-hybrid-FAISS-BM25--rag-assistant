Make a link activate on doubleclick only

I'm building a very simple web-based file browser for my website. I've styled my links to look like files and I want to be able to single-click to select them so I can do things like rename etc, and I want to be able to double-click to actually activate the link and download the file. I've come up with the following, but it looks ugly. Does anyone have a more elegant solution? Untitled Document function nullClick() { //do select stuff return false; } function dolink(link) { window.location(link.href); } Clicky
