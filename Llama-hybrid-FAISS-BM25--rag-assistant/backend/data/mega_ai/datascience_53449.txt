When you say feature reduction i guess that you mean dimensionality reduction. The difference between feature selection and dimensionality reduction is that the set of features created by feature selection must be a subset of the original set of features, and the set created by dimensionality reduction doesn't have to be a subset of the original set of features (e.g. see PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction)
