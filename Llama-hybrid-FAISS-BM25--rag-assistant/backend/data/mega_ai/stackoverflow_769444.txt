Session as a state storage method is rough in high traffic systems for several reasons. First, the default Session storage method is in-process, meaning that if you have a load-balanced web farm, you'll constantly 'lose' Session information as a user gets pages served from different servers. The in-proc Session server also dies when an app pool is recycled, which happens more often on higher traffic servers. The scalability options for Session data are Use the freely available ASP.NET Session Server and point all your applications at it Use SQL Server to store Session data. Due to the nature of Session data in general, neither of these is a very good option for a very high traffic site (unless you have unlimited money to throw at the hardware).
