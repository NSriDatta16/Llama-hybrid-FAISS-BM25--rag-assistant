The answer to your question should logicaly be "Yes." The group means of the PC should differ from the PC of the means. This should happen for two reasons. You're transforming your variables into PCs, which try to maximize the total interia. This depends on the spread of the data in the different variables. Once you take the means you eliminate most of the inertia. The PCA will be much more "accurate" (not surprisingly almost 100% of the intertia is explained by the first component), but the composition of the PC will be different because there is no longer much intertia to explain. You can think of this in terms of how a PCA operates. The PCA is computed using squared distances, maximized for the first PCA. If you remove all this variability, the estimations change.
