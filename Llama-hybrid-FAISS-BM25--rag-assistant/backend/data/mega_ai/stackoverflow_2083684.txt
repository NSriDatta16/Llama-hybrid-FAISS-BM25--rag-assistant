How can I add an editor without IEditorInput into a RCP application?

I'd like to add an editor to an RCP application. I need to leverage the advanced features of editor, such as keywords highlighting. But it seems that editor have to be associated with an IEditorInput, but I just do not need to persistence the text, store it in memory is OK for me. Is there any way to do that ? Thanks -- Best Regards Jeff Zhang
