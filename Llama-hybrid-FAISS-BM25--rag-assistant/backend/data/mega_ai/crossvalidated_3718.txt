There is no mysterious reason. If you multiply a bunch of numbers between 0 an 1, the result will forcibly be close to 0. The average result for RAND()*RAND()*RAND()*RAND()*RAND()*RAND() should be something close to (0.5^6), that is, 0.015625. Be careful using Excel's RAND() function, though. It's not the best random number generator in the world.
