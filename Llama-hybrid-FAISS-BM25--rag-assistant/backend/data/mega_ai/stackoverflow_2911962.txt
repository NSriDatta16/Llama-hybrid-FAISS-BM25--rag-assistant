LDAP Query for OU's

Sorry for being an uber pain people, its all very new :( Already had alot of help on this, but don't seem to be able to see the problem, I am trying to populate a combo box with a list of all the current OU's, later to send each machine within that OU a shutdown command. (Acquiring AD OU list & Active Directory list OU's) were my previous Q's. string defaultNamingContext; //TODO 0 - Acquire and display the available OU's DirectoryEntry rootDSE = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://RootDSE"); defaultNamingContext = rootDSE.Properties["defaultNamingContext"].Value.ToString(); DirectoryEntry entryToQuery = new DirectoryEntry ("LDAP://" + defaultNamingContext); MessageBox.Show(entryToQuery.Path.ToString()); DirectorySearcher ouSearch = new DirectorySearcher(entryToQuery.Path); ouSearch.Filter = "(objectCatergory=organizationalUnit)"; ouSearch.SearchScope = SearchScope.Subtree; ouSearch.PropertiesToLoad.Add("name"); SearchResultCollection allOUS = ouSearch.FindAll(); foreach (SearchResult oneResult in allOUS) { //comboBox1.Items.Add(oneResult.ToString()); comboBox1.Items.Add(oneResult.Properties["name"][0]); } I have been through and debugged everything i know, the searcher isn't picking up any results, hence why nothing is populated in the combo box.
