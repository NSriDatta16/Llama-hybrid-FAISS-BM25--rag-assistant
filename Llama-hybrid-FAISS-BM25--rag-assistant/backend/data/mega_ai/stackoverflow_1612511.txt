Insert OpenXmlElement after word bookmark in Open XML SDK

I was able to access a bookmark in my word document using this code: var res = from bm in mainPart.Document.Body.Descendants () where bm.Name == "BookmarkName" select bm; Now I want to insert a paragraph and a table after this bookmark. How do I do that? (example code would be appreciated)
