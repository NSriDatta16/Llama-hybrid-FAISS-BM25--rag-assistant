The AUC is scale independant. It is solely based on ranks. If you multiply all the probabilities outputed by your logistic regression by the same factor $\lambda\in(0,1]$, the AUC will remain the same. Note that as $\lambda\rightarrow0$ the pseudo $R^2$ will decrease (possibly becoming negative). So you can have a low pseudo $R^2$ but a large AUC.
