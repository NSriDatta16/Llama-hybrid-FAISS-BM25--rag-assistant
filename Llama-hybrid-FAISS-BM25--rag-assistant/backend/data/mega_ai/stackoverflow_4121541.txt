Infragistics, Telerik or devexpress .. which one is better then others?

We are planning to purchase third part controls for Asp.net and WPF both. we short list Infragistics, Telerik, devexpress. But now have to decide that which one to purchase from these three. I Google about the disadvantages or week points of these controls but I want some solid reason to select one or reject others. I want to know the users experience about these controls, which could be helpful for me to take decision. thanks
