Should I put my XML nodes in container elements?

I'm creating an XML hierarchy that looks something like this: element A 0+ element B 0+ element C (has PCDATA) (more complex hierarchy below this one, not really relevant) 0+ element D 0+ element E 0+ element F 0-1 element G (has PCDATA) 0-1 element H (has PCDATA) As a result, it's starting to look a little "crowded" under element A. Should I add container elements to organize things a bit, like so: element A 0-1 B-container 0+ element B 0-1 C-container 0+ element C (has PCDATA) (more complex hierarchy below this one, not really relevant) 0-1 D-container 0+ element D 0-1 E-container 0+ element E 0-1 F-container 0+ element F 0-1 element G (has PCDATA) 0-1 element H (has PCDATA) Or is it fine to have a bunch of different elements underneath element A? This XML needs to be consumed by XSL stylesheets mostly written by users, so I'm trying to figure out what makes it easiest for users to interact with.
