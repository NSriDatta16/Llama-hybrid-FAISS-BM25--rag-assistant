WP7 Data Storage-- lots of data

I am going to be creating a WP7 app that needs to store a decent amount of data. Specifically, blocks of text (short article length), and more than 50-500 at any one time. I am a PHP guy, so I would use MySQL if I were doing this on a server, so is there an equivalent database system or data storage system for WP7 that can handle this amount of text? Would IsolatedStorage be ok for this, or do I have to use something else? It doesn't have to be SQL, just something that can handle lots of data. I just used MySQL as an example because it would be (my) ideal choice if this were a server.
