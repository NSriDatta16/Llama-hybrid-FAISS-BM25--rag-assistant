SVM - how can I find the kernel of a specific mapping function

I am studying SVM and I now understand the kernel trick, as we can skip the high dimensional feature space and just use the kernel function. However, if I have a mapping function, how can I find the corresponding kernel? As an additional question, do practitioners often care about the mapping function, or do they just directly engineer valid kernels?
