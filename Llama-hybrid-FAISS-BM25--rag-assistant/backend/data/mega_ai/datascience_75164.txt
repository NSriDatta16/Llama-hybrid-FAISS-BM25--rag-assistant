Main formula for SVM is - $y_i(wx_i +b) \geq d$ In the derivation process, it is changed to 1 to make it standardized for all hyper-plane. If it has to be described, it will be - "Greater than" "per unit of minimum margin distance" Let's suppose, If a hyper-plane has the minimum margin point at 4 Eucledien distance Another one has it at 4.5 Eucledien distance So, this $y_i(wx_i +b) \geq$ 1 means, 1 unit of "every 4 units" for first hyper-plane and 1 unit of "every 4.5 units" for the other hyper-plane What it meant - This is more for Mathematical convenience . Another neatness it added, the maximizing equation changes to 1/ $w$ from F/ $w$ . F is the distance of the point which is nearest to the plane. Why it will not affect point position A plane i.e. $(wx_i +b)$ will not change if we rescale $w$ and $b$ . So we rescaled it in such a way such that F becomes 1. This "1" will be different for different Hyperplanes depending on it's $w$ . Added this screen from Support Vector Machines Succinctly .
