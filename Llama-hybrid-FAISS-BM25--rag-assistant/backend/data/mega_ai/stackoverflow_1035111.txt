Can I customize cloning in Script.aculo.us's ghosting?

I have a Draggable in Script.aculo.us. I'd like to use ghosting, which clones the dragged element, so you appear to be dragging a "ghost" of the element. However, this element contains an iframe. When I begin the drag, the clone's iframe loads, which is annoying. I'd like a chance to remove the iframe from the clone. How can I do that? (Just to complicate matters: the original and the clone appear to have the same id, so I'm not sure how I'd even tell them apart without checking their styling, which seems overly hackish.)
