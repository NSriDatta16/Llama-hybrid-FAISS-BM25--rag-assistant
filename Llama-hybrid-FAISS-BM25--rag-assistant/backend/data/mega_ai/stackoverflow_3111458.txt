Mootools - get form's first input, select etc item

I need to get the first element from a form, could be a select, text, radio etc. I can get all the elements using the following: $('myformcontainer').getElement('form').getElements('select,input[type=text]'); And this returns all my form elements, however the problem is that the items are organised by tag type (in this example; select items would be before any text field, even if the text field is first). How can I sort this array so that the first item in the form is first? Or, a better way of getting them? Btw, I've tried getFirst - it always returns null.
