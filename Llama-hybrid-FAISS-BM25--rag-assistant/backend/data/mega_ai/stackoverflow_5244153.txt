Recreate a graph that change in time

I have an entity in my domain that represent a city electrical network. Actually my model is an entity with a List that contains breakers, transformers, lines. The network change every time a breaker is opened/closed, user can change connections etc... In all examples of CQRS the EventStore is queried with Version and aggregateId. Do you think I have to implement events only for the "network" aggregate or also for every "Connectable" item? In this case when I have to replay all events to get the "actual" status (based on a date) I can have near 10000-20000 events to process. An Event modify one property or I need an Event that modify an object (containing all properties of the object)?
