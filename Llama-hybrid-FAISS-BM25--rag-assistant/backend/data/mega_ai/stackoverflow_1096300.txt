Pylons/Routes rewrite POST or GET to fancy URL

The behavior I propose: A user loads up my "search" page, www.site.com/search, types their query into a form, clicks submit, and then ends up at www.site.com/search/the+query instead of www.site.com/search?q=the+query. I've gone through a lot of the Pylons documentation already and just finished reading the Routes documentation and am wondering if this can/should happen at the Routes layer. I have already set up my application to perform a search when given www.site.com/search/the+query, but can not figure out how to send a form to this destination. Or is this something that should happen inside a controller with a redirect_to()? Or somewhere else? Followup: This is less an actual "set in stone" desire right now and more a curiosity for brainstorming future features. I'm designing an application which uses a Wikipedia dump and have observed that when a user performs a search on Wikipedia and the search isn't too ambiguous it redirects directly to an article link: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple. It is actually performing an in-between HTTP 302 redirect step, and I am just curious if there's a more elegant/cute way of doing this in Pylons.
