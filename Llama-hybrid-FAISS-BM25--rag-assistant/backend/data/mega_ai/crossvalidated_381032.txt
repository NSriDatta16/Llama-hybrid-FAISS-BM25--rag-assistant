The 28 refers to the new dimensions of the images. It equals 28 because there is no padding and you have a 5x5 kernel, so you loose 2 pixels left, right, top and bottom. In order to keep the width and height the same, you would add a padding of 2. Since they chose 20 as the dimension of the output channels, there are now 20 instead of 3. In deep learning in general: some parameters are highly important (learning rate), while some others are almost irrelevant (sometimes). Things like the exact number of channels might sometimes tend to be in the latter group, e.g. 32 channels vs. 28, not really a big deal. but When paper $i+1$ claims to improve over papers $\{1,...,i-1\}$ by marginally improving some performance metric, often just doing thorough parameter tuning on the earlier papers would have helped more. So, yes, these variables matter, but they kind of don't. As long as you don't choose really wild/extreme values for these parameters you'll probably be fine. In articular, the number of "channels" / "filters" , and stride and padding is usually done by: 1) follow existing settings used by other papers because they claim to be good, or 2) try a few settings and compare via some ultimate performance metric, 3) when possible, don't force yourself into choosing one single value, i.e. randomize over some range of those values.
