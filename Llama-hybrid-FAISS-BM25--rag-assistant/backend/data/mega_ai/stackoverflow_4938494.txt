This is an excellent question and often a big misconception about Azure. Azure allows for an ability to adjust amount of compute resources allocated via an REST-API call, but does not automatically adjust your resources for you. What you're talking about, sounds like the dynamic or automatic scalability. It needs to be implemented by yourself (there are dozens of examples out there) or you can utilize a third-party service AzureWatch that can handle most of the scaling scenarios for you. In order to implement dynamic scaling, you may or may not need to think about it upfront. I mean you definitely should think about it, but you may not need to do much about it, depending on your requirements and your ability to work with 3rd party vendors. The hard part about dynamic scalability is not the actual scaling part, but knowing when to scale up and when to scale down. First of all, Azure will kill all the calls to public load-balanced endpoints if the calls are not done within 1 minute. Thus, if your calculations take a longer time, you want to plan for asynchronous calculations and utilize queues. This way allows you to scale up or down based upon queue size. If your calculations are done quickly and your calls are over rather quickly and incoming clients requesting calculations are not asynchronous, you likely want to track average utilization for previous X amount of time and scale up or down based upon that. In your case, I wouldn't go with this approach, as it sounds too restrictive and non-flexible enough. Either way, AzureWatch will work with either pattern or both together.
