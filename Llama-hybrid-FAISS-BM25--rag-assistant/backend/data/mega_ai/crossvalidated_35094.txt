This looks like a case-control study (all cases are sampled, a similar number of controls are sampled at a much lower rate) -- read up Alastair Scott and Chris Wild's s work on this ( book chapter , invited lecture ). I second gung's opinion about logistic regression being somewhat more suitable (the theoretical advantages being the exponential family and sufficient statistics).
