Python dictionaries, find similarities

I have a python dictionary with a thousand items. Each item is, itself, a dictionary. I'm looking for a clean and elegant way to parse through each item, and find & create templates. Here's a simplified example of the individual dictionaries' structure: {'id': 1, 'template': None, 'height': 80, 'width': 120, 'length': 75, 'weight': 100} From this, I want to pass through once, and if, 500 of the 1000 share the same height and width, determine that, so I can build a template off that data, and assign the template id to 'template'. I can build a gigantic reference hash, but I'm hoping there's a cleaner more elegant way to accomplish this. The actual data includes closer to 30 keys, of which a small subset need to be excluded from the template checking.
