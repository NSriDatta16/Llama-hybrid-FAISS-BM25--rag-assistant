Generally I want to catch all messages, at least WARNings and severe levels. Since loggers inherit their level from loggers higher in the hierarchy and ultimately from the root logger, I assign levels only to the top-level loggers. In your case that would be the "ExecutableName" loggers. For those special case loggers from which I'm e.g. not interested in seeing other than FATAL messages I will add a specific level setting. But this is usually not the general case and will thus be of manageable size. I find it useful to set e.g. WARN or INFO at those top-level loggers and then use appenders with filters on the various levels. The result is that the potentially vast amount of messages get grouped into different storages depending on level. You could even have separate appenders for each top-level logger to get even more fine grained control over the message stream.
