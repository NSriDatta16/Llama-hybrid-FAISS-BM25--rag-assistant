You could use IsolatedStorage to store some state related info (and you can even encrypt it before you save if you want - it's your storage, do what you want with it). Another way to store state information is to use cookies, here and here . The "state" information that i refer to is the state and/or progress of your Silverlight app, i.e. you can track where the user got to in the questions, and avoid requesting questions they have already completed. Both of these types of storage can be deleted by the end user, if they know what they are doing. But you shouldn't let that worry you - if they want to cheat, then let them.
