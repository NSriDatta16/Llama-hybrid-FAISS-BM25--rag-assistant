How does the email template vars works within Magento?

I needed to create a specific email template sent using an observer running from a cron. When I received the email, I don't have the value of the provided variables. $vars = array( 'product' => $product, 'customer' => $customer ); $mailTemplate->sendTransactional( $mailId, 'general', $customer->getData('email'), $customer->getData('firstname') . ' ' . $customer->getData('lastname'), $vars ); $product & $customer are both object from a Model Collection (Product_Collection & Customer_Collection). In my template, I'm trying to access them like this: Dear {{htmlescape var=$customer.name}}, Check {{htmlescape var=$product.name}} Any ideas? By the way, how can I construct url to my product? (to let the customer click on a link to view the product)
