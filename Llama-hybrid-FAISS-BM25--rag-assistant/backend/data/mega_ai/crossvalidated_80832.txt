I think you are confusing two things: You would like to know if your moving averages are equal to each other or to the "true measurent" You could do a classic hypothesis test that the true mean of all the moving averages you assembled is equal to your null hypothesis mean, And use the standard deviations you find on your moving averages to calculate confidence intervals. You would like to know if your moving averages are constant in time, fluctuating around the true mean and hence stationary Now you need to use the time dimension and you will have to deal with the classic stationary tests (a.k.a. unit root tests). Given this case, I would test for non-stationary with deterministic or stochastic trend (depending on the time period) to find out if the measurements for example increase over time. I also think it is not necessary to use the moving averages, you loose information by doing so, I would apply them on the raw data.
