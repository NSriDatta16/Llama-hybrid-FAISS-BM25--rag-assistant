How to tell if a trend seen in multiple data sources is significant?

Let's say I have several stations which measure temperature vs. time each hour for several years. Due to noise, when I plot the temperature vs. time from any one station, it's hard to see a trend. (The source of the noise could be sensor noise, or short-term variability due to storms etc.) However if I average all stations at each time step and plot the resulting mean vs. time, it seems there is a linear trend. How can I test if this common trend is significant ? I know I can perform a t-test , but how do I include the number of stations, since my result is more reliable if it seen across 100 stations than across 10?
