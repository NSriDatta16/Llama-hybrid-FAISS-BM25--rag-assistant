You cant dynamically construct a string with using @ token as part of the dynamic string and expect it to work with a literal. @ in literal is interpreted by compiler/runtime string a = @"abc"; is different from string b = "@abc"; In your example, you should not do "@" + "\"" + ... As the returnvalue is already a string type, you don't need to surround them in quote again and definitely not the "@" too. If in doubt, debug and drag that expression to the watch window. You will see that you ended up with string that looks like "@\"xxxxx\"" Make sure the returnvalue has the correct path value. If in doubt, System.IO.Path class gives you a range of static methods that can help you test or manipulate path string.
