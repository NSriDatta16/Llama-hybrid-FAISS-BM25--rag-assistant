You could try attaching a custom subclass of UIGestureRecognizer , which tells you when the users interacts with the view to the toolbar. Alternatively, you could try subclassing UIToolbar and change its -[touchesBegan:withEvent:] and -[touchesEnded:withEvent:] methods to tell you when the users starts/stops interacting with anything on the toolbar. The latter is probably simpler.
