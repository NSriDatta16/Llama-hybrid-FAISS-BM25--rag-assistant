"NTKRNLMP.EXE vs NTKRNLMP.EXE vs NTKRNLMP.EXE" Included is the "explanation" from wikipedia: Names of kernel NTOSKRNL.EXE : 1 CPU NTKRNLMP.EXE : N CPU SMP NTKRNLPA.EXE : 1 CPU, PAE NTKRPAMP.EXE : N CPU SMP, PAE So basically the NTOSKRNL.EXE is the NT kernel for 1 CPU, NTKRNLPA.EXE is for 1 CPu with physical address extension (PAE) support. NTKRNLMP.EXE is for multiple CPUs, NTKRPAMP.EXE is for multiple CPUs + PAE.
