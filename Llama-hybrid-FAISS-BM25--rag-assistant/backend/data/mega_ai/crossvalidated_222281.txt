An additive risk model of the form $Z = \vec{b} \mathbf{X}$ is not appropriate for interval censored data. The estimates will be anticonservative and probably biased by model misspecification. This also doesn't agree with the JAGS code you show below. What you fit there is what seems to be a Bayesian logistic model. It turns out a complementary log-log model is the right approach, but you haven't fit the appropriate survival model for interval censored data, as you have described it. A nice discussion of the topic can be found in Applied Survival Analysis 2nd Ed by Hosmer, Lemeshow, and May on page 232 I assume in your formulation the $y$ is a 0/1 indicator of failure for a particular tree and you are modeling the overall likelihood of failing as a cumulative probability with p(fail at time t) = "p"^t (with "p" more of a hazard, not a probability here). I also assume you have not accounted for some frailty or correlation between multiple "looks" at each tree. I also assume you're not interested in modeling the actual survival function, but want to estimate the effect of some fixed design variables "x" which are either weather conditions, fertilizer, elevation, etc. The appropriate way of fitting this model is to have 0/1 outcomes for whether or not a tree failed in a specific interval. You remove any subsequent 0s after a particular tree has failed because it is no longer at risk of doing so. The intercept here can be modeled using fixed or random effects depending on the number of intervals.
