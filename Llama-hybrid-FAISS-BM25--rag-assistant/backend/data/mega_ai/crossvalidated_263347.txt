When we do Principal Component analysis the principal components correspond to the directions of maximum variability, they do not guarantee maximum discrimination or separation between classes. So the 2nd component gives you good classification means data in that direction gives you better discrimination between classes. When you perform Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) it gives you the best orthogonal direction components that maximize the inter-class distance and minimize the intra-class distance. So if you do LDA on the data instead of PCA probably one of the very first components would be closer to PC6 than to PC1. Hope this helps.
