It may be worthwhile having an extended discussion on what a scale parameter is, what a rate parameter is with respect to an exponential random variable, and how the exponential relates to the Gamma. The TL;DR is this: The gamma can be viewed as the sum of iid $n$ exponential random variables. Exponential random variables have a rate parameter, so it makes sense for the Gamma to inherit a rate parameterization. The rate parameter also happens to be related to a scale parameter, so it makes sense for the Gamma to have a scale parameterization. Let's break this down a little more. What is a Scale Parameter? According to wiki , a scale parameter is a parameter $s$ for which the density of a random variable satisfies $$ f_s(x) = f(x/s)/s$$ Let's take a look at the Gamma distribution, $$ f(x) = \dfrac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma (\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}$$ and try to identify the scale parameter. After some thinking, you might say that the scale parameter is $1/\beta$ . Do verify this, we need to show that the first equation in my answer is satisfied. Let's start by setting our proposed scale parameter to 1 (so $\beta=1$ ) and then manipulate $f(x/s)/s$ to see what we get. $$ f(x/s)/s = \dfrac{1}{s} \times \dfrac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\left(\dfrac{x}{s}\right)^{\alpha-1} e^{-x/s} $$ Now, we proposed $s=1/\beta$ . After some algebra, you find that this expression is equivalent to $$ = \beta \times \dfrac{\beta^{\alpha -1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x} $$ Which is $f_s(x)$ . So we've proved that $1/\beta$ satisfies the requirements for being a scale parameter. What is a Rate Parameter for an Exponential Random Variable? The exponential distribution is often used in modelling failure times for various things. If the failure time $T \sim \operatorname{Exponential}(\beta)$ then we should expect $\beta$ failures per unit time. This makes sense too when you think about the expected value for an exponential random variable (if I get $\beta$ failures per unit time, then on average I should expect to wait $1/ \beta$ units of time per failure). How are The Gamma and Exponential Related Now, I'm not a historian of statistics, but I anticipate that the shape and rate parameterizations for the Gamma could be viewed as coming from the following relationship: The sum of $n$ iid exponential random variables with rate parameter $\beta$ has gamma distribution with shape parameter $n$ and rate parameter $\beta$ . Various proofs of this are found on this site and on Wikipedia, but you can easily simulate this in R or something to verify it empirically n
