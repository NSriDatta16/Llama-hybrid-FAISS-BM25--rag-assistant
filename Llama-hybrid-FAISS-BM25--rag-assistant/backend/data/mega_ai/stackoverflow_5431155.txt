I have done this before by storing the data from the controls in session. Every time you dynamically add a control, store the current data entered into the controls in session or viewstate for example, and then rebind on postback. Not the most elegant solution but it worked. I take it this is a webforms question? Add dynamic control click Save current form data On page_load load the data from viewstate into the controls
