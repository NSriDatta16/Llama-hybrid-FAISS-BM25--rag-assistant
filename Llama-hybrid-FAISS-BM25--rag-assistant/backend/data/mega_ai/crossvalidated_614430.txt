How to account for difference in group sizes for logistic regression

Using this study as an example, I am wondering if the size of different study groups run in the same models impacts the conclusions we can draw from statistical tests. In this study, the researchers were looking at pulse oximetry discrepancies between Black and White patients. They found that Black patients were more likely to have something called Occult (or Hidden) Hypoxemia, which is when the pulse oximeter incorrectly measures the peripheral oxygen levels as higher than they truly are. These mistakes are illuminated by running a more invasive test of arterial blood oxygen saturation. In this study, the study population is 73% White (N = 21,918), 21.6% Black (N = 6,498), and 5.4% Hispanic (N = 1,623). They found that Black patients had a significantly higher probability of being given a mistakenly high reading of peripheral blood oxygen saturation than White and Hispanic patients, which could potentially lead to worse health outcomes for those patients. My question is, given the large difference in sample sizes of White v. Black and Hispanic patients, how is this accounted for in running statistical tests and drawing conclusions? For example, in this study the researchers used a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the odds of occult hypoxemia, and adjusted for patient characteristics like age, race, sex, etc. Is this adjusting enough to account for the differences in sample size, or are there other methods one should use to bolster statistical models run on groups of different sizes?
