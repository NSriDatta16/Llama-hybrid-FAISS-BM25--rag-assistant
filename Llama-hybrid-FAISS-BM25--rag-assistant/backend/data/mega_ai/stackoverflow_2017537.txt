Not sure what you're asking. If you ask about the problem of setting the byte one by one and messing up the data, usually this is doen with a packed struct with members having meaningful names. Like: #pragma push(pack) #pragma pack(1) struct FooHeader { uint someField; byte someFlag; dword someStatus; }; #pragma pack(pop) FooHeader hdr; hdr.someField = 2; hdr.someFlag = 3; hdr.someStatus = 4; WriteFile(..., sizeof(hdr), &hdr);
