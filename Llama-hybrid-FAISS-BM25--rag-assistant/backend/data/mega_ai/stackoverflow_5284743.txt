Image slices placed using CSS Divs

Right now many of my designs used sliced graphics with absolute positioned DIVs. #Slice-01 { position: absolute; left:0; top:0; width:214px; height:38px; } I've seen an alternate method where the image is the background of the DIV instead of an object inside the DIV... #Slice-01 { position: absolute; left:0; top:0; width:214px; height:38px; background-image: url(/slices/Slice_01.jpg); background-repeat: no-repeat; } The only practical difference I can see is that one can drag the image out of the browser window on the first example but cannot when it's the background image. Questions: What's the more commonly accepted method and why? What are the pros and cons of each method? Thank-you!
