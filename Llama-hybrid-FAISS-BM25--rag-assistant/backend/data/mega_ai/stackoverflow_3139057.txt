Implementation of periodic writing timestamps in ms sql database

Task: Write timestamps into MS SQL database table every second. Solutions: External application which writes timestamps by schedule (Sql agent for example). Stored procedure, which writes timestamps in infinite loop. Questions. Which of the solutions is best? Is there any drawbacks of running infinite loop in stored procedure? How to start stored procedure after server reboot? Any other solutions?
