Time series factor model with one series more frequent

Let's say I have two time series, one of which updates more frequently than the other: $x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_t,\dots$ $y_0,y_{10},y_{20},\dots,y_{10t},\dots$ I want to fit a model to this that predicts $y$ from $x$ (and possibly from previous values of $y$) at each of the values $1,2,3,\dots$, i.e. it gives a prediction even for values of $y$ for which we won't make an observation (equivalently, assume that there are true values for $y$ at every value of $t$, but we only observe it at $t=0,10,20,\dots$) Is there a canonical way to do this?
