How would you judge the performance of an LSTM for time series predictions?

For an LSTM model for forecasting time series, what metrics or tests would you use to evaluate its performance (i.e loss, RMSE, accuracy etc). I'm slightly confused because I read that time series forecasting is considered a regression problem so accuracy doesn't apply but I have also seen many time series models use accuracy as a metric. Any explanation would be greatly appreciated!
