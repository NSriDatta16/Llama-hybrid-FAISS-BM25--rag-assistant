Are there any Non Neural Network models to do face detection in constrained domains?

In some constrained domains(eg: car driver), the camera is stationary which means the background will not change much. And we can sure when the car is running, there must be a driver. In this kind of cases, are there any fast face detection models that don't contain deep neural networks? I'm asking this because deep neural networks need lots of data to train and wondering if there are some "cheaper" models?
