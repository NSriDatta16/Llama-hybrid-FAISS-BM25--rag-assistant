You can cache the property values in an array: NSArray *propertyValues = [myObjects valueForKey:@"someProperty"]; And then you can quickly find the index of the object whose someProperty equals to the value you are searching for: NSUInteger objectIndex = [propertyValues indexOfObject:propertyValue]; Alternatively, you can search with NSPredicate (should be noticeably slower) or using a for loop (should be a tiny bit slower). If you can sort your objects by property values, you can optimize the for loop for the case when the value is not found by an average of 2 times.
