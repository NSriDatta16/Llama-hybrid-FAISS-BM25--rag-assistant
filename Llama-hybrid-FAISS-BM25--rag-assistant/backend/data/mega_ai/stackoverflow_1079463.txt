this is an interesting topic, and to some extent extremely undefined... the word "manage" is entailing potentially a whole world of things. Everybody can "try" to do Scrum, the theory it is not difficult to grasp, what is hard is the practice. Scrum like other agile approaches is very much based on "People and Interactions" and in order to make them happen right, you will have to deeply understand the values, the relationships and the ownerships that the whole Scrum framework describe. That is the hard part, and is a part that requires a lot of practice, and experience to be effectively converted into daily practice. This of course doesn't mean that you can "learn" yourself, on the contrary, often we hear that Scrum is "learning by doing... and failing" and so "fail often... and fail fast!". All Lean thinking principles, but it is much less trivial than it seems to get the point where it is time to assess results, identify failure, and set best practices for improvement. Being a Scrum Master means that one knows the framework and the relationship between the three main roles, which is way far from saying that he can implement Scrum. That step is in the Scrum Alliance signed buy the CSP (Certified Scrum Practitioner) accreditation, that requires a minimum of one year of practicing Scrum, to be allowed to submit the accreditation form. This is intentionally done because only with practice people will learn what the principle "that in theory are sounding clear" - and you will learn at a CSM Training - really mean, and moreover how to use them to maximize the productivity and efficiency of a Scrum Team. When we talk about an organization, and we want to implement Scrum, the dimensions to consider, as well as the complexity, are some order of magnitude bigger, and way out of reach of a "simple" - no offence, we talk about mapping value streams, structures, accounting... - Scrum Master. To do something like that, either you take a lot of risk yourself, and you can afford to heavily affect the productivity of your company, or you need someone who has experience in helping companies to transact to agile and Scrum. This is what the CSC (Certified Scrum Coach) accreditation is all about. Hope this helps a bit :-)
