I would say your way of comparing this is rather incorrect. There are two main problem from what you did those are : R linear model (lm) is solved using deterministic solution whereas keras model optimized with gradient descent. In the end you expect the weights and result to be close but not similar. For OLS, it attains the lowest theoretical training error(by definition) averaged over all training sample. Your keras model will converge towards this minima but it might have difficulty converging to similar minima(due to the nature of GD). you are not training your keras model with full data. Notice you put validation split to be 0.2 i.e. you are training with 80 percent of your data. Finally, if you want to test whether single layer NN is similar to OLS You can try setting validation split to 0 (or simply don't declare it) and training it with the whole dataset as your batch.
