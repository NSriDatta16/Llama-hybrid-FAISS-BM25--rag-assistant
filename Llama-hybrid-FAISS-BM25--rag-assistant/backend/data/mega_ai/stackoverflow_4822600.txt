Firefox 3.5+ has a nice drag-and-drop api: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop Chrome you can can drag and drop onto a file upload, so, you can do drag and drop, but you have to fake it by hiding the form via opacity:0 but make it large via a wrapping div and a width:100% and height:100%: http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/gmail-upload Safari is the same as Chrome except you can only do one file at a time, more on this at the link above at the end of the post (thecssninja link) IE it seems like you can use VBDataObject or ActiveX, but i'm still not quite sure where to find more information. I can just find little snippets of information about how you could use those: http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=36896 -- If anyone can help me with how to get IE to support it, let me know. Opera has nothing at all it seems. Just playing with it, it acts like IE where if you drag onto a file upload it just opens that file. If anyone knows away around this let me know.
