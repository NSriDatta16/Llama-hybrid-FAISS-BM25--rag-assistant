It's not possible in Maven 2. It may be possible in the future in Maven 3. We have also considered adding this possibility in Nexus to dynamically proxy artifacts. The bottom line is that most organizations want control over the proxy repos used by developers and so this feature turns out to be very popular in a repo manager. For the same reason, having developer machines directly fall back from accessing the repo manager to the repos directly is not desirable. Then you end up losing all the benefits of proxy caching, sharing, filtering etc that you get.
