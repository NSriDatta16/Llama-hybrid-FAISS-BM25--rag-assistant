How to retrieve the path to a node in a tree - efficiently (related to the post 'parse a flat table into a tree?')

This question is a follow up to this post: What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? I liked the ClosureMap solution, but I have an additional problem to solve. How can you easily retrieve the path to a particular node in a tree? For example, if you look at the tree provided: ID Node Name 1 'Node 1' 2 'Node 1.1' 3 'Node 2' 4 'Node 1.1.1' 5 'Node 2.1' 6 'Node 1.2' The path to 1.1.1 would be: ID = 1, 2, 4 Without doing recursive SQL calls, is there an elegant way to retrieve a path?
