If you run coeff = pca(rand(1600,5000)) you will see that coeff is of $5000\times 1599$ size. Meaning that with $1600$ points you can only find $1599$ principal components in the $5000$-dimensional space. For the reason why, see here: Why are there only $n-1$ principal components for $n$ data points if the number of dimensions is larger or equal than $n$? Of course the $5000\times 5000$ matrix coeff*coeff' can not be an identity matrix, because it is of low rank (rank $1599$) and must have $5000-1599=3401$ zero eigenvalues (whereas identity matrix has all eigenvalues equal to one and is full rank). However, if you use all PCs for reconstruction, then the reconstruction of your data points should still be perfect (and not "lousy"), because all your data points lie precisely in the $1599$-dimensional subspace found by PCA. By the way, note that coeff'*coeff will be a $1599\times 1599$ identity matrix.
