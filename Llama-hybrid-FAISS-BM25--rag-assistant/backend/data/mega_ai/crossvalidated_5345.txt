Both packages use Lattice as the backend, but nlme has some nice features like groupedData() and lmList() that are lacking in lme4 (IMO). From a practical perspective, the two most important criteria seem, however, that lme4 extends nlme with other link functions: in nlme , you cannot fit outcomes whose distribution is not gaussian, lme4 can be used to fit mixed-effects logistic regression, for example. in nlme , it is possible to specify the variance-covariance matrix for the random effects (e.g. an AR(1)); it is not possible in lme4 . Now, lme4 can easily handle very huge number of random effects (hence, number of individuals in a given study) thanks to its C part and the use of sparse matrices. The nlme package has somewhat been superseded by lme4 so I won't expect people spending much time developing add-ons on top of nlme . Personally, when I have a continuous response in my model, I tend to use both packages, but I'm now versed to the lme4 way for fitting GLMM. Rather than buying a book, take a look first at the Doug Bates' draft book on R-forge: lme4: Mixed-effects Modeling with R .
