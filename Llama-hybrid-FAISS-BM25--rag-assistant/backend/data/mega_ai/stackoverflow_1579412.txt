Free Windows Forms Components Similar to jQuery UI Draggables

EDIT: So, I ended up making my own basic solution to this problem, and it can be found in my own answer to the question below. Or, here's a link. Original Post I'm doing some UI programming for a small .NET application. The application has some collections of items that need to be displayed in a grid sort of format (X columns by Y rows) and the grid elements need to be able to get dragged around to different grid locations, and possibly out of the grid all together. The most comparable sort of UI design elements I can think of are the jQueryUI Draggables . Do I have to roll my own or are there components people have already written to act like this? Even better, are there any free components? Or is there an easy way to do this that I just don't know about (don't do a lot of .NET UI programming..) Also these "grid items" need to be able to include windows form components. The DataRepeater control is close to what I need, except it only supports horizontal or vertical alignments, not grids of items. Here's a visual example of what I'm looking for: I tried to stick with a halloween theme here.
