jqplot zoom - happens only if zoomed till the borders

I am facing an issue with zooming using jqPlots. I have a graph with multiple y-axes. I have the following lines of code for performing the zoom: cursor: { showVerticalLine: true, //showTooltip: true, followMouse: true, showTooltipDataPosition: true, tooltipFormatString: '%s x:%s, y:%s', zoom: true, constrainOutsideZoom: false, clickReset: true } I am able to zoom with the above. However, the zoom happens only when I drag the zoom area to one of the borders. If I try to zoom somewhere within the canvas, it does not zoom. Can someone tell me where I could be going wrong? Thanks, S.
