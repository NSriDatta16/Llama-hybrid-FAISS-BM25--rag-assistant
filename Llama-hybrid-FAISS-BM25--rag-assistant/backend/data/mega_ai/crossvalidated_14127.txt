How to compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence when the PMF contains 0s?

I have the following timeseries obtained using the data posted below. For a sliding window size of 10, I am trying to compute the KL-divergence between the PMF of values within the current sliding window and the PMF of the history with the final goal of plotting the value of KL-divergence across time so that I can compare two time series. As of now, there is a conceptual problem I am facing (which I'll explain using Python): In [228]: samples = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1] # In reality this 10 should be 20 because that is the max value I have seen in the timeseries In [229]: bins = scipy.linspace(0, 10, 21) In [230]: bins Out[230]: array([ 0. , 0.5, 1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5, 3. , 3.5, 4. , 4.5, 5. , 5.5, 6. , 6.5, 7. , 7.5, 8. , 8.5, 9. , 9.5, 10. ]) In [231]: scipy.histogram(samples, bins=bins, density=True) Out[231]: (array([ 1.63636364, 0. , 0.36363636, 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. ]), array([ 0. , 0.5, 1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5, 3. , 3.5, 4. , 4.5, 5. , 5.5, 6. , 6.5, 7. , 7.5, 8. , 8.5, 9. , 9.5, 10. ])) The problem is that the resulting PMF contains 0 s so that I cannot really multiple two PMF s to get the KL-divergence. Can someone tell me how to mitigate this problem?
