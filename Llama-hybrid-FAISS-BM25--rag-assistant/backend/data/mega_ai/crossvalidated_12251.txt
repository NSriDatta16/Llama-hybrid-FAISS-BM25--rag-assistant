Determining true mean from noisy observations

I have a large set of data points of the form (mean, stdev). I wish to reduce this to a single (better) mean, and a (hopefully) smaller standard deviation. Clearly I could simply compute $\frac{\sum data_{mean}}{N}$, however this does not take in to account the fact that some of the data points are significantly more accurate than others. To put it simply, I wish to preform a weighted average of these data points, but do not know what the weighting function should be in terms of the standard deviation.
