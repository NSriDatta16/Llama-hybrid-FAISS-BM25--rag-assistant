SAS 9.3 now provides proc mcmc with a detailed documentation (as usual!). No fewer than 19 examples illustrate that new bayesian procedure. Simple linear regression models, linear and non-linear mixed models, but also Cox models and many other types of analysis are covered. Strictly speaking, this is not a book... but it is definitively a gold mine of applications ;-)
