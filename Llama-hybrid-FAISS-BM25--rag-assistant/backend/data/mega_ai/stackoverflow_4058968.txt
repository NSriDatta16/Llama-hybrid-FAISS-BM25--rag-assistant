static page links not working without index.php in front

I created static pages in admin and when I try to open www.website.com/static-page-identifier We get 404 page If we put index.php in front like this www.website.com/index.php/static-page-identifier It works I have checked that mod-rewrite works on server. I have been switching 'Use Web Server Rewrites' to yes and no in magento admin. At last, in CMS->static pages section I click preview any of the static pages I get the same 404 page. Any idea what is going on? thank you, Margots
