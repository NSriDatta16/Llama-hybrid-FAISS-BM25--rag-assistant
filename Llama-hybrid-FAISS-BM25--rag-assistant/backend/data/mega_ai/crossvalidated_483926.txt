Cross Validation in small datasets

I have a really small dataset (124 samples) and I'd like to try out if I get some interesting results with some machine learning algorithms in R. What I've done: I splitted my data set into 75% training and 25% test, and trained six diferent models with the structure similar as follows: fitControl However, I just started studying about machine learning and deep learning and the cross validation part is aways hard to understand. The question is: In the code there is only the inner cross validation step, is it necessary to do an outer loop for cv? If yes, how can I code it? EDIT: Just an update that can be helpful if someone is passing by with the same problem: I did this and worked fine: folds $Group,4) split_up bestTune} Now I'm proceding to further analysis. If someone with more expertise find a mistake, please let me know. This link helped me a lot: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62183291/statistical-test-with-test-data/62193116#62193116
