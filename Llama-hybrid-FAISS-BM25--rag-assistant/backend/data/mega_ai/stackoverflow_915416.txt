Is there an way to make an invisible UIButton that will still "be there" and catch touch events for my UIImageView?

I thought to be clever and just put an transparent UIButton over an UIImageView with the exact frame size, so that I can wire it up easily with any event I like, for example TouchUpInside, and make it call a action method of an view controller when the user touches it. Well, it works until alpha is below 0.1f. If I do 0.01f, it will not work. So to get it work, when looking a long time on the screen, you'll see that 0.1f of alpha shining through. And that's totally disgusting ;) It seems like iPhone OS trys to be clever and won't catch events on the button if it's visually not there. Any idea how to solve that? Sure I could make a subclass of UIImageView and implement touchesBegan:... etc., but it doesn't feel really elegant. I mean...when I want to hyperlink an image on the web, I would never want create my own HTML element for that image, just to wire it up to an url when it's clicked. That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
