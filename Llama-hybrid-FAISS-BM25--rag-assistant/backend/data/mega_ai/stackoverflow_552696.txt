In a similar vein to ShuggyCoUk's suggestion , you could rig up a queue (or queues) using the Windows built-in ESENT database (comes already installed with Windows). There is a managed code access library (open source): http://www.codeplex.com/ManagedEsent . If you stick with writing / reading CLOBs or BLOBs, it should work just fine. If you want to be really clever, you can use NServiceBus and write (contribute?) ESENT-flavored subscription storage and transports. There are some forays into using ESENT on Ayende's blog as well (you'll have to poke around his SVN repository for the juicy bits).
