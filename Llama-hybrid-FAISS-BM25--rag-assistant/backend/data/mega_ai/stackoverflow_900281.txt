Well, it all depends on how big these projects are. If you've only got a few files, then whack them all in one folder. Too many folders when you haven't got many files to manage is in my opinion overkill. It gets annoying digging in and out of folders when you've only got a few files in them. Also, it depends on who's using this stuff. If you're writing a library and its going to be used by other programmers, then it's good to organize the headers they want to use into an include folder. If you're creating a number of libraries and publishing them all, then your structure might work. But, if they're independent libraries, and the development isn't all done together and they get versioned and released at different times, you'd be better off sticking with having all files for one project locatable within one folder. In fact, I would say keep everything in one folder, until you get to a point where you find its unmanagable, then reorganize into a clever scheme of dividing the source up into folders like you've done. You'll probably know how it needs to be organized from the problems you run into. KISS is usually always the solution in programming -> keep everything as simple as possible.
