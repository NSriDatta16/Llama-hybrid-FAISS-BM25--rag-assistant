If you have a service that you want to expose to two different assemblies, then what you should do is define the interface for that service in a separate assembly and share that between the two. Generally speaking, I always put services in their own assembly (project) and I put the interface definitions to those services in a separate assembly (project). In the specific case of the CAB I would avoid exposing much of anything to the Shell unless it is absolutely necessary - only if the Shell itself has to use the service would I reference it in the Shell. The Shell should be bare-bones; it exists so that modules can show their own elements to the user. Individual modules can worry about referencing and utilizing the specific services. As far as solution organization: Generally, when I am working on a CAB application, everything is in one solution. I have rarely had need for separate solutions. Separate projects, yes - but all under one umbrella solution.
