One way that some sites have done is to create a bookmarklet. The user would browse around regularly, then if they find a site they want to add as a bookmark through your web application, they could just click on the bookmarklet. The bookmarklet is a javascript function that would perhaps show a modal dialog window that could then access your site's bookmarking capability remotely. For example, Facebook's Share Bookmarklet , any number of Delicious bookmarklets. Your web application would then just provide a way to organize the bookmarks that people save using your bookmarklet. You could also look into a Firefox plugin, but bookmarklets are a more cross-browser friendly solution.
