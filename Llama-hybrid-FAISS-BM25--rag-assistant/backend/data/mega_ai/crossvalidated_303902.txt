Exploring similarity embeddings

I'm trying to find embedding for audio which explains similarities between songs, and have extracted relevant, MFCC, features. From this, I will apply different techniques to find different embedding. My question is as follows: How can one evaluate/explore how "good" an embedding is? What are the different techniques to evaluate/explore? :)
