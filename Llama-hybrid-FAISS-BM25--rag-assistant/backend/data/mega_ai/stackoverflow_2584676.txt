There is also the Desktopcouch project, which aims to provide a storage backend for (not necessarily Linux) desktop applications, for things like preferences and bookmarks. It is based on CouchDB and one of the stated goals is automatic replication and synchronization of data between computers. I believe it also plays a central role in the Ubuntu One cloud storage service.
