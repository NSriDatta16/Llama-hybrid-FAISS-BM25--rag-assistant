With this plugin: [link text][1] you can order the column and manipulate data from a source with the union of plugin jEditable, you can see a example in Examples > API > Editable Rows (with jEditable). You can use draggable with the event Stop $( ".selector" ).bind( "sortstop", function(event, ui) { ... }); with the method .sortable( "toArray" ) to get the new order of elements. You can find examples in the official documentation in: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#event-stop =)
