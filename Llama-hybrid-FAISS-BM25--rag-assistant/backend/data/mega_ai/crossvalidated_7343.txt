How to correct uneven sampling distribution when calculating the mean?

Suppose I have a function f , and I want to sample it at 100 points in the interval [0, 100] . For some reason (that seemed smart to me at the time), I decided to not sample at equidistant intervals, but rather use the following function to determine the sample points: log2(x)*(100/log2(100)) This gives me a sequence of sample points that becomes denser as it approaches 100. The problem is, that now I need to calculate the mean over the values I have sampled, but due to the bad sampling that would be heavily biased. I cannot resample the data, this would take way too long (several days), and I am on a very tight schedule. So, the solution that comes to mind is to calculate a weighted average to correct the error. My question is, how do I determine the weights?
