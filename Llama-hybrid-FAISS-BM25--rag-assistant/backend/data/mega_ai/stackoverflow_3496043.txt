Imagine you work for a security agency and were given the task of developing a web-site. The field agents specifilly requested that the site could swap colors so that they could use it both on night-vision and at the office. With what you learned describe how you would separate content from structure to allow night/day switching and what security measures you would implement to prevent another enemy agency from stealing your data. A spiced up question. I always find my students more interested when I put them in the middle of a plot.
