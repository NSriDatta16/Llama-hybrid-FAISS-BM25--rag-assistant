Hexagon is the brand name for a family of digital signal processor (DSP) and later neural processing unit (NPU) products by Qualcomm. Hexagon is also known as QDSP6, standing for “sixth generation digital signal processor.” According to Qualcomm, the Hexagon architecture is designed to deliver performance with low power over a variety of applications. Each version of Hexagon has an instruction set and a micro-architecture. These two features are intimately related. Hexagon is used in Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, for example in smartphones, cars, wearable devices and other mobile devices and is also used in components of cellular phone networks. Instruction set architecture Computing devices have instruction sets, which are their lowest, most primitive languages. Common instructions are those which cause two numbers to be added, multiplied or combined in other ways, as well as instructions that direct the processor where to look in memory for its next instruction. There are many other types of instructions. Assemblers and compilers that translate computer programs into streams of instructions – bit streams - that the device can understand and carry out (execute). As an instruction stream executes, the integrity of system function is supported by the use of instruction privilege levels. Privileged instructions have access to more resources in the device, including memory. Hexagon supports privilege levels. Originally, Hexagon instructions operated on integer numbers but not floating point numbers, but in v5 floating point support was added. The processing unit which handles execution of instructions is capable of in-order dispatching up to 4 instructions (the packet) to 4 execution units every clock. Micro-architecture Micro-architecture is the physical structure of a chip or chip component that makes it possible for a device to carry out the instructions. A given instruction set can be implemented by a variety of micro-architectures. The buses – data transfer channels – for Hexagon devices are 32 bits wide. That is, 32 bits of data can be moved from one part of the chip to another in a single step. The Hexagon micro-architecture is multi-threaded, which means that it can simultaneously process more than one stream of instructions, enhancing data processing speed. Hexagon supports very long instruction words, which are groupings of four instructions that can be executed “in parallel.” Parallel execution means that multiple instructions can run simultaneously without one instruction having to complete before the next one starts. The Hexagon micro-architecture supports single instruction, multiple data operations, which means that when a Hexagon device receives an instruction, it can carry out the operation on more than one piece of data at the same time. According to 2012 estimation, Qualcomm shipped 1.2 billion DSP cores inside its system on a chip (SoCs) (average 2.3 DSP core per SoC) in 2011, and 1.5 billion cores were planned for 2012, making the QDSP6 the most shipped architecture of DSP (CEVA had around 1 billion of DSP cores shipped in 2011 with 90% of IP-licensable DSP market). The Hexagon architecture is designed to deliver performance with low power over a variety of applications. It has features such as hardware assisted multithreading, privilege levels, very long instruction word (VLIW), single instruction, multiple data (SIMD), and instructions geared toward efficient signal processing. Hardware multithreading is implemented as barrel temporal multithreading - threads are switched in round-robin fashion each cycle, so the 600 MHz physical core is presented as three logical 200 MHz cores before V5. Hexagon V5 switched to dynamic multithreading (DMT) with thread switch on L2 misses, interrupt waiting or on special instructions. At Hot Chips 2013 Qualcomm announced details of their Hexagon 680 DSP. Qualcomm announced Hexagon Vector Extensions (HVX). HVX is designed to allow significant compute workloads for advanced imagi
