Drag specific object

I have a problem with dragging object in iPhone sdk , my UIImageView outlet is red and I don't know why the dragging doesn't work ! but when remove the if line my code works fine , here is the code : - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches]anyObject]; if ([touch view] == red) { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; red.center = location; } } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
