ASC3 (ActionScript 3) begin listening when a frame begins, how do I?

Alright, I'm working on a Droid app and need some help. I need to load some variables when the user begin the game. But I don't want to do this when the user click something. I want it to be performed when the user enters a frame. How would I do this. I have tried the below code but that doesn't work. start.addEventListener(Event.START, check); function check(event:MouseEvent):void{ cash.text.text = cash1; storage_count.text.text = storage1; lemons_count.text.text = lemons1; cups_count.text.text = cups; straws_count.text.text = straws; ice_count.text.text = ice; }
