Code in a test app that interacts with a View of the AUT must run in the main apps thread but is .runOnUiThread always needed?

While reading the testing tutorial at http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/testing/activity_test.html I began to wonder why is the below code needed. public void testSpinnerUI() { mActivity.runOnUiThread( new Runnable() { public void run() { mSpinner.requestFocus(); mSpinner.setSelection(INITIAL_POSITION); } // end of run() method definition } // end of anonymous Runnable object instantiation ); // end of invocation of runOnUiThread Why is it not better to use sendKeys( KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_DOWN ); alone to set the focus? Such as here http://mihaifonoage.blogspot.com/2010/01/unit-and-functional-testing-in-android.html public void testAdd() throws Throwable { //First field value sendKeys( KeyEvent.KEYCODE_3 ); sendKeys( KeyEvent.KEYCODE_PERIOD ); sendKeys( KeyEvent.KEYCODE_5 );
