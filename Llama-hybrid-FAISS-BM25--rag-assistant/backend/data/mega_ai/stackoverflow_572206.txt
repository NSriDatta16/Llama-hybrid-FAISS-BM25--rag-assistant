How do I check if certain files exist in Bash?

In a bash script, I have to check for the existence of several files. I know an awkward way to do it, which is as follows, but that would mean that my main program has to be within that ugly nested structure: if [ -f $FILE1 ] then if [ -f $FILE2 ] then echo OK # MAIN PROGRAM HERE fi fi The following version does not work: ([ -f $FILE1 ] && [ -f $FILE2 ]) || ( echo "NOT FOUND"; exit 1 ) echo OK It prints NOT FOUND OK Is there an elegant way to do this right? UPDATE: See the accepted answer. In addition, in terms of elegance I like Jonathan Leffler's answer : arg0=$(basename $0 .sh) error() { echo "$arg0: $@" 1>&2 exit 1 } [ -f $FILE2 ] || error "$FILE2 not found" [ -f $FILE1 ] || error "$FILE1 not found"
