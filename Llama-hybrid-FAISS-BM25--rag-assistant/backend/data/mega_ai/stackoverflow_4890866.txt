Basically, your question is just "How do I get a file from drag-and-drop?" Once you know how to get the dropped file, you just pass it into your mystery string. The short answer is that you implement the NSDraggingDestination protocol and in your performDragOperation: method, you ask the drag info object for its propertyListForType:NSFilenamesPboardType . There's a whole drag-and-drop guide on Apple's website that includes lots of detailed instructions and example code.
