what values of an image should I use to produce a haar wavelet?

I currently have a Java program that will get the rgb values for each of the pixels in an image. I also have a method to calculate a Haar wavelet on a 2d matrix of values. However I don't know which values I should give to my method that calculates the Haar wavelet. Should I average each pixels rgb value and computer a haar wavelet on that? or maybe just use 1 of r, g,b. I am trying to create a unique fingerprint for an image. I read elsewhere that this was a good method as I can take the dot product of 2 wavelets to see how similar the images are to each other. Please let me know of what values I should be computing a Haar wavelet on. Thanks Jess
