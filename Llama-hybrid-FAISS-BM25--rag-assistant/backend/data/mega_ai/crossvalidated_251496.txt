Why sum of squared errors for logistic regression not used and instead maximum likelihood estimation is used to fit the model?

I have a doubt on why sum of squared errors is not used for Logistic regression and instead maximum likelihood estimation is used and also why not the vice versa. Edited Many were asking me to clarify the question, my intention was to know about using a squared error loss function to find Î² vs MLE
