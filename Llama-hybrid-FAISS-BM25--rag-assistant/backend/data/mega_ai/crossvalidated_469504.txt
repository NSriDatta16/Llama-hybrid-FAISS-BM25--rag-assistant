Why do we take the ratio of two features?

I've just learned that one technique for feature engineering consist of taking a ratio feature: feature1/feature2 , but I'm quite confused and I have questions: Why does this work ? Is this technique useful for gradient boosted trees based models for regression ? Is there any systematic way to find the right features for which to compute the ratio, or do I need to use my intuition to find these features ? Thank you a lot for your clarifications.
