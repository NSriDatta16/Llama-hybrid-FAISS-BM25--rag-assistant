According to Erhan et al. (2010) I am correct. That paper contains info on how to do it with a Deep Belief Network. To summarise, pre-train a neural network by training a Deep Belief Network (a stack of RBMs). The DBN should have the same topology as your NN. The weights and biases of the DBN are the initial weights and biases one should use when training one's NN using gradient descent.
