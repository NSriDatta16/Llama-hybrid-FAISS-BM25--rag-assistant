You can't do that with HTML. Maybe with Javascript. Basically, you just detect double clicks in a certain area and then select the appropriate text. EDIT: Here's how to do it in W3C compliant browser (e.g. Firefox, it probably won't work in IE, which isn't a W3C compliant browser and uses different text selection model): function select(elem) { var sel = window.getSelection(); var range = sel.getRangeAt(0); range.selectNode(elem); sel.addRange(range); } a simple paragraph, this is clickable area when this span tag is double-clicked then they will be selected
