No, the averages of the averages of subsets is not the same as the average of the whole set. It will only be the same value if the subsets are the same sample size. If you want the average of the population, multiply each average by the size of the sample it came from to get the population total, then divide by the total number of data points (population size). See the batting averages example on Simpsonâ€™s paradox for a good illustration of why averaging averages does not usually work.
