We really need some evidence. Can you include any stats & screen grabs? Which browsers & OS's are you talking about? You also need to show some code, are you replacing large fragments of the DOM? (if your using crappy update panels wrapped around large forms then this is a real possibility!) If so how are you doing it? What tool did you use to find the leak(s)? Can you recreate the issue on jsbin or jsfiddle?
