I can't help with the specific tool you're using, but the general idea with path coverage is that each possible path through the code should be executed. If you draw a flowchart through the program, branching at each if/break/continue, etc. you should see which paths your tests are taking through the program. To get 100% (which isn't totally necessary, nor does it assure a perfect test) your test will have to go down every branch of the code, executing every line. Hope that helps.
