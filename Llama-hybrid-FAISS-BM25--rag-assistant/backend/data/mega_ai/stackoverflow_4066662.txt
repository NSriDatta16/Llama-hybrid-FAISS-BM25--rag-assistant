NSDictionary losing decimal place at retrieval

I have a json string something like this "{"price":1.0}", using the json-framework I am converting this json string to NSDictionary. Now I am retrieving the value from NSDictionary as below NSString *text = [[dictionary objectForKey:@"price] description]; I am getting back only "1" as a result the decimal place and the 0 is gone. But if i have a json string like this "{"price":1.11}" then it just works fine, which means I get back 1.11 in my text. I am displaying the price information on my app and it looks little wired to just display a number 1 :) Does any one how do get back 1.0 instead of just 1?
