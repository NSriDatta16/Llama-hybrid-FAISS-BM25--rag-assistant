Linear regression on large sparse feature set

I have a sparse feature matrix with 50K observations and 150K features. All features are binary. On this I have to run a linear regression. I want just a decent fit. Data: Let us consider training dataset as a matrix: observations are rows and features are columns. Each column has on average only 10~60 entries of 1s. Similarly, each row has on average 10~60 entries of 1s. Context: Each row represents a movie and columns represents an actor. I want to predict movie ratings just based on cast. I have removed actors who appeared in less than 5 movies. What will be the fastest way to run this? I would like to refrain from dimentionality reduction, because test users may not have any actor in common with the reduced feature vector.
