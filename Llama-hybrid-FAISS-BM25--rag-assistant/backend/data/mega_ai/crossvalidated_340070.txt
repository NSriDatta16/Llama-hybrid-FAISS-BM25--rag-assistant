This is definitely not a bad practice . In some context (imbalanced labels or non-contradictory labels, e.g.), it can be much easier to cut a multi-class classification problem into multiple problems. However, in your case, a possible improvment of your setup could be to share part of the architecture and the weights of your neural networks as they apply to the same images (as far as I understood). This way, the learning of one task could benefit from the other task.
