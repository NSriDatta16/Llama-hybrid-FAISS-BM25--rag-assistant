Correct or most valuable way to model consumption/usage among users of a product or system?

Is there a best method for approximating average daily consumption among users of a product? I'll use an example to illustrate. We have monthly data for the past year (we have all data since launch) on the two following variables: Number of ice cream makers sold Number of ice cream maker mixes sold We can assume when someone buys the maker they start using it right away. If we wanted to look at the average daily consumption among the months and among the year is there a best way to do so? Would you do: (Ice cream mix sold in M1)/(Cumulative ice cream makers sold in M1) for each month over the period? Is it better to average the values for the month and the previous period? And what would be the best way to calculate the average daily usage for the year?
