They're both true. To justify the way that the book mentions, it might help to use slightly different notation. If $\theta$ is a location parameter, then set $U = Y-\theta$ and observe that $$ p_{U \mid Y}(u \mid y) \propto p_{U,Y}(u,y) = p_{U,\theta}(u, \theta)|1| = p_{U \mid\theta}(u \mid \theta) p_{\theta}(\theta). $$ We can use the $\propto$ sign because the normalizing constant is free of $\theta$ . The first equality is by the transformation theorem, where we are transforming $(\theta,u) \mapsto (y,u)$ . The last property is just the definition of a conditional density. Stumbling on the same paragraph more than $4$ years later...
