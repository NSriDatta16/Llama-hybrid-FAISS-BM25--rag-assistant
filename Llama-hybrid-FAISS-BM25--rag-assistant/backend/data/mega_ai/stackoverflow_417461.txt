For one thing, Exceptions are implemented in the Library, not in the language--how can they create exceptions in the library? I'm pretty sure you aren't advocating that system libraries should have a different set of rules. For another, it's actually possible to use an object tree of exceptions. Your inherited exceptions can have special attributes if you like--they can be used for more complicated things than they are. I'm not advocating they be used as a generic data transport mechanism or anything (although they could be), but I could see a case where someone implemented a custom logging solution that required a special attribute on the Exception... Your custom exceptions could contain a flag indicating special treatment (maybe one saying you should restart the JVM), they could contain information about logging levels, a bunch of stuff. Anyway, I'm not advocating this stuff, I'm just saying it's possible. The first paragraph is you real answer.
