Having thought and read about this a bit more, here are the reasons that I think matching methods are not commonly used in studies where there is no specific treatment to be assessed and the aim is rather to compare the means of two groups differing in some characteristic while controlling for explanatory variables: Most such studies are not only interested in a single comparison by one categorical variable; they are also interested in the effects of the covariates. It is therefore more appropriate to make a single model of the relationship between all of the postulated explanatory variables and the dependent variable, and test that using regression. Missing explanatory variables may become more of a problem when using matching rather than fitting a specific model. In studies of treatment effects, the variation that is controlled out through matching is relatively straightforwardly interpreted as selection bias. But in studies comparing two groups differing in some characteristic there is not this interpretation, and matching might even worsen the confounding effect of some unobserved variable. In the original example, say that urban natives (A) are on average much wealthier than rural-urban migrants (B), but with some overlap, and we matched each A with a B at a similar wealth level, and didn’t have any control variables other than wealth in the data set. These ‘matched’ households would likely differ strongly in terms of missing variables, because an A at a wealth level typical for group A would have to be matched to a B that was well above average wealth for group B, and that difference might be due to an unobserved variable such as parents' education. That unobserved difference could then bias the estimated difference in terms of an outcome variable such as children's education attainment. (maybe) Separate conventions and traditions used in the different types of study. Is this about right? Maybe there are other reasons too.
