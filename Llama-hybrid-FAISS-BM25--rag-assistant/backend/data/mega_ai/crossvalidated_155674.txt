Instead of using naive Bayes, have you tried other classifiers? Logistic regression or SVMs could be attractive here since they are quite simple to implement (logistic regression at least) and you could use L2 regularization to downweight unimportant features or zero them out via L1 regularization. In general, naive Bayes classifiers are not performing very well compared to other classifiers, especially if you have a large number of documents like in your case. I'd just compare the different models
