Since it's for a class I'd recommend the following: Report the average as if there was no censoring, treating the censored value as 0.1. Note that this average is, as an estimator of the true mean, downward-biased , so you'd expect the true mean to be a bit higher. Also note that it's not possible to say how far the average will be biased without doing a more sophisticated statistical analysis that takes into account the censoring.
