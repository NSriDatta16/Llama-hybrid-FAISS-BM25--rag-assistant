There are definitely other solutions, although I don't know that I would call them "elegant". you could call Abort or Interrupt on the thread but these can have some negative side effects. Personally, for something like this I prefer to use BackgroundWorker if possible. It has a Cancel feature but it is similar to what you mentioned - a bool flag in the class that you have to periodically check for in the executing code (at least it's not a global flag). This post on stopping threads in .NET is a bit old but goes over some of the pitfalls of the other options I mentioned above.
