Animating a UIImageView tint

Similar to this previous question , I want to apply an arbitrarly-coloured tint to an arbitrary image (a UIImageView ). However, I want the tint to fade away over N seconds of time, to have a "pulse" effect. I'll be triggering the pulse every M seconds. While I think I could rig up a naive solution using an NSTimer to change the tint, I think I can probably use some of the Core Animation framework to have a much more elegant (and efficient) solution. However, I'm not very familiar with Core Animation. Is creating a "pulse" like this possible with Core Animation? If so, how?
