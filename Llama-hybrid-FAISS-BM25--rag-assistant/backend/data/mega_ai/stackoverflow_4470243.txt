Another pragmatic use of conditional compiles is to "comment out" sections of code which contain standard "C" comments (i.e. /* */). Some compilers do not allow nesting of these comments, for example: /* comment out block of code .... code .... /* This is a standard * comment. */ ... oopos! Some compilers try to compile code after this closing comment. .... code .... end of block of code*/ (As you can see in the syntax highlighting, StackOverflow does not nest comments.) instead you can use #ifdef to get the right effect, for example: #ifdef _NOT_DEFINED_ .... code .... /* This is a standard * comment. */ .... code .... #endif
