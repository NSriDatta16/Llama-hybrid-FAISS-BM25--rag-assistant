Here some resources that might be helpful: Recommenderlab - a framework and open source software for developing and testing recommendation algorithms. Corresponding R package recommenderlab . The following blog post illustrates the use of recommenderlab package (which IMHO can be generalized for any open source recommendation engine) for building movie recommendation application, based on collaborative filtering . Research on recommender systems - a nice webpage with resources on the topic, maintained by Recommenderlab's lead developer Michael Hahsler. Mortar Recommendation Engine - an open source customizable recommendation engine for Hadoop and Pig , written in Python and Java . Company, sponsoring the development of this project, Mortar Data , offers general commercial cloud platform for development and hosting data science software projects, including ones based on the Mortar Recommendation Engine (development and hosting of public projects are free): http://www.mortardata.com . Mortar Data provides help in form of public Q&A forum ( https://answers.mortardata.com ) as well as a comprehensive tutorial on building recommendation engine using open technologies ( http://help.mortardata.com/data_apps/recommendation_engine ). "Introduction to Recommender Systems" - a relevant Coursera course (MOOC), which content and description provide additional resources on the topic. PredictionIO - an open source machine learning server software, which allows building data science applications , including recommendation systems ( source code is available on GitHub). PredictionIO includes a built-in recommendation engine ( http://docs.prediction.io/current/engines/itemrec/index.html ) and supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks via RESTful APIs as well as SDKs/plug-ins. PredictionIO maintains an Amazon Machine Image on AWS Marketplace for deploying applications on the AWS infrastructure. Additional open source software projects , relevant to the topic (discovered via MLOSS website on machine learning open source software: http://www.mloss.org ): Jubatus MyMediaLite TBEEF PREA CofiRank The following relevant R blog posts are also interesting: "Simple tools for building a recommendation engine" "Recommendation System in R"
