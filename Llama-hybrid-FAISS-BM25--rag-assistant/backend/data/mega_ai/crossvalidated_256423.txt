You may use principal component analysis (PCA) to get an idea on how many common factors are driving these variables. Follow the following steps calculate the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix and rank the eigenvalues from the largest to the smallest. Calculate (sum of top eigenvalues) / (sum of all eigenvalues) For example, if the top three (3) eigenvalues account for 90% of the total eigenvalues, it intuitively means that the variables are primarily driven by three factors. ' In many cases, very high dimension data are actually driven by just a few underlying factors.
