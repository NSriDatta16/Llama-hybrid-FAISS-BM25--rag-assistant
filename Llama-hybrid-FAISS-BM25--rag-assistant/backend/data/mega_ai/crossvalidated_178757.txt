Why is Logistic Regression mentioned by many sources as useful in predicting stock prices?

My understanding of Logistic Regression is that it is actually a classifier, hence used for predicting either a categorical outcome (ie. binary or an outcome with specific labels) as opposed to a continuous outcome. I would have expected that predicting a stock price would be a continuous outcome, so I don't understand how a stock price can actually be a classification. Can someone please enlighten me? An example of research paper using Logistic Regression to predict a stock price .
