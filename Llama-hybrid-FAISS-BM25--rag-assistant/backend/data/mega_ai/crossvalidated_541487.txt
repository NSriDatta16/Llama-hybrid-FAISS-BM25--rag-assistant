Is Training my deep learning model 100 epochs two times instead of 200 at once gonna effect the performance?

I was wondering if training my Deep model two times 100 epoch each, instead of 200 epochs one time gonna effect the performance of my model or not ? Suppose first I run my model 100 epochs and then I trained it with the initialized best weights learned in first training session of 100 epochs and running it again for 100 epochs instead of training my model once with 200 epochs I do understand how epoch works [one epoch = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples] If I have Training Set of size 1000 and batch size of 100 then it will take 10 iterations to complete one epoch in each epoch we will draw 100 instances from training set without replacement. From my understanding I don't see any problem in Training my deep learning model 100 epochs two times instead of 200 at once
