The VCL already tracks the WM_LBUTTONDOWN/UP messages for you. The csLButtonDown flag will be enabled in your component's ControlState property while the left mouse button is held down on your component (if the DragMode property is not set to dmAutomatic , that is). Your Paint() code can check for that flag and adjust its background drawing as needed.
