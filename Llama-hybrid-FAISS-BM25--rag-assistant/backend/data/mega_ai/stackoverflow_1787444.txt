If you're using the default "cpython" version then this won't help you, because only one thread can execute at a time; look up Global Interpreter Lock . Instead, I'd suggest looking at the multiprocessing module in Python 2.6 -- it makes parallel programming a cinch. You can create a Pool object with 2*num_threads processes, and give it a bunch of tasks to do. It will execute up to 2*num_threads tasks at a time, until all are done. At work I have recently migrated a bunch of Python XML tools (a differ, xpath grepper, and bulk xslt transformer) to use this, and have had very nice results with two processes per processor.
