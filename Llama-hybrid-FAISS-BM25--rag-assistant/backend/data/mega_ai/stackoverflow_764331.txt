sqlite column width

i'm executing PRAGMA table_info over a sqlite db PRAGMA table_info(my_table); And these are the columns retrieved: name type notnull dflt_value pk I noted there is no column width in case of (n)(var)char data types, Â¿is there any easy way to get this info? NOTE: I know there is no problem inserting large values in these columns, however, i wanna access this metadata anyway.
