For a given predictor, $$t_{(df)}=\frac {\hat b-b_0}{SE_\hat b}$$ where $\hat b$ is the regression coefficient estimated from a sample, $SE_\hat b$ is its standard error, $b_0$ is the value of the $b$ population parameter assumed by the null hypothesis (zero by default), and $df=n-k$, where $n$ is the number of observations, and $k$ is the number of regression coefficients estimated in the model, including the intercept's. Wikipedia answered this better than I did at first, so I've reorganized things somewhat to suit it. You may find several other details included there useful, including an exception for certain time series where t is not normally distributed.
