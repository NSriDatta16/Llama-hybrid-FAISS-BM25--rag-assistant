Copy Localizable.Strings from one project to another

I need to copy the Localizable.Strings files/folders from one Xcode project to another. I'm having difficulty seeing how to do it. I'd prefer not to have to re-create and then copy the content, but at the moment I can't find another way. Importing the folders with Add Existing or Drag and Drop from two Xcode windows doesn't seem to do it right.
