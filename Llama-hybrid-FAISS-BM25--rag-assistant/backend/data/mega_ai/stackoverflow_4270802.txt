Appending to the rows of a table

I have a two dimensional list and a one dimensional list. I would like to insert the 1D list into the 2D list as an additional column. For example: array = {{a,1,2},{b,2,3},{c,3,4}}; column = {x,y,z}; becomes final = {{a,1,2,x},{b,2,3,y},{c,3,4,z}}; I have done this inelegantly: Table[Insert[array[[i]], column[[i]], 4], {i, Length[array]}]; My question: what is the proper way to do this in Mathematica? I don't think it needs the loop I'm using. My solution feels ugly.
