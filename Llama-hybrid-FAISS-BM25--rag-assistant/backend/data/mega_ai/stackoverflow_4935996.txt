Short Answer: Yes you can, but your browser needs to support for the Drag and Drop and File APIs that are part of HTML5. Currently, that is only Chrome 8+ and Firefox 3.6+. July, 2011 Update : Current browsers that support this are Chrome, Firefox, Safari 6 (and Safari 5 if you use FormData objects) and IE 10 Preview 2. More information here . IE 8 and 9 don't work, not sure if IE9 final will change this. Safari 5 (as much as Apple touts HTML5) has no support for the File API necessary and DnD of native resources is not recognized (DnD within the page can be made to work, but that is only half the problem). You can hack around this lack in Safari 5 by using a trick of styling out an INPUT field of type "FILE" to actually not show the file path bar and utilize the fact that that Drag and Drop onto a file upload box in Safari actually inserts the full file name -- you use some JavaScript to trigger the upload as soon as they drop and viola. Here is a tutorial specifically for that hack. Opera doesn't seem to support either API -- I've read that they are waiting out the battle of the HTML5 spec until the dust settles THEN adding support for those APIs necessary to do this. I am actually the author of the HTML5 Drag and Drop/File API Upload tutorial linked above and used that method to implement exactly what you want at imgscalr.com -- the JavaScript is heavily commented if you want to pull it down and look at how I'm doing it. Hope that helps.
