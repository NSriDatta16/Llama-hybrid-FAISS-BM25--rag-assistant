'#' Fragment is accessible client-side only, however IE8 submitting URL include #fragment part. You can use Ajax to make it works. Something like: var fragment = location.hash; // on page load $.get('/yoururl' + '?' + fragment.replace(/^.*#/, '')); It will looks like you are requesting URL#fragment on client-side, but actually, it will request URL?fragment and you can work with it on server-side. One thing you should remember about - server page will be requested twice, so second one (Ajax request - check the request header "X-Requested-With=XMLHttpRequest") you should take. P.S. Google applications using same solution, as I'm seeing from Firebug.
