Hypothesis Test for Ranked Preference?

I am conducting a survey where people are required to rank 3 different designs from 1st to 3rd. For example, there are 3 designs - A, B and C. Participants are required to rank them in order of preference, e.g. A: 3rd B: 1st C: 2nd How should I conduct a hypothesis test to see if people prefer design A over the rest? I came across the Friedman test which mentions that measured values across the 3 groups (in this case, designs) are correlated. However, in my scenario, they are mutually exclusive within the same participant, e.g. if someone chooses design A as 1st, they cannot choose designs B and C as 1st. Is the Friedman test still applicable? I also came across posts that recommended doing the Friedman test, followed by the Wilcoxon-test to first figure out if there are statistical differences between the groups, then doing pairwise comparisons. Is it possible to compare Design 1 vs Design 2+3 directly, such that my alternative hypothesis would be Design 1 is preferred over both Designs 2 & 3? I was thinking if I could calculate the averages of 2 & 3 together, then followed by design 1 and comparing them against each other directly using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.
