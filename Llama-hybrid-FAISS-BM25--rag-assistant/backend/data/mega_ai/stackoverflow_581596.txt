( I did it in PowerShell) You need this dll Microsoft.VisualStudio.Coverage.Analysis.dll then this line will turn .coverage into an xml file (which the .trx already is) $dataStore = ([Microsoft.VisualStudio.CodeCoverage.CoverageInfoManager]::CreateInfoFromFile("$homeDir\tests.coverage")).BuildDataSet($null) $dataStore.WriteXml("$homeDir\Coverage.xml") Then you could use the MsTest xsl file from cruisecontrol.net to put the test results in a nice html format, and I have an XSL for the coverage. WHich won't fit here. I wish they had a way to upload files. Email me alex dot hutton at hotmail, and I can get you the xsl to display that coverage
