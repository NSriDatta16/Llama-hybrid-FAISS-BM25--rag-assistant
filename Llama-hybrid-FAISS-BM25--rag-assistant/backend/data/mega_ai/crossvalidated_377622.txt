A few comments: It doesn't matter if you code the responses as {1,2,3,4,5} or {-2,-1,0,1,2}. Obviously the numerical result will be different, but the analysis comes out the same. It just depends how you would like to present the results. Similarly, it doesn't matter if the result for each Question Category is calculated from the average of the responses from the individual questions or the sum of the responses. Unless you have missing responses. In that case you will have to think carefully about how you will handle missing data. Usually if your questionnaire is designed to have questions summed into Question Categories --- that is, if individual Likert items are summed into Likert scales ---, then you wouldn't address the individual questions.
