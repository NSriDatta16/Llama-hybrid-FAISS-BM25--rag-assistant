Literature recommendation for convolutional neural nets

I am looking for a good book or an article concearning convolutional neural nets, especially their architecture. I like the http://deeplearningbook.org but it does not provide any information on the application, e.g. on how the size of filters should be chosen. Actually I am looking for a serious source for statements like that: "It is common to increase the number of filters for deeper convolutional layers." "A common choice for the max pooling layer is a filter of size $2\times 2$ and stride $2$ ." There are tons of really good blogs on this topic (that's where I got my information from), but I need some citable sources for my thesis. It should not be too case-specific, especially as I don't use the CNNs on images what most articles seem to do. EDIT: It would be great if the sources had an open access..
