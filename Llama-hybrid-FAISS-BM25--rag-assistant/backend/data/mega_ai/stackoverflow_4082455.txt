Is RIM Alliance Partner program the only option for blackberry applications when no BES and no APN are provided?

I'm here, as many before me, with an HttpConnection problem using the BlackBerry platform (the 4.6.1 in my case). I need to perform a call to a web service and everything works fine from the emulator (using MDS and WiFi) but when using a real phone (an 8250) only the WiFi works. My test phone, like many here in Italy, has a BIS data plan and no default APN configuration. As I told, this is a very common configuration for my country phones so I'd like to solve the problem without forcing the user to specify any connection parameter. I already tried to create an HttpConnection using all the variants of the Connector.Create method: (HttpConnection)Connector.open(uri); // No parameters specified (HttpConnection)Connector.open(uri + ";deviceside=true" ); (HttpConnection)Connector.open(uri + ";deviceside=false" ); (HttpConnection)Connector.open(uri + ";interface=wifi" ); (HttpConnection)Connector.open(uri + ";deviceside=false;ConnectionUID=uid" ); Number 4 , i.e. WiFi, is the only method working for me. Number 1 and 3 fail complaing about the missing APN configuration. Number 2 fails because I'm not connected to a BES infrastructure. Number 5 fails because the uid retrieved with the code shown into the BB documentation always return a null value (maybe because WAP2 is not configured?) I didn't test the WAP1 solution because the average user will probably not know the parameters needed for configuring it. I've just discovered that also the "mds-public" magic string may affect the connection but I still have to investigate on its meaning and the effects on my carrier. So, finally, the real question: Do you think that the only solution for me is to request the access to the BIS-B service and so to become an Alliance Partner program member? You know, I'd like to be sure before asking to my boss to pay for it if it is not necessary. Thanks so much in advance, Alessandro
