LAMP setup on elderly hardware?

My former roommate agreed to host my web site for a while on his server while I got situated at my new apartment with my wife (also new). He is looking to move soon and wants to retire his web server, so I need to build a server for my own use. I investigated setting up a virtual box on the Mac Mini that I use for development, but I can't really guarantee it will always be available, so I'd like to have hardware dedicated to serving up the site. The old setup is LAMP, and I'm pretty comfortable in Linux, LAMP seems the way to go, but the spare hardware I have is OLD - 3/486, 32 or 64 meg of ram, with a HD somewhere between 8 and 16 gigs. Due to setting up budget with my wife, however, new hardware is pretty much out. What do you guys think? Can I get a LAMP setup running on hardware that old and constrained? Some of the pages leverage MySQL and Php, so it's not straight static HTML, but I'm not running Java or anything. Are there distros specially suited for this sort of setup?
