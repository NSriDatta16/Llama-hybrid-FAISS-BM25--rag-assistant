I would argue that you want a two-way model because there is meaningful variance associated with both dogs and raters (a one-way model would only look at variance associated with dogs). Whether you want [agreement or consistency] and [single or average] depends on how you want to use the ratings. If you plan to use the ratings from a single rater for each dog, then calculate single score ICCs; if, however, you plan to use the average of multiple raters' ratings for each dog, then calculate average score ICCs. Finally, if you plan to use ranks or z-scores for analysis (and therefore don't care if raters have different means), then calculate consistency ICCs; if, however, you plan to use the raw scores (and therefore want raters to have the same mean), then calculate agreement ICCs.
