The logistic regression model is of the form $$ \mathrm{logit}(p_i) = \mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{p,i}. $$ It is called a generalized linear model not because the estimated probability of the response event is linear, but because the logit of the estimated probability response is a linear function of the predictors parameters. More generally, the Generalized Linear Model is of the form $$ \mathrm{g}(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{p,i}, $$ where $\mu$ is the expected value of the response given the covariates. Edit: Thank you whuber for the correction.
