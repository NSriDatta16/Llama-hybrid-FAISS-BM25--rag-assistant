While the JFileChooser accessory was intended to be used for things like thumbnails of the currently selected file, per the JavaDocs : An accessory is often used to show a preview image of the selected file; however, it can be used for anything that the programmer wishes, such as extra custom file chooser controls. So you'll have to create a custom JComponent to represent "favorite directories", then call setAccessory(myFavesComponent) on your file chooser. To actually implement the storage of favorite directories, you'll want to use the Preferences API .
