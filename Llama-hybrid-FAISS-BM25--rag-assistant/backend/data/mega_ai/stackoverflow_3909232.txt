Keyboard Input In A Separate Class?

Just started learning Java a week or so ago. I have made a little Java program that calculates the amount of reviews, and the average review rating that something has. For instance, on the app store, you would enter in 1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star, and 5 star reviews and the program would calculate the average review score. Anyway, maybe it would just be easier to show you. What I want to do is have the keyboard input section in a different class. But when I tried to do this, the compiler said "cannot find symbol" I know there is no global variables in Java, but surely there is a way to pass the user-input variable into a different class(?). I have tried the "extends" keyword to make my keyboard class a subclass, but that didn't work either. I essentially need to access the firStar , secStar , thrSstar , fouStar , and fivStar variables in the reviewHandler class, when those variables are originally defined in the keyboardInput class. reviewHandler class: public class reviewHandler { public void reviews() { keyboardInput keyboard = new keyboardInput(); keyboard.fiveStar(); int oneStar = firStar; int twoStar = secStar; int threeStar = thrStar; int fourStar = fouStar; int fiveStar = fivStar; int starOne = oneStar * 1; int starTwo = twoStar * 2; int starThree = threeStar * 3; int starFour = fourStar * 4; int starFive = fiveStar * 5; int reviewCount = oneStar + twoStar + threeStar + fourStar + fiveStar; double reviewStarCount = starOne + starTwo + starThree + starFour + starFive; double reviewAverage = reviewStarCount / reviewCount; reviewAverage = reviewAverage * 100; reviewAverage = Math.round(reviewAverage); reviewAverage = reviewAverage / 100; System.out.println("Total reviews: " + reviewCount); System.out.println("Average review score: " + reviewAverage); } } keyboardInput class: import java.util.Scanner; public class keyboardInput extends reviewHandler { public void fiveStar() { Scanner stars = new Scanner(System.in); int firStar, secStar, thrStar, fouStar, fivStar; System.out.println("Number of 1 star reviews: "); firstar = stars.nextInt(); System.out.println("Number of 2 star reviews: "); secstar = stars.nextInt(); System.out.println("Number of 3 star reviews: "); thrstar = stars.nextInt(); System.out.println("Number of 4 star reviews: "); foustar = stars.nextInt(); System.out.println("Number of 5 star reviews: "); fivstar = stars.nextInt(); } } reviewLauncher class: public class reviewLauncher { public static void main (String[] args) { reviewHandler start = new reviewHandler(); start.reviews(); } } EDIT: If I move the firStar, secStar, thrSstar, fouStar, and fivStar variables out of the method, transforming them into instance variables, the program compiles and runs, but the program will return a 0 when I try to use it.
