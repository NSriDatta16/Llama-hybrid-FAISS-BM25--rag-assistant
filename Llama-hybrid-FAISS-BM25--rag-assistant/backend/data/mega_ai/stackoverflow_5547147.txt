Magento custom save order

We have a custom discount option other than magento default discount/coupon option. In that customer can choose the full amount to be paid from their balance amount with the account. So if they choose to pay the total amount then i want to skip the magento payment tab. In the custom action i have to save the order and redirect the checkout page customer to checkout success page. How can i do that. When i call order->save(), it throws error like " Should select a payment option." Please help me to skip the payment option on checkout page
