Which algorithm to use to classify plots based on graphical features?

I have plots which I need to classify based on some features. For example, I need to differentiate between the following plots having smooth features or 'valleys' at certain x values. Which machine learning algorithm would be most appropriate to do so? I was thinking a combination of anomaly detection, clustering and classification. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!
