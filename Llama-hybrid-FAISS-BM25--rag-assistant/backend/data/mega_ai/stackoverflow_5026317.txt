I want to implement drag drop functionality using jQuery Masonry layout

There are online examples where you can drag and drop pannels which are positioned relative. but i want the divs to be placed with position absolute and should not collide each other. its kinda griddy layout without any white spaces.. and i want exactly like the Masonry jQuery layout with drag and drop functionality.
