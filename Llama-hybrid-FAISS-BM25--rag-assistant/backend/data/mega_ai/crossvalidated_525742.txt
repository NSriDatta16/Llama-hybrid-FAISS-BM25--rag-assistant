Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) provides general case solutions and exponential distribution solutions for median survival and calculation of confidence intervals. Suppose $T$ is the distribution of event times, with $C$ the indicator of censor versus failure. The Kaplan Meier estimate $\hat{S}(t)$ of the overall survival is a consistent estimate of $1-F_{(t)}$ where $F$ is the cumulative distribution function for the failure process. Supposing $F(t)=1-\exp (-\lambda t)$ , the median survival $F^{-1}(0.5) = M$ is given by $$M = \log 2 \sum (\text{observed survival times})/d$$ where $d$ is the sum of observed deaths. In fact, $\sum (\text{observed survival times})/d$ is the MLE of $\lambda$ . The 6 months survival by $F(6) = \exp(-6 \lambda )$ . On the linear scale, the variance estimate of $\hat{M}$ is $\hat{M}/\sum P_i$ where $$P_i = 1-\exp\left(T_i \log(2) / \hat{M}\right).$$ A symmetric interval for the median with this variance approximation is called the Bartholomew interval. However, most reported intervals will be asymmetric based on the variance stabilized interval. As a pragmatic solution, I'd recommend taking the midpoint of these estimates to recover the linear variance approximation. With an estimate of the variance, the remaining details can be recovered via the $\delta$ -method. The mapping $f(x)$ defined by $\exp(-6 \log 2 / x)$ gives $F(6) = f(F^{-1}(0.5))$ . And $$f^{\prime}(x) = 6 \log (2) \exp(-6 \log 2 / x) / x^2$$ So by the $\delta$ -method, a consistent estimate of the variance of the 6 month survival would be given by: $$ \text{SE}(\hat{S}_6) = f^\prime(x) \text{SE}(\hat{M})$$ The approximation seems to work well for $M$ and $S(6)$ not close to 1 or 0.
