Time series with external regressors

I have monthly data for about the last 2.5 years for an economic index as well as external regressors for each month. Is it feasible to treat the months as independent and just fit a multiple regression model regressing the external data (3-5 variables) on the index? I have tried fitting an ARIMA (1,0,0) and with external regressors and the auto regressive term is not significant. Is there a test that will determine whether a time series is independent given external data? Also, given my small amount of data what is the best way to validate any models.
