Creating a machine learning algorithm

I've heard of various different types of machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, neural networks, naive bayes etc, and I was wondering what goes into creating a machine learning algorithm? How do they know when it is "good"? How do you create a machine learning algorithm? Thanks
