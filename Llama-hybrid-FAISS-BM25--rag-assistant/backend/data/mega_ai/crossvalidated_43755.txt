Study replication from a Bayesian point of view

Consider following situation: Study A compares two groups and finds a mean difference with an effect size of d = .8 (p From an NHST perspective, there is no single/ simple answer to the question "Does Study B replicate the results of Study A?". Asendorpf et al. (2012) summarized it as follows: "Given that no single approach to establish replicability is without limits, however, use of multiple inferential strategies […] is a better approach. In practice, this means summarizing results by answering four questions: (a) Do the studies agree about direction of effect? (b) What is the pattern of statistical significance? (c) Is the effect size from the subsequent studies within the CI of the first study? (d) Which facets of the design should be considered fixed factors, and which random factors?". That means, there is no single answer for the question "Has this study been replicated?" (see also Sanjay Srivastava's blog post What counts as a successful or failed replication? ). Now I ask myself: Is there probably a simple(r) answer from a Bayesian point of view? Kruschke (2010) describes a "cumulative replication probability", which takes the actual posterior distribution from Study A as the prior for simulated data, which then gives an answer on the probability of replicating a certain decision of Study A (e.g. a Bayesian model comparison). In my scenario, however, we have already two Studies conducted. Now here's my question: Is there some way to feed Study A's posterior as information into Study B's results and come up with an answer to the question "Is Study B a replication of Study A?"? How could such an answer look like? (As I am interested but so far unexperienced in Bayesian stats, my description of the situation might be utterly wrong ...) Asendorpf. (2012).
