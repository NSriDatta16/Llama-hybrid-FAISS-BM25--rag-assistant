We generally do moving average in the following way: It means we have to keep on adding 3 months data and move our data point one by one, it means for this data 2,5,1,9,3,4: Moving avg1=(2+5+1)/3 Moving avg2=(5+1+9)/3 Moving avg3=(1+9+3)/3 For even moving averages you have to iterate one more times for odd moving average you have to do single iteration.
