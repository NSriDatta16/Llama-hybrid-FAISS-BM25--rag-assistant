I have been using Eclipse Memory Analyzer for analyzing different performance problems successfully. First of all, install the tool as described in the project webpage in Eclipse. After that, you can create a dump file knowing the pid of the jvm to be analyzed jmap -dump:format=b,file= .hprof Then just import the .hprof file in eclipse. It has some automatic reports that try (for me they usually do not work) to point out which could be the possible problems. Edit: Answering the comment: You are right, it is more like a leak finder for Java. For performance problems, I have played with JRat for small projects. It shows time comsumed per method, number of times a method is called, hierarchy of calls, etc. The only problem is that as far as I know, it does not support .hprof files. To use it, yo need to execute your program adding a VM argument -javaagent: /shiftone-jrat.jar This will generate a directory with the profile captured by the tool. Then, execute java -jar shiftone-jrat.jar And open the trace. Even been a simple tool, I think it could be useful.
