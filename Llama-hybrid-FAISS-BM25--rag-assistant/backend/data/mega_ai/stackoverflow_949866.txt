Just guessing about your situation, of course, but I most often find that "I just learned to program, and have been practicing every since" programmers (a class which includes me, I might add) are sometimes short on the tools supplied by a compilers course (see Learning to write a compiler for resources). The recognition of this crept up on me slowly, but looking back on it this is huge. My second worry for informally trained programmers is understanding how computers work at the low levels, but if you are doing embedded work, I imagine that you have (at least!) a good start in that area. I suppose it sounds useless when (in the comments) I describe this as "the course on writing compilers". Afterall, you probably figure that you don't intend t write any compilers, so you're OK. But that course really does provides a set of powerful and general tool that you can leverage in many situation. See How much of the compiler should we know? .
