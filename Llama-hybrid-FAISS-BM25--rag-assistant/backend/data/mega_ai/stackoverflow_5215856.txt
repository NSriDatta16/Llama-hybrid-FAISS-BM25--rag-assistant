Reinforcement Learning With Variable Actions

All the reinforcement learning algorithms I've read about are usually applied to a single agent that has a fixed number of actions. Are there any reinforcement learning algorithms for making a decision while taking into account a variable number of actions? For example, how would you apply a RL algorithm in a computer game where a player controls N soldiers, and each soldier has a random number of actions based its condition? You can't formulate fixed number of actions for a global decision maker (i.e. "the general") because the available actions are continually changing as soldiers are created and killed. And you can't formulate a fixed number of actions at the soldier level, since the soldier's actions are conditional based on its immediate environment. If a soldier sees no opponents, then it might only be able to walk, whereas if it sees 10 opponents, then it has 10 new possible actions, attacking 1 of the 10 opponents.
