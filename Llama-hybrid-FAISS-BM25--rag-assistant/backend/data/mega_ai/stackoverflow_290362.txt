I would add a boolean flag to the Response, something like isObjectPresent . Your clients can then take a look at this flag to determine if the object "is present" or not. Any values you do not set in the response object will have their default values set (int = 0, String = ""), but this way you can signal to the client not to pay attention to those fields.
