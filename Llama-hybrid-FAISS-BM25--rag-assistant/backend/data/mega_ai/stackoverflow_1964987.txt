the issue could be the space in the path field. this attribute should be unspecified or should be a valid path like /home. try specifying an empty string ('') instead of space. could also be a caching thing, i.e. the login page may appear to be unauthenticated because the content was cached. session_cache_limiter('nocache') in php would instruct the browser not to cache anything (when using sessions), which is the same as setting: Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache to omit the path, you can pass '' (empty string) or null to setcookie for that param. or use something like '/' to indicate the entire site. ie8 windows and tabs share the same session unless the user selects "File -> New Session" or runs iexplore.exe -nomerge explicitly.
