All machine learning models need the data provided as numbers because what they do is build mathematical models. This means that you need somehow to encode all the non-numerical data (images, words, categories, sound recordings, etc) to numbers, this applies both to the features and the labels. To learn more, search for feature engineering . In the case of labels, we encode them as binary variables (binary, -1/+1), whereas for multiple categories we can use something like one-hot-encoding . As for training the model, it's the same as regression: the model predicts some score and it is compared to the encoded label using a loss function. Squared error is a perfectly fine loss here, but there are also specialized ones like cross-entropy loss. If this is new to you, I'd recommend that you start with some introductory course or handbook on machine learning to catch up.
