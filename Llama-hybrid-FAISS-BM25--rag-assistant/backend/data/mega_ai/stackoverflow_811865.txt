post-edit answers: What I think you may be missing is that SSL is linked intrinsically to TCP. You cannot have an SSL "connection" to the server that doesn't ride on top of a TCP connection. You break one, you break the other. Most SSL implementations include "shortcut" negotiation where subsequent new connections can leverage the public key encryption that has already taken place and instead directly use the most recently negotiated symmetric key. The details of this, however, are hidden within the SSL implementation. From the point of view of the user and/or client software, the fiction is maintained that the entire negotiation took place just like it did on the first connection. If the SSL connection is still established, then it follows that the symmetric key information is still maintained on both ends. Yes. Yes, although it would be improbable for the client to keep a connection to a server once it has navigated away to some other site.
