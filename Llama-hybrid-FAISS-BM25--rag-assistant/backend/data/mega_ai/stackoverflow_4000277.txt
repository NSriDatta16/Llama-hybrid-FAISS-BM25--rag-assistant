I think one database with multiple tables is the way to go, because duplicating the database and schema for each new client doesn't scale well. XML files sounds cool but so far I haven't seen an XML read/write engine which is as fast as most RDBMSes, so bin that one. To make this work (lots of tables in one database) you should pay attention to indexing and optimizing the one database; indexes in particular will help you maintain speed as you scale up.
