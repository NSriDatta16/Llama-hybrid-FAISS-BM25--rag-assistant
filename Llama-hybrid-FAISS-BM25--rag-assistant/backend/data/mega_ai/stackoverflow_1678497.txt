No, you do not need neural networks here! Simply consider an HSL color value a vector and define a weighted modulus function for the vector like this: modulus = sqrt(a*H1*H1 + b*S1*S1 + c*L1*L1); where a,b,c are weights you should decide based on your visual definition of what creates a bigger difference in perceived color - a 1% change in Hue or a 1% change in Saturation I would suggest you use a = b = 0.5 and c = 1 Finally, find out the range your modulus would take and define similar colors to be those which have their moduli very close to each other (say 5%)
