If you know C -- it sounds like you do -- grab a used copy of this ancient book: http://www.amazon.com/Craft-Take-Charge-Programming-Book-Disk/dp/0078818826 In it there's a chapter where the author creates a "C" interpreter, in C. It's not academically serious like the Dragon book would be, but I remember it being pretty simple, very practical and easy to follow, and since you're just getting started, it would be an awesome introduction to the ideas of a "grammar" for languages, and "tokenizing" a program. It would be a perfect place for you to start. Also, at $0.01 for a used copy, cheaper than the Dragon Book. ;)
