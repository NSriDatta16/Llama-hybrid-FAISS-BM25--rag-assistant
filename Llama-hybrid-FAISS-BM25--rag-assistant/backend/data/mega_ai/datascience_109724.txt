Movie Recommendation Model based on user behavior pattern and movie data

Now, I want to develop Agent Based Modeling (ABM) for movie recommendation system. ABM is a kind of simulation system, I can set some rules for client's action. In my current setting, I want to make client rules by using client log data. In log data, each individuals has their own actions, coded as numeric data and likes path . customer ID action1 action 2 ... X123 12 15 ... X234 17 25 43 And I also have embedded vector for actions. action feature1 ... feature N 12 0 ... 0.561 15 0 ... 0.141 17 0 ... 0.871 My point is that could I combine 'my action embedding vector' and 'customer action path' for my simulation system? I found some methodologies like Graph Neural Network, but they made embedding vector based on client log datasets. Are there any methodologies that I can use both movie data and personal action datasets? I considered Graph Convolution Network, but I think it is inappropriate because I want to make model deriving user's behavior path.
