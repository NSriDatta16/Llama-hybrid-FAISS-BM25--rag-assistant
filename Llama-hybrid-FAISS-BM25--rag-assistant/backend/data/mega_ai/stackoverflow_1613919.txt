CLASSPATH is not "supposed" to start with "." . Since its purpose is configuration of the runtime, it is free to take on any value you choose. Also note that using the CLASSPATH environment variable has been discouraged since Java 1.1 (released in early 1997)â€”at least 12 years. The classpath of a web-application, on the other hand is well-specified. Move the contents of the controllers directory (and any other invalid subdirectories) into WEB-INF/classes/ , so that the package directory is an immediate child of classes .
