If you're trying to grab info in column A and maybe multiply it by something in column B in your B cell you would do: =A1*2 Is this what you're talking about? This seems maybe too straightforward... EDIT Try this: =$A1*2 and then drag the little square in the lower right corner of the cell down as many rows as you need.
