If I understand correctly, the way I approach this problem would be a 3-tier (Don't get hang up so much on the 3-tier buzz words that we all have heard about): JavaScript (ExtJs) on browsers talks HTTP, Ajax using XmlHttpRequest, raw (naked) or wrapper doesn't really matter, to the web server (Lighttpd, Apache, ...). Since the app on the embedded device can talk by socket, the web server would use socket to talk to the embedded device. You can decide to put more business logic on the JavaScript, and keep the Apache/Lighttpd code really thin so it wont timeout. In this way, you can leverage all technologies that you're already familiar with. Ajax between tier 1 and 2 is nothing new, and use socket between 2 and 3.
