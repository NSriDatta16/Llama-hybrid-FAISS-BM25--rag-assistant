Thanks for the answers above, the job has been done. My solution: subclass a UIView, override touchesBegan:withEvent: in it's implementation file add the UIView(as subview) to cell.view and cover the position of imageView, then make the subview nearest transparent(alpha=0.015f) done. it works fine Note : if alpha number is too small(0.01f), there will not trigger the touch event, anybody knows why?
