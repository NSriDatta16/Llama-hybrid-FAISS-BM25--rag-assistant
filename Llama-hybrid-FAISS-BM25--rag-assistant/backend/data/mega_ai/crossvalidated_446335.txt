Can I do a repeated measures logistic regression for 16 students who answered different questions on a test?

I had 15 students take a vocabulary test with 100 items at the end of a course and were scored "1" (correct) or "0" (incorrect) for each item. I would like to predict the likelihood of them getting a specific word correct based on how frequently they encountered the word during the course (input frequency) and how often they used the word in their assignments (productive use). Here is an example of what my data looks like: student word input.freq productive.use score 1 影響 4 1 1 1 含まれる 10 0 1 1 燃える 4 0 0 2 影響 4 1 1 2 含まれる 10 0 0 2 燃える 4 2 1 Obviously I don't have a large sample size, so I was wondering if I could use repeated measures in order to do a logistical regression? However, I worry it may be problematic because they are being given different vocabulary words. If logistic regression cannot be used, are there any other suggestions?
