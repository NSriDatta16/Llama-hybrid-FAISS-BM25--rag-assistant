Suppose you wanted the equivalent of an IEnumerable but were using C# 1.0. You could implement IEnumerable - but that would require boxing and unboxing on each iteration. Using the sort of duck-typing version of foreach you could get away without any boxing. In many cases the boxing wouldn't actually be that harmful (I tend to find that the performance hit is exaggerated ) but it's still inelegant. I strongly, strongly suspect that if generics had been around in C# 1.0, foreach would have been restricted to IEnumerable .
