Describing the data cleaning process

The term "Data Cleaning" is used to describe outlier checking, date parsing, missing value imputation to structuring datasets (organizing data values within a dataset) to facilitate analysis. The latter is commonly referred to as " Data Tidying " but what about the former? I have seen outlier checking, date parsing and missing value imputation referred to as " soft processing ", however I wonder if this is a commonly used term. If I describe a component of data cleaning as " soft processing " is it reasonable to assume that knowledgeable people will know that I am referring to outlier checking, date parsing and missing value imputation? In the field of Data Science, is there a commonly accepted phrase or term that umbrellas outlier checking, date parsing and missing value imputation .
