glm binary variable using family= gaussian instead of binomial is it wrong?

no this question is not a duplicate what i did is that i have 50 variables one qulitative y taken values 0 for normal cells and 1 for abnormal cells and 49 quantitative variables what i wanted to do is using logistic regression to express y ~the other 49 variables but when coding i just used this glm formula glm(y~., data=mydt) and i did not mentioned the family so what i used really is not logistic model but model with family=gaussian then now what i want to know is wht is the difference between the two models and if this did affect the results that i have i hope that is now clear thanks a lot in advance for any help
