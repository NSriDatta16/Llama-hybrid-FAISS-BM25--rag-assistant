A) Regarding training your model with what data, you always want to train your model on training data and keep aside some data to evaluate the performance on unseen data(test data in this case). B) Regarding deployment of a timeseries model, you need to have a pipeline prepared where in 1) you can deploy your packaged model file (can be a pickled file, pmml, onnx, h2o packaged file etc.) on any preferred platform(cloud/local machine), 2) Get an API endpoint of the deployed instance to which you can send prediction requests, 3) Monitor the responses and calculate error metrics(RMSE/MAPE etc.) with your real and predicted data that helps you keep track of your model performance 4) It is important to retrain your model when ever there is new data available especially in the case of timeseries as future is unpredictable and you need to keep account of trend and seasonality. Make sure your deployed model is always trained on the recent data available. The above is the deployment pipeline for a timeseries model you need to have to build a better machine learning system.
