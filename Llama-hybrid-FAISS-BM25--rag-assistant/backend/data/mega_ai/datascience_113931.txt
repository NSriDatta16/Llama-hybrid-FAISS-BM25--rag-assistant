How to aggregate qualitative results from a simulation

I am trying to look for methods to aggregate and find the average of qualitative data that are outputted from a simulation. There are 20 qualitative measures, each divided unevenly into 4 cycles labeled 1-4. I am trying to find which bucket would be the mean? I cannot simply take the average, as that would cause problems if most were labeled 1 and 4. The average could not be 2.5. I will say that 1 is closely related to the numbers it's next to, 4 and 2(because its a cycle). So, in my previous example, the answer of 2.5 is further incorrect because its saying the mean cycle is one that's most opposite of where most qualitative data is. I was looking into cell-cycle prediction and thought this may be something similar.
