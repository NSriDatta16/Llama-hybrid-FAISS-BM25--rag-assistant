Is covariance matrix required to compute SVD?

In the PCA lecture of Andrew Ng's ML in Coursera, it is computing the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ from X and use it to compute SVD. Is covariance matrix of X required to compute SVD of X? I think SVD can handle non-square matrix and no need to get a square matrix which is required in eigen vector decomposition, but not SVD.
