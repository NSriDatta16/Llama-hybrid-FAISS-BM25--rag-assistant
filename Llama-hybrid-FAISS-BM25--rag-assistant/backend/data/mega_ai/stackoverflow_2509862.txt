Does setting HttpCacheability.Public also cache the page on the server?

I have these lines in my global.asax (basically because of Can I add my caching lines to global.asax? ) The thing I want to now understand is whether this code purely adds the HTTP headers to the page or does it also make .Net cache this page on the server for 300 seconds? Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(300)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public);
