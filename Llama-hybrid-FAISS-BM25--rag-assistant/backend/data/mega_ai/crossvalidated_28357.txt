It think this has potential to become an interesting list. Maybe we should all either explain or reference how the methods use a likelihood approach. A list of additional likelihood classification procedures: GLMs for binomial or multinomial data (Logistic Regression, Probit Regression, other Link Functions) McCullagh & Nelder and their regularized extensions Hastie et al. The equivalent GAMs Hastie & Tibshirani Certain classification and model trees can also be seen as likelihood-based models ( Su et al , Loh et al's work , Zeileis et al , Rusch & Zeileis , etc.) Certain types of Boosting may also be seen as likelihood-based Lebanon & Lafferty , Friedman et al . From what I know, Bayesian approaches nearly always use the likelihood as part of the model, hence they are always likelihood based. If a negative (log)-likelihood for a classification problem is used as the loss function that is minimized to train the model and then predictions from this model are made, I suppose any classification approach following this counts as likelihood-based.
