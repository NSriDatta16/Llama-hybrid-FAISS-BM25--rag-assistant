When you're dragging and dropping, you're modifying the dom. Thus, you can just check if the right 'answer' draggable is in the correct 'question' droppable. Your first set of code doesn't show your div structure, but consider the following: The Capital of KSA The Capital of UK The Capital of USA Riyadh London Washington You can now check if question1 contains answer1 if( $('#q1').find('#a1').length > 0 ) { alert('question 1 is right!'); } I used .find to make the code easier to read, but i think you get the idea, ya? edit: now i see what you're up to - you want the submit to hold that data. You need to note that before submitting the form into a form element, such as: The Capital of KSA The Capital of UK The Capital of USA Riyadh London Washington $(function() { $('f1').submit(function() { $('.question').each(function() { var $question = $(this); var $answer = $(this).find('.answer'); if ( $answers.length '); }); }); }); Hopefully not too crude typing it in the browser. But the principle is you're going to make hidden form elements with the answer upon submit of the form. The function goes through each question and grabs the id of the answer - you'll end up with form elements that have a name like answer_q1 with a value of a1 - (or a2, if the user is wrong, ya?). Btw, your submit button was after the form closing tag - it needs to be before it.
