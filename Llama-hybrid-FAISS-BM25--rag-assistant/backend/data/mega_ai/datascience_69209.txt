Generating synonyms or similar words from multiples word embeddings

I am looking for a way to generate synonyms, using word embeddings. From one word, and from multiple words. Such as the two example below: "word" -> Word embedding -> generate synonym of "word" "word", "synonym of word .. "-> -> Word embeddings -> generate a synonym of both word I am very new at this. What do you think I should use ? I also want to use a tools that, in further work, would take into account context for word embedding generation, such as: "sentence in including a word" -> Word embedding of word -> generate synonym of "word" in that context I think I will start to do it with BERT... How should I start ? or which alternative should I use ? Thanks for your help !
