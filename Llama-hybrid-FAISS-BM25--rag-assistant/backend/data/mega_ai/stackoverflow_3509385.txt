There are several column oriented SQL DBMSs and they have been around for years. Sybase IQ and Vertica being two well known examples. These are columnn stores in the sense that they use column based storage internally - they still use exactly the same SQL table-based data model as any other SQL DBMS. Unfortunately the term "column oriented" or "column store" has much more recently been appropriated by some NOSQL databases to refer to an entirely different concept. Bigtable for instance. In this context column oriented means a different data model (not relational or SQL). This new definition of a decades-old term has lead to a deal of confusion - especially for people who hadn't heard the term until this newer wave of products came along. http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2010/03/distinguishing-two-major-types-of_29.html
