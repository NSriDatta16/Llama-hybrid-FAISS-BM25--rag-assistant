How can I perform semi-supervised learning for Random forest algorithm in R language?

I want to train random forest by semi-supervised learning. And I have figured out a co-training framework for that, but I need to extract each tree and corresponding bootstrapped training dataset from the fitted random forest model. Is there a way to do that in R?
