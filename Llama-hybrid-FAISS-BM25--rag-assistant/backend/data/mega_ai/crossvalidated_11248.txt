How can I use credibility intervals in Bayesian logistic regression?

I'm using Gibbs sampling to learn the distributions of coefficients for a multinomial logistic regression model. At the end, I end up using the mean values of distributions of coefficients, and the resulting logistic regression is used as a classifier. I'm trying to find out advantages of having probability distributions for coefficients and the response variable, but I can't really see the way to leverage credibility intervals. What can I do with these distributions that I end up with, other than using their mean values? ok, I think I've failed to express my question clearly. Here is the update Let's assume that I have y = b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 in my hands. for all b1,b2,b3 I have normal distributions, with mean and quantiles. These distributions come from the mcmc results. I can use the means of b1,b2,b3 and that'd give me a classifier. I can also use %2.5 quantile values and 97.5 quantile values for b1,b2,b3 and so on. What would be the probabilistic interpretation of these other equations? Can I produce a smoother classifier this way, rather than using only means? The use of credibility intervals is quite clear to me when they are used for a single variable, but in this case, I'm talking about N variables (5 actually) each with their own credibility intervals. I'm having trouble getting the semantics of this setup. I have not seen any papers etc that discusses this, and any pointers would be appreciated.
