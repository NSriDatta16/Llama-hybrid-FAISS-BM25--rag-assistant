Magento - Send emails for different order status

I am currently building an online store using magento. After placing an order, customers automatically receive an "order confirmation". However, I would like to check first first if this order can be processed (for several reasons) and after that, send an "order acceptance" email saying that we accepted the order starting to process it. I cant believe that magento lacks this feature. However I also need to send several other emails: when payment is received when more preoducts need to be ordered when we received the products otderd by the customer.. Does anybody have any clue, how something like this can be accomplished? Thanks in advance!
