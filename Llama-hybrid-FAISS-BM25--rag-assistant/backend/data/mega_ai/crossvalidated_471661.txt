combined p values from different hypothesis

I am currently working on a project in which I'm simultaneously identifying and quantifying protein in k samples. Experimentally, for each of the k samples, I have n identified proteins, with a p value that gives me the reliability of that identification, and the quantity of each protein in each sample. I don't have much control on how this p value is computed. Other than that, samples are independent, treatment and analysis is the same. For each of the n proteins I compute a combined p value from the individual p values for each protein, using either Fisher's or Stouffer's, to assess the significance of identifying each protein in the k samples, and I get a p value for the identification of each protein, call it p1. Then, I want to know the average quantity of each protein in the 4 samples, and I'm testing to check where H0: measured_average = goal_average, and I get a p value for this for each protein, call it p2. I've been reading a lot of research papers both on statistics and on the experiments I'm performing, and to the best of my knowledge and readings, combining p values, and even combining combined p values, can only be performed if the statistic tests for each individual p value are the same, which I guess it is not the case. My question â€“ can I combine p1 and p2? Is there anyway to have an aggregated p value for this situation? Or I just leave it at that?
