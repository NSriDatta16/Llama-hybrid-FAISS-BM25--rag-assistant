If you want to place a one line text, for example a header title in your box, than use line-height For example with a 200px width and 40px height box: .the_box{ width: 200px; height: 40px; line-height: 40px; } It's easy, elegant, and cross-browser. If you have longer text than 200px, this method will not work.
