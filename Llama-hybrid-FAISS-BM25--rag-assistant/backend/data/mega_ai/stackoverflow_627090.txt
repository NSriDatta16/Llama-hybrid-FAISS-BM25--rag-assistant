We ran a similar beta program with non-technical users. We had 30-40 participants, most of them very non-technical and it was definitely painful organizing the provisioning and getting the apps on their phones. We ran into the following problems: Dealing with Windows users. We were working on Macs and it's difficult to ensure that your distribution archive will work properly with the Windows version of iTunes. Testing the installation on a Windows VM helps, but it's definitely a tricky area. Provisioning users as beta applications trickle in. Since we had no defined beta schedule (our fault), we provisioned users as they came in and when we felt like enough had accumulated, we pushed out a new build that would work on the new devices. Unless you're organized, it's possible that some users may accidentally be left out and not be provisioned for a particular build. If they're not provisioned, this can be difficult to debug from the iTunes error message that pops up when they attempt to install. Dealing with iTunes errors when users try to install or upgrade. iTunes seems to be very particular about how you install apps and we could never crack the code on the best method to have our users install or upgrade the app (drag and drop the .app file/directory? build a .ipa file and give it to them that way?) All that being said, if you're only distributing to a few users per client, ad hoc distribution should be manageable and is definitely better than screenshots or mailing a device.
