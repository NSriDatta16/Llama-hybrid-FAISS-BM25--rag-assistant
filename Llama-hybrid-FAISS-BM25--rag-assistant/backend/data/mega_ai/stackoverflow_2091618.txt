A rewrite of the answer by Sarfraz would be something like this, I think: document.getElementById('change').onclick = changeColor; function changeColor() { document.body.style.color = "purple"; return false; } You'd either have to put this script at the bottom of your page, right before the closing body tag, or put the handler assignment in a function called onload - or if you're using jQuery there's the very elegant $(document).ready(function() { ... } ); Note that when you assign event handlers this way, it takes the functionality out of your HTML. Also note you set it equal to the function name -- no (). If you did onclick = myFunc(); the function would actually execute when the handler is being set. And I'm curious -- you knew enough to script changing the background color, but not the text color? strange:)
