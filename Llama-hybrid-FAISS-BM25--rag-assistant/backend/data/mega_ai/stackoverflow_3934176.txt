Android: ViewFlipper & multiple images?

Hey, I checked tons of tutorials and guides but somehow can't find it... I need to include multiple images in my Android app. It's like an image viewer/slideshow. Currently I switch between pictures from /drawable-mdpi dir simply with ImageView and adapter, using gestures to left/right. Works but nothing impresive :/ Basically I could use something like Android (2.1) gallery with some image show animation. 1st question: what's the best way to include many (50-100) fullscreen images in App? 2nd: is it possible to use ViewFlipper animations directly to images? or do i have to somehow populate Views?
