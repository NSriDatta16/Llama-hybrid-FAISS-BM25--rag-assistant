Which algorithm suits for classification of multivariate time series data?

I have multivariate time series data, where the goal is to predict a binary label, which is changing in time. For illustration: there are 20 individuals, for each of them I measure 50 values (categorical, compositional and continuous types) each day, for 1000 consecutive days (some individuals came into study after start, i.e. I do not have 1000 values for each of them and some left the study). There is one more variable, a binary label, which I assign to each individual at each day. Once the label becomes 1 it is hard to get back to 0, but not impossible. The goal is to predict the probability of the label being 1 in next 1,2,3, ... days for each individual and at the same be able to say which of the 50 variables contributed to this probability of label being 1 and how much. Which model is suitable for this? I was thinking about dynamic Bayesian networks, but I am not sure whether this makes sense, as I do not believe that the data have Markovian property and this assumption would be thus incorrect. I was also thinking about some survival model, as I have left and right censoring, but I am not very good in it. Please, if you have any clue what I am talking about, give me some input, I am out of ideas ...
