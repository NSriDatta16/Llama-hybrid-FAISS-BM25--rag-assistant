basically you have to define a width for your form and float: left input and float: right the label, so the label gets next to your input. The is a trick to center relative possitionet elements in CSS: margin: 0 auto but you have to define a width. The problem you gonna have is that all your inputs are gonna be next to each other. In order to prevent that you nest your label and input in a element. And clear the floats. I would use a UL LI element and not Paragraphs (like in PW example), because most of the time, your form, is a list of questions. I have made up an example for you: http://jsfiddle.net/Qs4pk/2/
