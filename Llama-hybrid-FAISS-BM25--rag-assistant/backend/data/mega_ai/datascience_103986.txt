Logistic Regression - Probabilistic intuition vs Geometric intuition

The Probabilistic approach of logistic regression involves the MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) maximizing the likelihood function, or in other words, finding the best parameters for the best fit line using partial derivatives. The Geometric approach involves assigning +1 & -1 to the classes 1 & 0 respectively. A random line is fit to the data. The distance between the points & the line is calculated & the correct & incorrect misclassifications are identified based on the y*d formula. This process continues till we find a line with the least number of misclassifications. Which of these approaches does logistic regression use?
