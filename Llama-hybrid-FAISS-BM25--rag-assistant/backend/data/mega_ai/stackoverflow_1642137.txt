I think this is classic problem ( at least for me ) , where you want to represent your data model in your application. According to my own experience there is always akward sitution like you described. My solution is very similar with some answer above. Make simple class that one to one with your table and if that table have relationship with another table , then make as a property in your class. And about your saying ' I want to do the retrieval in one hit. ' , I think you should write custom SQL Query or perhaps using LINQ.
