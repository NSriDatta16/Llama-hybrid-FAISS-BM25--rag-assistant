Logistic regression

I want to calculate sex and age adjusted odds ratio (simultaneous adjustment) in addition to 95% CI. The dependent variable is disease (0 or 1) The independent variables are age (continuous), sex (0 or 1), and blood sugar (continuous). How to calculate the sex and age adjusted odds ratio? Which one of the tests should be used: multinomial logistic regression or binary logistic regression or another test?
