I am going to take a stab in the dark here, some code would help as Hogan said. Typically overflow error occur with string when VB6 things it is dealing with integer or longs in math formulas and the results are too large for a integer or long to hold. Depending on the nature of your formula you may get away from the problem by forcing the system to use the numbers as floating point by adding a '.0" at the end. Otherwise use the various Cxxx function to explicitly convert the numbers to a type that has a greater range. The one thing you consider is that floating point are less precise than whole number integers so make sure you don't lose needed precision when you do the conversion.
