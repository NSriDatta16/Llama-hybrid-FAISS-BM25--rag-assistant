Document Control

What is the best open source document control app for PHP/MySQL? Focus is to be on a system that is robust, easy to use and fast to implement. Needs to have security layers so that files can be public or private. Group assets would be nice. Project management features would be a bonus if they were scalable, robust but not overcomplicated. EDIT #1: Just to formalize this question a little more, I would like to ensure you all understand what I mean by Document Control program. We have a lot of files that are associated with multiple projects and multiple customers. I would like document access and document revisions to be managed. When someone is putting a document into the system, the system needs to tag the file and manage its safe data storage. This will also be a collaborative venture in that many people will download and edit each file. Admins would have to be able to control which file is the CURRENT version of the file, so that we have the choice of hiding older documents or preventing users from accessing them.
