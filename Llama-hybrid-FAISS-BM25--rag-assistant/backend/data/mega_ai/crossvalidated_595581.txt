Generate data from posterior predictive distribution

I am new to Bayesian. I want to draw data from the posterior predictive distribution p(y|D). Do we need to find the CDF of the posterior predictive distribution and use the monte Carlo method or is there another way for simulation in bayesian? my model has a complicated posterior predictive distribution p(y|D), so I cannot derive CDF. if I can use monte Carlo, can I draw data with pdf?
