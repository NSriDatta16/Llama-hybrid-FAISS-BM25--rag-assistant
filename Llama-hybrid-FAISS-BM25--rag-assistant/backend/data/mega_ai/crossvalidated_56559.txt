Fit a logistic regression code in R

If I have 10 Variables (Q,W,E,R,T,Y,U,I,P,A) and I want Q to be my response variable and other 9 to be my predictors variable. Do I write it in R like this EXAMPLE Furthermore, what if Q is Binary (goes from 1 to 0) and all the other 9 variables are categorically numbered. is it still the same or do i need to write it diff in R
