Like others here said, sending the location header with: header( "Location: http://www.mywebsite.com/otherpage.php" ); but you need to do it before you've sent any other output to the browser. Also, if you're going to use this to block un-authenticated users from certain pages, like you mentioned, keep in mind that some user agents will ignore this and continue on the current page anyway, so you'll need to die() after you send it.
