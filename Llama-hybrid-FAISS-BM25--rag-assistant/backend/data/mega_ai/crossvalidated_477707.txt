How to fit a model to data with asymetric errors?

I need to fit a model to some data. I fit models like this all the time. Usually, the data has symmetric errors (i.e. x Â± error). When its like this, I can minimize Chi^2 no problem (Chi^2 = [(data-model)/(error)]^2) and get a best-fit. But now I a dealing with errors that are asymmetric (i.e. x + high error -low error) and I am not sure how to do this, even in principle. Could the denominator in Chi^2 be some kind of average between the high and low error? I can't find anything online that directly addresses my question. Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated. The model is very simple: I have a single parameter "N" that I tune to fit the model to the data. N is a constant multiplier to a curve I get from simulations.
