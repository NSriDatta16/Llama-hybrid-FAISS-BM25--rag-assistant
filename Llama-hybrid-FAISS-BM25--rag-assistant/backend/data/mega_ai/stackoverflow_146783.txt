What I generally do is to create an Interfaces namespace at a high level in my hierarchy and put all interfaces in there (I do not bother to nest other namespaces in there as I would then end up with many namespaces containing only one interface). Interfaces |--IAnimal |--IVegetable |--IMineral MineralImplementor Organisms |--AnimalImplementor |--VegetableImplementor This is just the way that I have done it in the past and I have not had many problems with it, though admittedly it might be confusing to others sitting down with my projects. I am very curious to see what other people do.
