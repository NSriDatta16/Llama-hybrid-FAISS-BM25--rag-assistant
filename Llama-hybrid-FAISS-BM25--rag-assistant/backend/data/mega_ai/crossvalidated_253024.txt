You are right! In ADF package urca you just have to take into consideration: 1) type="none": delta y(t) = gamma * y(t-1) + e(t) tau1: Ho: gamma = 0 (unit root) 2) type="drift": delta y(t) = a0 + gamma * y(t-1) + e(t) tau2: Ho: gamma=0 (unit root). phi1: combined Ho: gamma = a0 = 0 (unit root and no drift). Rejecting this null implies that one OR two was NOT zero. 3) type="trend": delta y(t) = a0 + gamma * y(t-1) + a2(t) + e(t) tau3: Ho: gamma=0 (unit root) phi3: gamma = a2 = 0 (unit root AND no trend at same time). Rejecting this null implies that one OR two was NOT zero. phi2: Ho: gamma = a0 = a2 = 0.(unit root, no drift term AND no time trend term). Rejecting this null implies that one, two, OR all three of these terms was NOT zero. Once you know the null hypothesis, you have to compare value of "test-statistic" with value of "critical value". To reject the null hypothesis test-statistic has to be more extreme than critical value. I usually take 5pct critical value to study econometric time series.
