How to get databound TreeViews selected TreeViewItem's Header section height without child heights

I am using a WPF treeview with couple of heierachical datatemplates. Treeview has a drag drop capability. Can someone please help me to get the selected TreeViewItem's Header section height (Actual Height). If I get the selected items ActualHeight(TreeViewItem.ActualHeight) then it will give the height with the children. But I want is only the Header elements height. I achived this by using a VisualTree search to find a control (border) inside the data template which covers the entire header. What I want is a more faster way of doing this (Faster than the visual tree search) since I am doing this inside a DragOver event of the treeview.
