I would like to thank everyone for their help. I am using jQuery 1.4.1 to append elements to a UL: var file = ""; FilesToUpload++; $("#UploadedFilesList") .show() .append(" " + file + " x "); I am adding and hidden element but I've tried using a text as well. I've checked with FireBug and the elements are inside the .... I've checked and all the TAGS are closed properly. This is the script I am using to post the form: $('#aspnetForm').submit(function() { $(this).ajaxSubmit(options); return (false); }); All the asp.net web controls are posted correctly; the problem is just with the dynamic fields. I'll try to build a sample project to see if I've got the same problems. I've tried with different browsers and the results are the same. Thanks Alberto
