Should I average data sets and calculate single parameter or average individual data set's parameters?

I am interested in calculating oxidation reaction kinetics parameters of a material at a particular temperature. Essentially I have a curve of data (mass change) vs. time for the particular temperature. I have repeated the experiment three times so I have three individual curves. Technically each of these curves should be the exact same, and the calculations of their curve's parameters (such as slope) should result in the same values. However, experimental variance causes the curves and their respective parameters to have slightly different values. I am wondering if there is any mathematical difference between averaging the curves of data and calculating a single parameter from the single averaged curve (that parameter would have a C.I. determined from regression of the parameter), vs. calculating individual parameters for each individual curve and then finding the average and C.I. of the set of those three parameters/curves? I have been trying to obtain some insight into this, but I cannot seem to figure out the proper phrasing to search google effectively.
