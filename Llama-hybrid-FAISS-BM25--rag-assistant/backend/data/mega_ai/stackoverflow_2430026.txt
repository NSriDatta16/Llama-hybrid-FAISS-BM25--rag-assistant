Found the solution to my issue. I had to declare foreign keys separately from references like so: create_table "agents_games", :force => true, :id => false do |t| t.references :agent t.foreign_key :agents, :column => :agent_id, :null => false t.references :game t.foreign_key :games, :column => :game_id, :null => false end With this, I could take out the Inflector stuff.
