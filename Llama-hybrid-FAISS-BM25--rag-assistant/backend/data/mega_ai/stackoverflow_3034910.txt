What's the best way to migrate a Django DB from SQLite to MySQL?

I need to migrate my db from sqlite to mysql, and the various tools/scripts out there are too many for me to easily spot the safest and most elegant solution. This seemed to me nice http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/14/ but appears to be 3 years since getting an update which is worrying.. Can you recommend a solution that is known to be reliable with Django 1.1.1 ?
