You will find all of the latest OOP features in PHP from version 5. Before PHP v5, there was PHP v4, which was not fully Object Oriented. Also you will find many new & advanced frameworks like the following:- Magento Zend Kohana Symphony CodeIgniter Yii These frameworks have some great features & are really powerful in true sense, and some are also programmer-friendly. Some notable points:- PHP v5 still does not support Multiple Inheritance. PHP v5 still supports procedural way of coding, so it is still backward compatible for older websites (which had been developed in procedural way using PHP v4). Hope it helps.
