Negative relative error

I am trying to calculate the relative error between one model and another as follows: (model1 - model2)/ (1 - model2) where model1 and model2 are the correct predictions of the models, respectively. model1 is better than model2 and I use this formula to calculate how much model1 reduces the error. The only thing I am not sure about is how to interpret the results: since model1 predicts more correct classes than model2 , my relative error is negative. Let's say I have relative error = -54% how can I interpret the result? Does it mean that model1 reduces the error by 54%, compared with model2 ? EDIT: model1 and model2 are the correct predictions of two neural networks on a language task: the neural networks pick the correct word among a limited set of words. model1 has a better performance than model2 : therefore the error from this formula will be negative. Example: given 200 examples, model1 exactly predicts 150, model2 only 55. The result should be: (150 - 55)/(1 - 55) = -1.76 (if we calculate the percentage = -175%)
