class properties

I've just began using classes and would like to make some functions of a class visible outside that class. The problem is that I haven't got (and unable to have) a variable of type Abc. Let me explain with a snippet of code: class Abc { private float foo; public float Foo { get { return foo; } set { foo = value; } } public static void Hello() { foo = 5.0f; Console.WriteLine("Hello everyone!"); } } .... somewhere else .... Abc bar; bar.Foo = 5.0f; // ok, I know this bar.Hello(); // fine, I know this too Abc.Hello(); // I'm trying to do this! EDIT: Ok, now suppose I would like to assign something to foo in Hello (as in my code). I know this might sound like a nonsense, so I'm not sure it's even possible.
