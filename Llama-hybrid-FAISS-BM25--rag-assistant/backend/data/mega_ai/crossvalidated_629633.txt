You can use any dissimilarity measure (or distance metric) that compares pairs of points, as described in [1,2 3]. It makes sense to use the same measure as used to construct the clusters as then they share the same criteria for inter/intracluster similarity. If you use different measures, then you need to be careful to ensure the different dissimilarity measure used for Silhouette score makes sense and won't favor one cluster approach over the other, as you might find the Euclidean distance favoring the Euclidean clustering over the Manhattan distance. The scikit learn silhouette metric score performs the averaging over all samples. If you want per sample they have silhouette_samples [3]. This function returns the mean Silhouette Coefficient over all samples. To obtain the values for each sample, use silhouette_samples. References Peter Rousseeuw.
