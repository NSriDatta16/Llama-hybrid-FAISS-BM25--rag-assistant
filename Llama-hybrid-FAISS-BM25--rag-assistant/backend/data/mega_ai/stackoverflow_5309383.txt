Well, I managed to convert the first string "-1" to a proper long. The line var x = SchedulerMatrixStorage.Resources.Items.Select(col => Convert.ToInt64(col.Id)).ToList(); work perfectly for me now. The Id will always be a long. With that rule assured, is there a best method to accomplish this? I mean, my task is done but wanted to now if LINQ offer an even better method...
