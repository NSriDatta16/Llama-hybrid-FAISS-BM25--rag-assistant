Robert C. Barth gave me the idea that solves the problem: " Text="Do stuff" /> and then the code-behind file contains: protected string GetItemClientClick(MySomething item) { ... String szOnClientClick = "return DeleteItem(this, "+ Toolkit.QuotedStr(item.NodeGUID.ToString()) + ", "+ Toolkit.QuotedStr(GetItemText(item))+");"; return szOnClientClick; } i really would have preferred to keep presentation in the aspx, and business logic in the code-behind - but the real world often doesn't conform to that model.
