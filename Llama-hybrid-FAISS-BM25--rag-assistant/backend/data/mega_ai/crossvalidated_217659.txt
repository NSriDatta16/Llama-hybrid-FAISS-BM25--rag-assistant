Just make sure you resample from your data with replacement, and you give every data point the same chance of being chosen. Then you should be good. Here's a quick R example: num_samples You probably want to wrap that in a function and generate a bunch of them. Here's the math behind the idea. As long as your historical data set is large enough, you should be drawing almost exactly from the "true" distribution of percentage changes. Denote a random draw as $X^*$. If you're assuming all of these percentage changes are iid then $$ P(X^* \le x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n 1(X_i \le x) \to P(X_1 \le x)$$ as $n \to \infty$ by the law of large numbers. I wouldn't worry about the discreteness. Rather, I would worry about the fact that you're not treating the time series data as a time series. All of the work above assumes that one time's change is independent from the others. I am not a domain expert here, so I can't say how much trouble you're going to run into.
