Can I replenish my dataset with unlabeled data?

I have a database of time series data generated by giroscope sensor. A small part of the data is already labeled and used to fit the model. My strong assumption is that most of the samples left in this database are of the same class of movement. Can I use this data to replenish the model without manual labeling? What are the steps required?
