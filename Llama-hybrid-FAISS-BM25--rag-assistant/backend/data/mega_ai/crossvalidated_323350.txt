As pointed by Xi'an, an example where no best unbiased estimator exists is $x\sim\mathcal{U}[θ−1,θ+1]$. The proof is very technical and it might be interesting to extend it to "almost any $p$" which may be very difficult. However the model here has a strong invariance property under translation. It makes sense looking only at equivariant estimators $S$ who are those such as: $$S(X+(t,t,....t))=S(X)+t$$ Intuitively: when you shift the whole data, you shift the estimator just the same which sounds pretty natural. While there may be no best unbiased estimator, there is a unique best equivariant estimator. Equivariant estimators have constant MSE simply because their distribution just shifts with $\theta$. As a consequence they can be compared with a total order and you can simply evaluate their MSE under $\theta=0$. Note that they all have constant bias and can always be recentred to improve them. Thus the best equivariant estimator is necesserely unbiased. To construct the best equivariant estimator, just write the ancillary statistics $\Delta=(X_2-X_1,X_3-X_1,...,X_n-X_1)$. It is easy to see that the equivariant estimators are those such as: $$S(X)=X_1-f(\Delta)$$ Now the best $f$ is the one such as the MSE is the smallest (for example under $\theta=0$), it minimize $E_0((X_1-f(\Delta)^2)$ and the unique solution is $f(\Delta)=E_0(X_1|\Delta)$ : the projection of $X_1$ onto the space of $\Delta$-measurable variables. Note that other ancillary statistics could be used and would yield the same estimator. Thus the best equivariant estimator is: $$\hat\theta = X_1-E_0(X_1|\Delta)$$ For the general theory of equivariant estimators see: Invariant estimation . This estimator is known as the Pitman equivariant estimator . Other equivariant estimators include: recentered (debiased) MLE Bayesian $E(\theta|X)$ with uniform prior on $\theta$ We can be sure they are not better. But in fact our Pitman estimator is the same as the Bayesian one (see the reference). MLE however is generally less good. See Xi'an answer for an example for the Cauchy distribution.
