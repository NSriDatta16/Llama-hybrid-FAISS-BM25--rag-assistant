What data should be used to train an ensemble of pre-trained models?

I split my dataset into train and test data. Then I trained logistic regression, SVM, and random forest models using pipelines with cross-validation and train data. I saved best-performing models with tuned parameters via best_estimator_ And now I want to make a voting ensemble with these models to predict using test data. The questions are: Can pre-trained models be used in ensembles this way? On which data I should train the ensemble?
