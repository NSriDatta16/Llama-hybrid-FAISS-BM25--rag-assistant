You could use some similarity metric on the strings involved and a hand tuned threshold. Alternatively the threshold could also be trained by some a machine learning approach. Which particular similarity metric works best depends on the kind of strings you want to match. You might also need to pre-process the strings before applying a metric to them (i.e. remove noise characters like spaces etc., normalize capitalization, resolve common previously known abbreviations, ...) For a quite comprehensive overview of different string similarity metrics and a Java library see http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~sam/stringmetrics.html
