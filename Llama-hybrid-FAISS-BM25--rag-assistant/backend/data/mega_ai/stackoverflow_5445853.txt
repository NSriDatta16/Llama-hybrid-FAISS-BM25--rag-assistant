Have you looked into http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/ and http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ ? I imagine that you could get the functionality you desire between those two and some custom code. I just looked at your code on jfiddle and put this: $(function() { $( ".window" ).draggable().resizable(); }); which worked great to make it draggable. It resized to a degree, too. To make the resize work better, it would be best if you gave relative sizes to the child elements of window (like 100%) instead of pixel sizes. I hope that helps. If so, please mark as answer.
