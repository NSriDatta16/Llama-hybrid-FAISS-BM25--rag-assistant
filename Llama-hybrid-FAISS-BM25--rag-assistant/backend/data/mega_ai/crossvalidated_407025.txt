A Moving Average Filter is a special case for a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter , where equal weights are used that add up to unity. Note that in the case of time sampled data the result of the averaging is written for the time index of the most recent data point in the averaging window, hence the name filter. If another index is used then this is interpreted as usage of future information, and the procedure is called smoothing. A Moving Average Filter/Smoother clearly operates based on the assumption that the underlying state changes slowly hence can be recovered by locally averaging in order to reduce the observation noise. If our indexing is based on another variable then we are not doing something very different. Time indexing can be thought as random sampling from a uniform distribution. Applying a similar local averaging idea in this case corresponds to kernel regression or kernel smoother . Since there is no time component the filter vs smoother distinction is not very relevant (likewise whether the filter being a causal filter or not). We are also flexible on the weights. If we use a uniform kernel equal weighting of Moving Average will be imitated. Other kernels are clearly applicable similar to FIR. The main distinction comes when determining the neighborhood. In the time samples, equal distance sampling is usually assumed. In the regression case a more sophisticated distance metric needs to be employed. For a single independent variable this is not much of a concern (the distance on a line is very intuitive). But if there are many independent variables then the distance calculation severely affects which data points to be included in the averaging.
