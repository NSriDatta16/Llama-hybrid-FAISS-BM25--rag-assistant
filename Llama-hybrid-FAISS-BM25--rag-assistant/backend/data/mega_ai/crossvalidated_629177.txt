Yes, one can combine multiple estimates by averaging them (but for odds ratios, one would first log transform them before taking the average). However, the difficult part is computing the correct sampling variance of such an average. If the estimates are independent, then the sampling variance of $\bar{y} = (y_1 + y_2 + y_3)/3$ would simply be $\mbox{Var}[\bar{y}] = (v_1 + v_2 + v_3)/9$ , where $y_i$ is the $i$ th estimate and $v_i$ the corresponding sampling variance. But these estimates are not independent, since they are based on the same sample. Roughly, to the degree that the subscale values are correlated, so will be the estimates. If one knows knows what the correlation between the estimates is, then one can compute the $\mbox{Var}[\bar{y}]$ . See Box 24.1 in Borenstein et al. (2009) (the book Introduction to meta-analysis ). The problem is that you typically do not have information about the correlation between the different subscales (this is not typically reported in studies). But one might still be able to make an educated guess about the correlations (from other studies or own data) and use those in computing the sampling variance of the average.
