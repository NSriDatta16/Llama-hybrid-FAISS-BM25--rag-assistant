rate or time on landing page, which is because machine-learned models "learn what people say they like, not what people actually like". In January 2017, the technology was included in the open source search engine Apache Solr. It is also available in the open source OpenSearch and Elasticsearch. These implementations make learning to rank widely accessible for enterprise search. Vulnerabilities Similar to recognition applications in computer vision, recent neural network based ranking algorithms are also found to be susceptible to covert adversarial attacks, both on the candidates and the queries. With small perturbations imperceptible to human beings, ranking order could be arbitrarily altered. In addition, model-agnostic transferable adversarial examples are found to be possible, which enables black-box adversarial attacks on deep ranking systems without requiring access to their underlying implementations. Conversely, the robustness of such ranking systems can be improved via adversarial defenses such as the Madry defense.
