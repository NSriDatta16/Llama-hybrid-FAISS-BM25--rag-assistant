How to set up a subclass of UIScrollView, and connect it in Interface Builder

First of all I began with the code below in my view controller but for reasons that work for me I needed the below code to be in a separate class. So I created a CustomView class which I've posted below. At this point is it possible for me to create an instance of this class in my view controller, create an IBOutlet and connect it to a UIScrollView (or some kind of view) in interface builder and get the same kind of behavior, and how would I do something like that? customView.m #import #import @interface CustomView : UIScrollView { UIScrollView *scrollView; UIImageView *imageView; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIScrollView *scrollView; @property (nonatomic, retain) UIImageView *imageView; customView.m #import @implementation CustomView @synthesize scrollView, imageView; - (id)init { if (self = [super init]) { // Initialization code UIImageView *temp = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"myImage.png"]]; self.imageView = temp; [temp release]; scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(imageView.frame.size.width, imageView.frame.size.height); //Other Scroll View Properties scrollView.delegate = self; [scrollView addSubview:imageView]; } return self; } - (void)dealloc { [scrollView release]; [imageView release]; [super dealloc]; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //Perform an action } @end
