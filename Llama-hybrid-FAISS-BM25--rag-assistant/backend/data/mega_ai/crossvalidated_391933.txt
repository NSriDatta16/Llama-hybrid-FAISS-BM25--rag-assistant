How can I test whether two logistic regression coefficients are identical in mixed models?

Similar to question here . 3 variables (1 continuous (X) and 2 categorical (A & B)) predict 1 dichotomous variable in generalized linear mixed models. Both variables A and B are dichotomous and are coded with 0 (reference category) and 1. Criterion is coded with 0 & 1. After library(lmerTest) glmer(Y ~ X*A*B + (0+X|G) + (1|G), data=dat, family = "binomial", verbose = T, control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")) we have the following results: Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. G (Intercept) 0.1458298 0.38188 G X 0.21727 0.46612 Number of obs: 26260, groups: G, 230 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.47384 0.04094 35.997 Now, the slopes for different conditions are: A1 A2 B1 X X+X:A2 B2 X+X:B2 X+X:A2+X:B2+X:A2:B2 How can I test the following hypothesis X+X:B2 = X+X:A2 + X:B2 + X:A2:B2 which equals to 0 = X:A2 + X:A2:B2 and finally X:A2 = -X:A2:B2 For logistic one-level models we use Wald's test as described in here . library(aod) R Can we use the identical approach for mixed models?
