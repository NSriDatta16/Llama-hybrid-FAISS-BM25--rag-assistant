Oracle Select numbers from an IN clause

I'm looking for the best way to select numbers directly from an in clause. Basically like: SELECT * FROM (2,6,1,8); That doesn't work. I can do it this way: SELECT Lv FROM ( SELECT Level LV FROM DUAL CONNECT BY Level But that seems to be a bit clunky. Is there a more elegant way?
