well i wrote a CMS for personal use and released it to the biggest chorus of chirping crickets ever! no biggie, though. i did learn a lot and i encourage you to move forward. my clients use it and like it and it's holding up fine. but if i were to start over (and i might) here's the advice i would give myself: scrub everything everything everything entered from the user user administration is a product differentiator. bonus points for being able to handle someone copy/pasting from WORD. extensibility. 90% of the comments i get are from developers who want to use the cms to host "some" of the website pages but not others. or they want to embed their custom scripts into the page among the content. my next cms will be as modular as i possibly can handle. many folks are absolutely fanatic about clean urls.
