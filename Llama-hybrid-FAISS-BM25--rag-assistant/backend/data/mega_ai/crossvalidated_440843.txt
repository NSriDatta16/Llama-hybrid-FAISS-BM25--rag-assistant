Jeffreys Prior vs. Empirical Bayesian analysis

I have a small data set, provided at the very end, where I have computed Jeffreys Prior to being a Beta(.5,.5) distribution. I then use this Jeffreys prior to report a 95% posterior credible set, assuming a binomial data set, which gives the proportion results as, I then go ahead and use the actual proportions i.e. p1=12/(12+50) and find the mean and variance of those combined proportions to find my a and b values for my posterior distribution which is a beta(a+Y,b+n-Y),n=sample size,y=number of approvals, a and b are shape parameters. Using this distribution I now calculate the new 95% posterior credible set for each county which yields, What the values mean here are the proportions we would expect (95% Confidence) to get the approval rates if we sampled each county. What I'm struggling to see is what the pros and cons of using each method are. For the first method, we use Jeffreys prior to calculate the credible set and don't do anything with the actual proportion value. Where in the second method we use the actual proportions that are provided by the data set, also known as an Empirical Bayesian analysis. Here's the data set and thanks for the input,
