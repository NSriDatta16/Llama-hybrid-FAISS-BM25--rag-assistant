You can use geometric distribution to reason about such events after several trials. Let $p$ be the probability of obtaining 18 or more ($p = P(X > 18)$). Then the amount of trials $k$ until success (that is, until 18+ is generated) is distributed according to the geometric distribution: $$ k \sim (1-p)^{k-1} p $$ Then you can use quantiles of that distribution to estimate how many trials you need to get this event in, say, 95% of runs. Or, just use the mean of that distribution ($\frac{1}{p}$) as the average number of trials until a rare event.
