Don't use Ordinary Least Squares to model/predict TRUE/FALSE variables. Use a logistic regression to model whether or not the response is 3 (as opposed to 2) instead. In R: > set.seed(1) > training testing model predicted.probability predicted.probability 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0.3878517 0.5758582 0.5125030 0.5696074 0.7251828 0.6150541 0.6124945 0.5703115 0.4203187 0.4636143 > prediction 0.5)+1] > prediction [1] 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 Look at ?glm (note the family argument) and ?predict.glm (note the type argument), and read up on logistic regression .
