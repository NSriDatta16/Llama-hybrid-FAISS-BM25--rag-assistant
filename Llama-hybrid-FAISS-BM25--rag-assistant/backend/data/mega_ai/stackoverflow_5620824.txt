Sentence splitting is a non-trivial problem for which machine learning algorithms have been developed. But splitting on whitespace between [.\?!]+ and a capital letter [A-Z] might be a good heuristic. Remove the newlines first with tr , then apply the RE: tr '\r\n' ' ' | sed 's/\([.?!]\)\s\s*\([A-Z]\)/\1\n\2/g' The output should be one sentence per line. Inspect the output and refine the RE if you find errors. (E.g., mr. Ed would be handled incorrectly. Maybe compile a list of such abbreviations.) Whether C# or sed is faster can only be determined experimentally.
