Ratio of a matrix's sample standard deviation to the sd of the matrix of its row averages approximately = the square root of the sample size?

Given a large matrix, why is the ratio of a matrix's sample standard deviation and the standard deviation of the matrix of its row averages approximately equal to the square root of the sample size? test What is the mathematical basis of this?
