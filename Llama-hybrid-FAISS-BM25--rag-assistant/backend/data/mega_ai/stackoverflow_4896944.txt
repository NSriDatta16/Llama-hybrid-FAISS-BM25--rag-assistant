Converting Range or DocumentFragment to string

Is there a way to get the html string of a JavaScript Range Object in W3C compliant browsers? For example, let us say the user selects the following: Hello World It is possible to get "Hello World" as a string using the Range.toString() method. (In Firefox, it is also possible using the document 's getSelection method.) But I can't seem to find a way to get the inner HTML. After some searching, I've found that the range can be converted to a DocumentFragment Object. But DocumentFragments have no innerHTML property (at least in Firefox; have not tried Webkit or Opera). Which seems odd to me: It would seem obvious that there should be some way to acces the selected items. I realize that I can create a documentFragment , append the document fragment to another element, and then get the innerHTML of that element. But that method will auto close any open tags within the area I select. Besides that there surely is an obvious "better way" than attaching it to the dom just to get it as a string. So, how to get the string of the html of a Range or DocFrag?
