This depends a lot on your method . For above data set, decision trees and random forest may work well. They do not need dimensionality reduction; it will likely even harm your result. K-Means on the other hand will not work on such data very well, because data normalization is really difficult to do right. But you appear to be interested in classification, not clustering anyway.
