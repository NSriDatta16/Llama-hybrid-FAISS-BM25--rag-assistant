Technical Term for choosing distribution of starting point of a time series in a way such that the time series is stationary

In Time Series Analysis there is this idea of choosing the distribution of the starting point of a time series in a way such that the time series is stationary. Let for example $\{X_t\}_{t=0}^T%$ be a time series following an AR(1) process ( $X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t, \ \varepsilon_t \sim wn(0, \sigma^2)$ ). The Wold(-like) decomposition looks like this: \begin{align} X_t = X_0 + \sum_{i = 0}^{t-1} \phi^{i} \varepsilon_{t-i} \end{align} Relevant for the stationarity is e.g. the variance which is given as \begin{align} Var(X_t) = Var(X_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_{i = 0}^{t-1} \phi^{2i} = Var(X_0) + \sigma^2 \frac{1 - (\phi^2)^{t}}{1 - \phi^2}. \end{align} Now in order for $X_t$ to be stationary, we have to choose $X_0$ in such a way that \begin{align} Var(X_0) = \sigma^2 \sum_{j = t}^{\infty} \phi^{2j} \end{align} Because then we have $Var(X_t) = \frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}$ which is independent from $t$ . My question is, what is the technical term for choosing $X_0$ in such a way. I only know the german term which is "eingeschwungene LÃ¶sung".
