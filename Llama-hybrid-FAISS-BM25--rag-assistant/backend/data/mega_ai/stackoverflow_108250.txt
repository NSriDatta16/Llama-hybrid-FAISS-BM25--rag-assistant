This could be the obvious answer but the FLVPlayBack component is really nice if you have a single video you need to throw on a website in hurry. Drag it on the stage - select a control panel - double click controls to edit with the Flash drawing tools - post to the website.You might have to use a FlashVar to get the url into the url but that's fairly trivial... http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/fl/video/FLVPlayback.html
