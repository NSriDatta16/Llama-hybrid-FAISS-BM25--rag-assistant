For a developer I really don't think there is anything you should be worried about. The Sybase origins of SQL Server will clearly show up in all common tasks. One thing I would recommend is to go over the features that appeared in SQL Server since 2005 and 2008 releases, specially 2005. You want to give them a cursory look just to understand what they do and to be prepared to use them in your arsenal: Crypto functions, CLR procedures, XML data type, varchar/varbinary(MAX) types, Service Broker, snapshot isolation, filestream storage, MERGE statement, common table expressions and recursive queries. A book that is targeted specifically at developers for SQL 2005 should also be of elp, like Expert SQL Server 2005 Development perhaps. Make sure is a new content book, not a reprint of a SQL 2000 book updated for 2005. For more advanced coverage, the Inside SQL 2005 series is very good.
