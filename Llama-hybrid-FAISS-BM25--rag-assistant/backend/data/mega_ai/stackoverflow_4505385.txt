SQL Server: most commonly used data types?

I'm a bit confused as there are many variable types in sql server (ntext, varchar, nvarchar, etc) so maybe if you give me what data types you use for the following fields I'll understand this a little better. If I'm missing a common field type please let me know. ID Telephone Number Email Description (a paragraph of text) Name SSN Price Ship Date Sex (m/f) Discontinued (yes/no) Quantity Zip Code
