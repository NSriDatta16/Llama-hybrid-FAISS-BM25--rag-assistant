Covariate balance diagnostics using TMLE function in R

I am currently using the tmle function in R to perform targeted maximum likelihood estimation as a doubly-robust alternative to propensity score methods in identifying an average treatment effect. This is an ideal method, as I have a large number of covariates, and I'm not worried in estimating the effect of specific covariates on the outcome. However, with propensity score methods, I generally report on covariate balance. I've been trying to find some similar diagnostic to show that the estimation of the probability of treatment resulted in a sufficiently low level of bias. Anyways, just wondering if anyone knew of a way to pull such diagnostic info?
