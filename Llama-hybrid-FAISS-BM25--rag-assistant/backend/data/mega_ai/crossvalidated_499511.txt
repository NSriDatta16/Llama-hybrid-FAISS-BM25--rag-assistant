Examplary applications of Pearl's theory of causality

Causal theories described in Pearl (2009) seemingly find more and more attention in methodological papers (Elwert and Winship, 2014; Pearl, Glymour and Jewell, 2016; Lewbel, 2019; Imbens, 2019). But are there any good, practical applications of Pearl's causal theories in empirical research? Have you encountered such papers? Elwert, Felix, and Christopher Winship.
