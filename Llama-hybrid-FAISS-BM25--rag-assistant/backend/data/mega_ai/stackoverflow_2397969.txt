You can load your data into a shadow table as slowly as you like, then instantly swap the shadow and actual with RENAME TABLE: truncate table shadow; # make sure it is clean to start with insert into shadow .....; # lots of inserts etc against shadow table rename table active to temp, shadow to active, temp to shadow; truncate table shadow; # throw away the old active data The rename statement is atomic. An intermediate name "temp" is used to help swap the names of temp and active. This should work with all storage engines. Rename table - MySQL Manual
