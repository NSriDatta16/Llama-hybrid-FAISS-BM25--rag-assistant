You are right. If someone is using regularization correctly and doing hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting, then it should not be a problem theoretically (ie multi-collinearity will not reduce model performance). However, it may matter in a number of practical circumstances. Here are two examples: You want to limit the amount of data you need to store in a database for a model that you are frequently running, and it can be expensive storage-wise, and computation-wise to keep variables that don't contribute to model performance. Therefore, I would argue that although computing resources are not 'scarce' they are still monetarily expensive, and using extra resources if there is a way to limit them is also a time sink. For interpretation's sake, it is easier to understand the model if you limit the number of variables. Especially if you need to show stakeholders (if you work as a data scientist) and need to explain model performance.
