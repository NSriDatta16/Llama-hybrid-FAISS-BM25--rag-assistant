ETS function in forecast package is not choosing minimized AICc

I have the following Time Series: Time Series: Start = 1 End = 23 Frequency = 1 [1] 2.827639 3.025919 2.758508 2.615995 2.544861 2.581062 2.384300 2.295275 [9] 2.295331 2.205670 2.079790 2.097358 2.256680 2.212057 2.309781 2.494873 [17] 2.784051 2.701699 2.742262 2.886574 2.943660 3.000333 3.023846 I am using ETS in two different ways to obtain a forecast model: ModelSelection My understanding from reading through the literature is that, when not specifying any parameters, ets() will minimize AICc. The prediction intervals are better for the second model as it has a smaller sigma value. Is ets() choosing an optimized model by AICc alone? Or is there more going into the selection process I am missing? Here are the error statistics as well: accuracy(ModelSelection) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 0.008646586 0.1293883 0.09940506 0.3967123 3.831806 0.9055805 -0.06642329 accuracy(OptSelection) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 0.01147291 0.1264468 0.09997687 0.5508859 3.876411 0.9107897 0.05564438
