If $p$ is the probability of an event, $o$ the odds (the ratio of probabilities of the event happening and it not happening), and $\alpha$ the log-odds, then $\alpha = \log_e\left(o\right) = \log_e\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$ $o = e^\alpha = \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$ $p = \frac{o}{1+o} = \frac{e^\alpha}{1+e^\alpha}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\alpha}}$ with the function $\log_e\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$ being called the logit function and $\frac{1}{1+e^{-\alpha}}$ being called the logistic function . You can generalise the logistic function by adjusting the scale and location to have a logistic function which can be the results of logistic regression. So what you suggest is essentially correct: you use logarithms to move between the odds and the log-odds.
