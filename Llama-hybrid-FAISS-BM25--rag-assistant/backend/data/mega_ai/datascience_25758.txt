Generally, if you can find a network that has been trained on data remotely similar to yours, then it's a good idea to take advantage of this pre-trained network and use fine-tuning / transfer learning to train the model on your data. Transfer learning occurs when we use knowledge that was gained from solving one problem and apply it to a new, but related problem. Fine-tuning is a way of applying or utilizing transfer learning. Specifically, fine-tuning is a process that takes a model that has already been trained for a given task and then tuning the model to make it perform a second task. Assuming the original task is at least loosely similar to the new task, using an artificial neural network that has already been created and trained allows us to take advantage of what the model has already learned without having to develop it from scratch. I explain the concept of fine-tuning in this video . At 4:10, it also links to videos showing how this is process is done in code using Keras.
