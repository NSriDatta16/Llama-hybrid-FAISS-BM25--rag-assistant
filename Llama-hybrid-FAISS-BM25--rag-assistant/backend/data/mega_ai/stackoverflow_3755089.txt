Well, technically, it can (you can select which one of the mipmap level you want to update / fetch from), but this leaves you with the initial problem : when you're at max zoom, you have to have the entire image in memory. I can think of two options. This first is a dynamic atlas texture, also known as megatexturing or virtual texturing. You'll find plenty of links on the subjects, but this is a little bit overkill for what you want. The second is a standard LOD (level of detail). At zoom 0.1x, you draw only 1 quad, with a low-def texture. When you zoom in, you recursively split the quad depending on the distance to the camera (near = recurse more). For each medium or little quad, you create a new texture at the right resolution, and bind it. So you'll have a series of 512x512 images, at different resolutions, organized in a hierarchy.
