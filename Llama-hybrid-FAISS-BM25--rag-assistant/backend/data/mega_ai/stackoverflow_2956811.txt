One approach could be to create two new DateTimes from your values you want to compare, but ignore anything from the seconds on down and then compare those: DateTime compare1 = new DateTime(year1, month1, day1, hour1, minute1, 0); DateTime compare2 = new DateTime(year2, month2, day2, hour2, minute2, 0); int result = DateTime.Compare(compare1, compare2); I'd be the first to admit it's not elegant, but it solves the problem.
