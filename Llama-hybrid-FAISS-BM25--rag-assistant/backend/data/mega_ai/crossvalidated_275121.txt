Help! Newton-Raphson explodes!

I am trying to find the posterior mode of a log likelihood in order to implement maximum a posteriori. The parameter I am trying to estimate is actually a vector. I can find the first and second derivative analytically. Now when I come to implement the Newton-Raphson scheme, the Hessian is not positive definite, and the sampler blows up! I have tried to "fix" my Hessian, but it is still exploding. Are there any suggestions on what to do in this circumstance? Are there any alternatives to Newton-Raphson? Of course, this is a large vector (of length Tx1, where T>1500) and it needs to be done very quickly as it is part of a large Bayesian scheme. As a side note, the variable is on the positive real domain. Many thanks in advance.
