For a single, simple, known function (as in your case: a line) it is not hard to simply code a basic least square routine from scratch (but does require some attention to detail). It is a very common assignment in introductory numeric analysis classes. So, look up least squares on wikipedia or mathworld or in a text book and go to town.
