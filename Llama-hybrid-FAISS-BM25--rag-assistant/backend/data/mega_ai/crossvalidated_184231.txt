I suspect that this is just rounding error: The computer program just used more digits to compute the marginal effect than you did. Alternatively, if your model is non-linear (e.g. a logit or Poisson) then it could be that the marginal effect you got was actualy an average marginal effect instead of a marginal effect at the average. For an average marginal effect, the marginal effect is computed for each individual and than those marginal effects are averaged. For linear models there is no difference between the two, but for non-linear models these marginal effects are (somewhat) different.
