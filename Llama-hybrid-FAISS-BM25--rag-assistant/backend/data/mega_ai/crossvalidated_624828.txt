Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous states and continuous actions

Are there model-based reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous states and continuous actions? I was trying to find such algorithms but couldn't find any. I know dynamic programming is for discrete spaces only. Thank you!
