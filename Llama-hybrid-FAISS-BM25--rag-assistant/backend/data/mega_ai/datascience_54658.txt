So far I know, Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) is best for time series problem. LSTM(type of RNN), always consider long term dependencies and evaluate new value after understanding the whole series pattern. Whereas SVR, consider each row as a sample for training data and predict the outcome and will not consider the previous patterns. For example: 10->20, 20->40, 30->60, and so on ... LSTM will try understand the whole series and then predict the next value, whereas for SVM each row is a individual training sample divided into Features/Target and will predict value based upon the different values it learnt so far. Thats the reason RNN is better for timeseries.
