How to check if file exists in lotus formula?

Scenario: I have an outline where I have links for my menu. Each link points to file stored on FTP server in DMZ. By clicking each link I run the agent which downloads the file locally and deliver url to it for end user. I would like to hide outline element when file does not exists. Obviously I do not have this information before I try to access file and I cannot run domino agent to check if I can show this element or not and use it in HideWhen formula window. Also it is not possible to run agent and check all files if exists, store this information in ln db, because simple it's too many files. Any other ideas?
