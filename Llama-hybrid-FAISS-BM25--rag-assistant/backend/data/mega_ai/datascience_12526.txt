If only a small fraction of features is missing you can use imputation . For more serious cases, you can use a probabilistic model such as a Gaussian process , which will let you marginalize the missing features. Or alternatively, train a neural network with dropout regularization . When you have missing data, just "drop out" the missing connections for real. Since your network is already trained for missing features, it should work fine without them.
