As others have pointed out, adjusting for a post-treatment covariate can introduce bias in the estimated treatment effect. However, I would like to add that there are corner-case scenarios where adjusting for post-treatment covariate is acceptable. The basic idea is that if the covariate is unaffected of the treatment, the adjusting for it won't introduce bias. By adjusting for it, the precision of the estimated average treatment effect can then be improved. Furthermore, if you have confounding in the form of an unobserved pre-treatment covariate, then adjusting for a post-treatment covariate related to it can reduce the bias of your estimate under certain conditions. The details can be found in Rosenbaum (1984). That said, I would be very reluctant to adjust for anything that is post-treatment, as the cases where such adjustment is beneficial are likely rare. As a general principle, avoid doing it. And if you plan on doing it, I strongly suggest reading the provided reference first. References: Rosenbaum, P. R. (1984).
