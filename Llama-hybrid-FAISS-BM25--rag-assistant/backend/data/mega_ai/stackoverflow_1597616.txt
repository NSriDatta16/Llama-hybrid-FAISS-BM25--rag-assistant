The worst case for this algorithm is clearly when you're choosing the full set of N items. This is equivalent to asking: On average, how many times must I roll an N-sided die before each side has come up at least once? Answer: N * H N , where H N is the Nth harmonic number , a value famously approximated by log(N) . This means the algorithm in question is N log N . As a fun example, if you roll an ordinary 6-sided die until you see one of each number, it will take on average 6 H 6 = 14.7 rolls.
