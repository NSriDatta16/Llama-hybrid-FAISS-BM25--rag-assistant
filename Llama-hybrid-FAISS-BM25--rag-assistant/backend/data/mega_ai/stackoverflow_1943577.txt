Rails Caches_Page being misplaced due to namespacing

I have a controller within a namespace and would like to cache it's Index. I am successfully caching pages that are not under a namespace, and successfully caching fragments as well. When I visit http//.../house/kitchen it successfully creates /public/house/kitchen.html. However it never finds it, so it is always writing over the cached file. I haven't been able to find an option with cache_page or caches_page to help me direct the cached file in the correct location. Another frustrating thing is that http//.../house/kitchen/table successfully reads and creates /public/houose/kitchen/table/new.html. I would greatly appreciate any direction! Edit: adding details Ruby : 1.8.7 Rails: 2.3.5 Server: Mongrel Edit: I've placed kitchen.html in every possible location in my public folder, this controller seems just to refuse reading it.
