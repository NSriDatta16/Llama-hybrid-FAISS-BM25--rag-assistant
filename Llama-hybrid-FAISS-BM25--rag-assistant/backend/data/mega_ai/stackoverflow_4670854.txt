Mobile safari: window.pageYOffset / scrollY seemingly ignores navigation bar height even though it scrolls

So I have setup a scroll listener: window.onscroll = function (){ alert(window.pageYOffset); // have also tested with window.scrollY } And, as expected, I get my alerts once scroll is complete. I have the debug console, turned off for this as well, so as not to add any extra space in the mobile browser, hence doing the alert() and not console.log(). Now, I am also doing this onload: setTimeout(function() { window.scrollTo(0, 0); }, 33); And, as expected, the navigation bar hides on load. I tried just doing the window.scrollTo() without the timeout, and it was failing until I added the timeout. Anyway, that's not the issue. My navigation bar hides, which is what I wanted. So now that I have my viewport moved to 0,0 and and alert firing on scroll, I would expect that the act of dragging my finger down (scrolling up) to reveal the Navigation Bar would tell me that window.pageOffsetY My question is: Is there a way to tell if you are scrolling into the Navigation Bar space? The ultimate goal for this is to have something always positioned at the bottom. I have my element doing that on scroll properly except when I start entering into the Navigation Bar scroll space as mobile safari reports the scrollY / pageYOffset as 0 even though there is some more scroll action happening.
