I would suggest to look at the following three directions: longitudinal clustering : this is unsupervised, but you use k-means approach relying on the Calinsky criterion for assessing quality of the partitioning (package kml , and references included in the online help); so basically, it won't help identifying specific shape for individual time course, but just separate homogeneous evolution profile some kind of latent growth curve accounting for heteroscedasticity: my best guess would be to look at the extensive references around MPlus software, especially the FAQ and mailing. I've also heard of random effect multiplicative heteroscedastic model (try googling around those keywords). I find these papers ( 1 , 2 ) interesting, but I didn't look at them in details. I will update with references on neuropsychological assessment once back to my office. functional PCA ( fpca package) but it may be worth looking at functional data analysis Other references (just browsed on the fly): Willett & Bull (2004), Latent Growth Curve Analysis -- the authors use LGC on non-linear reading trajectories Welch (2007), Model Fit and Interpretation of Non-Linear Latent Growth Curve Models -- a PhD on modeling non-linear change in the context of latent growth modeling Berkey CS, Laird NM (1986).
