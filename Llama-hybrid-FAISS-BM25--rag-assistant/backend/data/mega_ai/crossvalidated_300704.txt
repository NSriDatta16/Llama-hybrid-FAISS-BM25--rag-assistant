I tried to find the correlations between probabilities returned by logistic regression model. I mean Pearson correlations for two random variables of probabilities. I build 5 000 sets of random feature vectors, assuming that each observation in any set is pairwise connected to the observation in any other set (same entities are under testing). I assume that the model quality is good, and there is a linear separability of classes corrupted my controlled level of Guassian noise. rm(list = ls()); gc() library(data.table) #dummy_data = 0, 1, 0)] dummy_glm = 0, 1, 0)] } fit_probabilities I did not find significant correlations. So I am asking again why you say the p values stemming from one model with different, independent features as an input would be correlated. Are there specific assumptions that should be met to satisfy this?
