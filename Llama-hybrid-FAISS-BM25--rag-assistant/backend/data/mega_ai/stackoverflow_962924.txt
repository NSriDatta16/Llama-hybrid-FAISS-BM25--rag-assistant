When adding to a dictionary , the first item added would be the key (a string in this case ) - this must be unique within that dictionary otherwise this error will be thrown. I would also use this declaration of the dictionary otherwise you could get an array of dictionaries Dim adinsured as new Generic.Dictionary(Of String, Person) i.e. if you added did this: Dim adinsured2 as new Generic.Dictionary(Of String, String) Adinsured2.Add("Fred", "Fred") Adinsured2.Add("Fred", "Fred") This would throw this error, however this would be fine Dim adinsured2 as new Generic.Dictionary(Of String, String) Adinsured2.Add("Bert", "Fred") Adinsured2.Add("Fred", "Fred")
