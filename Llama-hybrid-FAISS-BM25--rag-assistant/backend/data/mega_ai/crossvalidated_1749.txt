How can you approximate the number of trials to success given a particular Pr(Success)?

I'm uncertain whether I should be able to intuit the answer to my question from a question that has already been asked but I can't, so I am asking the question anyway. Thus, I am looking for a clear easy to understand answer. A recent newspaper article reported that on average couples were able to conceive a child after 104 reproductive acts. Assuming indpendant binomial trials, that means for each act there was a 1/104 probability of success. I can do a quick simulation to show myself what the quantiles for this distribution look like, e.g. in R: NSIM But it seems like there should be some simple equation or approximation that could be applied, perhaps a probit or poisson? Any advice on how to get the quantiles without running a simulation? Bonus points for providing a way to do the relevant calculations in R.
