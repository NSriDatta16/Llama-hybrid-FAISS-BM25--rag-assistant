jQuery UI - How to know if dragged element is on top of element #x?

I have multiple draggable elements and I don't want them to be dropped on top of each other. I'd want the dragged element to appear light green when dragged, but once it's over element with certain class, it would turn red. If it would be dropped it would revert to its original position. Everything else is simple, but I would need an event for "entering" another element. I haven't found any integrated function or a plugin to solve my problem. I can't think of any other way of doing this myself than keeping record of all elements locations and sizes, then comparing to them on drag event. However it would be so heavy the dragging would be painful. So, any suggestions? A plugin I haven't found perhaps? :)
