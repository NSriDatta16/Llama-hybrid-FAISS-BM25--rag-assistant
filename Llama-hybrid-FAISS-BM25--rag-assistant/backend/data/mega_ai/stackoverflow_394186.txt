I'm not sure I have the whole answer, but a couple of observations. You can eliminate some lines of code by using CurrentDB.Execute strSQL. This elminates the need for the SetWarnings calls. It executes directly against the database without interacting with the usual interface mechanisms. For debugging purposes, it might be better to use Debug.Print to put your SQL string out to the Debug window. It avoids involving the user interface still puts the SQL where you can copy it to the clipboard if you want to grab it and work with it. I think there's a slim chance that the DoCmd method call to execute your SQL, even with the calls to SetWarnnigs, might be tipping something in the interface to pull focus off of the form, like shahkalpesh suggested. I've done things like this and not seen the problem you are having, so my only advice on the problem itself is to do as I do and switch to CurrentDB.Execute and eliminate calls to DoCmd inside the loop. Just curious -- why did you use an array for the previous values rather than using the OldValue property on the controls?
