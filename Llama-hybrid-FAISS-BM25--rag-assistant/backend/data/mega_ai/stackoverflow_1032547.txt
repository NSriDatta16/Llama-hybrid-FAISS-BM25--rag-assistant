The biggest flaw in this concept is not the input, but the game output. Your bot can't just randomly press keys, it needs to know what is "happening". Very few games allow you to query this data which would leave your bot to solve a very tricky problem - Converting 60 frames per second of 2D visual data into a virtual space. There are actuially games out there that not only allow bot players, but encourage them. Open RTS is one of those but there are also simpler ones like GUN-TACTYX and crobots which are good starting points.
