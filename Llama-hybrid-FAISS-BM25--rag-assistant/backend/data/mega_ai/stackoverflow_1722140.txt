How can I parse XML using Java?

TL1 10.05.2.3 2001 agent get ........... ........... ........... .......... ..... ....... TL1 10.5.2.98 2001 agent get ........... ........... ........... .......... ..... ....... ....... ....... I want to know how to parse this XML using Java. Such that I can use that data as it is in the same given way for my program. I know of how to parse it but the problem is for each command there might be different number of data blocks. So after parsing I need to use respective datablocks for respective commands. I mean for first command while retriving I should get only one data block value and for 2nd command 3 data blocks and so on. Please let me know any sample code for solving this issue.
