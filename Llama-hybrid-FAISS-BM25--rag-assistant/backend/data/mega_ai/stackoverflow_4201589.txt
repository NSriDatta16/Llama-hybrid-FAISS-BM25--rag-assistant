Mac App Store - Copy Protection, or not, or what?

the license agreement for the Mac Developer Program explicitly states that I am not to implement my own copy protection process in my Mac app. Yet, in the developer documentation, Apple also says this: You can add receipt validation code to your application to prevent unauthorized copies of your application from running. I am confused here. Does the Mac App Store provide any form of built-in copy protection for Mac apps? The above statement from Apple would seem to indicate that it does not. The statement suggests that if I do not implement these receipt checks, then unauthorised copies of my Mac App CAN run on other Macs. I'm not allowed to implement (or rather, keep an existing) copy protection, but I am expected to verify receipts manually, using various fragments of code and pseudo-code provided by Apple, simply to provide the most basic level of protection. Is this interpretation correct? Is this a miscommunication from Apple, or is this really how things are done? Ref: http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/documents/validating.html Thanks. (Please note that I'm not after a debate on the philosophy of copy-protection or the merits of Apple's approach. Rather, I'm just interested in the technical requirements for getting a Mac app on to the App Store.)
