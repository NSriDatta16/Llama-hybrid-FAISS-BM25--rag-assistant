Did anyone use Merchant services? http://merchantservices.com/ - they include authorize.net gateway -- is that enough to use Merchant services with Magento. I believe that Merchant services also include a merchant account. What is the costing for authorize.net? Do they also provide a merchant account? Paypal WebSite Payments pro? is it a good one ......
