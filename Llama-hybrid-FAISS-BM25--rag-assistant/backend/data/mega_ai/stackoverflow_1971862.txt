Relational data attributes have no order nor ordinal. Columns in a table have no order, nor ordinal (physical implementation asside). Result set column positions correspond to specific queries, based on the projected list of the query, and the application always knows the ordinal because it knows the projection list it asked for. If you want to display columns in a certain order in a grid, display them in the order you desire. If you want to retrieve a column ordinal number in the physical storage for ad-hoc queries not known at development time, then you're going to interogate the physical storage directly using some storage specific mechanism. For example, if the storage is SQL Server you would look in sys.columns .
