There are several approaches to creating a parser that would parse plain text message into SQL. For example, you can create a grammar-based parser and use an NLP algorithm to build the structured query. If you already have plenty of parsed messages from one domain (like e-commerce) - you can try a Machine Learning approach and use it for your further parsing. However, I think the best approach is to combine a grammar-based parser for text-to-SQL translation, and ML to complement the rule-based grammar by fixing the syntax, eradicating typos, etc. Learn more about the different approaches here .
