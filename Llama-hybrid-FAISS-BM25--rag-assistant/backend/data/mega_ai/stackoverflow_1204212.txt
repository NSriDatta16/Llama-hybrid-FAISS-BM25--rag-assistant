I think your best bet will be to keep going at a steady pace on the book - going into more detail if you get lost, and if necessary grab a snapshot from online to keep pace if you break things. From there I would start branching out into many of the other excellent resources available. Pragmatic Programmers have a book called Advanced Rails Recipes that I hear is also fairly good. Since Rails is still moving rather quickly your best bet will likely be, once you have a handle on things, to start following some of the latest news. Ruby Alltop might be a good place to start looking for more resources. I would suggest going through as many Railscasts as you can - they are pretty much the definitive place to pickup Rails concepts quickly.
