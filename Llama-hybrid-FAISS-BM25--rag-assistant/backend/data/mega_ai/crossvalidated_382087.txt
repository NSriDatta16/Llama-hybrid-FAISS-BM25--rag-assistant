You could take the difference between each sample in condition A and B, i.e. x_i = b_i - a_i and then perform a t-test or Wilcoxon test to check whether mean difference is significantly different from 0. If you're interested in whether B leads to more visits than A on average, you can do a one-sided test with H0: u However, you should be careful here since there may be other things to consider in your case, e.g. are the visits counted in the same time period for each sample? Does the fact that a web-page is available on A before B reduce visits in B? All of this could bias the outcome of your analyis.
