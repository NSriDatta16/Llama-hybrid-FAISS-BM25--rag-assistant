SharedPreference is only good for objects that SharedPreferences supports. For any long term storage of objects you will have to go down the serialized route of some sort. I am guessing you have read the Data Storage page in the docs . From there I would recommend you reading about Internal Storage . If you don't want to deal with Java's serializble interface then I suggest you check out XStream . XStream coupled with Internal Storage may offer the solution you need.
