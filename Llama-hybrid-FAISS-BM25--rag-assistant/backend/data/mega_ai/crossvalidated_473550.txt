In an "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, in the section entitled "Validation and Cross-Validation," they promote calculating the standard error of the test MSE as a valid way to compare models. However, it should not be done through bootstrapping. Rather, one should randomly split the testing and training many times, recalculating the test MSE with each iteration.
