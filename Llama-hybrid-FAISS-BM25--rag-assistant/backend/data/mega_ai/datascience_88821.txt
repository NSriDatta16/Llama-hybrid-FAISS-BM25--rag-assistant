The right Machine Learning solution for this problem

Throughout my understanding about using Machine Learning, there was always a column whose name Target or Label , that was causing us to call methods Supervised learning. Now I am dealing with not a supervised or an unsupervised procedure. I do not know what exactly is. I have some data-frames that each of which has 3 columns. The columns have a relation with each other but it does not matter. I am looking for a way to show the effect of samples on each other. In the sense that, in my topic, theoretically, it has been proved that in a specific situation, some samples are more important than the others. Now I need to show it using Machine Learning. I have generated the required data for having that situation but I do not know how to find the effect of samples on each other.? I could have shown some differences on samples but couldn't find any meaningful scenario to be used in machine learning. To clarify, I have defined a value which a computation between each column value and I would like to know in the computation of this value in a specific index, which sample are playing a more important role. Now The question is that, **HOW TO FIND THE EFFECT OF SAMPLES ON EACH OTHER USING SIMPLE OR ADVANCED TECHNIQUES?** To understand better let's see some sort of data here. an example of data frame is below: S C E 0 0.2 1e-2 1 -0.15 2e-2 2 0.24 2e-3 3 -0.1 3e-1 4 0.3 2e-1 the third column is a combination of the first 2 columns(There is the equation of combination) Now I need to know for example for the E[2] , what is the effect of c[0],c[1],c[2],c[4] .
