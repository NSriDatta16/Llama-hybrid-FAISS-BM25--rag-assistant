Bayesian planned orthogonal contrasts, can one just average two means?

I have a dataset with three levels of one independent variable, repeated measures. To simplify, I have two planned contrasts to perform: High Treatment & Low Treatment combine, vs No Treatment Hightreatment vs Low Treatment Or, as contrast coefficients: HighTreatment(1) + LowTreatment(1) + NoTreatment(-2) HighTreatment(1) + LowTreatment(-1) + No Treatment(0) I need a simple way of gaining a Bayes Factor for these planned contrasts. I have been told, that in order to combine the high and low treatment conditions, I am able to simply create a new variable which is the combine mean of High and Low, and then compare this to the no treatment condition (using a Baysian repeated measures t-test). Thus, my question is twofold: Is the aforementioned method valid? If not, What is an appropriate method to get a Bayes Factor for a specific planned contrasts which weights two variables equally.
