Time Series Chow test & Bai Perron test

I have a question about breakpoints test, that is to select which variables to put in the model ? Example: Y = C(constant) + Ut , Ut ~ N(0,1) ....first model Y = C(constant) + Trend + Ut , Ut ~ N(0,1) ....second model Y = C(constant) + AR(1) + Trend + Ut , Ut ~ N(0,1) ....third model Y = C(constant) + AR(1) + AR(2) + Trend + Ut , Ut ~ N(0,1) ....fourth model In the picture(1) I simulate two time series and combine them , each of them are AR(1) Model , one has trend and another no trend. Assumption I don't know components of this series , to detect break in this time series , which model should I use (1、2、3、4 model，or neither of them) ? I know if I want to see the constant change i put C in model to detect change , want to see trend change then put C + trend in model , but I want to know a better way to select model detect break , not use eyes.
