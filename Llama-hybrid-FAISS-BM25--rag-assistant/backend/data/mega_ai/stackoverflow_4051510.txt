the flash object is a holder for storing view fragments/messages and persist them for one redirection using the session. I see absolutely no problem in storing a link, or better an URL. example : redirect_to posts_path, :alert => "You cannot do that", :flash => { :url => post_path(@post) } and in layout view, the usual suspects : - if flash[:alert] ... - if flash[:url] = link_to "blah blah", flash[:url]
