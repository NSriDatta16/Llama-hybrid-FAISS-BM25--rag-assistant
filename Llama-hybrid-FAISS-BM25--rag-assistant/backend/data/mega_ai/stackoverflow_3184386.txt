Using regular expressions for parsing or modifying HTML documents is frowned upon. For a one shot operation, you could use ]*2.jpg[^>]*>( )? to identify image tags containing "2.jpg". If you want to do this more than once, you'd do yourself a favor using a HTML Parser like the HTML Agility Pack. There are much less fragile when confronted with real world HTML code.
