Improving model fit and model comparison using AIC with logistic regression

So I am running some hypothesis testing on a data set with a binary response (presence/absence data). My response variable is the use or lack of use of a given resource (0 or 1 respectively), over ~6 different resources. I am looking across populations using the glmer function in R with my individual as a random effect. I have my models set up as follows: glmer(use~var1+var2+var3+var4+var5+(1|ID), family=binomial) glmer(use~var1+var2+var3+var4+(1|ID), family=binomial) glmer(use~var1+var2+var4+var5+(1|ID), family=binomial) glmer(use~var1+var3+var4+var5+(1|ID), family=binomial) ## .. and so on. #NULL: glmer(use~{1|ID)) My end goal is to compare the various models to see what is the best fit using AIC, a common practice within my field. I am being held up on two main questions: in cases where my null model is the best fit what does this actually tell me outside of the fact that I am probably not catching the variables driving use within that population? Is there something I can do other than looking at different explanatory variables, and could it be an issue with the fact that I have too little use data for that group? When you get warnings about model fit (see example below), what can be done outside of scaling variables to try and improve binomial model fit? Because it is a 0 or 1 I assume that I cannot transform the response data, and I have already scaled my environmental variables that had a much larger range, and still received the same error. I guess I am mainly looking to understand more about how to improve model fit of binomial data outside of scaling the explanatory variables being included in the model. Example of warning: Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model is nearly unidentifiable: large eigenvalue ratio Rescale variables? I am not looking for a fix to the warning message, which is why I haven't included any actual data or code, just to try and have a better understanding of ways you may improve model fit in logistic regressions.
