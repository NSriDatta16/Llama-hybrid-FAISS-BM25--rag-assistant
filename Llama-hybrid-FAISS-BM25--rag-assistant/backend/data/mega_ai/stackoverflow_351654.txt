I see a pattern of people just using the Database Engine Tuning Advisor and thinking that it is somehow smart enough to suggest the most optimal indexes and stats. That is an pattern you should avoid. Instead look at your query plan outputs before deciding how to approach optimization. They can tell you lots of useful information about how to best approach a query. Often times people throw indexes on all kinds of fields because they think it is the right thing to do, ignoring that in some cases any gain they might achieve could be overall negated by the impact of having the index itself (lots of indexes on a table can slow down inserts and updates). Pick up a book on T-SQL Querying by Itzik Ben-Gan (MS Press) the next time you are in a bookstore (They will have it). Read the first 3 chapters and it will cover how the query process works inside SQL Server - as far as your work with this particular technology they may prove to be the most important 3 chapters you will ever read.
