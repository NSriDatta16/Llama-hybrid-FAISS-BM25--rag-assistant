I had to do this to implement a describeTable() method for SQLite when I worked on Zend Framework. SQLite does not have any way to get very detailed information about metadata. What I did was to run the following SQLite query: PRAGMA tableinfo( ); See http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html , under the heading "Pragmas to query the database schema." The result set returned from this query has columns for: column position (integer) column name (string) data type (string) nullable (0) vs. not null (1) default value (string) primary key (1) You can view the PHP code by downloading Zend Framework and looking in class Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Sqlite , method describeTable() . You can also view the source online via the code repository browser at framework.zend.com (although it is frequently not working). FWIW, this is not like mysql_fetch_field() . That method returns metadata about a result set, which may not be the same thing as metadata about a table.
