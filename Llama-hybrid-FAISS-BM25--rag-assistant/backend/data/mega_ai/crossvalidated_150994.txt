Bayesian networks (BNs) are commonly used in the context you describe. As a generative model , a BN would allow you to represent the statistical dependencies between your domain variables, which in your case can be subgrouped as 1) pre-treatment, 2) treatment, and 3) post-treatment variables. You can train your model on your existing patient data, and then enter evidence (fill in observed values) for a specific patient to investigate how the observed values affect other variables (including those you labelled as outcome, i.e. post-treatment.) One neat trick is that you can actually asses the effect of different treatment types on your outcome variables. This is called an intervention . If interested, we have a relevant paper here .
