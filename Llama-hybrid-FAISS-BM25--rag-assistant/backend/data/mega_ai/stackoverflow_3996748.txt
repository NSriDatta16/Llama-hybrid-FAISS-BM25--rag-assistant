Looking for distributed, in-memory Graph DB

Is there a database which will satisfy all (or at least most) of this requirements? Graph oriented - optimized for storing graphs and traversal(e.g HyperGraphDB, Neo4j) Running in memory, but having a persisted storage (e.g. Redis) Distributed (e.g. membase) Had .NET adapter (TCP/IP, not HTTP REST) Or am I asking too much? Thanks in advance.
