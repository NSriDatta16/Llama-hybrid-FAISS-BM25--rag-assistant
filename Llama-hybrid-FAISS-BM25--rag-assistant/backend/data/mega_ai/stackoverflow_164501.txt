Greetings! I think you are getting WAY ahead of yourself in forcing a specific language and working on specific topics and a curriculum.. It sounds like you (and some of the responders) are confusing "advising a programming club" with "leading a programming class". They are very different things. I would get the group together, and the group should decide what exactly they want to get out of the club. In essence, make a "charter" for the club. Then (and only then) can you make determinations such as preferred language/platform, how often to meet, what will happen at the meetings, etc. It may turn out that the best approach is a "survey", where different languages/platforms are explored. Or it may turn out that the best approach is a "topical"one, where there topic changes (like a book club) on a regular basis (this month is pointers, next month is sorting, the following is recursion, etc.) and then examples and discussions occur in various languages. As an aside, I would consider a "language-agnostic" orientation for the club. Encourage the kids to explore different languages and platforms. Good luck, and great work!
