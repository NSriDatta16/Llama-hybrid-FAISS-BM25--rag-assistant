Question about validity of an MCMC algorithm

Let suppose I want to sample from the posterior distribution of $X_1,X_2|y$ using an MCMC algorithm and let indicate with $X_i^t$ the value of $X_j$ at the $t-$ th iterations. I want to know if the following algorithm samples from the target distribution: Sample $X_1^t$ from the distribution of $X_1|X_2^{t-1},y$ Sample $X_2^t$ from the distribution of $X_2|X_1^{t},X_3^{t-1},y$ Sample $X_3^t$ from the distribution of $X_3|X_1^{t},X_2^{t},y$ where $X_3$ is a suitable variable that makes the sample of $X_2$ easier. A reference is highly appreciated. EDIT: I did some simulations and it seems to work
