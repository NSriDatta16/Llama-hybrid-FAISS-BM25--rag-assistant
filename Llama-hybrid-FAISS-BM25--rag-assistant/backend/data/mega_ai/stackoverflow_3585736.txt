Is the CPU bandwidth on Google App Engine just too expensive or it is my code?

I wanted to benchmark GAE read performance. Around 10,000 entities are being fetched from data store. These entities contain 3 properties name (around 16 chars), description (around 130 chars) and a time-stamp. Nothing unusually large. Here's what I see: On an average it takes around 11 seconds to read 10k entities. Not sure whether this is considered fast, slow or reasonable, but it is not too exciting regardless. More interesting find is the CPU metering. Performing this read operation 100 times consumes about 3.0 CPU hours. The cost is $0.30. Given there is no CPU intensive algorithm going on here, doesn't it make GAE's CPU bandwidth quite expensive? (sure, it comes with 24/7 sys-admins in the form of Python scripts etc etc, but still...) Or is this something in my Java code: http://github.com/akirekadu/GAE-Evaluation/blob/master/show.jsp
