This is a good approach (both using spurious variables and the placebo treatment you describe). As you write, it's important to make sure the control time series are not affected by the intervention. This is the case if the intervention does not does not directly affect the control time series, and the response does not (causally) influence the control time series. Using spurious variables makes sure 2 is not the case. To make sure also 1 is not the case, you could fit an additional CausalImpact model using one of the control time series as response, and the remaining ones as covariates (and repeating this for each control time series): if the control time series are indeed not affected by the intervention, CausalImpact should fail to find a significant impact here.
