Eventual Solution : I changed the data insertions from LinqToSql to use SqlBulkCopy via DataTable. The first time I did this, I got an OutOfMemory exception when trying to build a DataTable with 2 million rows in memory. So I am adding 50,000 rows at a time, and loading them into the DB with SqlBulkCopy (Batch Rate: 10,000) and then clearing the DataTable Rows collection. I am now getting in 2.1 million rows in 108 seconds (About 20,000 per second; Rate rate last night was average of 200 per second with L2S). With the increased data insertion performance, the app-wide unresponsiveness has gone away.
