Reading the question closely, it seems that you have to read a file, extract each word and use it as the key value, and store the length of each key as the integer: an example line leads to a HashMap like this an : 2 example : 7 line : 4 After you've built your map (made of keys mapping to entries, or seemingly elements in the question), you'll need to run some statistics over it to find the number of keys (look at HashMap) the average length of all keys (again, simple enough) the number beginning with "a" (just look at the String) Then make a value object containing these values and return it from the method that does the statistics. I know I've given more information that you require, but someone else may benefit from a little extra help.
