Industry analysis - multiple industries

I am trying to run logistic regression on marketing leads and use industry as a predictor of whether the lead converts (1/0). Often, when I enrich data from websites like crunchbase the associated company for a lead has multiple industry associations. I am looking for help in finding a method, as well as R script, to separate these values and ultimately and identify the industries that are the best predictors of conversion. If anyone can offer some guidance here it would be greatly appreciated.
