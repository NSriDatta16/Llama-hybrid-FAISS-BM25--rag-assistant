Time series regression

I m new in the domain of machine learning. I m here to ask for some elucidation. I have a data set presented as a time series( from a strain sensor coming from a wind turbine). In this time series, we can capture stop and start as u can see in the attached figure . I would like to know. which type of layer should I use? is it possible to make a model that counts up the start and stop of the signal(output dimension = 2)? Until now I just did classification using conv1D and the classes are (there is a stop, there is a start, there is nothing) but this way proceed is not convenient since sometimes we can have a rotor stop and start. I already thanks you a lot for your help,
