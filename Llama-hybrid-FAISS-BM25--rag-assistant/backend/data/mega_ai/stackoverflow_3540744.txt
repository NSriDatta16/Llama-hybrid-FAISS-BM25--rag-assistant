Read up on the GAC (Global Assembly Cache), this a central storage for DLLs that are shared across projects... thats where I put my log4net DLL. You can then simply add the reference to it in your .config file forevery project you need to use it in without adding the DLL to the projects themselves. This is a good place to start: MSDN: Working with the Global Assembly Cache
