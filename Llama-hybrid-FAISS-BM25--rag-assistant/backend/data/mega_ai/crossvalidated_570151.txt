Disclaimer: I have a Bayesian bias. The purpose of frequentist hypothesis testing is to reject the null hypothesis : that is not the same as proving the alternative hypothesis. Such experiments don't give you the "evidence that $H$ is true", even if you can hear people making claims like this. The $p$ -value is the probability of observing the data $D$ more extreme than observed given that the hypothesis $H$ is true $P(D>d|H)$ . The Bayesian posterior probability is the other way around, the probability that $H$ is true given the data $P(H|D) = P(D|H) P(H) / P(D)$ . So in fact in the Bayesian setting, you do update your prior belief $P(H)$ about $H$ given the observed data, while in the frequentist setting you don't. Frequentist experiments don't tell you how likely $H$ is and because of that, it doesn't give you a direct framework for updating your beliefs about it. If you rejected the hypothesis that $H=5$ , it still can be anything (just not $5$ ), and you still don't know what it is. There is also maximum likelihood , "find $H$ such that the likelihood of observing $D$ is highest under it", but again, it doesn't tell you what $P(H|D)$ is. Finally, if you consider probabilities to be a measure of beliefs , you are already taking a Bayesian side. Thanks to adopting such a viewpoint, you can measure how true it is given the data. In a frequentist setting, you can only make the "assuming that it is true" claims.
