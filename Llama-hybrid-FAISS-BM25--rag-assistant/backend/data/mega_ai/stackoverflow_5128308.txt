There several ways: 1) AlbumsVM is aware of CreateAlbumVM (for example first opens the second). In this case you can simply add album into AlbumsVM using details provided by CreateAlbumVM 2) CreateAlbumVM is aware of AlbumsVM . Then it can insert albums into AlbumsVM itself. 3) AlbumsVM receives albums as ObservableCollection from somewhere. Then CreateAlbumVM can insert new album into original ObservableCollection which will be reflected in AlbumsVM 4) There is some mediator between these viewModels which provide event AlbumWasAdded .
