People generally like the "zoo" and "forecast" packages in R for time series, but R does some simple time series stuff without any packages. If you want to learn more about time series prediction in R, Cowpertwait's "Introductory Time Series with R" is a really good book. I'd recommend going through it to learn how to do the kind of modeling with time series you want.
