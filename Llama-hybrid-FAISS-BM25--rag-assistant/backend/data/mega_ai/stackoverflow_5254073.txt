Ganglia Metric Value Decay To Zero

I am sending metrics to Ganglia using Gmetric once every 5 minutes. But if the cron task that is sending the metrics is not working, I would expect the metric value on the Ganglia graph to go to zero, whereas it stays at its last updated value. Is there a way to change this behaviour?
