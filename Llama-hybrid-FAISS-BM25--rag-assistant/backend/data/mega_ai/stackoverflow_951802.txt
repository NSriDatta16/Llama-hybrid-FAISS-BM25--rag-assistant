Calling .NET Web Services Asynchronically from Java

I need to make asynchronous calls to .NET web services from java since synchronous calls are too slow. I know in .NET this is easily done since the stub (proxy) class created by wsdl.exe also generates methods for asynchronous calls(BeginMethod()/EndMethod()). I created the service stub using eclipse Ganymede but no asynchronous method call were generated. How do you do this in java? Thanks in advance
