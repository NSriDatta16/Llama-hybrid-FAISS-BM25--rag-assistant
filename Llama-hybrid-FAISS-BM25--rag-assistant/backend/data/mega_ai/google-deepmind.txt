DeepMind Technologies Limited, trading as Google DeepMind or simply DeepMind, is a Britishâ€“American artificial intelligence research laboratory which serves as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Founded in the UK in 2010, it was acquired by Google in 2014 and merged with Google AI's Google Brain division to become Google DeepMind in April 2023. The company is headquartered in London, with research centres in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and Switzerland. In 2014, DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine). The company has created many neural network models trained with reinforcement learning to play video games and board games. It made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat Lee Sedol, a Go world champion, in a five-game match, which was later featured in the documentary AlphaGo. A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs playing go, chess and shogi (Japanese chess) after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning. DeepMind has since trained models for game-playing (MuZero, AlphaStar), for geometry (AlphaGeometry), and for algorithm discovery (AlphaEvolve, AlphaDev, AlphaTensor). In 2020, DeepMind made significant advances in the problem of protein folding with AlphaFold, which achieved state of the art records on benchmark tests for protein folding prediction. In July 2022, it was announced that over 200 million predicted protein structures, representing virtually all known proteins, would be released on the AlphaFold database. Google DeepMind has become responsible for the development of Gemini (Google's family of large language models) and other generative AI tools, such as the text-to-image model Imagen, the text-to-video model Veo, and the text-to-music model Lyria. History The start-up was founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in November 2010. Hassabis and Legg first met at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London (UCL). Demis Hassabis has said that the start-up began working on artificial intelligence technology by teaching it how to play old games from the seventies and eighties, which are relatively primitive compared to the ones that are available today. Some of those games included Breakout, Pong, and Space Invaders. AI was introduced to one game at a time, without any prior knowledge of its rules. After spending some time on learning the game, AI would eventually become an expert in it. "The cognitive processes which the AI goes through are said to be very like those of a human who had never seen the game would use to understand and attempt to master it." The goal of the founders is to create a general-purpose AI that can be useful and effective for almost anything. Major venture capital firms Horizons Ventures and Founders Fund invested in the company, as well as entrepreneurs Scott Banister, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk. Jaan Tallinn was an early investor and an adviser to the company. On 26 January 2014, Google confirmed its acquisition of DeepMind for a price reportedly ranging between $400 million and $650 million. and that it had agreed to take over DeepMind Technologies. The sale to Google took place after Facebook reportedly ended negotiations with DeepMind Technologies in 2013. The company was afterwards renamed Google DeepMind and kept that name for about two years. In 2014, DeepMind received the "Company of the Year" award from Cambridge Computer Laboratory. In September 2015, DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust signed their initial information sharing agreement to co-develop a clinical task management app, Streams. After Google's acquisition the company established an artificial intelligence ethics board. The ethics board for AI research remains a mystery, with both Google and DeepMind declining to reveal who sits on the board. DeepMind has opened a new unit called DeepMind Ethics and Society and focused on
