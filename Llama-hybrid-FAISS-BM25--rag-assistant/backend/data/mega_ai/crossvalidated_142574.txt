linear regression and logistic regression

Suppose I have a variable X1 , which is a score on some psychological test, that indicates whether a person will commit a crime. The variable Y is a binary outcome which indicates whether a person finally committed a crime after the test. If I create a table by using X1 and Y , the result is shown as below. TEST SCORE X1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Y 0 100 20 10 7 8 9 1 6 10 4 3 2 1 The summary of logistic regression and linear regression shows X1 is statistically significant. My question is that I wonder which of these options is the appropriate answer for this result. X1 successfully indicates whether the person will commit a crime With appropriate weight (slope coefficient) X1 will successfully indicate whether the person will commit a crime. Relying on the test score is insufficient since the error rates are approximately 45% (20 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) / sum of all. However, appropriate weight (slope coefficient) X1 will successfully indicate whether the person will commit a crime. Any comments or answers will be much appreciated.
