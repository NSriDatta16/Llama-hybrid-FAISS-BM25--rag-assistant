risk related to using winPcap in place of socket

What I have read so far, winPcap allows you to bypass OS and bypass application and transport layer processing for TCP and provides direct access to the link layer. I am planning to use winpcap to do some user application stuff and not just sniffing. I will be receiving and sending critical information using pcap which I am currently doing via sockets. Does bypassing OS, and according to my understanding application and transport layers on my side, involve any risks? As a side question the winpcap documentation I have found so far talks about how to programatically implement it but does'nt tell in detail what it is bypassing and how does it do that. Any link to that will be helpful. Also, I'd like to know if anyone is using winpcap for any purposes other than network sniffing for monitoring reasons and msn.
