One feature - several units

I have a dataframe where one of the features is the Mileage expressed in some cases in $\frac{km}{l}$ , while in others is expressed in $\frac{km}{kg}$ , according to the combustion type of the car (so I can't just convert some and have all expressed in the same unit because that'd make no sense). I think it makes no sense to just ignore this and treat all numbers equally. The first approach I can think of consists of creating two separate columns for each case, in which case for each register in the dataset, one column will have a number while the other will be empty. I could then fill nans with the average value of the column, thinking of it as 'the most neutral value it could get'. Another option I can think of consists of saving all the values in the same column, and have another column to indicate the type of units used in each case, e.g. $\frac{km}{l}$ maps to $1$ ; $\frac{km}{kg}$ maps to $0$ . I'm not convinced by any of the two approaches, but at the same time can't think of anything better. If anyone can help me think of a better approach to deal in this cases, I'd be very thankful. Edit1: Here are the types of fuel and their respective units. CNG: ['km/kg'] Diesel: ['kmpl'] Petrol: ['kmpl'] LPG: ['km/kg'] Electric: [nan] Although it would be possible to convert cng kg to l, it would be a different meaning in each case. One thing I thought of was to express this information in terms of price per km... Until now, it seems the most reasonable thing to do.
