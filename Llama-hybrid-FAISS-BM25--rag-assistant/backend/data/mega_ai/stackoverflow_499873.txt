Do you think Unit Tests are a good way to show your fellow programmers how to use an API?

Do you think Unit Tests are a good way to show your fellow programmers how to use an API? I was listening to the Stackoverflow Podcast this week and I now realize that unit testing is not appropriate in all situations (I.E. it can cost you time if you go for 100% code-coverage). I agree with this as I have suffered from the "OCD code coverage disorder in the past), and have now mended my ways. However to further appropriate my knowledge of the subject, I'd like to know if unit testing is a good way to bring in new programmers that are unfamiliar with the project's APIs. (It sure seems easier than just writing documentation...although I like it when there's documentation later...)
