java audit log every method using aspectj

How to log messages for every method before and after the method executes. Mainly for all classes in a package whether they are managed by spring or not. Using spring aop you can intercept beans that are managed by spring, but how to intercept beans that are not managed. I don't want to use java -agent option, as it requires a jar in tomcat and other few things to be done to get it working. is compile time weaving the only choice?
