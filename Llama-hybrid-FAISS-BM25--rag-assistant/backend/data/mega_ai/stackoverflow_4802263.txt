string handling

I would like to know that if I have an english dictionary in a text file what is the best way to check whether a given string is a proper and correct english word. My dictionary contains about 100000 english words and I have to check on an average of 60000 words in one go. I am just looking for the most efficient way. Also should I store all the strings first or I just process them as they are generated. Thanx
