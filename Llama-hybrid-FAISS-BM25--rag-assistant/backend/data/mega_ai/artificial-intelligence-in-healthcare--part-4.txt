s a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. Concerns have been raised, however, regarding the limited diversity of datasets, particularly the underrepresentation of darker skin tones, which may reduce generalizability across populations. In addition to skin cancer detection and analysis of tissue samples of histological smears, AI has been applied to chronic and aesthetic dermatology. Consumer-facing platforms have extended these methods into digital health, offering remote evaluation and personalized treatment. For example, MDalgorithms has developed mobile applications such as MDacne, which uses a proprietary database of nearly one million acne images to grade acne severity from smartphone selfies and generate customized treatment regimens. AI has also been applied to inflammatory skin conditions such as rosacea, where an AI-powered diagnostic tool was reported to achieve accuracy rates of approximately 88â€“90% in identifying the disorder, highlighting the potential for automated systems to support clinical assessment. Similarly, MDhair applies AI analysis to scalp photographs to personalize hair loss treatments, with clinical trials reporting reductions in shedding, increased density, and improved scalp hydration. A large study involving over one million individuals, described by Dermatology Times, further emphasized the value of AI-based systems in collecting extensive demographic and clinical data on skin and hair health, enabling the identification of population-level trends that may inform both research and patient care. This illustrate the broader applications of AI beyond diagnosis, including treatment personalization, remote monitoring, and enhanced access to dermatologic care. Nevertheless, independent reviews have emphasized that many studies rely on context-free images rather than full clinical examinations, and performance comparisons often fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists. According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. Gastroenterology AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology. Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in us
