What is the best way to implement 'Excel like column sizing' for an HTML table?

I want to allow the user to resize columns in an HTML table, using the same method as you would in Excel. Drag the space between columns and size. I did some research on this last year, and found a few hacks and kludges. Most were pretty bad, and I didn't find anything really good. Now, it looks like I need to implement this functionality, and want to do it right, so before I start this again, I just thought I'd ask if anybody else has done this, and how they did it. I believe I've seen a FogBugz demo video where they had this implemented. So I know it can be done well. BTW-I'd prefer not to use any open source frameworks, since my client may sell this app in the future.
