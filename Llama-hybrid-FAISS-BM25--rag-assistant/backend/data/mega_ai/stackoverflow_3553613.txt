Generally, you should be able to call "eval()" with the resultant data as the parameter, and it will run the code. HOWEVER, using eval is strongly discouraged for security reasons. For example, remember to NEVER EVER evaluate code that you get from the user. You should look into other ways to do what you want to do.
