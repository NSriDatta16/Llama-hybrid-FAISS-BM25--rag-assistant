Why we need it / why they make our life easier ? It allows you to check the expected behavior of the piece(s) of code you are testing, serving as a contract that it must satisfy. It also allows you to safely re-factor code without breaking the functionality (contract) of it. It allows you to make sure that bug fixes stay fixed by implementing a Unit test after correcting a bug. It may serve as as a way to write decoupled code (if you have testing in mind while writing your code). How to unit-test [simple example in Java] ? Check out the JUnit website and the JUnit cookbook for details. There isn't much to writing JUnit test cases. Actually coming up with good test cases is surely harder than the actual implementation. When do not we need them / types of projects we can leave unit-testing out? Don't try to test every method in a class, but rather focus on testing the functionality of a class. Beans for example, you won't write tests for the getters and setters... Links JUnit - Unit testing EclEmma - test coverage tool link text - Wikipedia link to unit testing
