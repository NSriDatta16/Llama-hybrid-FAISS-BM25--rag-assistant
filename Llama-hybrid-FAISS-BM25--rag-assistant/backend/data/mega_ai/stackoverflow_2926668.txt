Well look the sad truth is 50% of developers are below average. Actually due to the Jon Skeet factor it's more like 65%. But that doesn't mean you should throw in the towel. (If everyone did that it would only serve to set the bar even higher, making even more people depressed about it.) At least you acknowledge the fact that you aren't satisfied with yourself and want to be better. I know people that write terrible code and think it's the greatest thing in the world. But I don't think I've ever met a good developer that wasn't embarrassed of the code he wrote 6 months ago. It's normal and it's a sign of progress.
