I've found some information on a couple of Diagnostics attributes DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute and DebuggerHiddenAttribute that indicates that using these attributes will cause the coverage analyzer in VS to leave these out of its results. I've tried it with the DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute and it seems to work. I can probably live with this for most of the classes that I'm thinking of, though I don't like the side effect of not being able to step into these classes. That shouldn't be a problem for the wrapper classes, but it may end up being so with classes that are inherently hard to test and I need debugger access to. I'm still looking for alternatives, though.
