Full width background color highlighting of codeblock in Vim

I have Vim documents that have codeblock regions that use 'syntax include' regions to have different syntax highlighting from the main document. For example, I have a syntax region named 'pyregion' defined that I use when I input Python code. The pyregion areas of the document are then highlighted using setup in Python's syntax file, while the area outside the region uses the syntax file of the main document. I want to have the entire background in the Python region be shaded a different color to distinguish it from the non-Python areas of the document. I can get part of the way there by entering a background for the entire python region: :highlight pyregion guibg=#555555 But the command above changes the background only for areas that have text characters on them, not for entire background of the region, which seems still to be governed like rest of document by the background color defined for the 'Normal' group. This is okay -- it does draw attention to the region, but it has a blotchy look because only the code characters themselves have different background, not the entire band of the region across the screen. Is there some way to get a uniform band of a different background color across the whole region, not just portion of region where there are characters? There's related question and answer in following link, but so far as I can tell that answer also changes background only where there is text: Highlight Code Block Backgrounds with Vim Thanks for any help.
