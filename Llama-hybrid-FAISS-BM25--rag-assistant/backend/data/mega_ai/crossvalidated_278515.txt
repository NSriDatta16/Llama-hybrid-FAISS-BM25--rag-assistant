Logistic Regression Multiple Models

If you have a population size of 61,000 and you take a sample of 10,000 should you run your model with different random samples to gain better results? I ran a logistic regression model twice both with different random samples. Both Models had the same AIC and SC values as well as very similar c statistic values (.773 and .771 respectively) In the first sample, the p values are a lot less than .05. On the second random sample the p values for some variables (employer name, preferred adr line 1) are close to .05. Would it be better to use the first model since the p values are much lower?
