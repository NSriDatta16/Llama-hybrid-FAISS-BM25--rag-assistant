Assuming you're using GLSL via the ARB extensions (GL_ARB_shader_objects, GL_ARB_vertex_shader and GL_ARB_fragment_shader), you need to use glGetAttribLocationARB, from the GL_ARB_vertex_shader extension . If you are not using those extensions and not using OpenGL >= 2.0, then you don't need to use glGetAttribLocation since it requires a vertex shader to be present.
