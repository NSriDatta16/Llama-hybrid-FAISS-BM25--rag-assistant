We use normal distribution because it is easily reparameterized. Also a sufficiently powerful decoder can map the normal distribution to any other distribution, so from a theoretical viewpoint, the exact choice is not important. As for your second question, I would question your premise -- I am pretty sure weights are NOT normally distributed -- I recall seeing that resnet weights follow a more laplacian distribution. Anyway that is a pretty unrelated matter to the choice of prior in a VAE.
