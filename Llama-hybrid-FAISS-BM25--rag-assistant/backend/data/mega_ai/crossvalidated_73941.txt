How to mix probability estimators of the same phenomenon?

Also posted here and here . I have the following problem: I have N models that give me an estimation of the probability distribution function p(x) of a certain phenomenon x. Let's call them: $p_1(x),...,p_N(x)$. They come from different sources of information, so they can give different values, but they all refere to the same observable fact. Is there a formal and valid way to combine them into a single formula? I have read about mixture distributions, are they applicable to my case? Suppose that my models can be more or less reliable, depending on the source of information they are based on, can I also combine them giving more weight to one model rather than another? One possible solution I have thought is to make a weighted average of all the PDFs: $p(x) = w_1*p_1(x) + ... + w_N * p_N(x)$ where $\sum\limits_{i=0}^N w_i = 1$, does it make sense? Thanks very much for your suggestions! PS: to be more concrete my models give me the probability distribution that a certain person is in the position (x,y) and they rely on different sources of information like the power of a received signal or some other observable fact.
