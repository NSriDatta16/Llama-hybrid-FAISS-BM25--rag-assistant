Is it possible to use a trusted connection (SSPI) with the SQLDMO API?

I am using the DMO API via .NET to provide an alternative interface to job scheduling functionality on SQL Server 2000 Agent. The working code looks something like this: using SQLDMO; internal class TestDmo { public void StartJob() { SQLServerClass sqlServer = new SQLServerClass(); sqlServer.Connect("MyServerName", "sql_user_id", "p@ssword"); // no trusted/SSPI overload? foreach (Job job in sqlServer.JobServer.Jobs) { if (!job.Name.Equals("MyJob")) continue; job.Start(null); } } } Everything works in the above-listed form (SQL Server authentication with uid/pwd provided) but I would also like to provide an option to authenticate as a trusted user (aka SSPI, Trusted Connection) Is this possible in the DMO API? If so how? Note: The SQLServerClass.Connect method does not seem to have any overloads, I already tried to pass null values for the user id and password to no avail and the Googles has not been helpful yet. Any ideas?
