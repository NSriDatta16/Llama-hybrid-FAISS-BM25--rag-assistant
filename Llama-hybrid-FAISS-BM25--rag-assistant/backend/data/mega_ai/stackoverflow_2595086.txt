For .NET 3.5, LINQ-to-SQL; drag the tables onto a data-context, job done. Actually any ORM would probably do, but LINQ-to-SQL is a very quick way of getting the job done using just the MS tools and VS IDE. They aren't "pure" POCO done this way (they have L2S attributes etc), but it is easy. You can do pure POCO with L2S, but it takes a bit more effort. With 2.0, NHibernate. But more work as unless you use additional tooling you'll have to write the classes and/or mapping files.
