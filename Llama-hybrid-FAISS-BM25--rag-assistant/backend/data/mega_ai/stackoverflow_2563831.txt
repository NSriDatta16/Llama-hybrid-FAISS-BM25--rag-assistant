I'm not aware of a YourKit option to do this (which isn't to say that there isn't one), but there is a Java remote-debugging option to do this. Try adding the following to your command line, in addition to the YourKit agent options: -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y This should cause the VM to suspend as soon as it starts up, waiting for a debugger to connect on port 8000. YourKit itself isn't a debugger, but an IDE like Eclipse or Netbean will do the job, as will the basic jdb command line. So run the command, with both options set, connect YourKit, then use a debugger to connect to the debug port, which will trigger the VM to continue execution, allowing YourKit to get the data you need. It would be better to do this all using YourKit, but I know of no such way.
