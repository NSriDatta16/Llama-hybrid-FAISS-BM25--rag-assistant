Let user reorder buttons in a UIView

I have a view in which there are 6 buttons. I want to let user reorder the position of these buttons as I can do in the screen of the iphone with the app icons. The user could drag a button to the position of another button and change its position in the view. Facebook app has this functionality with its icons too. Any idea? Thanks.
