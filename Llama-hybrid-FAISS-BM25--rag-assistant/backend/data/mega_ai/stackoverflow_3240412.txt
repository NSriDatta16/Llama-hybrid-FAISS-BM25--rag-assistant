Interestingly, the implementation of isalpha() in your question is slower that the most common implementation provided with standard C libraries 30 years ago. Remember, this is a function that will be used at a critical inner loop of your average C compiler. :) I'll admit that current library implementations are probably marginally slower than they used to be, because of character set issues that we have to deal with today.
