How do I make "simple" throughput servlet-filter?

I'm looking to create a filter that can give me two things: number of request pr minute, and average responsetime pr minute. I already got the individual readings, I'm just not sure how to add them up. My filter captures every request, and it records the time each request takes: public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ...() { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); chain.doFilter(request, response); long stop = System.currentTimeMillis(); String time = Util.getTimeDifferenceInSec(start, stop); } This information will be used to create some pretty Google Chart charts. I don't want to store the data in any database. Just a way to get current numbers out when requested As this is a high volume application; low overhead is essential. I'm assuming my applicationserver doesn't provide this information.
