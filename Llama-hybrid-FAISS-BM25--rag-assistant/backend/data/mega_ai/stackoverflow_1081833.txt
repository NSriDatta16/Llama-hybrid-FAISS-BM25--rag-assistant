You haven't specified which platform you're talking about, but in both Java and .NET, you're recommended to use the organisation name in the namespace, e.g. Microsoft.CSharp.* or com.google.base.* . That means if you know the full name of the class, it should be fairly obvious where it comes from... and an IDE will generally show you the full name of the class (including the namespace) if you hover over the brief name in code. If this doesn't help, please clarify the question.
