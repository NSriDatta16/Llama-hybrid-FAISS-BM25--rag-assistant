Regression vs. XGBoost vs deep learning for tabular data

I am modelling a tabular dataset and getting better results with a DNN than XGB or linear regression models. The literature tells me this shouldn't be the case. Are there any specific instances when DNNs should outperform gradient boosted decision trees and/or regression methods? These data have a large number of highly interacting features. The model does not need to extrapolate outside the training data.
