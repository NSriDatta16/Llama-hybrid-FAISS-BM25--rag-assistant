If I need the name of the friend with ID 1234321, I can request the name from this table. However, the problem is that this table will keep growing, until all users on Facebook are indexed (>500million rows). My webhost is not going to like this! Such a table will take about 25GB of diskspace. If storing the names of the users you need really takes 25GB, then it takes 25GB. You can't move data around and expect it to get smaller - and the overhead of a table is not that much. Instead, you need to focus on only storing the data you actually need. It is unlikely that everyone on Facebook uses your application (if it were the case, you shouldn't be using a host where 25GB of space is a worry). So instead of indexing the entirety of Facebook (which would be difficult regardless), just store the data relevant for the people who actually use your application and their immediate friends, which is a much smaller dataset. Your first proposed solution is the proper way to do it; it eliminates any potential redundancy in name storage.
