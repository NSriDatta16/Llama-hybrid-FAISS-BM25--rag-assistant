If you're looking for any kind of difference in distribution rather than just a shift up or down, a chi-squared test should be fine. It doesn't matter that the dimension is larger than 2x2. Similarly a Fisher Exact test may be done on tables larger than 2x2. If you're specifically interested in a tendency to higher (or lower) categories on the ordered variable, you would want to consider different tests with better power against such alternatives. Here's examples of a chi=squared and Fisher exact test done on a 2x3 table in R: > table(ED) type severity organic psychogenic mild 24 15 moderate 15 15 severe 10 21 > chisq.test(table(ED)) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: table(ED) X-squared = 5.9425, df = 2, p-value = 0.05124 > fisher.test(table(ED)) Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: table(ED) p-value = 0.05536 alternative hypothesis: two.sided
