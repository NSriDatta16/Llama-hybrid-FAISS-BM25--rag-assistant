Plot This summary is from the PURE version of the film.A masked gamer sits at his computer and plays a game titled 'Baby Invaders'. Inside the game and from a first-person perspective, a group of "avatars" with AI-generated baby faces loot a house, take selfies, and play a first-person shooter game. They join other players and taunt a second group as a Twitch-inspired livestream chat appears on the left, before riding in the back of a van. A global feed tracks their group, known as Duck Mobb, and their leader, known as Mr. Yellow. The Mobb arrive at a mansion and breaks inside, taking the residents hostage. Yellow sees an AI-generated white rabbit swimming in water while looking at a lake behind the mansion. In a webcam, three other masked gamers sit in front of a screen wearing headsets. The Mobb steal cash, food, clothes and champagne. Back outside, other players have murdered two hostages. Yellow makes an in-game purchase for pills and does cocaine. A giant metallic baby head with demonic horns rises from the water and speaks to him. Then, a nude giant attacks Yellow in a boss fight, and he defeats it. At night, Yellow watches a clip from the game being played at the beginning. Suddenly, he is inside a tunnel made of duplicates of the clip, with the masked gamer watching him from the end. Yellow runs backwards until he falls out the back of the tunnel. An unknown player makes their way to an office and finds a marker at a security desk that reads "Get to work." The monitors display a CCTV feed of another mansion. The player watches as a group of other players invade the mansion, taking hostages and robbing it.

A pop-up message from the Operator reveals the group to be the Duck Mobb and orders Mr. Yellow to find and open a safe. Yellow walks around the mansion collecting coins before the group of horned players appears again, now marked as intruders. The unknown player leaves the security desk to explore the rest of the office, realising all the lights have been turned off. From a GoPro, the three masked gamers livestream themselves entering an apartment and attacking the owner. Yellow sees a white rabbit hop towards a large fence gate, and two horned avatars acknowledge him. After taking a hostage outside to extract information is unsuccessful, Yellow rides around the house on a scooter. The Mobb find the safe and Purple drills through it, revealing a huge sum of cash inside. After looting it, Yellow plays a minigame. When he returns inside, everything appears distorted and changes rapidly. Yellow continues riding the bicycle while the others play basketball. Through a series of pop-ups, the Mobb rounds up the remaining hostages. At night, Yellow rides an electric wheelchair. When he collects a coin, he is teleported into a video-game room. Three masked burglars break into an elderly man's houseboat, robbing it and brutally murdering him. From a player's perspective (presumably Yellow), a group of pigs stand around a dead pig, before cutting back to the wheelchair. A pop-up reads "Play Time‚Äù. While in the pool, Yellow sees a giant white rabbit beneath the surface. The Mobb take a photo in front of the mansion. Digital fireworks go off, and they wav
