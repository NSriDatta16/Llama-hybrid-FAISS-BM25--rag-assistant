Using Image Data along with CSV file data for CNN model

I have image data along with csv file where each row of csv file contains attributes for corresponding image. I want to use images as well as csv file data to build CNN model using Keras. What is preferred way of doing it? I can append the attribute data with numpy array of image and train the model. I can create 2 different models and use average/voting for prediction. I think, in 1st appraoch csv file data which has around 50 columns would hardly matter as image shape is (128*128*3). Is it correct? and how can I give more importance to csv file (like 60% weightage to image data and 40% to csv file). And again how CNN would work with that CSV file data as CNN is preferred on Image Data?
