Magento: is there an API to mark an order as shipped?

I want to mark orders as shipped after we import the shipping feed from our warehouse. Is there an API for this? Or do I have to use the actual classes? I'm very new to Magento and I'm trying to figure out how to understand working with some of the lower level operations.
