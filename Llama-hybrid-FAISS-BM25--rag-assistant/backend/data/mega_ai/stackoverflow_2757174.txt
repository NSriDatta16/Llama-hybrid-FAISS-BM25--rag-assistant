I was just about to write the same as Justin :) The component I would suggest to replace during testing could be the logging component (if you have one, if not, I'd strongly suggest to implement one...). It's relatively easy to replace it with code that generates error and the logger usually gets enough information to know the current application state. Also it seems to be feasible to make sure that the testing code doesn't go into production. I would discourage conditional compilation though but rather go with some configuration file to select the logging component. Using "random" kills might help to detect errors but is not well suited for systematic testing because of its non-determinism. Therefore I wouldn't use it for automatic tests.
