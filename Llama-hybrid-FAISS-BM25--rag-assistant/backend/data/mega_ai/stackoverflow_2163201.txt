Also, the term "break the build" - does this mean code put source control and when the build is executed, it fails due to the code not passing a unit test/code coverage app returns negative results below a certain threshold? This could mean different things depending on company, project or team. Usually "build" is some reference (usually automated) procedure which is either succeeds or not. Thus "breaking the build" is doing something that leads failing of this reference procedure. It could include or exclude unit-tests running, or regression test running, or deployment of your product, or whatever your team thinks should never fail.
