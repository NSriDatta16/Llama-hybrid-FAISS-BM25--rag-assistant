The whole business of improper priors in Bayesian analysis arises because some users of Bayesian reasoning believe that proper priors tend to be derived from 'subjective' opinions and thus would taint the Bayesian inference with subjectivity. It turns out that ignoring the impropriety of the priors can nevertheless yield usable results. There are other schools of thought depending on one's interpretation of what is meant by probability. One train of thought is that everything in statistics is more or less subjective, not just the priors in Bayesian analysis. All models are approximations; models are chosen subjectively. If you think on those lines, then you will choose uninformative priors only if it is really true that you know absolutely nothing about the variable in question. But if you do know something - and quite often it will turn out that you do know something - then you should use informative priors. They will never be improper.
