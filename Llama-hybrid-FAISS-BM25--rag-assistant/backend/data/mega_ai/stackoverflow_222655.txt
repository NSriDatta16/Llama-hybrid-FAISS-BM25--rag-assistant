Embedding assemblies inside another assembly

If you create a class library that uses things from other assemblies, is it possible to embed those other assemblies inside the class library as some kind of resource? I.e. instead of having MyAssembly.dll , SomeAssembly1.dll and SomeAssembly2.dll sitting on the file system, those other two files get bundled in to MyAssembly.dll and are usable in its code. I'm also a little confused about why .NET assemblies are .dll files. Didn't this format exist before .NET? Are all .NET assemblies DLLs, but not all DLLs are .NET assemblies? Why do they use the same file format and/or file extension?
