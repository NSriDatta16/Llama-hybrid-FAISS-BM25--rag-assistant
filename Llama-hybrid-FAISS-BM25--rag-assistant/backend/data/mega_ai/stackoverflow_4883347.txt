Regarding the conditional index: You can't do this. MySQL has no such thing. Regarding the primary key: It depends on the storage engine. MySQL does not define how data is stored or retrieved, that's left up to the storage engine. MyISAM does not enforce any order on how rows are stored; they're appended to the end of the table but gaps from deleting can be reused and UPDATE queries can leave things out of order even without any DELETE s. InnoDB stores rows in order of their primary keys.
