Is it possible and reasonable to use AMEs for interpretation in a logistic regression even if the spline methodology is to be used?

Because of the linearity assumption of the logistic regression I have to use splines for my regression. I am now wondering if I should still use AMEs to extend the results? I am working with R. I know the function margins(). But this function does not work with my spline modell. SplineModell Is it possible and reasonable to use AMEs (average marginal effects) for interpretation in a logistic regression even if the spline methodology is to be used? Unfortunately, I have not found any exact literature on this. I would be very grateful for an answer.
