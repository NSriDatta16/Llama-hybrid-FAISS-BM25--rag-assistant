You could create working sets for your top-level groups like project1 and project2 ( Package Explorer View Menu -- little triangle in the upper right corner > Configure Working Sets... ), configure the package explorer to view these as top-level elements ( Package Explorer View Menu > Top Level Elements > Working Sets ), and add the dependent projects into them (using drag and drop or Configure Working Sets... ).
