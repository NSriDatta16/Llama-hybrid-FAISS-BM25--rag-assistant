I'm not sure that what you're doing is quite right, in that you're fragmenting your strings into separate packets. This could cause problems with multibyte strings. However, you may wish to check out ByteArrayOutputStream . You can write into this, then convert to a String using toString(enc) , where enc is the encoding you've used in your Python to convert your strings into bytes in the first place. Looking at your comment below, it appears you need some means to serialise in Python and deserialise in Java. Leaving aside solutions like XML serialisation, have you looked at possible solutions like Google Protocol Buffers ?
