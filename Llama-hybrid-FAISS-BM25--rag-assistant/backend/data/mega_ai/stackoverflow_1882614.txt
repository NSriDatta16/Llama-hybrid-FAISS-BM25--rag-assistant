The iPhone has support for youtube videos, (hence the built in youtube player), other than that it supports only quicktime. There is no support for other formats: most sites use flash for video these days (inc youtube), but flash is not supported on the iPhone. I site embedding a youtube video will work, but one embedding a video hosted elsewhere will not (unless its quicktime)
