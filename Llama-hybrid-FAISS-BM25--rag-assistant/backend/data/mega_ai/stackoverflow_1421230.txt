You can also move all your quiz_ related migrations into a separate subfolder in the db/ directory and then add rake tasks mirroring the regular migration functionality but that looks for the migrations in that subdirectory. Not super-elegant perhaps but it works. You can copy and paste the rake tasks already in rails and just modify them a bit.
