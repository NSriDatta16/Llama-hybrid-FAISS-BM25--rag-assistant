Running map reduce over geographically located VMs - How bad is this setup for a hadoop cluster?

Like the subject reads, is it important that I get dedicated hardware to run a hadoop cluster and not VMs? If yes, what is acceptable network latency? Are you required to have Gigabit ethernet? I would like to leverage hadoop in speeding up an ETL process. In trying to do so, I did setup a few VMs (512-1GB RAM, 1core per VM of a dual core 2.2Mhz CPU) which are about 500 miles apart, with a network latency of 10-25ms on a 100Mpbs ethernet. I am unable to match a single machine performance for my ETL process, with 3-4 VMs as nodes. So, I thought I would ask this question here for more insight.
