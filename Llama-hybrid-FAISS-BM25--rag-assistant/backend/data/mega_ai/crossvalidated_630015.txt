Let $f$ denote any density, characterized by its arguments. Let $f(y \mid \{x_1, x_2, x_3\})$ be the conditional density of $Y$ given $X_1, X_2, X_3$ . Then we have (limits of integration formally are $(-\infty, \infty)$ and are omitted, with the understanding that the densities may be set to zero over a subset of the extended reals). $$E[Y|X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,X_3=x_3] = \int y\cdot f(y\mid\{x_1,x_2, x_3\}) ~dy \tag{1}$$ By Bayes theorem for densities (or the "chain rule") $$f\left(y \mid \{x_1, x_2, x_3\}\right) = \frac{f(y, x_1, x_2, x_3)}{f(x_1, x_2, x_3)} \tag{2}$$ Inserting $(2)$ into $(1)$ , $$E[Y|X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,X_3=x_3] = \int y\cdot \frac{f(y, x_1, x_2, x_3)}{f(x_1, x_2, x_3)}~ dy \tag{3}$$ Implementing the suggestion of user @Spätzle , we would then have $$E[Y|X_1=x_1] = \iiint y\cdot \frac{f(y, x_1, x_2, x_3)}{f(x_1, x_2, x_3)}f(x_2,x_3)~dy\, dx_2\,dx_3. \tag{4}$$ Applying the chain rule $$f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = f(x_1 \mid \{x_2, x_3\})f(x_2,x_3)$$ and inserting this into $(4)$ and simplifying, we get $$E[Y|X_1=x_1] = \iiint y\cdot \frac{f(y, x_1, x_2, x_3)}{f(x_1 \mid \{x_2, x_3\})}~dy\, dx_2\,dx_3. \tag{5}$$ But is it so? Let's verify. What we are after is, again applying the chain rule $$E[Y|X_1=x_1] = \int y\cdot f(y \mid x_1)~ dy = \int y\cdot \frac{f(y , x_1 )}{f(x_1)}dy = \frac{\int y\cdot f(y , x_1 )~dy}{f(x_1)}\tag{6}.$$ We have $$f(y , x_1 ) = \iint f(y , x_1 , x_2, x_3)~dx_2\,dx_3, \tag{7}$$ and inserting this into $(6)$ we get $$E[Y|X_1=x_1] = \frac{\iiint yf(y , x_1 , x_2, x_3)~dy\,dx_2\,dx_3}{f(x_1)}\tag{8}.$$ Q: When is eq. $(5)$ the same as eq. $(8)$ ? A: Only when $X_1$ is independent from $(X_2, X_3)$ in which case $f(x_1 \mid \{x_2, x_3\}) = f(x_1).$ So the suggestion by user @Spätzle is not true in general. The reason why? We do not marginalize out all conditioning variables, we keep one, so we must take into account the possible dependence between it and the other two. This is why the invocation of the Law of Total Probability / Expectation fails here. Finally, using analogous manipulations as before, from $(8)$ we arrive at the generally valid expression $$E[Y|X_1=x_1] = \iint E(Y\mid X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, X_3=x_3) f(x_2, x_3 \mid x_1)\,dx_2\,dx_3.\tag{9}$$ Verbally: we should not "average over" $X_2$ and $X_3$ by using their joint density, but by using their joint density conditional on $X_1=x_1$ .
