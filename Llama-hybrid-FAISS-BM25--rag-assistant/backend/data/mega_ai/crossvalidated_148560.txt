You get the coefficients from PCA. These coefficients are multiplied by your observation matrix to obtain the components. So, multiply rotation by the new observation matrix instead. Don't forget to center it. Here's the code. Run PCA and see how the score matrix is obtained from the original data and the rotation. Note, that I'm NOT centering, and you probably should. > x=matrix(c(1,2,3,2,4,5.5),3,2) > x [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 2.0 [2,] 2 4.0 [3,] 3 5.5 > r=prcomp(x,retx=1,center=FALSE) > r$rotation PC1 PC2 [1,] -0.4666132 0.8844615 [2,] -0.8844615 -0.4666132 > r$x PC1 PC2 [1,] -2.235536 -0.04876479 [2,] -4.471072 -0.09752958 [3,] -6.264378 0.08701220 > x %*% r$rotation PC1 PC2 [1,] -2.235536 -0.04876479 [2,] -4.471072 -0.09752958 [3,] -6.264378 0.08701220 Now, apply the same rotation to the different data (again, see that I am NOT centering). > y=matrix(c(1,2,3,2,4,6.5),3,2) > y [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 2.0 [2,] 2 4.0 [3,] 3 6.5 > y %*% r$rotation PC1 PC2 [1,] -2.235536 -0.04876479 [2,] -4.471072 -0.09752958 [3,] -7.148839 -0.37960095 Note the similarity of the new scores. By the way, this is used a lot in forecasting with PCA. We obtain the rotation on historical data, then apply it to new data.
