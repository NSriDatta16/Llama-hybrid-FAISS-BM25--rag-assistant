I've read this over and over and I still don't understand. The SVN ADD and SVN COMMIT commands are the SVN client software. What do you mean "I'm not using an SVN client, just the OSX terminal"? What do you mean "What's the right way to overwrite a directory in my SVN repository?" -- are you trying to delete a directory? If so, do SVN DEL on your working copy and then commit. Are you trying to add files to your repository? If so, use drag-n-drop or "cp/mv" commands and put them into your working copy. Then SVN ADD them then SVN COMMIT. SVN maintains its working copies by virtue of hidden ".svn" directories which contain configuration information. If you remove those, then you get "'.' is not a working copy" errors. You must not delete or modify the .svn directories.
