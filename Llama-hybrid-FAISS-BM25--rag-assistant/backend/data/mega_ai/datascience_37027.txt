How to give rewards to actions in RL?

I'm working on below reinforcement learning problem: I have bottle of fix capacity (say 5 liters). At the bottom of bottle there is cock to remove water. The distribution of removal of water is not fixed. we can remove any amount of water from bottle, i.e. any continuous value between [0, 5]. At the top of the bottle one tap is mounted to fill water in the bottle. RL agent can fill [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] liters in the bottle. Initial bottle level is any value between [0, 5]. I want to train the agent in this environment to get optimal sequence of actions such that bottle will not get empty and overflow which implies continuous supply of water demand. Action space = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Discrete Space Observation Space = [0, Capacity of Bottle] i.e. [0, 5] Continuous Space Reward logic = if bottle empty due to action give negative rewards; if bottle overflow due to action give negative rewards I have decided to use python to create an environment. I'm new to RL. I'm not aware about for which condition I have to give the rewards. Is my reward logic is correct or I have to change it?
