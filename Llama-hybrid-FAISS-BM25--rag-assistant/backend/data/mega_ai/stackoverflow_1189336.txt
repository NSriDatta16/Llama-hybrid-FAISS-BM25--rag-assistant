Templates are text files in a directory on your server. The menu is a list of directories. The specific template to be loaded is named in your render_to_response calls in each view function. It's wonderfully quite simple and elegant. You never need to do a template "swap". You can simply have all the templates you ever want in a template search path. All can be available to all users at all times. You just provide directory_name/template_name . All handled for you. Don't mess with explicit cookies. Django already does this for you. See chapter 12 of the Django Book. Use the Profiles extension and put the selected template directory name in the user's profile.
