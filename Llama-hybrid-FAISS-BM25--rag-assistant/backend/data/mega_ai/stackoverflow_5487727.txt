I would go for 32GB memory and maybe more harddisks in RAID. CPU won't help that much - you have eough cpu power. You also need to configure mysql correctly. Leave 1-2 GB for OS cache and for temp tables. Increase tmp_table_size remove swap optimize query_cache_size (don't make it too big - see mysql documentation about it) periodically run FLUSH QUERY CACHE. if your query cache is doesn't clean the cache , it optimizes it (defragment). This is from mysql docs: Defragment the query cache to better utilize its memory. FLUSH QUERY CACHE does not remove any queries from the cache, unlike FLUSH TABLES or RESET QUERY CACHE. However I noticed that the other solution has the half disk space: 850GB, which might be reduced number of hard disks. That's generally a bad idea. The biggest problem in databases is hard disks. If you use RAID5 - make sure you don't use less hard disks. If you don't use raid at all - I would suggest raid 0.
