C# How to write a function body that could be used as GetAverageAge(students, s => s.age)

Say I have several ObservableCollections of different classes: public class Employee { public int age { get; set; } } public class Student { public int age { get; set; } } ObservableCollection employees = ...; ObservableCollection students = ...; now I need a function to calculation the average age of these collections: int employeeAveAge = GetAverageAge(employees, e => e.age); int studentAveAge = GetAverageAge(students, s => s.age); How to write the function body? Im not familiar with Action/Fun delegate, and somebody suggested me to pass a lambda as the function's parameter well I don't use the build-in LINQ Average() because I want to learn the usage of passing lambda to function
