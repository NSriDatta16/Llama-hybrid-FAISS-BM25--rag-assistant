How do map 1-to-1 relationship in grails to just 1 table under the covers?

Let's say I have a UserAccount domain class that has a UserPreferences domain class. I do this to separate the fields for organization purposes. Is there a way to tell grails/gorm that I really want it to map these domain classes to just the user_account table under the covers? Thanks!
