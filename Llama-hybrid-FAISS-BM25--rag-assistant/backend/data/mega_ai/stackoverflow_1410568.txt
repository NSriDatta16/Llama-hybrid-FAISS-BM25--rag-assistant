The easiest way to collect performance of both systems is to run a PAL, and collect the approriate data. PAL has extra counter sets for SQL Server. It will collect and analyse the data, and let you know where you have an issue. PAL can be found here http://www.codeplex.com/PAL Also an important issu is to location of the filegroups. How is the underlying storrage system defined? It usually has a huge impact on the SQL Server. (You should talk about spindels here, and not raw size...) Make sure your database files are not sharing the resources with anyone else
