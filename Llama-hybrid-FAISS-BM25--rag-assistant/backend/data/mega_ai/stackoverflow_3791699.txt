It seems like perhaps you should consider re-organizing your DOM. I don't understand why you change position relative to absolute positioning for the start of the drag and then change that back to relative on drop. That's a recipe for disaster as layouts get more complicated, naturally creating plenty of opportunity for your tags to jump around. If you checked in firebug, you'd find some children who are outside of their parents, which you probably didn't expect if you were dropping on a parent. If you are new to the world of types of positioning, and need to just get it done, stick to keeping these draggable elements absolute, this should minimise difficulties in predicting behavior. But to have nice sites at a variety of resolutions, you really should get to grips with how exactly a browser will place visible objects given their properties. Good luck :)
