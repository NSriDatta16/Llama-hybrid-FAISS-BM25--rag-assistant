I don't think you actually have a problem due to the sampling proportions in the disease/no disease dimension. Different prevalence of disease in your sample and the population isn't an issue for calculating sensitivity/specificity -- these two numbers just ask (1 -- sensitivity) whether the tool works well for detecting disease amongst those with disease, and (2 -- specificity) whether it works well correctly determining "no disease" amongst those without the disease. If you think about these two points (see Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity for formulae), you'll see that the calculations are independent of disease prevalence. Your sampling scenario is however an issue for calculating positive predictive value and negative predictive value -- but one could factor the known population prevalence into a calculation to combine this information with your sensitivity/specificity in order to estimate PPV/NPV. Again, Wikipedia covers this issue ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value#Problems_with_positive_predictive_value which also links through to a Statistics Notes one-pager from the BMJ that touches on this issue briefly: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2540558/ ) A more general point to consider for your overall approach -- if you use logistic regression to determine your sensitivity and specificity (really, one would be calculating an area under the curve equivalent using the c-statistic) then you are actually measuring sensitivity and specificity of the entire model -- that is, sensitivity/specificity of your new diagnostic test alongside the information in age/gender and the other covariates being specified.
