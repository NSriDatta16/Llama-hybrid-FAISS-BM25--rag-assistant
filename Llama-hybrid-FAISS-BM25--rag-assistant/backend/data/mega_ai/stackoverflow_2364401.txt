Had a similar problem. It turns out that at least in some circumstances the action of a rightBarButtonItem is called when a view controller is popped. My ugly fix for this is to remove the offending item when I push the next view controller on to the stack. Then I check in viewWillAppear if rightBarButton is nil and recreate the button if neccessary. However, recreating the button will have it hover at 0, 0 for a fraction of a second before popping into place at the right side of the navigation bar. A slightly more elegant fix would be to set the action of the button to the default value of 'NULL'. This solves the first problem but will also break the backBarButtonItem. So to sum up, I'm still looking for a proper fix for this. I'm about a day's work from contacting Apple with this -- might even be a bug, come to think of it...
