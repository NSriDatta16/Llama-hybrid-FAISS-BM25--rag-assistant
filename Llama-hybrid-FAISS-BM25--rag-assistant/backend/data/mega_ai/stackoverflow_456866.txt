You can also use VS's own class diagram to give a graphical view for some items. Although I think its limited to just one project at a time. Add a new 'Class Diagram' to the project, and then drag classes or assemblies etc from the Class view onto it to add them; or go to the class view and right click, view diagram. I find these very useful for looking around, but not so great for editing.
