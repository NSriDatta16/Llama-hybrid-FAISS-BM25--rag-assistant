My best answer here is not to check and simply try to do the job as best as it can. If and when a problem occurs, throw the appropriate error message. What would be the purpose of checking beforehand that the application is not installed, other than to warn the user that it is not? It would be the same as simply going ahead and attempting to execute and then failing and telling the user the exact same message. It's really not that bad of a strategy, for example in Python its encouraged to simply try to perform the function and then when an error occurs, recover properly. If you really want to check for external resources, you could have a messaging service set up on the server which tells your application whether or not the resources exist. I don't know if you're allowed to set that up or not.
