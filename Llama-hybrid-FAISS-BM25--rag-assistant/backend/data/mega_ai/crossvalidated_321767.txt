How to classify image when training samples are a mix of proportions? (plant cover)

I have some multispectral images (RGB + NIR) that I would like to classify for vegetation type using a supervised classification algorithm (most likely random forest but I'm also going to look into SVM and artificial neutral networks). The training data that I have are quadrats describing percent vegetation cover, and there are 15 vegetation options. For instance, a very fake example could be: Plot 1 Oak = 50% Alder = 20% Maple = 30% Blackberry = 0% English ivy = 0% ... etc Plot 2 Blackberry = 30% Grass = 50% Bare earth = 20% Oak = 0% ... etc My issue is that I am not familiar with ML classification except using random forest with defined categories for the dependent variable. Barring making categories out of similar groups of proportions (so anything that is a certain mix of grass and bare each is just called "grass"), is there another way to model this so that I can use these samples to classify the rest of the images? (Note: I have tried searching a lot and I think I may simply be missing a critical piece of jargon to Google.)
