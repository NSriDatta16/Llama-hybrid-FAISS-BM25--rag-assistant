Convolution with autoregressive filter

I am trying to understand what was done with timeseries from one paper.It says The raw time series are prewhitened, typically by convolution with an autoregressive filter, to reduce the spectral dynamic range. The autoregressive filter must be computed robustly; I have my ts x ,how to perform convolution with autoregressive filter in R?Could library forecast be used or...? EDIT What I have done so far d Then I have plot If I perform two-time differencing d Then my plot looks like this Should I preprocess the data again or not before I start building ARIMA models?
