As @nickcox says there are many times series models. The family of forecasting models can be seen here http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/23-forcasting-family-tree where ARIMA models are a subset of Transfer Function Models (includes causal vbariables). Some guidelines to developing a time series model can be found here http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog/entry/build-or-make-your-own-arima-forecasting-model . If you have possible predictors then by all means you should be considering multivariate time series models : note that simple multivariate regression is a particular case of a Transfer Function. Finally I had a role to play with the development of AUTOBOX and you should investigate a number of software providers including the free ones.
