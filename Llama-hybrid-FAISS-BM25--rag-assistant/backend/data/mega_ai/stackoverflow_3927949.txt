Mark, Tony, Leslie and all, thanks for your feedback but I managed to sidestep the problem! I discovered that the where clause results in false if there are no records in resourceOrganization table. That means even if resource table has records where active, published and resourcePublic are all 1, if there are no data in resourceOrganization table, the where clause results in false. I really don't understand why this is the case but now that I discovered this, I added some logic in my Java code to build query string depending on whether are records in resourceOrganization table. In any case, does anyone have any explanation for this behavior?
