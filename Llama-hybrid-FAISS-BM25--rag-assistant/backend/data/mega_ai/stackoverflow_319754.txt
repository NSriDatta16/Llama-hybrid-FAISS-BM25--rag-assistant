How do I run client script after a postback?

I'm looking for something like OnClientClick for a button, but I want it to happen after the postback (instead of before). I'm currently using the following, which works, but it adds the script block over and over again, which is not what I want. I simply want to execute an existing client script function. ScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlock( this, typeof( MyList ), "blah", "DraggifyLists();", true );
