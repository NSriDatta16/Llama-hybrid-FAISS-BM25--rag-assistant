Finally I found the solution. The solution doesn't include multithreading to start with. As I said that the delay was in binding the grid meaning the main thread was held, we couldn't do much. So the solution is to bring delays. When user selects the master row, a timer ticks off for a certain time. If another request is made before the time is expired, timer gets restarted. This is we ignore all calls that are made because user was clicking or selecting rows too fast. Once timer is expired, I take the selected row and display data. Simple and elegant solution.
