An HPD region is defined as$$\mathfrak{h}_\tau \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \{\theta;\ \pi(\theta|x)>\tau\}$$and it is an interval only when the parameter is unidimensional and the posterior is unimodal. Assuming this is the case and the posterior $\pi(\cdot|x)$ is available up to a multiplicative constant, finding an HPD interval consists in solving in $\theta$ the equation$$\pi(\theta|x)=\tau$$Since in most situations a coverage of $\alpha$ is requested, a second computational step consists in associating a coverage $\alpha(\tau)$ with the bound $\tau$, as in $$\int_{\{\theta;\ \pi(\theta|x)>\tau\}} \pi(\theta|x)\,\text{d}\theta = \alpha(\tau)a$$followed by the inversion of the function $\alpha(\tau)$ to find the value of $\tau$ guaranteeing the proper coverage. In the case $\pi(\theta|x)$ is the density of a Beta $B(\delta,\beta)$distribution, the first step requires solving $$\theta^{\delta-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}=\tau$$ which usually has no analytic solution [unless there exists $\gamma$ such that both $\gamma(\delta-1)$ and $\gamma(\beta-1)$ are integers. Hence a numerical resolution of the equation is required. For each $\tau$, the coverage $\alpha(\tau)$ can then be derived by calling the Beta cdf.
