This is an artifact of the model used for logistic regression, which is model for one of the two probabilities, which add to 1. If your two values are coded, eg, 0 and 1, then linear regression assigns a positive coefficient to any variable, x, that increases in value as y shifts from 0 to 1. So regression assumes that y increases from 0 to 1. The logistic transformation can model either the probability that y = 1 or that y = 0, eg logit(P(Y=1)) = b0 + b1x or logit(P(Y=0)) = b0 + b1x. These two models give opposite signs for b1, but they are the same in absolute value and they have the same estimated variance or standard error so they also have the same p-value. Confidence intervals also have their signs switched. The inferences you make about b1 are the same. The choice of models, for P(y=1) or P(y=1), is arbitrary as far as the logistic method is concerned, when there are two categories. The person who wrote the software probably wasn't concerned about whether users would want to compare linear regression with logistic regression, only with having a program that worked well. I seem to recall that the model SAS originally programmed did just what you have noticed. For many years they refused to make any change. After a lot of complaints they included an option that permitted the user to switch the roles of the two categories that resulted in switching the signs of all the variables.
