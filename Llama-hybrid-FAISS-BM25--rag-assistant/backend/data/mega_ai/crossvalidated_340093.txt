As you used RF to build you model, you can use a sensitivity measure (also called importance measure) which comes (almost) for free when you build the Random Forest: mean decrease in accuracy (also called permutation accuracy importance). As @Frank Harrell said, it is better to estimate a few times the random forest training to have multiple importance measure and have a better idea of their true importance. See the paper of Strobl et al. (2007) for more details about the method. Dependending on the library you used for your RF estimation, you could have it already computed or you may have to recompute it yourself. In R, RandomForest and cforest packages provide it. In Python, scikit-learn does it too ( feature_importances_ parameter). Same in Mllib . If using R, use cforest without bootstrap, as advised in Strobl et al. Note also that you can still apply any classical Sensitivity Analysis tool provided your problem is a regression (and not a classification). See HSIC indices, for example: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00903283/document and https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sensitivity/versions/1.14.0/topics/sensiHSIC
