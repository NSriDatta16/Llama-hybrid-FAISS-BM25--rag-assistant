PCA performs a linear combination of your original variables and defines a new set of variables. Not reducing the dimension of Xtrain after using PCA would imply that the PCA scores are able to recover all the variability from the original variables in Xtrain, so if you had a non penalized regression model, then the $R^2$ coefficient would be the same using Xtrain or using the PCA scores. But the variables themselves with which this $R^2$ coefficient is achieved are different when using Xtrain vs using PCA scores. Now, when adding a penalization such as elastic net, you impose some additional constraints on the $\beta$ coefficients associated to the variables. Since the variables in Xtrain are different from those in the PCA scores, it is expected that the same alpha and l1_ratio values for the elastic net provide different results when using Xtrain or the PCA scores.
