OpenMP parallelizing matrix multiplication by a triple for loop (performance issue)

I'm writing a program for matrix multiplication with OpenMP, that, for cache convenience, implements the multiplication A x B(transpose) rows X rows instead of the classic A x B rows x columns, for better cache efficiency. Doing this I faced an interesting fact that for me is illogic: if in this code i parallelize the extern loop the program is slower than if I put the OpenMP directives in the most inner loop, in my computer the times are 10.9 vs 8.1 seconds. //A and B are double* allocated with malloc, Nu is the lenght of the matrixes //which are square //#pragma omp parallel for for (i=0; i
