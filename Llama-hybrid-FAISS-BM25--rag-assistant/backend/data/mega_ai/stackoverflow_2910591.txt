Magento connect stuck while installing

I am facing this problem while installing extensions, themes basically anything from magento connect. When I enter the extension key and click install It just gets stuck and even when it says done and I try and go back on admin page it says "There are PEAR processes running. If you will close the window or navigate away from the page, installation will be interrupted. " Has anyone faced this problem. I am working on ubuntu 9.1 and having magento 1.4. Any help would be highly appreciated. Cheers
