How does cross validation works for feature selection (using stepwise regression)?

I have used the MATLAB regression learner application to do some stepwise regression with a 10-fold cross validation for feature selection. But now I want to code it myself and I'm confused about the algorithm! So I divide my data into 10-folds and then train my model using 9-folds and test in on 1 remaining fold. I do it for 10 times. This gives me the performance of 10 linear regression models with different feature subsets. The regular way is to take the average of the 10 performance metrics (RMSE, MSE, R2,...) and decide which model performs the best. But in my case the model is the same and the features are different. So I'm confused how to choose the best subset. Should I just compare the 10 performance metrics and choose the subset with the highest performance?
