Interpreting the results for the glm() function?

Sorry if the question is elementary, I am a beginned both in R and in statistics. I am reading from An Introduction to Machine Learning with R . We are looking at a dataset called Sonar. It contains 61 variables; the first 60 are numerical, and the last one is an unordered factor with levels M and R, (meaning mine and rock). We want to create a model that predicts weather a certain observation is a rock or a mine: library("mlbench") data(Sonar) ## 60/40 split tr 0.5, "M", "R") From the last line, it seems clear that each entry of p is the probability that the corresponding observation is a mine. My Question: What, in the code, determines that the entries of p are the probabilities of mines, and not of rocks?
