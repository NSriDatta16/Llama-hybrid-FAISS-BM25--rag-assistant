How can I calculate confidence intervals of a probability obtained by my logistic regression model?

I have fit my own logistic model and I am using it to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes. I would like to know how I can obtain the confidence intervals of these probabilities. I am using scikit in python, but I am happy to know just the mathematical answer.
