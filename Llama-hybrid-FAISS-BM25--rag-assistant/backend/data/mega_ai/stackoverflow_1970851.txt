I believe with NHibernate it is encouraged to use transactions even when you you're only querying. Check this article http://nhprof.com/Learn/Alerts/DoNotUseImplicitTransactions . Also your EX_2 code might not hit the database depending on what type of primary key you're using. If you're using Identity key that autoincrement, NHibernate will hit the database and get a primary key, but if you using guid, guid.comb, or hilo, you won't hit the database at all. So your Get would be grabbing what NHibernate has cached in memory unless you do a commit changes and then clear the session so you know you got nothing in memory.
