Diffuse priors and noninformative priors are not necessarily the same: a very diffuse prior (like the (improper) infinite uniform distribution) could be quite "informative" on e.g. a variance. That being stated: your intent of using a diffuse prior that strongly influences the prior seems to be contradictive. I'm assuming you want to use a diffuse prior exactly for the purpose of empowering the data, no? The only "other" reason I see to use a vague prior is because you have little prior information - but then indeed you put all your bayesian hope in the data. In short: either you trust your prior information, and then you use whatever prior expresses this information, or you don't, in which case you use as noninformative a prior as possible. In the case where you have something like an "outdated" prior (e.g. a prior that comes from research from a long time ago, or in different circumstances), you can, however, make the prior more diffuse to express this. In some cases this can be done in a controlled manner (I believe this is the case for a conjugate prior) so you can add diffusion matching a set of "virtual observations", but most analytically expressed distributions have straightforward ways of increasing the variance. In any case, it is a matter of feeling and judgment how much diffusion to add, and it will definitely be worth your while to do a sensitivity analysis for this effect afterwards.
