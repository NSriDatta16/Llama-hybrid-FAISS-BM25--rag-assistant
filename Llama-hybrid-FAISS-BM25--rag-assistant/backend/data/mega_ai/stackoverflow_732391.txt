Provide a rough estimate and be really clear about that. Identify a strategy on how you will tackle the project. Particularly identify pieces of the system you can deliver as working intermediate releases. Pay special attention at the closest of these you would be able to release fully functional, and if possible take the rest out of scope (keep a list of these and anything that comes up, to be scheduled as a follow up project). Use short iterations. Consider/analyze how the intermediate releases fit in 2-6 week iterations. Take into account learnings this give you, and adjust the overall estimate. Go on with the first iteration, and apply what you learn about the assumptions you made. How off you are in the early iterations usually point to a problem in the estimates. Resist the temptation of considering the deviation in the estimates part of the initial overhead, as you will probably be delaying the point in time where you realize the estimates where off. Note that I do understand/agree the velocity of the project increases over time, but thinking about that tends to hide/delay the issues.
