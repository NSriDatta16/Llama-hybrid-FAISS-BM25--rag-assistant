This points to one of the few serious problems with the conventional statistics through null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). A much more meaningful approach in this case is to totally abandon NHST, and adopt the Bayesian framework. If you have some prior information available, just incorporate it into your model through prior distribution. Unfortunately most statistics consumers are simply too indoctrinated, obsessed and entrenched with the old school of thinking. See more discussion here .
