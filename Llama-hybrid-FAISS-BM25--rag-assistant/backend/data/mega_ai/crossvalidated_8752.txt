How to construct quadrats for point processes that differ greatly in frequency?

I want to perform quadrat count analysis on several point processes (or one marked point process), to then apply some dimensionality reduction techniques. The marks are not identically distributed, i.e., some marks are appearing quite often, and some are pretty rare. Thus, I cannot simply divide my 2D space in a regular grid, because the more frequent marks will "overwhelm" the lesser frequent ones, masking their appearance. Thus, I tried to build my grid such that each cell has at most N points in it (to do so, I simply divide each cell in four smaller (and equally sized) cells, recursively, until no cell has more than N points in it). What do you think of this "normalization" technique? Is there a standard way to do such things?
