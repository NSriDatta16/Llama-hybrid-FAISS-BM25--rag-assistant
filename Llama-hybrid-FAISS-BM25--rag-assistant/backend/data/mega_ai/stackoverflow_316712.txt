I start by calling the development environment macro that sets up the include guards (#ifdefs and/or #pragma once). Next I stub out the class name and any namespace it will be in, without adding any functionality at all. Then I create the unit test file for that class, and add the first test (usually a parameter constructor test). I just work from there, writing and refactoring the class as I think about what I really need from it. Things I tend to test specifically: const-correctness, implicit and explicit conversions, types of exceptions thrown, etc.
