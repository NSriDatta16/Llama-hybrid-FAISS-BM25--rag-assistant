In ASP MVC 3 you can use the [AllowHtml] attribute on individual fields/properties in your Model/ViewModel to turn off validation for just that field, which is pretty nice. I will add this attribute to certain fields in my model, and then use the excellent AntiXSS library (also available via NuGet) to sanitize the user input by calling the Sanitizer.GetSafeHtmlFragment(mymodel.Description) (where the "Description" property is a string property on my view model, that has the [AllowHtml] attribute applied)
