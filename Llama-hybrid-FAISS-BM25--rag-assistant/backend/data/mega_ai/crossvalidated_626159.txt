High Level Time Series Forecasting Question given a set of unknown data sets

I have this question regarding 4 data sets where one of the data sets is missing half of the data. The data is relatively correlated, but not perfectly. How may we construct a model to produce the fourth data sourceâ€™s missing data? Suppose this data is generally upward trending with seasonal cycles, as well as a large dip in 2020. As a side note, this is a purely theoretical question and I'm just curious how other's would approach such a problem. I'm not looking for some good library to use or any complex algorithm, but rather high level reasoning for how to create a good predictor. Thank you!
