The goal of PPCA is not to give better results than PCA, but to permit a broad range of future extensions and analysis. The paper states some of the advantages clearly in the introduction, ie/eg: "the definition of a likelihood measure enables a comparison with other probabilistic techniques, while facilitating statistical testing and permitting the application of Bayesian models". Bayesian models in particular are enjoying a huge renaissance lately, eg VAE, "auto-encoding variational Bayes", https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114 . Extension of PCA to be usable in variational frameworks and similar has the potential for another researcher to say 'Oh hey, what if I do ... ?'
