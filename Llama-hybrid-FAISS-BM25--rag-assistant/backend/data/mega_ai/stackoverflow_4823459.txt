I'm glad you asked! This is much easier than you'd think so don't be discouraged! ActionScript is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. First of all, let's define what we want. After reading your question I believe you would like to use your button something like this: So let's go over how to make that a reality. Now, I would highly suggest extending Button with ActionScript, but it is also possible to do in mxml: //MyCustomButton.mxml Then you can add the SkinPart s you need in a : So now when you make a skin you should include something like the original label, just with a different ID to reflect your new SkinPart: But wait! What text should our second label show?? Well, we will need to add another property that you can set for each individual instance of the button: Cool, so now we can set label2 when we use our button, but at this point it won't change the label's actual text property. We need to hook up our label2 to our secondLabelDisplay. We do this by calling invalidateProperties when the label2 changes and then change the label in commitProperties (which will be called because of the invalidateProperties() call): Lastly, you'll notice that if you change label2 again afte runtime, the label will show the change. But it won't show the change if you set an initial label2 like in our target usage. The Flex team made a special method just for this case, partAdded(). I won't go over too many details about it because there is already a good amount of literature on the subject. Finally, here's our finished, custom button awaiting a skin to put it to use: Best of luck!
