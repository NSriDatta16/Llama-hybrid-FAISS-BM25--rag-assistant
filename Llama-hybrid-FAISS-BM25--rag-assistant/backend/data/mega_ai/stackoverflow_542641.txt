I use Log4Net. It is already integrated in with various other libraries I use (NHibernate) so it makes a lot of sense. I have an Introduction to Log4Net if you want to read more. http://elegantcode.com/2007/12/07/getting-started-with-log4net/ Also, like Will said about LAB, it can be difficult to configure (done via xml config files), but Log4net is very stable. Also, you can configure Log4Net to do almost anything you want (text files, rolling text files, log to database, Event Viewer, etc)
