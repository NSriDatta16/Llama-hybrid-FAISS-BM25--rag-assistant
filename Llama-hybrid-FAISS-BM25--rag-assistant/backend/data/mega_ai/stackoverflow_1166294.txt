In Subversion, making a branch is simply making a copy of a hierarchy of directories. Therefore, you can branch a subset, but only if that subset can be defined by a hierarchy of directories. Can I branch file0 so changes committed to file0 will update something like myrepos/branches/a-branch/file0 but all the other files in my working copy will simply be from the trunk? To answer this question: No, you can't branch a single file. However, what I think you want to do instead is to make a branch and work on file0 there. As you make changes to trunk files, you simply merge them into your branch where you're working on file0 . In this way, you'll always have the latest information from trunk , which will let you test the file0 changes independently of trunk. Then you can use svn switch to move your "file lens" between the trunk and the branch (but beware, Eclipse may complain about such shenanigans).
