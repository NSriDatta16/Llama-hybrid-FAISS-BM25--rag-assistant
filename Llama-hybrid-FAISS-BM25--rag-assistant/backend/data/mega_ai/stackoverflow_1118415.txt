I have two recommendations for you. Dont use OSCommerce. Dont use XTCommerce which is based on OSCommerce To be more specific NEVER EVER use oscommerce for ANY project you want to extend at all. If you run the project 100% out-of-box and need some payment extension that nobody features consider it for two seconds but then better DONT. OSCommerce features code from 2001. OSCommerce has only one coding pattern which is FIXHACKCOPYQUICKPASTEHERENOW. Its the negation of everything you think to know from software development and project mangement. If you use OSCommerce and try to extend it your project will need twice as long and you will start hating webdevelopment. And yes i know it sounds like, but i am not kidding. Been there, done that. If anybody tells you to use oscommerce - e.g. for all the existing extentions that are out there - stand up and leave the room. Extra Tipps: Magento IS SLOW. http://www.prestashop.com/ - In the OSS world Prestashop has some popularity. http://www.interspire.com/shoppingcart/ has some reputation but is not OSS.
