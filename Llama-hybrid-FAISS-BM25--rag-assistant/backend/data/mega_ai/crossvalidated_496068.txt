The non i.i.d. problem resulted from active learning query strategy

We usually assume the i.i.d. assumption in machine learning problems, but in active learning, the labeled examples acquired by querying oracle are clearly not i.i.d. I want to know will it be better to reweight the labeled examples to make them mimic the target distribution and retrain a model with the reweighted data? Has anyone done that before or why not?
