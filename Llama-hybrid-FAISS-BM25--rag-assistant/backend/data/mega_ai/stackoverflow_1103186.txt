I haven't used Silverlight, but this sounds like normal debugging behaviour. When debugging C# apps in VS, when you reach an unhandled exception the debugger stops on that line. Your choices are: Implement some exception handling (try/catch). Not sure if this feature is available yet with Silverlight, but can you drag the arrow that points to the currently executing line to a different line?
