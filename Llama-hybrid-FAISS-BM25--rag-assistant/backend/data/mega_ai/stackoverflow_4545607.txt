there is any way so i can play video on the remote browser without installing any software Nope, there isn't. You will always need video playing capability on the client side. (Well, short of turning the videos into Animated GIFs, but that is madness.) The best supported Video embedding methods are Flash Video and HTML 5 Video. See this SO question for detailed information on the two.
