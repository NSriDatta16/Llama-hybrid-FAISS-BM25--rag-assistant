This looks like a typical regression problem - given one variable (here: $MAX$) you want to predict the other (here: $N$). As there are only two dimensions, it is possible to visualize this data on a scatter plot, so you may notice a pattern. The easiest way to go is to start with linear regression ; perhaps you need to take logarithm of variables (you need to test it). If you only care if $N \leq 10$, then use logistic regression . That way you will get estimation of probability that $N \leq 10$, given $MAX$. There are myriad of other ways to do it, but without more information about your data it's hard to advise anything more specific. But the easiest step forward is to play with variable scaling - especially Box-Cox transformation .
