Caveat The OP presents an interesting experiment that produced (up to) 200x20 = 4000 measurements. It's best to analyze the data at the student level, not the 20 averages per question, using for example spline regression as the averages don't follow a simple trend and the variances don't look constant either. That being said, the actual question is how to summarize the trend in the averages and what that trend is. As @whuber illustrates, a plot is a great way to present 20 numbers (at least in two dimensions). If the numbers follow a pattern, this pattern can be highlighted with a judicious use of color and superimposing a line or a curve to emphasize the apparent relationship between the x and y variables. These are powerful tools because the human visual system is very strong at seeing patterns. Sometimes however the additional graphical elements may suggest a relationship that's not strongly supported by the data. I, for example, see a negative correlation between question order and time to answer only for questions 1 to 10. For questions 11 to 20, I see a leveling-off of average time to answer and an increase in variance (except for question 18). Qualitatively, the data is consistent with both the "constantly negative" relationship" and "first-half negative, second-half level" relationship between question and time. To demonstrate I plot the data twice, superimposing the two relationship patterns in each plot. I also add some commentary in the title, deliberately provoking, to stress the point I want to make with the functional relationship, in front of my imaginary audience. [For completeness, I include my "data" below.] Neither alternative shown below is convincing (though the constant trend is less un convincing?) It's better to fit a model that doesn't make strong assumptions about the relationship between question order and time to the full dataset of obseverations without averaging first . Perhaps spline regression, as recommended in Regression Modeling Strategies , is a place to start. See for example here . And the alternative: My fake data. I took the average response time from the original plot by eye. I assume time is measured in seconds because the total time is about 400 units and 400 minutes of math is a lot. math
