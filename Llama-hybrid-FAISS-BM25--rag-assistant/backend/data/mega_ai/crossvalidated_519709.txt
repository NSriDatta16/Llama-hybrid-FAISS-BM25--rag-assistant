I would get the mean delta for B-A, subtract off 0.02, and called this $\mu_{obs}$ . Then during $B=1000$ iterations, get the mean delta of B-A with column A shuffled (permuted), and call this $\mu^{(b)}$ . The p-value will be equal to the number of times $\mu^{(b)}$ is greater than $\mu_{obs}$ , divided by $B$ . You know that when you shuffle column A and then take the difference between B and A, that average will probably be zero. You also know that B-A for the observed data (unshuffled), $\mu_{obs}$ , may be 0.02 or more. Thus you have to subtract off the 0.02, and this way you will be testing that the two "zero means" means are significantly different. See a recent post on permutation testing that I provided here .
