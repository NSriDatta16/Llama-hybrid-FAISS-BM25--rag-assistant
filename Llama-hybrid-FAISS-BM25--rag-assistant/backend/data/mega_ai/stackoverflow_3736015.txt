This approach strikes me as contrary to the intent of a dictionary. A dictionary is made up of hash keys which have had values associated with them. The benefit of this structure is that it provides very fast lookups (on the order of O(1)). By searching through the keys, you're negating that benefit. I would suggest reorganizing your dictionary. dict1 = {"EMP$$": {"1": 1, "2": 2, "3": 3} } Then, finding "EMP$$" is as simple as if "EMP$$" in dict1: #etc...
