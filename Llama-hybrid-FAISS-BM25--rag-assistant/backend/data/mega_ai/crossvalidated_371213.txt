Cluster analysis of variables or observations?

I'm very new to cluster analysis. In papers such as Richette et al. 1 (which tries to see which concomitant diseases cluster together), authors first cluster the variables and then the observations (i.e., patients). (Bevis et al. 2 , did the same thing.) They used SAS's PROC VARCLUS and factor analysis (others have used PCA) for clustering variables , and cluster analysis for the patients. I don't understand why they would (need to) do both? In the first paper, all their discussion centered on the latter. Richette P, Clerson P, PÃ©rissin L, et al. Revisiting comorbidities in gout: a cluster analysis . Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 2015;74:142-147. Bevis, et al. (2018). Comorbidity clusters in people with gout: an observational cohort study with linked medical record review . Rheumatology (Oxford). 57(8): 1358-1363.
