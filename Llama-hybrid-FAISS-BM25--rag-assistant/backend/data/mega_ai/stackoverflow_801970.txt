Something about the information you supplied doesn't add up - if you were really generating around 20G/min of archive logs, then you would be switching your 100M log files at least 200 times per minute - not the 3 times/minute worst case that you mentioned. This also isn't consistent with your description of "... mostly SELECT's". In the real world, I wouldn't worry about log switches every 5-10 minutes on average. With this much redo, none of the init parameters are coming into play for switching - it is happening because of the online redo logs filling up. In this case, the only way to control the switching rate is to resize the logs, e.g. doubling the log size will reduce the switching frequency by half.
