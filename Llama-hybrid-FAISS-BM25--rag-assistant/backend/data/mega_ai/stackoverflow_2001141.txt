Why doesn't g++ link with the dynamic library I create?

I've been trying to make some applications which all rely on the same library, and dynamic libraries were my first thought: So I began writing the "Library": /* ThinFS.h */ class FileSystem { public: static void create_container(string file_name); //Creates a new container }; /* ThinFS.cpp */ #include "ThinFS.h" void FileSystem::create_container(string file_name) { cout I then compile the "Library" g++ -shared -fPIC FileSystem.cpp -o ThinFS.o I then quickly wrote a file that uses the Library: #include "ThinFS.h" int main() { FileSystem::create_container("foo"); return (42); } I then tried to compile that with g++ main.cpp -L. -lThinFS But it won't compile with the following error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lThinFS collect2: ld returned 1 exit status I think I'm missing something very obvious, please help me :)
