Independence vs Autocorrelation

In Section 3.2 of R. S. Tsay, Analysis of Financial Time Series , I read: The basic idea behind volatility study is that the series { r_t } is either serially uncorrelated or with minor lower order serial correlations, but it is a dependent series. and a little further: ...it seems that the returns are indeed serially uncorrelated, but dependent. I'm very confused by these statements, because I thought that serial correlation (autocorrelation) and dependence were basically the same thing. Here , for instance, the coin tossing game is given as an example of independence, as a series where each throw has no memory of the previous throws. Therefore, it seems to me that instead a not independent variable should be serially correlated. Can you give me an example of a time series that is not serially correlated but dependent, and another one that is serially correlated but independent? Is that possible? Or perhaps am I wrongly assuming that causation implies correlation?
