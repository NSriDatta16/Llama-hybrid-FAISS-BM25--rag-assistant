Finding N Distinct RGB Colors

I'm trying to graphically display a graph of N lines and I'm trying to find a way to dynamically assign distinct colors based on how many lines I have. The values in RGB range from 0 to 1. I can't use white because the background is white. I found it easy for N r=(h&0x4)/4; g=(h&0x2)/2; b=h&0x1; This gives me black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, yellow. But after that it will use white and then loop. Does anybody know a good way to assign RGB values for an index? I also have an opacity value to play with.
