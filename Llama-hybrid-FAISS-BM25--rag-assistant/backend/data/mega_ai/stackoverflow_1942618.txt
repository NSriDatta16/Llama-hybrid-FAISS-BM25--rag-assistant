How do I set the "format" used for drag'n'drop on a list control?

I'm dragging from a TileList to a custom component. I want to know what is being dragged before I accept it. How do I set the "format" that is used for "event.dragSource.formats" in the DragEvent? Edit for clarification: When you set "dragEnabled=true" on the TileList, it takes care of the drag source stuff, but it uses "items" as the format for the DragEvent. I'm looking for a way to have the TileList use the correct format.
