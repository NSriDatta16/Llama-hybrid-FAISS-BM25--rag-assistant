Getting a "summary" of a webpage

I have something of a a hairy problem, I'd like to generate a couple of paragraphs of "description" of a given url, normally the start of an article. The Meta description field is one way to go but it isn't always good or set properly. It's fair to say it's a bit problematic to accomplish this from the screenscraped HTML. I had a general idea that perhaps one could scan the HTML for the first "appropriate" segment but it's hard to say what that is, perhaps something like the first paragraph containing a certain amount of text... Anyone have any good ideas? :) It doesn't have to be foolproof
