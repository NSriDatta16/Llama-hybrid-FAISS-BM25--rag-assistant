Counterfactual formal causal reasoning of the form motivated by Pearl is ill-suited to the analysis of complex dynamic causal systems (i.e. networks in which every variable is either directly or indirectly the cause of every variable at some future time). 1 Disclaimer 1: I am a fan of Pearl's framework, and had the privilege of being taught counterfactual formal causal inference by two of his early exponents (Hernán and Robins). Disclaimer 2: Levins was my mentor when I was a doctoral student, and I have published using his methods. The counterfactual theory of causality, and the counterfactual formal causal inference/structural causal modeling built atop of it, are profoundly useful for reasoning through both the strengths and weaknesses of causal inference based on specific combinations of study design and analyses. However, to my mind, structural causal models built out of the counterfactual theory is a theory of terminal causal narratives : $A$ , and $L$ , and $U$ , (and maybe $V$ or $E$ ) happened, and then they caused $\pmb{Y}$ to happen (or not) . However, the counterfactual theory of causality does not appear to describe or infer the behavior of complex causal systems, and is thus not a theory of cyclic causal narratives . I would raise as a counterexample of a formal causal reasoning system Levins ' qualitative loop analysis , which, like Pearl's work with DAGs also hearkens back to Wright 's path analysis , but employs signed digraphs in a different causal formalism (in fact, one obvious distinction is that qualitative loop analysis employs signed digraphs which are cyclic , not acyclic), to describe the behavior of such causal systems under different kinds of perturbation. The questions posed and answered by Levins' method (and subsequent elaborations on it ) include: How does the level of each variable in a complex system respond to press perturbation at one or more variables in the system? How does the life expectancy / turnover of each variable in a complex system respond to press perturbation at one or more variables in the system? Does variance induced by system perturbation (at specific variables) tend to diffuse across the system, or sink into very few variables in the system? Where do (Lyapunov) stability and instability emerge in the system? Where does system behavior depend on either ontological or epistemic uncertainty regarding the existence or magnitude of specific direct causal relationships comprising the system? What are the signs of expected bivariate correlations (or correspondences) between any variable pairs given a press perturbation at one or more variables in the system? (Because most of Levins' loop analysis is a purely deductive method—although, see Dambacher's extension—only the bolded question is directly statistical.) These questions are different questions than the ones posed and answered in the counterfactual formal causal inference championed by Pearl. I have even had difficulty finding examples of counterfactual formal causal inference applied in the context of stochastic processes and autoregressive models (e.g., dynamic models including $Y_{t}$ as a function of $Y_{ ), although this may be more due to my lack of familiarity with the intersections of Bayesian probabilistic causal graphs and Pearl's work, than due to a specific deficiency in the latter. Aside: Sugihara's empirical dynamic modeling (see tutorial by Chaing, et al.) elaboration on state space reconstructions, likewise provides an alternative perspective to counterfactual formal causal reasoning, also from the world of complex causal systems. Video of Sugihara and friends blowing your mind and mine by recovering the topology of 3D complex system from a 1D time series. 1 A point similar to something Spirtes pointed out quite a while ago.
