Millikin teaches in the Department of Kinetic Imaging at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts. Notable artworks Millikin's art often includes self-portraits as well as portraits of celebrities and political figures. His work often incorporates mixed media and found objects, such as packages of candy, paper currency, and spiders. Millikin's works range from those made almost completely of text (including calligraphy, typography, anagrams, ambigrams, free verse, and cut-up technique poetry) to those that are optical illusions or completely abstract. The Dance of the Nain Rouge: A 2023 documentary film about the Detroit folklore legend of the Nain Rouge (French for "red dwarf"). The film is described by film festivals as "an experimental decolonial Detroit demonology deepfake dream dance documentary." Millikin created custom AI systems for the film's visuals, audio, and script. The visuals are based on historical photos including factory workers and spiritualists, microscope photos of red blood cells, and telescope photos of red dwarf stars. The audio is based on sounds including recordings of human organs and outer space radio waves. The script is based on folk tales of the Nain Rouge and other "red" themed books like the gothic horrorThe Masque of the Red Death, the grimoire Le Dragon Rouge, and the Marxist Das Kapital. The film has been exhibited by Boston Cyber Arts, the Peale Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, the Redford Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, and in other exhibitions including in Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. It was awarded the "Best Innovative Technologies Award" ("Premio Migliori Tecnologie Innovative") at the 2024 Pisa Robot Film Festival in Italy and "Best Animation Film" at the 2024 Absurd Film Festival in Italy. Millikin has been creating work based on the Nain Rouge since the early 2000s. Cyborgs for Rebellion: A 2022 art installation of outdoor video projections in the woods, projecting on the trees of Bryan Park in Richmond, Virginia, where the slave uprising Gabriel’s Rebellion was planned in 1800. The video system projects “an infinitely rotating series of poetry reading, three dimensional portraits” created with artificial intelligence and 3D modeling. The portraits were created with an AI system Millikin created based on "slave rebellion instigators" like Gabriel (“Prosser”), Nat Turner, and John Brown, along with "robots from America’s most critically acclaimed and top-grossing science fiction films" including Metropolis, Blade Runner, and The Terminator.
