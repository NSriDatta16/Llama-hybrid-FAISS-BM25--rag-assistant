How do I determine the arguments (that is, Data, Extras, etc.) to send to an Intent? If it is not documented, do not use it. The code you show is very fragile and may stop working with any new Android release. It might even fail on certain devices, if a device manufacturer decides (for whatever strange reason) to replace that portion of the Settings application.
