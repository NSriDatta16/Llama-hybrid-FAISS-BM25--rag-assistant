How can I calculate power for a conditional logistic regression?

A client wants to perform a 1:1 matched case control study, matching on 3 risk factors, and analyze results using conditional logistic regression. A sample size calculation is required in order to plan the study. How can I estimate the sample size? Some thoughts: I could use sample size estimates for regular logistic regression since we are not matching on the exposure of interest. Conditional logistic regression is a form of Cox regression, so in principle, I suppose I could use sample size estimates for Cox regression If neither of the above work, and there is no principled way to compute sample size, I can just simulate the power curve.
