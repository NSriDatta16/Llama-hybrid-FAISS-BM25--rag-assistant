Predict Seasonal Variations

I am developing an application related to pharmaceutical industry. Certain items are sold in significantly higher quantities during specific periods of the year. For example, here in my country, Mebendazole is more in demand during the school vacations. I am in the process of automatically predicting the reorder quantities of items for a pharmaceutical logistics application. I want to analyse the past data, for example, during the last five years and to know whether there is a significant increase or decrease in the demand during, for example, the next two weeks than the average. If it is significant, I want to calculate the percentage above or below the current years average to decide on reorder quantity. What are the statistical methods available to achieve these two tasks? Thanks in advance
