Let $X \sim \mathcal{Multinom}(n,p_1,\dotsc,p_k)$ and we want to find the index corresponding to the largest probability $p_i$ , that is, finding $\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{arg\,max} j=\argmax_i p_i$ . As in the answer by @bdeonovic, the obvious estimator is $\hat{j}=\argmax_i X_i/n$ , but we could also take the question as asking about additional inference, that is, some measure of uncertainty in that estimate. One traditional solution is called subset selection , and many papers is published on this problem, see this list . I will use some definitions from this 1967 paper by S S Gupta , he published a lot on subset selection problems! The idea is to select a subset of indices such that the probability of that subset containing $j$ is at least some prespecified probability $P^*$ , often chosen as $P^*=0.95$ . So this is some kind of analogy with a confidence interval. The rule Gupta proposes is to select all indices $i$ such that $$ X_i \ge X_{\text{max}}-D$$ where $D$ is an integer chosen such that the $P^*$ -condition is fulfilled. For that the coverage probability must be calculated for the full parameter space, and then the minimum found. He argues by numerical experiments that the worst configuration is $p=(1/k, \dotsc, 1/k)$ . Then the paper gives some tables. Gupta's paper is full frequentist, but a Bayesian solution is simple to implement. Simulate from the posterior many times, find the index with maximum estimated probability, and then include in the subset enough of the indices occurring most often to reach 95%.
