Dynamic File Path in Django

I'm trying to generate dynamic file paths in django. I want to make a file system like this: -- user_12 --- photo_1 --- photo_2 --- user_ 13 ---- photo_1 I found a related question : Django Custom image upload field with dynamic path Here, they say we can change the upload_to path and leads to https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/files/ doc. In the documentation, there is an example : from django.db import models from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage fs = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/photos') class Car(models.Model): ... photo = models.ImageField(storage=fs) But, still this is not dynamic, I want to give Car id to the image name, and I cant assign the id before Car definition completed. So how can I create a path with car ID ??
