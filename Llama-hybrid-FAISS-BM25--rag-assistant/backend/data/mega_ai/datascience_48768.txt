In order to "tap" intermediate layers of an existing model you could do the following: # get your feature layer cnn_model = load_model('weights/pre-trained_CNN.hdf5') feature_layer = cnn_model.get_layer('fc7') # stack your LSTM and other layers below, e.g.: lstm_layer = TimeDistributed(LSTM(...), input_shape = ...)(feature_layer) output = Dense(...)(lstm_layer) # create a combined model model = Model(inputs = cnn_model.input, outputs = [output])
