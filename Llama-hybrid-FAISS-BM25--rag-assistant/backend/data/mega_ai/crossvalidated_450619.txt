One way would be to compute standardized coefficients, standardizing both by the standard deviation of the corresponding predictor and the standard deviation of $y^*$ , the latent continuous variable underlying the binary outcome. Standardized coefficients do not have the same interpretation as partial correlations , but they are a scale-free way of describing the relationship between a predictor and the outcome conditional on the other covariates. Another method would be to use one of the pseudo- $R^2$ measures available for logistic regression and compute the change in the pseudo- $R^2$ corresponding to removing each predictor from the full model while keeping other predictors in the model, which is how the squared semi-partial correlation is computed in linear regression. McKelvey & Zavoina's $R^2$ is a nice choice because it also relies on the continuous latent variable $y^*$ .
