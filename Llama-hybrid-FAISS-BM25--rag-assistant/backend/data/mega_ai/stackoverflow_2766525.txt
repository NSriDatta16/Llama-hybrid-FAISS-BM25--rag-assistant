dragging toolbars

I created in my app 2 toolbars. Because I wanted to be able to drag them, I put both TToolBar components inside a TControlBar. I this case I can move them, but I want to be able to drag them like in MS Office (drag a toolbar from top and put it left, right or at bottom of the window and save it's position).... Can anyone help me out?
