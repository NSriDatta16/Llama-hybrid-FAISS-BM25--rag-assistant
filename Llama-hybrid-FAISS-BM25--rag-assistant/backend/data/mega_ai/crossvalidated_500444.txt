Evaluating rate of change in repeated measure on an outcome

Here is a brief description of my problem set up. Retrospective observational cohort of people seen in the ED with pneumonia. Index day or start time is day disease diagnosed. Independent variable is a severity score on CXR (which can be taken multiple times at irregular intervals). Outcome variables are ICU admission and inpatient mortality. One example question of interest would be whether a high rate of change in your CXR severity score between the first (defined as CXR taken near index start) and second CXR can discriminate between people who will need ICU level care in the next 2-3 days. Potential approaches? repeated measures ANOVA, mixed effect logistic regression, or cox regression with mixed effects (coxme package in R)? I'm very new to mixed effect modeling though and have a few questions: Any help or resources on better understanding how the output of these methods can be interpreted in plain English? I'm intrigued by the coxme approach, but am confused how you would deal with immortality bias when evaluating the change in a repeated measure of an independent variable (i.e. you have to live long enough to reach the second measure) Am I overthinking this? A simpler method (for me) would be to use multivariate logistic regression with binary outcome (ICU admission or death within a specified time frame) and include "first xray severity score" and "change in severity score on next xray" as separate variables. Have a feeling there are several limitations to this method though. Any advice on which method and where to focus my energy to learn more is greatly appreciated!
