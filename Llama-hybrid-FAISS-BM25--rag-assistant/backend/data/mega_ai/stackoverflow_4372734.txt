I've found XCode 4 to be stable enough for daily work as of the DP5 release, and Apple is actually encouraging this now. When (and you will) you run across things that don't work, or XCode crashes, just switch back to XCode 3.2 and work past the issue. The project file format is compatible so this isn't an issue at all. Overall, XCode 4 is shaping up to be an awesome tool.
