I once had this kind of problem, the delay between requests was about 2-5 seconds. The cause was google adsense. It somehow makes another request from it's own server for no reason to the same page. To verify it, just store every requests IP and the user agent, if IP's (user agents too) are different, then you know the cause. Solution? Give the user some kind of a token before visiting next page - if the token doesn't match on the next request - it's not the same user. Something like a XSRF protection :)
