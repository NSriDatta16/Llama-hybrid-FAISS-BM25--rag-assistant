The problem with linear regression is that you are modelling E(Y/X) directly, so predicted values in theory can be 1. With logistic regression you are using a link function that prevent values to fall outside the range of (0;1). You need your response to be either binary or ordinal, so you should create levels, I suggest using the quantiles of that percent and adjust a cumulative logistic regression. If you are only interested in two groups of values for the percentage - let's say 75%, then use the logistic regression for binary outcomes. An example of logistic regression with ordinal data can be followed here . For a binary outcome, see this one .
