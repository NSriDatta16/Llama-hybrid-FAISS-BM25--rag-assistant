Understanding stratified cross-validation

I read in Wikipedia : In stratified k-fold cross-validation , the folds are selected so that the mean response value is approximately equal in all the folds. In the case of a dichotomous classification, this means that each fold contains roughly the same proportions of the two types of class labels. Say we are using CV for estimating the performance of a predictor or estimator. What would mean response value (MRV) mean in this context? Just the average value of the predictor / estimator? In what scenarios would "achieving approximately the same MRV" in all folds be actually important ? In other words, what are the consequences of not doing so?
