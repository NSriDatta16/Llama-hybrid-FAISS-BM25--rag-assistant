It's usually wrong (and way too much work) to use join in LINQ to SQL . Instead, use the navigation/association properties L2S generates for you: var coverage = from insuranceCoverage in context.tblPersonInsuranceCoverages where insuranceCoverage.PersonID == personID select new { insuranceCoverage.PersonInsuranceCoverageID, insuranceCoverage.EffectiveDate, insuranceCoverage.ExpirationDate, insuranceCoverage.Priority, CoverageCategory = insuranceCoverage.insuranceCompany.tblAdminInsuranceCompanyType.TypeName, insuranceCoverage.insuranceCompany.tblBusiness.BusinessName, TypeName = insuranceCoverage.InsuranceTypeID, Address = insuranceCoverage.insuranceCompany.Addresses .Where(a => a.AddressTypeID == 'b') .FirstOrDefault() };
