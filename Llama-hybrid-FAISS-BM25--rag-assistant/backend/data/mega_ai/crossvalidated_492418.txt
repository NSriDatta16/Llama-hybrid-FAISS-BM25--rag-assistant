ROC for testing goodness of fit

I'm interested in using ROC to test for goodness of fit for binary models such as logistic regression. I'm a bit confused by the literature where it is mostly just explained as a valid technique to test goodness of fit, and then how to calculate sensitivities, specificities etc. I'm more interested in the workflow of using ROC to test goodness of fit. Say I have a multiple logistic regression model with one dependent y and 10 independent x1, x2...x10. Where do I go from here? Do I split the data up and then compare ROC between them or? I'm just a bit confused on the next step.
