SQL Server 2005 does support the DATETIME datatype, which also includes time. To store only the time, you can use the CONVERT statement: SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME, '11:22:33') It's not optimal, because the date part is not used, but still takes up storage space. But then again, downgrading a database to a previous version never is optimal.
