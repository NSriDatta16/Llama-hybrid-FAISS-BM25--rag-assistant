# of positive to # of negative instances

I'm developing a spam detection classifier (the exact classification algorithm has not been chosen , I'll mostly go with CNN or NN). I'm fetching 20,000 tweets using Tweet4J and I'm a bit confused with the data collection. How many +ve tweets (spam) should I have vs -ve (non-spam)? I'm thinking to have 50% positive and 50% negative however, in real world spam tweets are way fewer than non-spam. Should training data be of similar distribution to the real world data (testing)?
