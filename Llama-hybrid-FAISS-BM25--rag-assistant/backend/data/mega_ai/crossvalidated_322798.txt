how to detect the exact size of an object in an image using machine learning?

I have a problem where I get an image from an underwater camera. The image is quite large compared to the objects shown so that it contains has mostly background (seafloor). Objects in the image are for instance corals or sponges. In the image I would like to detect the exact size (maybe in #pixels or some other measure) of one class of objects, lets say a coral across a sequence of images. Which approach should I take here? I know there are a lot of tool out there and I would be grateful for any advice on where to start and what to try as I have mostly worked with tabular data instead of images. Does deep learning with cnn work best here? Thanks a lot for your help!
