Firefox 3.6 does not have a User Agent stylesheet that recognizes the header elements as block level elements, so as with all unknown elements it is displayed as an inline element. Adding in this line should do the trick: display: block; Make sure that you use a HTML5 reset so that these elements display correctly for older browsers that do not recognize these new elements as block level elements, like: article, aside, figure, footer, header, hgroup, nav, section { display:block; }
