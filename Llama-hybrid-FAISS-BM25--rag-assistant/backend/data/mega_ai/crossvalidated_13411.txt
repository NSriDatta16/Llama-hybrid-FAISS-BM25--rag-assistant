Do non-significant correlates of a DV, which is significant, suggest anything about the effect of that DV?

Let's assume one has an analysis in which there are multiple correlated DVs (average correlation .46) being examined in separate univariate analyses (e.g. t-tests; insufficient df and frustration tolerance to restructure the data fro a MANOVA) in relation to a single IV. All except one of these DVs is not significantly affected by an IV manipulation. I was thinking that in general, dependence between DVs would tend to globally trend analyses to be significant or non-significant. However, when a DV with a legitimate effect is correlated with a variable which has no effect, wouldn't that correlation represent an association between them which is a source of error variance in the DV with the legitimate effect? Thus, if anything, the presence of significance in a DV associated with non-significant DVs should be taken as a sign of a true effect on that DV? In short: What, if anything, do the non-significant tests tells us about the one that is significant? Is there a relationship between this question and the notion of suppressor variables in regression?
