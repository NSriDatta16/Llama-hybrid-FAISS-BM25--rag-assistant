Your first quote is not correct, so applying the total probability law as you started yields: $$\begin{align}P(X_2 = j | X_0 = i) &= \sum _{k \in S}P(X_2 = j | X_1 = k, X_0 = i) P (X_1 = k | X_0 = i)\\&=\sum_{k\in S} P(X_2=j|X_1=k)P(X_1=k|X_0=i)\\&=\sum_{k\in S} p_{ik}p_{kj}\end{align}$$ This corresponds to matrix multiplication, so you might be confusing $p_{ij}^2$ with $(P^2)_{ij}$ , that is the $ij$ -th entry of the squared transition matrix. P.S. Assuming first order Markov chains as usual.
