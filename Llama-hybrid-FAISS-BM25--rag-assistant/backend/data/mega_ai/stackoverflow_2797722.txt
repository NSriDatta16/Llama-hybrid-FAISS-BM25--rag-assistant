Silverlight 4 does support the dragging and dropping of files from the file system to any UIElement . See this blog However whether this will work with drags initiatedin Outlook I don't know. I suggest you get the sample from this blog and build a little test app so see if you can drag the attachments. Of course you've still got the work to decode TIFF into a bitmap that Silverlight can use.
