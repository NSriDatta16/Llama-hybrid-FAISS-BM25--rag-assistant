One possibility to do it is with something similar to the Builder design pattern: For every strategy type you should have a corresponding builder (one or more). The builder does not work as a normal builder receiving all init params as method arguments; Instead, it should block until the relevant input is received. Some builders will display a Swing dialog and wait, others will print to the console and wait for inputs, others can read from a file, etc. After a builder receives all inputs, it can create the strategy instance and return it. This way you decouple the data retrieval logic from the strategy itself. Another benefit is that you can have a generic interface of all builders, so once you choose a specific builder you can manipulate it with the same piece of code.
