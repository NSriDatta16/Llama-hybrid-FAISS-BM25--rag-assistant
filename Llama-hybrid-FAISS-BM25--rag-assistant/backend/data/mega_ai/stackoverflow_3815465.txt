How do I copy Data from a excel in to word and keep its formatting

I have been trying to copy text from excel in to word, and retain the bold formatting on the text, but not the cell. When I try manually copy and paste over a cell the text is copied but not the cell itself. When I try repeat this using vb (as shown below) the cell is also copied over With wrdDoc .Content.Font.Name = "Times New Roman" .Content.Font.Size = 11 .Content.InsertParagraphAfter .Content.InsertParagraphAfter With Worksheets("Sheet1") Cells(1, 1).Select Cells(1, 1).Copy End With .Content.InsertAfter "AddTableHere" .Content.Find.Execute FindText:="AddTableHere", ReplaceWith:="^c" End With Has anyone any suggestions on how I could do this? Thanks
