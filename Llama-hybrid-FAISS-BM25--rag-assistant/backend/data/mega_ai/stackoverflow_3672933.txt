SQLite - inserting a string with newlines into database from csv file

All, I am trying to inject a long text entry into a SQLite database, in a TEXT field. This text has new lines in it (i.e. it spans multiple paragraphs). I can get the new lines to show up if I do the INSERT manually: INSERT INTO "LOGENTRY" VALUES(5,40,'PLACE','line1 line2 line4 ',1283990533315,'4A','TEXT','',NULL); but if I have the equivalent text in a CSV file and attempt to .import it into the table, I get an error that it's expecting more columns than exist (as soon as the new line is encountered, the program assumes it's the end of the input and thus it's missing columns). Is this possible? Or is the only way to manually do each INSERT?
