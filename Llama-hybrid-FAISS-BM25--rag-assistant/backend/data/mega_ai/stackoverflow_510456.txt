The Rich Text box from .NET is extremely buggy. In RTF, the way a table is defined is actually quite different from what you could expect if you are used to HTML. HTML: Mycell In RTF, a table is simply a series of paragraphs with control words defining rows, cells, borders. There is no group tag for the start/end of a table. RTF: \trowd\trgraph \cellx1000 Mycell \cell\row\pard\par If you want to add a paragraph inside a cell, you use \par and the control \intbl (in table) to indicate the paragraph is inside the table. .NET RTB can handle only a very small subset of RTF control words and doesn't support the vast majority of available commands. By the looks of things, \intbl is part of the long long list of control words it doesn't support, and if it actually parses \par at that point, the display is trashed. Unfortunately, I don't have a solution for that but I hope the small explanation above helps you make some sense of the problem. Don't put too much faith on my RTF sample. It works, but it's absolutely bare-bones. You can download the RTF specifications from Microsoft's website: Word 2007 RTF specs .
