For each of the transitions, you are asking how the combinations of temperature and species influence the probability of moving to the next stage. Binomial regression can evaluate how variables are associated with the probability of an event. There are several flavors of binomial regression, with logistic regression the usual choice. This UCLA web page shows how to implement that in R. A form you might use for the data you display would be: yourModel That uses the actual numbers of successes and failures in each situation as the outcomes. It's important to keep track of the numbers, as the reliability of an estimated proportion increases with the number of observations. The model evaluates the associations of Temperature , Species , and their combination (an interaction term) with the log-odds of success. It turns out that the test of overall significance of that model is closely related to what you would get with a chi-square test on a multi-dimensional contingency table, but the regression gives you the information needed to explore the model predictions in detail. Regression also allows you to evaluate continuous predictors--for example, if you wanted to model Temperature as continuous rather than as as a factor. As these are successive transitions to higher states of development, you might consider ordinal logistic regression if you started with a certain number of eggs in each condition and kept track of how many got to each successive stage. That might require some reformatting of your data, but it might be more efficient if you think that the combined effects of Temperature and Species are similar for each successive transition. You then can use post-modeling tools like those in the R emmeans package to examine specific combinations of Temperature and Species and to express results in terms of probabilities instead of in the log-odds scale used in logistic regression.
