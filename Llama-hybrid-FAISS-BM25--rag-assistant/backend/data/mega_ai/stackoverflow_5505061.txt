dynamic_cast does not perform any run-time checking when you use it for upcasts or identity-casts (casts to the same type). For such casts dynamic_cast behaves exactly the same as an ordinary static_cast . No difference whatsoever. The page you linked does not mention that, i.e. is not even a remotely complete specification of dynamic_cast , which makes it pretty useless. C++ provides no means to determine whether a given pointer is actually a valid pointer to a given type. So, you are out of luck there. Implement your own checking method.
