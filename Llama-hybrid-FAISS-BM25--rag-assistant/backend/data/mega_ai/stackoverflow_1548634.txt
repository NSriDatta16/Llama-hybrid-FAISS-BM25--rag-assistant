I figured it out. Anthony and Robert pointed me in the right direction. I realized that while the error message told me what was wrong, it seemed misleading to me. It would give me the error above when my parameter wasn't declared correctly. The main issue was the constants didn't exist somehow. By putting their integer values, I was able to get it to work. I think I had realized this at first, which is why my original post had "200" for the adVarChar. So, I just declared these variables at the top of my asp (incidentally, anyone know how to get those constants to be included?). Also, it seemed to want the size of the parameters (i.e., the 50 for the adVarChar). So, my final code looked like this (: ' Data Types adInteger = 3 adVarChar = 200 adDecimal = 14 ' Direction Constants adParamInput = 1 adParamOutput = 2 On Error Resume Next Set conn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") Set cmd = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Command") conn.ConnectionString = "Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Data Source=BRYCE-PC7\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Funeral;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=mkj;PASSWORD=jibenear32;" conn.Open cmd.ActiveConnection = conn cmd.CommandType = 1 cmd.CommandText = "UPDATE STORE2_ITEM SET sku = ? WHERE id = 224 and host_id = 1" Set param = cmd.CreateParameter(, adVarChar, adParamInput, 50) param.Value = "NEW SKU" cmd.Parameters.Append param cmd.Execute
