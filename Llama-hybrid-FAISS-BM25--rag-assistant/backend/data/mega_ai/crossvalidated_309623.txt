Bayesian regression models can deal with missing values in a principled manner. For theoretical background, there is a chapter on it in Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al.. A bit easier to read as an introduction is Statistical Rethinking by McElreath, in which missing values are mentioned as one of the topics where Bayesian methods can shine potentially. Prefabricated solutions like rstanarm or brms in R don't deal with it out-of-the box, allthough there are some running discussions on Github devoted to the topic, but depending on how complicated your model is, you can code it yourself in Stan , or find someone to help you a bit with that. This is all about the missing values problem, and should set you up to create a solid regression model, also able to handle ordinal questions, and hierarchical structure (within subjects variation). You could then interpret correlation between the answers of the questions If your question is actually more about analysing "predictive power", which is maybe not that clear defined, things get more complicated, and less well-studied. There are people working on Graphical Models, possibly even with a time-dependency. You can start with this link for some nice pictures, but this is a large field, if not as mature as standard regression analysis.
