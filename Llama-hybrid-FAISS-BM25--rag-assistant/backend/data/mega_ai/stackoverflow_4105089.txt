Sometimes the most obvious insights only find their way into my brain in the shower... I realized the easiest way to accomplish this is just by keeping track of the mouse coordinates when the MOUSE_DOWN is first registered. Then when the MOUSE_UP event occurs, you just check to see if the mouse coordinates are the same or if the mouse position has changed. If the mouse hasn't moved, then the user is clicking the object, if the mouse has moved, then you know the user dragged the object so they are not clicking.
