SOA governance is a subset of IT governance where you focus on defining , delivering and enforcing IT governance rules using SOA. It is also organization wide , otherwise it is practically pointless except as an exercise. IT Governance which is a subset of Corporate governance and should have at least a policy of providing Business Value in things that the company does. Here's an example: Provide Business Value (corporate policy) by providing consistent quality of service (corporate policy) by providing metrics for each procedure (IT governance) by providing transaction times for each service operation (SOA governance) As you drill down things get more technical and actually easier to enforce. SOA/IT/Corporate governance is basically analogous to the law makers (those who define the rules), the judge/police (those who enforce the rules), the rest of us (those who deliver within the rules).
