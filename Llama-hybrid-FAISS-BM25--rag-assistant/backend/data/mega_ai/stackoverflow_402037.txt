On GCC, for preference I use -Wall -Wextra -Wwrite-strings -Werror , and also specify a standard with std= . Which standard depends on the project: principally on how portable it needs to be. The reason I use -Werror is that warnings are unacceptable (to me) even if they don't represent a real bug. I'd rather work around whatever caused the warning, than have to ignore warnings every single time I compile for the rest of my life. Once you allow warnings in the compile, it's just too easy to miss one that wasn't there last time. Of course when dealing with third-party code, sometimes you can't get rid of the warnings. Then I'd decide on a case-by-case basis whether to relax the -W options, remove -Werror and write a script to check that only expect warnings occur, or maybe modify the third-party code (either to "fix" the warning or to disable it with pragmas if possible).
