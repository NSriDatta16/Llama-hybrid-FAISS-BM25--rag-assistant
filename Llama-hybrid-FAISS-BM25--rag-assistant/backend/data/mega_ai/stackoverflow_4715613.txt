Use Elastic Block Storage (EBS) instances for storing Cassandra log and data files. You will need to alter /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml to specify where these files go. EBS instances persist beyond when the EC2 instances they are attached to shut down. You can install it on one instance to try out the interface and to experiment with the data model. You don't need to set up a cluster yet. To test out the clustering capabilities, you might try setting up three instances and giving all keyspaces a replication factor of 3. But this could be a later stage of experimentation than experimenting with the data model. The recommended minimum cluster size is 3. You should experiment with different machine sizes. For experimenting with ultra-small instance sizes, you can use alternate vendors like Rackspace. If you run into performance issues with smaller instance sizes, see if moving up the instance sizes solves these issues. There are a few alpha Cassandra-Object-Mapping libraries for Rails. You may find that these don't quite work for you. You may elect to contribute back to them, or just implement the model persistence code directly in your models. For Rails 3 applications, you may want to look at the ActiveModel interface and helper modules, so that your models work well with ActionPack and other libraries that expect ActiveModel-compatible models.
