k-means does not care about the sign of your data. So it would be perfectly fine to go from $X$ to $-X$ to get rid of negative correlation without changing the result at all. Correlations in k-means increase the importance of features. Going from $(X, Y)$ to $(X, Y, X)$ simply puts twice as much weight/importance on $X$ rather than $Y$. That is why you have to be very careful with data preprocessing and normalization/scaling. PCA is just a crude heuristic that sometimes works, but don't use it to avoid understanding your data - use it only if you understand your data, and understand PCA to be the right thing to use on your data. Given the plots og your data (and percentage data types) I doubt that k-means will work, though. The data does not exhibit clear clusters. The k-means results will probably not be much better than assigning every object to $argmax x_i$ (i.e. to the maximum ingredient each, mostly sugar, mostly milk, ...)
