This is vaguely right in theory. In my long practice of doing SEO, I almost came up with this rule of thumb: "to get good Page Rank (say what you will about it not mattering) you have to worry less about SEO and more about making your business as good as it can be. If that happens, the high-quality links and higher page rank will come. Regarding the no-follow tag - it is 95% obsolete. I would not focus on it. Only google ever paid attention to it, and they have their own internal metrics which decide whether a link should be followed or not. You should cross-link your pages, but not excessively, and try to make your site look natural to the search engines.
