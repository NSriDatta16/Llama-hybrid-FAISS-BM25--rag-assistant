Which java webserver is most suitable here?

I am developing a simple web application which contains these 3 components: client that uses Ajax,javascript, html to display data on the browser. Java webserver that interfaces between the client and data processing entity. data processing entity, implemented in C++. I need to decide which java webserver to use. Some options are: a) use httpserver class in java (com.sun.net.httpserver) and create a multi-threaded process. b) use Glassfish server and deploy the application on it that creates the webpage,etc. c) use Jetty. d) ? The selection criteria for webserver is: Stability ( The process(web server) should run for days without restart) Maximum concurrent requests possible are about 200. and average case is about 30. Caching is done at the webserver and requests are served from the webserver itself if data is available or not marked dirty by the data processing entity. Your suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank You. Ron.
