Interface or Class for a list of static finals?

I am maintaining some Java code that utilizes an interface (let's call it BunchOfConstants) to simply store an abundance of public static final Strings. Occasionally these string names change or string names are added / removed. (which causes a bit of a headache for maintanance) The only current use for this interface is to compare to input later in a big ugly if/then construct like this: if(BunchOfConstants.CONSTANT1.equals(whatImLookingFor)){ doSomeStuff(whatImLookingFor) }else if(BunchOfConstants.CONSTANT2.equals(whatImLookingFor)){ doSomeStuff(whatImLookingFor) }else if(BunchOfConstants.CONSTANT3.equals(whatImLookingFor)){ doSomeStuff(whatImLookingFor) } ... I thought it would be more elegant to create a class that implements Iterable or even a class that stores this data in a hashMap. I can not figure out why the original developers decided to use an interface for this design as the interface is never actually implemented anywhere. Does anyone have any input? Would you agree that an iterable class with these members as constants would be more appropriate?
