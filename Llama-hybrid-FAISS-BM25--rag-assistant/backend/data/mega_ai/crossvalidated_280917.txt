Proper name for "modified Bland–Altman plot"

My lab uses what our PI calls "modified Bland–Altman plots" to analyze regression quality. I'd like to know what the generally used name is for these plots. A Bland–Altman plot compares the difference between two measures to their average. The "modification" is that the x-axis is, instead of the average, the ground truth value. The y-axis is still the difference between the predicted and true values. In effect, the modified B–A plot can be seen as the plot of residuals from the line $y=x$ —i.e. the line $predicted=truth$. B–A plots are also called mean–difference plots, so these modified ones could be considered "truth–difference" plots, but that name is not present in literature. Admittedly, this example has terrible bias in its prediction, shown by the deviation from the zero-line. Returning to the question at hand: what is the accepted name for these plots ?
