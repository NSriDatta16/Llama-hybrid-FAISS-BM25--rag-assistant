Is it possible average an information criterion across models?

Is it possible to take the average of information criterion like the AIC? For my model comparison, I have 24 different models. I use 4 different GARCH models each with 6 different distributions for the innovations. Now I have calculated the information criterion AIC to find the best in-sample fit. Now my question is if I can group the models from a certain GARCH model and take the average AIC of these models. Now I do this as well with the other 3 GARCH models. Next, I have 4 rankings of the average AIC of the different GARCH models. Is this a good way of comparing which models have a better fit?
