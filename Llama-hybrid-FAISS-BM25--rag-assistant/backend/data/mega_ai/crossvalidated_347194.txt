Is this a typo/error in Bishop's book

I am currently going through the chapter 9 - Mixture Models and EM from Bishop's book - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (2006) . I could not understand the maximization step with respect to the mean-parameters. I am particularly referring to the equation (9.16). $$0= -\sum_{1}^{n} \gamma(z_{nk} ) \Sigma_k (x_n - \mu_k)$$ Shouldn't that be $\Sigma_k^{-1}$, instead of $\Sigma_k $ ? Also, a follow-up question in the same line of thought. When we differentiate the likelihood with respect to $\Sigma$, how does he take care of the ${\lvert \Sigma\rvert} ^ {p/2}$ (where $p$ is the number of dimensions) that is present in the multivariate normal distribution? Looks like, from eq(9.19), he is simply ignoring the determinant term.
