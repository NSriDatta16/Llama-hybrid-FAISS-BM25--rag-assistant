Make sure that, as the tutorial says, you tell the app that you're creating a plist for iPhone settings: Select the Root.plist file, click on the Root entry in the detail view to ensure it is selected and then from the Xcode view menu select Property List Type -> iPhone Settings plist. To set the application defaults, you might consider trying this code instead: // Set the application defaults NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]; [defaults setBool:YES forKey:@"ShuffleToggleKey"]; [defaults synchronize]; This will initialize a default database on the user's phone, and take care of preference storage for you.
