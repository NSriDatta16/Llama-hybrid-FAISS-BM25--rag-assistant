I'm thinking the problem is with the Inventory collection in the Storage element. Your query will limit Product, ProductItem and Inventory items selected to those for the CategoryId specified. However, in order to fill the Inventory collection of the Storage element, the query also has to return all Inventory rows that use the same StorageId's (and then all of the corresponding ProductItem and Product rows for those additional Inventory records. I'd start by removing the Inventory collection from the Storage element or remove the corresponding include.
