Millhouse is on to it. I can also add: Batch expensive operations up. For example: don't make lots of individual calls to a database if you can do it all in one hit. Avoid server hops where you can. Process in parallel if you can (not so common for your 'average' web app but quite possible in larger Enterprise scale apps). Pre-process: crunching data, pre-puiblishing content etc, the more you can do before it's needed the better.
