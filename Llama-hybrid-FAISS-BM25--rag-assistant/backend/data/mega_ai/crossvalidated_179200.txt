Adrian Raftery's ICM webinar from a couple of weeks ago on Bayesian population projections may provide some guidance to addressing your question... http://www.methods-colloquium.com/#!Adrian-Raftery-Bayesian-Population-Projections/clv6/56180f810cf2c3576e55c39e As he notes, mortality and population tables are among the most stable of structural factors in national statistics due to the long range "march" of generations or cohorts. This makes their projection much easier, more robust and accurate. One approach worth considering would be an agent-based simulation of the difficult-to-identify subpopulations based on mortality data as well as the many other developing country population demographic metrics (e.g., TFR) available from, e.g., the UN, the WHO, etc. ABMs are widely used in simulating complex systems. Here are some papers on ABMs: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=agent+based+models
