I do have a solution implemented for this in my application, but I'm looking to see if there is something that is better or more "correct". For each historical day I do the following: function calculate_score(historical_set, forecast_set) { double c = correlation(historical_set, forecast_set); double avg_history = average(historical_set); double avg_forecast = average(forecast_set); double penalty = abs(avg_history - avg_forecast) / avg_forecast return c - penalty; } I then sort all the results from high to low. Since the correlation is a value from -1 to 1 that says whether the numbers fall or rise together, I then "penalize" that with the percentage difference the averages of the two sets of numbers.
