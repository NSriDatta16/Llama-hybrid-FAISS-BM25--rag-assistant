I don't know enough about finance to say if stock trades are optimal control problems, but an example of using RL for stock trades can be found in Maxim Lapan, Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On . The code corresponding to the chapter is on Github . Naturally, the problem is going about producing an RL agent that can do anything profitable. The agent proposed and tested in the book chapter fails to generalize, suggesting that this particular agent wouldn't be profitable at all.
