class_weight = 'balanced' if GridSearch on unbalanced data set?

I'm trying to optimize the hyperparameters of an SVM. I have an unbalanced data set with more than two classes. In some classes very many samples are included in others very few. Using GridSearchCV, I try to find the optimal hyperparameters and chose f1 (macro) for scoring, because the dataset is unbalanced. Furthermore, I set class_weight = 'balanced' and here I am not sure if this really makes sense or is rather counterproductive def make_f1_scorer(): f1 = make_scorer(f1_score, average='macro') return f1 scoring = make_f1_scorer() clf=GridSearchCV(LinearSVC(class_weight='balanced'), param_grid=param_grid,cv=5, scoring=scoring, n_jobs=-1) clf.fit(X,y Maybe someone can tell me if this approach is right or another better. Thanks in advance for any help
