While downloading filenames from non English languages are not getting displayed on the downloaded file correctly

When I am trying to download a file whose name has characters from languages like Chinese Japanese etc.... non ascii... the downloaded file name is garbled. How to rectify it. I have tried to put charset=UTF-8 in the Content-type header property, but no success. Code below. header("Cache-Control: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors header("Pragma: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors header("Content-type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$instance_name."\""); header("Content-length:".(string)(filesize($fileString))); sleep(1); fpassthru($fdl);
