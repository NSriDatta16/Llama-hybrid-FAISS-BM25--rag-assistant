Check my answer on the related question here: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/843/2452 . However, given your situation, you might need to work on something simpler. For this, it might be a good idea to review recommended literature in the open source data science master's curriculum : http://datasciencemasters.org . Many referenced there sources are free and easily available online. I'm pretty sure that many of these sources contain examples of simple projects that you could (re)implement, extend or otherwise use for your task.
