Correcting experiment results

We have performed a microarray screening of about 200 samples. In each sample we measure about 100 different variables. For technical reasons the screening of these 200 samples was divided into two batches with a couple of weeks interval between them. When all the data has been collected, I have performed principle component analysis (PCA) on the 200 x 100 table. When we look on linear projection of first 4 components (responsible for ~70% of the variability), we see a clear division between the two experiment batches. An illustration to what I have can be seen here: http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3687/pca.png What are the accepted techniques to address this issue?
