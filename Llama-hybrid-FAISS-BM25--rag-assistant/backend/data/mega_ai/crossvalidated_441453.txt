Creating a logistic regression when only having data points corresponding to True (using ML)

I know a logistic regression that tells you the probability of a specific data point corresponding to True, which means its a variation of a binary classification problem. Let's say I have data points where each point is an n-dimensional vector. I only have data points where the binary dependent variable is True (zero data points for where it is false). I would like to calculate the probability of an arbitrary n-dimensional vector corresponding to True. How would I go about doing this? Is this even possible? My only thoughts on this would be to somehow find the distance between this arbitrary vector and some other vector that corresponds to True, then weigh it in a way that could be interpreted as a probability. Would I even need to do this? Could I just do a logistic regression in Stata with the dataset I already have or would that not work?
