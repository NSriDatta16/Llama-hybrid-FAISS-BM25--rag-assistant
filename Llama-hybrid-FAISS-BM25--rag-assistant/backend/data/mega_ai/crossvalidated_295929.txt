Why is logistic regression based on an exponential function

I don't entirely understand why logistic regression is based on an exponential function. The sigmoid function seems to assume that as the dependent variables increase, the independent variable starts to increase exponentially. How do we know this is true? How do we know that this isn't a linear relationship?
