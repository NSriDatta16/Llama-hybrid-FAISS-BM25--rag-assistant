Recovering from a slightly out of date subversion repository backup

A problem I ran into a while back I never found a good solution for... Say you have a working copy checked out from subversion at revision 7500, and the disk holding the current repository dies. You've got a backup of the repository at, say, revision 7450. It's easy to restore the repository backup, but any attempt to use the working copy against it gives an error saying that revision 7500 doesn't exist in the repository. What is the best way to check in one gigantic revision to bring the content of the repository up to match the content of the working copy and get he working copy back to a functional state? (Ideally I'd like something easier than having to check out a brand new working copy and then copying over all the files manually - I think at the time the working copies were used to configuration manage servers, so it was a real pain to have to check out clean working copies)
