Regression is a family of methods, not a single one. I think you are probably referring to ordinary least squares regression. If so, then the dependent variable (DV) must be continuous (or nearly so) and the independent variable(s) can be continuous or categorical. But there are also methods for dealing with categorical DVs (various kinds of logistic regression), time DVs with censoring (Cox proportional hazards and other survival methods) and others.
