Confused on normality assumption

I know that the sampling distribution of the mean can be assumed to be normal if N>30, but does this have an implication on the "30" itself (the sample data)? I have three different time series with N=500 (well beyond 30) each and I want to test for equality of their means. Does the normality of the mean of the sampling distribution mean that I can assume the normality of the time series data I have and use a parametric test? For example Welch ANOVA?
