How to Evaluate a Probability Density Function you Fitted?

I was reading "A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics" by Ben Lambert and he brought up something I never thought of before and can't find the answer to on Google. That is, evaluating a PDF. In machine learning, you fit a model to training data, and evaluate it on testing data. What do you do for a probability model you fit? (like a normal distribution) So, to be specific: You have training and testing data. You fit a Normal Distribution to the training data using MLE or something. How do you know if it would simulate accurate data in the future? Use the testing data to evaluate the PDF somehow My guess is that you could simulate 1000 datapoints or something in the PDF, and then compare that data to the testing data to see how similar it is. If the simulated datapoints (sampled from the PDF) is similar to the testing data, then it's a good fit? What is the standard to evaluate a PDF?
