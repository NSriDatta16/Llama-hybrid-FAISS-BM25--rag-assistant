Barnard's unconditional test gives different results when switching rows and columns?

I'm really new to statistical analysis, and I've been playing around with exact tests for 2x2 contingency tables. I've noticed that for the Barnard test (implementation with library(Barnard) in R) gives different results depending on how the contingency table is organized as shown below in the two images. Can anyone explain why this type of behavior occurs? I know this doesn't happen for Fisher Exact Test, so I was wondering why it happens for Barnard's Unconditional Test...
