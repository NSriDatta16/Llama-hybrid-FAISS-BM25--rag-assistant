Ok, to answer your revised question... There isn't really that much you can do. If you don't want the admin to configure their account during installation on the server, then there will always be a small window where someone else might create it via the web before they do. All the solutions involve modifying something on the server (as this is how they prove they are the real admin). Yes, that can mean a config file... Upon first connect, give the user a token. Basically a hash of some salt+theirIP+theirUserAgent, etc. Then ask them to log into the server and feed this token to your app, probably in a config file. If the generated token next time matches the one in the config, allow them to proceed. A simpler solution is to let them put their IP address in the config from the start, and just allow this IP. (Assumes they know what their IP address is) Alternatively, allow account creation, but refuse to do anything else until some file is removed from the server. Many PHP apps do this with an install.php, but the file could be anything you test for.
