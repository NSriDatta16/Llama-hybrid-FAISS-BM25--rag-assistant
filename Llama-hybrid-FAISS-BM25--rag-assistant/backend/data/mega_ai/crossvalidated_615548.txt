outcome in this situation is fully determined by time . Another way to say this is that it is simply a re-expression of time on a binary scale. So if you were to model outcome and use time as a predictor, the other predictors would not matter - all the variation in outcome would be fully explained by time . Actually, that's an oversimplification - it would be worse than this. You would presumably be using a logistic regression, and would encounter the problem of perfect separation . I would add that outcome does not seem very useful to use as a response variable. You could just model time as a response; taking a continuous value and turn it into a binary throws away useful information. It's very unlikely that the binary outcome variable is a better metric of 'accuracy' than time . EDIT: Yes, including group*experience makes sense. As EdM says, it would tell you whether the effect of the treatment ( group ) on the outcome changes with experience . This is easier to understand if you plot the model output. Also, if you've measured each participant more than once, you will need to model the non-independence of data points. A mixed model (random intercept and perhaps random slope for participant) would help address this.
