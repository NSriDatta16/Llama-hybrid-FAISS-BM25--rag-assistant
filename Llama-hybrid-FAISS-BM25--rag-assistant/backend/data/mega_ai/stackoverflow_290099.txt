Parameterizing a test using CppUnit

My organization is using CppUnit and I am trying to run the same test using different parameters. Running a loop inside the test is not a good option as any failure will abort the test. I have looked at TestDecorator and TestCaller but neither seems to really fit. Code samples would be helpful.
