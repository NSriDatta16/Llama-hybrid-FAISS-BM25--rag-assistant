Rails3 views- JS templating directory structure

I really don't like having a duplicate directory structure in the public folder to contain Javascript templates as is suggested here . I'm about to dive into a project. Anyone that can talk me down from putting all my JS views in with my other views, please chime in with reasons not to do this. My thoughts: Whether you're using Backbone, Jammit templates, or any other Javascript to create a view of your data, shouldn't that code ideally live in the /app/views/[object] directory? If we're designing an application with multiple ways to represent the data, shouldn't all of those views live in the same place? It doesn't make sense to set up routes and have rails serve the files of course, but if we're using Jammit/Closure/another JS compression tool then we've already added a layer of processing between our directory structure and the JS we transmit to the client. Shouldn't that mean we can put the templates where it makes the most sense for code organization/maintenance? Thanks.
