StanislavL's right that mouseMove/mouseDrag events are not generated for every pixel you move the mouse cursor over. Why don't you want to use lines? If the issue is that the result is ugly and jagged, you might consider using cubic splines instead. GeneralPath.curveTo provides an easy way to do this. If getting the control points right is a pain, you can also use GeneralPath.quadTo; this is a quadratic approximation that won't look quite as good, but you can easily just pass in the last three points from mouseDrags.
