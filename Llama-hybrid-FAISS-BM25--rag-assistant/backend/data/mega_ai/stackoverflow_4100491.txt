Do you have a copy of FoxPro? You can save the database as an HTML file, if you want. Then, from HTML, you can save to any format you want. I recently did this to save a FoxPro table as an Excel spreadsheet (not that I'd suggest using that for your Java code). If you plan on using Java, once you have access to the data, why not use one of Java's native storage types?
