One consequence of such an orthogonal or "balanced" design: The estimated coefficients of the two variables will equal those of the two corresponding simple linear regressions. Check for instance the following example in R: # Generate two uncorrelated variables by PCA. The variables are shifted by two # to avoid side effects from being centered pc Thus, the ceteris paribus interpretation ("... holding the other variable fixed") makes perfect sense in such scenario. The higher the variables are correlated (e.g. age at diagnosis and time between diagnosis and study entry in a clinical trial), the stranger such interpretation usually is.
