Call [[touches anyObject] locationInView: self.superview] to get the point under the finger in the container view. Then send self.superview -hitTest:withEvent: to find out the view X is inside. Note that it will always return X, so you will have to override either -pointIsInside:withEvent: or -hitTest:withEvent: to return nil while you're dragging. This kind of kludge is the reason I would implement such tracking in the container view, rather than in a dragged view.
