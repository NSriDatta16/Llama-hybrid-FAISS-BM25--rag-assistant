We've had great success with Oracle 11g and Entity Framework 1.0 (Visual Studio 2008 SP1) on my current project. To bridge the gap with the out of the box functionality, I've implemented a free tool from CodePlex called the EF Oracle ODP Provider. This leverages the latest Oracle data providers and provides a wrapper to enable Entity Data Model generation. Unfortunately, it does not integrate well with the Entity Designer built into Visual Studio, so you have to run a few command line utilities to get your model stood up and maintained.
