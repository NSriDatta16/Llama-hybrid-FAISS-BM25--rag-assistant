Optimal Cutpoint for Predicted Results from Kaplan Meier and Cox Regression

Is there anyway to get the optimal cutpoint for predicted survival probabilities of the aforementioned survival analysis approaches? Something like the optimal cutpoint from ROC ( Epi package) for logistic regression. Thanks.
