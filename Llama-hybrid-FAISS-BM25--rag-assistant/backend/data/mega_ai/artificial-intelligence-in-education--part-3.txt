 accessibility and training educators to serve underprivileged areas. Bias AI agents might be trained on biased data sets, and thus continue to perpetuate societal biases. Since LLMs were created to produce human-like text, algorithmic bias can easily and unintentionally be introduced and reproduced. Some critics also argue that AI's data processing and monitoring reinforce neoliberal approaches to education rather than addressing inequalities. Data privacy and intellectual property Data privacy and intellectual property are further ethical concerns of AIEd. Contemporary LLMs are trained on datasets that are often proprietary and may contain copyrighted or theoretically private materials (e.g. personal emails). Further, many LLMs are regularly trained with data from end users. Recent discussions about generative AI have emphasized ethical concerns such as hallucination, bias in training data, privacy of student data, and the potential for misuse in automated grading or content generation. Educators and policymakers are increasingly focused on establishing guidelines and tools that help students use generative models responsibly while preserving academic integrity.
