Why don't you just access svn via 127.0.0.1? Surely this would be a better solution? You're faced with several issues here, if I understand correctly. There's only one way you can make this work, that is to have your home machine have an address of 192.168.0.10. Then, you specify the ssh local address with 192.168.0.10 instead of 127.0.0.1. The remote ssh connection will also by 192.168.0.10. E.g., ssh -l work_user -L 192.168.0.10:svn:192.168.0.10:svn work_ssh_host This syntax is possible with OpenSSH. This is all if I understand your situation correctly. A more elegant solution is to use OpenVPN, and route connections over the VPN.
