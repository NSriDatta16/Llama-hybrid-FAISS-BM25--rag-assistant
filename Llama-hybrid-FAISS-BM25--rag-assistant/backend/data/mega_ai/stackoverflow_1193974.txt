Look at the wikipedia entry and it will tell you: Generally, individuals who fill positions in computational finance are known as “quants”, referring to the quantitative skills necessary to perform the job. Specifically, knowledge of the C++ programming language, as well as of the mathematical subfields of stochastic calculus, multivariate calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, probability theory and statistical inference are often entry level requisites for such a position. C++ has become the dominant language for two main reasons, the computationally intensive nature of many algorithms and the focus on libraries rather than applications. It might be interesting to look at artificial intelligence, and therefore mathematical logic as well, like neural networks, pattern matching, knowledge databases, inference, ...
