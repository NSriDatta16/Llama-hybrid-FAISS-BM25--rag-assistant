Equation to calculate a smooth line given an irregular time series?

I'm trying to visualize a set of data that represents human body mass over time, taken from (usually) daily weighings. Because body mass tends to fluctuate +/- 3 pounds based on hydration I would like to draw a strongly smoothed line graph to minimize the fluctuation. Any help on what the equation would look like is much appreciated, or even just some names/links to send me in the right direction. EDIT: I need to code the visualization in Javascript, so I need understanding of the math involved, rather than a library that will do it for me.
