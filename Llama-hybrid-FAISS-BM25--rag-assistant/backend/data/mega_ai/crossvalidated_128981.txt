Within regression models homogeneity of variance of the residuals relative to the estimates, referred to as homoskedasticity, is a key underlying assumption of linear regression. If such residuals are not deemed homoskedastic but heteroskedastic (variance changes over observations instead of remaining roughly constant), the calculated statistical significance of your independent variables are invalid (t stat and P value are inaccurate). So, your whole selection of independent variables is questionable. So, you have to test whether such residuals are homoskedastic or heteroskedastic using the Breusch-Pagan test or the White test. If they are heteroskedastic, you have to calculate White standard errors (robust standard errors of regression coefficients adjusted for heteroskedasticity). Now, using those robust standard errors you can recalculate the statistical significance (p value) of those regression coefficients. Another alternative is to rerun your multiple regression model using a weighted least square regression (WLS) that will resolve the heteroskedasticity issue. From what I gather, calculating robust standard errors (White) is somewhat preferred to WLS regression because with the former you maintain the original coefficient and the causal meaning of your model. With the latter you don't. The meaning of your model can be somewhat altered and much more complicated to interpret. In short, homogeneity of variance is key because otherwise you just don't know if the independent variables you have selected within your multiple regression model are statistically significant.
