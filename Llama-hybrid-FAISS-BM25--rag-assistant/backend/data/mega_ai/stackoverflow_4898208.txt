you need to find out first, what component would you use. I would suggest FullCalendar as it's has built in all of those points, and plenty more . FullCalendar is a jQuery plugin that provides a full-sized, drag & drop calendar like the one below. It uses AJAX to fetch events on-the-fly for each month and is easily configured to use your own feed format (an extension is provided for Google Calendar). It is visually customizable and exposes hooks for user-triggered events (like clicking or dragging an event). It is open source and dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.
