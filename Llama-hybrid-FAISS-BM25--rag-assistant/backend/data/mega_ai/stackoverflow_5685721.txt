Drupal 7 tabs activation using url

Drupal 7 has the field group module which contains a horizontal_tab.js file. Inside this file i found this written // If the current URL has a fragment and one of the tabs contains an // element that matches the URL fragment, activate that tab. if (window.location.hash && $(window.location.hash, this).length) { tab_focus = $(window.location.hash, this).closest('.horizontal-tabs-pane'); } Can someone explain how this would work and what exact url i should call so that a particular tab is activated.
