It looks like your neural network has a high bias. There are a couple of things you can do as a first step to attack this: increase number of hidden layers increase number of neurons increase number of training epochs Generally, neural networks have a lot of hyperparameters and so would be good to optimise using a gridsearch for example. In terms of your first two models, it is of note that you need to double check they are not overfitting the training set.
