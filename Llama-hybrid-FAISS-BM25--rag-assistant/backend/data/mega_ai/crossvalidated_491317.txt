What is "Likelihood Principle"?

While I was studying "Bayesian Inference", I happen to encounter the term, "Likelihood Principle" but I don't really get the meaning of it. I assume it is connected to "Bayesian Inference" but I am not really sure what it is and what part of "Bayesian Inference" it is connect to and what it does. I have read the "Example" part in WikiPedia for "Likelihood Principle" but it is not clear that why the second case coefficient of the binomial distribution is different and I hope to get the translation of this part which is kind of unclear to me.
