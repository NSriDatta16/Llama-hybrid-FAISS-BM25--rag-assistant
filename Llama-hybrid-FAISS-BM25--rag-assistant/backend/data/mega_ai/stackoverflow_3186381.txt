Aggregate function over an aggregate result set using linq

I have the following linq query: var totalAmountsPerMonth = from s in Reports() where s.ReportDate.Value.Year == year group s by s. ReportDate.Value.Month into g orderby g.Key select new { month = g.Key, totalRecaudacion = g.Sum(rec => rec.RECAUDACION), totalServicios = g.Sum(ser => ser.SERVICIOS) }; var final = new ResultSet { Recaudacion = meses.Average(q => q. totalRecaudacion), Servicios = meses.Average(o => o. totalServicios) }; And I need to obtain the average of the total amount of “RECAUDACION” and “SERVICIOS” of each month. I made this query. However, I definitely think this is not the best solution at all. Could you please suggest me a better and more efficient approach (in a single query if possible) to get these data?
