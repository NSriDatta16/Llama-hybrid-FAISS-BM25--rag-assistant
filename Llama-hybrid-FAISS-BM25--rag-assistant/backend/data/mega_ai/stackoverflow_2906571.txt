What is your favorite convention for organizing a ASP.NET project?

My team is starting a brand new ASP.NET solution which will probably become large. Inspired by ASP.NET MVC, we currently express all data access objects in a model project. We, however, do not have good conventions for organizing ASP.NET ascx's and aspx's. We have already reviewed DotNetNuke and want to avoid the complexity of driving the whole application through a single default.aspx . What is the best way to organize a non-MVC ASP.NET solution? Your tips, links, and advice are greatly appreciated!
