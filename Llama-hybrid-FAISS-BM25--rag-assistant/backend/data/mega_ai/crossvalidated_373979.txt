This is more of a comment, but too long, can give some starters for a more complete answer. I will concentrate on a special case, the same number of respondents before and after, and we will assume they are the same, but the identification is missing, and neither there is some partial information for some partial pairing. Then one idea is to look at all possible pairings, and take the average. So let the data be $y_{2i}, y_{1i}, i=1, \dotsc, n$ , where the pairing implied by the indexing is arbitrary. So we want to calculate differences $$ D_\sigma = (\bar{y_2}-\bar{y_1})_\sigma = \frac1n\left( \sum_i y_{2i}- \sum_i y_{1\sigma(i)} \right) $$ where $\sigma$ is a permutation on $\{1,2,\dotsc,n\}$ . Then we average that over all the $n!$ different permutations: $$ D_{\text{Av}}= \frac1{n!} \sum_\sigma D_\sigma \\ = \frac1{n!} \sum_\sigma \left\{ \frac1n \sum_i y_{2i} -\frac1n \sum_\sigma y_{2\sigma(i)} \right\} \\ = \frac1n \frac1{n!} \sum_i \sum_\sigma \\ = \frac1n \frac1{n!} \sum_i \left\{ n! y_{2i}-\sum_\sigma y_{1\sigma(i)} \right\} \\ \qquad \text{but $\sum_\sigma y_{1\sigma(i)}= n! \bar{y_1}$ so }\\ =\frac1n \frac1{n!} \sum_i \left\{ n! y_{2i} - n! \bar{y_1}\right\} \\ =\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}. $$ which is indeed a support for the other excellent answer. An analysis of the variance is still needed. The important thing now is that this kind of analysis could be extended to include some information about partial pairing.
