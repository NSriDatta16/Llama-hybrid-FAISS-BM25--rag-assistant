If you can calculate the value of $f(\Theta|D)$ for a given $\Theta$ , then the problem can be solved in the following way: Consider the function $$g(\Theta|k) = 1\; \mathrm{if}\; f(\Theta|D) Your integral becomes $$ \int_M g(\Theta|k)f(\Theta|D) d\Theta $$ Using MCMC get n samples $S^{(j)}, j = 1\ldots n$ from the posterior $f(\Theta|D)$ , and then approximate the integral as $$ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j = 1}^n g(S^{(j)})$$ If you don't have a normalized posterior, you can still compute the evidence as $$ \int_M L(D|\Theta) p(\Theta)d\Theta $$ (by taking samples from the prior and averaging the likelihood over those samples), normalize the posterior and then use the two previous points.
