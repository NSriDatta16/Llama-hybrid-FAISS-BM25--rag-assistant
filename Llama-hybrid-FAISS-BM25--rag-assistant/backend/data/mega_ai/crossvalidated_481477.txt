How do you spot errors in data?

I was in an interview recently for a job where I'd been given a task relating to some employee data that had obvious errors in it. I've worked with data in jobs for years where I could just look at the (small sets of) data and use my domain knowledge and know if it's messed up - I didn't need any theory behind me. It's such an obvious question but it totally threw me. I listed a few things I would try, like to view by employee ID and eyeball it, but it was still a method that would apply only to small sets of data. Obviously, you're not going to eyeball 7 million records. Is there a certain data science term for error-spotting so I can research it? Alternately, what might you say? Edit: Just realised I hadn't stated the actual question I was asked, and it was "Having established that there are errors in the data, how do you go about finding out what they are?"
