There are multiple ways you can do this some of which are:- 1.) Use L2 Regularization to determine which out of the 5 features are contributing more in predicting the target. 2.) Use Tree based and gradient boosting based model to calculate the feature importance of each features. Here is an article that uses various models to calculate the feature importance. 3.) Use PCA to get the features with the maximum variance (although I'm not sure about this) 4.) Use mutual_info_classification from the sklearns library to calculate the feature importance. Other than this you can use filter based, wrapper based methods to get the feature importance of the 5 features.
