How to deal with "non-integer" warning from negative binomial GLM?

I am trying to model the mean intensities of parasites affecting a host in R using a negative binomial model. I keep getting 50 or more warnings that say: In dpois(y, mu, log = TRUE) : non-integer x = 251.529000 How can I deal with this? My code looks like this: mst.nb = glm.nb(Larvae+Nymphs+Adults~B.type+Month+Season, data=MI.df)
