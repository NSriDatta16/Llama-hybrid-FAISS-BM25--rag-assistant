How to get the browser to stop caching server responses?

I developed my own custom web server for a robot I built ( video ), without really knowing the intricacies of HTTP. One issue I am running into is I send a request from a browser, say, http://192.168.2.10/r?cmd=doStuff and the robot responds. Then I send the same request again from the browser (by clicking on a bookmark I saved), and the request never goes out, it just shows the response from the previous request. Here is what comes from the browser (IE8 in particular): GET /r?cmd=s HTTP/1.1 Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif, application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/msword, */* Accept-Language: en-US User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; Tablet PC 2.0; InfoPath.2; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; Zune 4.7) Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Host: 192.168.2.10 Connection: Keep-Alive The robot responds with the following: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Server: The Little Robot That Could 1.0 Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:05:00 GMT Content-Length: 4 X-Powered-By: Little Robot HTTP Server Do I need to throw some other HTTP header into the mix to prevent the browser from caching the response?
