Here's an elegant, Pythonic way to do it: >>> array([[1,2,3],]*3) array([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]) >>> array([[1,2,3],]*3).transpose() array([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]) the problem with [16] seems to be that the transpose has no effect for an array. you're probably wanting a matrix instead: >>> x = array([1,2,3]) >>> x array([1, 2, 3]) >>> x.transpose() array([1, 2, 3]) >>> matrix([1,2,3]) matrix([[1, 2, 3]]) >>> matrix([1,2,3]).transpose() matrix([[1], [2], [3]])
