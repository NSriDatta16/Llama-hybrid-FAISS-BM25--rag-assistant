A simple solution is to remove the mean effect of Teacher . I think that normalizing by the standard deviation per class (hence the z-score) is not necessarily and makes your data less intuitive. Subtracting the mean per Teacher can be done easily with dplyr . normalized_report % group_by(Teacher) %>% mutate(centralized_improvement = Improvement - mean(Improvement)) %>% ungroup() This solution is a simple but effective approach if you are interested in comparing class mates with each other. Also dividing by the standard deviation (hence, the z-score) is not necessarily, I think. This would mean that the difference in standard deviation is also caused by the Teacher . E.g. if you hypothesize that a teacher gives only attention to his favorites.
