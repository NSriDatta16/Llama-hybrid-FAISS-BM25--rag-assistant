Here's a pragmatic example from the world of filesystems. This utility recursively counts files under a specified directory. (I don't remember why, but I actually had a need for something like this long ago...) public static int countFiles(File f) { if (f.isFile()){ return 1; } // Count children & recurse into subdirs: int count = 0; File[] files = f.listFiles(); for (File fileOrDir : files) { count += countFiles(fileOrDir); } return count; } (Note that in Java a File instance can represent either a normal file or a directory. This utility excludes directories from the count.) A common real world example would be e.g. FileUtils.deleteDirectory() from the Commons IO library; see the API doc & source .
