This is a very broad question, but your easiest method would be to do the following. Using Visual Web Developer Express (Or full Visual Studio if you have it). Create a web applciation using ASP.NET and your language of choice. Add the Access Database to the website in the App_Data folder of the project, and depending on your specific needs, from here you can use a lot of the drag-drop items to build the page up. A few notes. Using the drag and drop items are great for rapidly putting up a site, but do not follow best practices. 4guysfromrolla.com is a great reference for the how-to's on the ASP.NET side of things Access IS NOT necessarily the best choice for a database engine for a website...but can work.
