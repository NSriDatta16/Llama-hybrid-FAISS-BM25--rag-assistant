How do I formulate logistic quantile regression models?

Which of these models is most appropriate given the data (prediction is my goal), and why? I haven't had much experience with quantile regression, and I have so far assumed (probably niavely) that they can be treated the same as OLS regression models to a degree. I would like to fit logistic quantile regression models to these data: df with the eventual goal being prediction. However, I am unsure if my model formula is appropriate as I can't find any tutorials on whether or not I should include polynomials with quantile regression, or how to do this if I should. This is what my data looks like: ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(y = PropDead, x = TrtTime, colour = factor(RepNumber))) I have tried a few different models so far: #Simple logistic regression time.lqr $PropDead, x = cbind(1,df$ TrtTime), p = 0.99) #Trying to include a quadratic curve to the fitted line. poly.lqr $PropDead, x = cbind(df$ TrtTime, poly(df$TrtTime, 2)), p = 0.99) #Log transformed time variable to straighten it. logtime.lqr $PropDead, x = cbind(log(df$ TrtTime)), p = 0.99) I know that the lqr models fit robust logistic regression models (and that there is a "best" alternative- see lqr::Log.best.lqr ) but I wasn't sure exactly what this mean and I also haven't been able to find any packages that fit non-robust alternatives. Question: Which of these models are appropriate, if any, given the data? Can I (or should I) be using the raw Live/Dead counts rather than the proportion? If so, how? I get an error when I try cbind like I would for a binomial glm. Are there other more appropriate models? To clarify these are not the only models that I am using - I have a suite of models and I am trying a range to see which works best (defined by minimising prediction error), but I would like to include quantile regression in this comparison.
