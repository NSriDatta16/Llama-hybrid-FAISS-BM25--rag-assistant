You can use deep neural networks for time series prediction, specifically a type of deep net called LSTM. I've seen it with done with LSTM in Tensorflow , but I'm sure you can do it with h2o as well (see also here ). Whether this actually performs better than ARIMA or not is an open question and will likely depend on the data. One problem with using neural nets is that they are a black box, while ARIMA models can be interpreted by a forecaster to some extent. You say that you can't use ARIMA because the time series is not stationary, but you seem to be misunderstanding the nature of ARIMA. It is ARMA models which require stationarity. The "I" in the middle of ARIMA stands for "Integrated" and refers to the process of differencing whose purpose is to transform non-stationary data into stationary data, so that an ARMA model then can be applied to it. Basically, the whole point of ARIMA is that it is a modification of ARMA so that it can be used for non-stationary series. So if your only problem is non-stationarity, then you can still use ARIMA. Moreover, you can use exponential smoothing and state space models for non-stationary data. These models are much more established and better understood than LSTM and RNN when it comes to times series forecasting.
