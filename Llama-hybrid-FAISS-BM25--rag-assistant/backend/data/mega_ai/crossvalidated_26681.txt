The problem is that you are not supplying the right number of initial hyper-parameter values for the covariance function you are using. In the example the data set has two attributes, so in that case the ARD covariance function needs three hyper-parameters (two scale parameters, one for each attribute and an overall scale factor for the covariance). For this covariance function (covSEard), you need one more hyper-parameter than the number of attributes. I would suggest changing covfunc to @covSEiso and hyp.cov to log([ell sf]) For a dataset with as many attributes as yours I would forget trying to use an ARD covariance, there are just so many hyper-parameters that you will just end up over-fitting the marginal likelihood in model selection and end up with a very poor model. I just wanted to add, GPML is a great piece of kit, I'd strongly recommend it to anyone interested in non-linear regression or machine learning approaches to pattern recognition. Rasmussen and Williams book is similarly excellent.
