You should first determine what the requirement for efficiency is, in terms of storage, speed etc. in concrete numbers. Without knowing this information, you can't tell if your implementation satisfies the requirement. And, if you have this requirement, you will probably find that the DOM satisfies it, and has the advantage of zero code to maintain. It will be a nightmare for future programmers as they wonder why someone wrote an alternate implementation of the DOM. Actually, pretty much anything you do will just be a DOM implementation, but possibly incomplete, and with optimizations for indexing etc. My personal feelig is that re-inventing the wheel should be the last thing you consider.
