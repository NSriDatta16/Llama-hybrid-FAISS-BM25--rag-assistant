Adding this solution by request. Not going to mark it as accepted, though, because it feels like an ugly hack and if possible I'd like a more elegant way to prevent the problem: procedure RTTISurgery(connection: TSqlConnection); var cls: TRttiType; begin cls := TRttiContext.Create.GetType(connection.Metadata.ClassType); cls.GetField('FQuotePrefix').SetValue(connection.Metadata, ''); cls.GetField('FQuoteSuffix').SetValue(connection.Metadata, ''); end; NOTE: I do not recommend the use of RTTI surgery techniques as a general purpose solution to programming problems. It should only be used when no better solution is available, since it almost invariably involves violating encapsulation. (Which is the point of using it: a last-ditch solution to fix over-encapsulated bugs.)
