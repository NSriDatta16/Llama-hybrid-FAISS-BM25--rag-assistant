Why static fields are not initialized in time?

The following code prints null once. class MyClass { private static MyClass myClass = new MyClass(); private static final Object obj = new Object(); public MyClass() { System.out.println(obj); } public static void main(String[] args) {} } Why are the static objects not initialized before the constructor runs? Update I'd just copied this example program without attention, I thought we were talking about 2 Object fields, now I saw that the first is a MyClass field.. :/
