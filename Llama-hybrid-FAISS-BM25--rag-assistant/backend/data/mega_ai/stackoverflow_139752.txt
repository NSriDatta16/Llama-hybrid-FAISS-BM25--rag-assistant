When to use partial mocks?

I'm starting to get comfortable with the idea of fakes, stubs, mocks, and dynamic mocks. But I am still a little iffy in my understanding of when to use partial mocks. It would seem that if you're planning on mocking a service and need to resort to a partial mock then it is a sign of bad design. Is it that partial mocks are mostly for getting legacy code under test coverage? On the flip side of this, say I am testing a class which has a Reset() method. If I have already confirmed in a separate test that the Reset() method works, and I have some functionality of the class that should end with a call to this method, is it poor test design to do a partial mock of the object and run tests against the partial mock, defining an Expectation on the Reset() method. I currently have several tests set up in this manner, is this sort of thing going to get me in trouble later on?
