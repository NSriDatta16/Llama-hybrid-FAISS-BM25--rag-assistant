Doing mostly Rails development on OS X/linux I end up spending half the time at the command line anyway as that is the easiest way to run most of the support tools, and it just becomes second nature after a while. I keep an IDE or text editor open (depending on the complexity of the project) open and spend 50/50 time between that and the command line. If you're using Visual Studio, I'm guessing that you're developing on windows. It's no wonder that using the Command line isn't a natural thing to do - no offence, it's just that the Windows console sucks and isn't exactly encouraging or pleasant to use. Couple of things to do to make your life easier: Install cygwin or similar as a replacement shell for CMD.exe and start using the *nix style command line tools. They'll give you far more power than what you get with Windows, and you'll find that it starts to get easier to use the command line for a lot of things that you'd used to use the GUI for (file copy/move operations etc, checking log files). Then install Console as a replacement for the standard windows command line terminal. It's far more customisable, supports tabs, colour highlighting etc. I did these two things when I went to a new client-site based project where we are forced to use Windows PCs. Helped enormously! Using SVN/GIT from the command line is often easier. Especially for bulk operations like this than digging through IDE dialogs.
