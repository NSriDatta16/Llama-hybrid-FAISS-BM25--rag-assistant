There is a difference. $this refers to an instance of an object. parent and self are used to call methods statically. This page of PHP's manual explains it in better detail than I have time to write at the moment. The first example in particular should help to highlight some of the differences. I encourage you to copy paste the first example and mess about with it, as I think its an important concept to get in your mind if you don't already know the difference.
