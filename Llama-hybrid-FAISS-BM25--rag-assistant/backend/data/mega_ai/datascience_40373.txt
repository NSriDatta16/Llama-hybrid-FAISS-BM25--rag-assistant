Cannot install package: dlx

I'm new to anaconda. How can I install the dlx package ( https://pypi.org/project/dlx/ ) in anaconda? I found it here: ( https://anaconda.org/auto/dlx ). conda install auto::dlx Solving environment: failed UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be in conflict: - auto::dlx - secretstorage Use "conda info " to see the dependencies for each package. I get no result from conda info auto::dlx . Can anyone help me? SOLUTION: Thanks to vivekwisdom for leading me on the right path. PyCharm created a virtual environment. I had to activate it first ( source activate ) and then install dlx using pip. It didn't work via conda install auto::dlx because it was missing cython, which I also installed via pip.
