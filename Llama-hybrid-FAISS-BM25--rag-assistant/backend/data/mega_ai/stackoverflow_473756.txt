If you look at the error trace, the error is occuring inside of fl.containers::ScrollPane/setScrollDrag(). If you look here you find out that scrollDrag ... Gets or sets a value that indicates whether scrolling occurs when a user drags on content within the scroll pane. You never put content into the scroll pane scrollPane.source = "..."; I believe this is why the error is occuring, try putting some content into the scrollpane before you set the horizontalScrollPosition.
