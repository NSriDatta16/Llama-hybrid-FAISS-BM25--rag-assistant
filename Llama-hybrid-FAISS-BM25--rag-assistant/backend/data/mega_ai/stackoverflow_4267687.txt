MYSQL UNION ORDERING

Is it possible to order the first enquiry and keep the rows returned as first and not order the second enquiry. (If that makes sence) An example of my current enquiry is : SELECT * FROM Devices WHERE Live = 'true' AND Category = 'apple' ORDER BY ListOrder UNION SELECT * FROM Devices WHERE DeviceLive = 'true' I was hoping that the devices under the category apple would be organised in there list order and would be at the top of the list above the other devices. But this seems to jumble the two querys together.
