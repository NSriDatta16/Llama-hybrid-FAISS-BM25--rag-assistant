You can put an enum is a new codefile with .cs extension, for intellisense to work make sure its part of your project/solution and ofcourse it should be a public enum so that you have a solution scope for it. If intellisense is a problem , make sure you build your solution once, i had this problem once and just a rebuild solved it. Namespacing is a good option if you want to organize your code properly and you are coding a large project. The .NET framework was large. so it has enums under namespaces just for better understanding and code organization.
