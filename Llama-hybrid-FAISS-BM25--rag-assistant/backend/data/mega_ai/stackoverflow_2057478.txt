touchesForView in hitTest

I have a simple UIView used like container. If I write this code: - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UIView *hitView = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event]; NSSet *sTouches = [event touchesForView:self]; NSLog(@"Touches %d", [sTouches count] ); return self; } Doesn't work! I would like get touches count in hitTest() message, before touchesBegan()! Is it possible? I have this hierarchy: UIView +---> UIScrollView When touch on my UIView ( single tap ) the container moves. When I double touch (two finger) on my UIView , the child UIScrollView doesn't work for Zoom (for example). So I have think to catch touches number. If touch number is equal to one, hitTest on my UIView container return "self". Else, if touch number is great to one ( == 2), hitTest return "scrollview" pointer. In others words, I would like catch two finger event into hitTest() message/event.
