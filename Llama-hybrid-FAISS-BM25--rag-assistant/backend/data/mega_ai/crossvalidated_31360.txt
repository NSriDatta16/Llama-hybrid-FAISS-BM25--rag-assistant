If you believe that these two means are both estimates of the same true value then inverse-variance weighting is the way to go. That's equivalent to fixed-effect meta-analysis . If you believe that the means are estimating different true values, then things get more tricky. If there were more means, you could do random-effects meta-analysis . In principle that still works with only two means, but your estimate of the between-sample variance will be very imprecise. A fully Bayesian analysis would put an informative prior on the between-sample variance.
