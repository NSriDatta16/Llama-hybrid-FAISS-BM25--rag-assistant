Third party controls that work with Web Forms aren't really compatible with a pure MVC application. Having said that, you may be able to work with a hybrid type of solution, leveraging Web Forms in certain places and MVC in others. It's not something I would do personally, but you could. See this post by Scott Hanselman which goes into some detail about doing just that. Using a web forms control on a Razor page just won't work though.
