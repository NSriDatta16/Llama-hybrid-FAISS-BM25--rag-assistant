In the sort descriptor, you're walking a relationship using the keypath game.date . Your leak is probably associated with one of those objects in the keypath. It disappears when you remove the sort because then the objects in the key path don't do anything. If you have transient properties, custom accessors, non-entity properties etc in the game entity I would look there. Custom value transformers are also a good bet. The stack in Instrument should tell you exactly which object is leaking.
