How to handle large amount of data in android

My app has several image and media files, which are around 1MB each or so. So if i follow the normal way, the app size is crossing over 40MB, which is huge. Is there anyway to avoid this? I have heard of external storage, but i really don't get any clue of how to work on them! Do i need to ask all those who instal this to save the images and media files in the external disk and then the app uses those? This makes my files public..isn't it? I actually don't own a android device. So is it like, whenever people install an app from the market, does it ask if it has to install in the phone memory or the external memory? I really need your help. If there is a way, i'd be thankful if you can provide me the step by step details of how this can be done! Thanks a lot.. Regards Nithin
