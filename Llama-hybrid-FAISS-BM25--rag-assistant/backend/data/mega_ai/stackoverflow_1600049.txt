C# Anchor property doesn't seem to work

I added some controls to my form and changed Anchor property how I'd expect this to work, but when I resize the form at the runtime, the controls stay at the same place. For example, I have two buttons in bottom right corner of a form - they are on the form, no containers or anything like that. Anchor = Bottom, Right. FormBorderStyle = Sizable. But when I drag-resize the form while running, buttons do not move. Am I missing something? c# 2005
