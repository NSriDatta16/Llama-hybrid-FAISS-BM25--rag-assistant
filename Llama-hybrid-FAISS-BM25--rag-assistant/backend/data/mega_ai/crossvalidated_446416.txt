How does BART (Bayesian Additive regression tree) help with causal inference?

I have recently learned about using BART for causal inference from observational studies. So, I read that if we want to see the causal effect of a variable Z (binary) on Y in presence of X covariates then we can get factual (putting Z=0 for all points) and counterfactual (putting Z=1 for all points) predictions for Y from the trained BART model and see the difference in the two generated distributions. (Please correct this method if I am wrong) My question is why BART allows for this kind of inference and not a regular model (such as decision tree, logistic regression, etc) as we can also produce factual and counterfactual probabilities using any another model? Please help.
