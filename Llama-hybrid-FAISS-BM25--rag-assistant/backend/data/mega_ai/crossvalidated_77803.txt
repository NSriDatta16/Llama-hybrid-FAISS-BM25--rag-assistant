(1) your constant = 2480! Where does that fit on the graph? (2) Graph doesn't have axis labels /legend. Looks like fitted data. (3) is time a linear term in this model? why? Have you tried fitting quadratic terms, cubic terms, quartic terms... - unless the change in scale is distorting the graph, the time trend is clearly non-linear and using a simple linear term lacks face validity. I'd build a main effects model first (time time2, time time2 time3 etc. where time2=time^2 and time3=time^3), find which one fitted best and then consider adding interaction terms. Your categorical would need to interact with each time term if you wanted to add an interaction. I would also test to see if you need the interactions - how you represent that in R is not clear to me (I usually use Stata) - There are other ways of handling non-linearity from piecewise models, to I think there is a mixed-effects GAM package. But this is a solid and traditional approach. (4) have you considered time as a random slope? (5) have you done residual diagnostics? - simplest would be to generate histograms of your level-1 and level-2 standardized residuals. but I think the linear time assumption is the key. (6) have you plotted predicted vs. actual? - from the model you should be able to predict a mean/model averaged trajectory over time. If you do this with the above model it should be clear that it doesn't fit the data at all. Or show that it sort of does fit the data. I don't think you're at the "what does this model tell me" stage yet. It's always hard to tell from just a snapshot like this, sorry if I'm way off base and wasting your time, but does seem like you still have a lot of model refinement to do.
