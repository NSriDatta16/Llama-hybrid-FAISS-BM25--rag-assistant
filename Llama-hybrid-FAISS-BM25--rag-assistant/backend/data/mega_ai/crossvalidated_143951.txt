What does it mean if the median or average of sums is greater than sum of those of addends?

I'm analyzing the distribution of network latency. The median upload time (U) is 0.5s. The median download (D) time is 2s. However, the median total time (for each data point, T = U + D) is 4s. What conclusions could be drawn knowing that the median of the sum is much greater than the sum of the medians of the addends? Just out of curiosity for stats, what would it mean if this question replaced median with average?
