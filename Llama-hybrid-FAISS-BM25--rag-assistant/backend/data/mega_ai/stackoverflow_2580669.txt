Live Updating Widget for 100+ concurrent users

what would you use if you had to have a div box on your website that would have to be updated constantly with new HTML content from the server. simple polling is probably not very resource inefficient - imagine also having 10'000 users and the div has to update. what is the most efficient or elegant solution for such a problem? are there existing widgets which contain this "autoupdate" functionality?
