I think IE is doing wrong. a:active is working when the mousebutton is down, but the href doesn't go off before the mousebutton is up again. Pseudo-code: onmousedown(e) { setCssAsActive(); } onmouseup(e) { activateHref(); } If the mouse goes up outside of the element, nothing happends. Try to click on a link, then drag your mouse away from the link and then release the button. Nothing should happend. That is what happening in your code. When you are clicking at the Stack-text, the link moves away fron your pointer, and when you release the button, the link is no longer under the pointer. It moves back at the release-time, but then it is too late. Therefore, I think IE is doing wrong.
