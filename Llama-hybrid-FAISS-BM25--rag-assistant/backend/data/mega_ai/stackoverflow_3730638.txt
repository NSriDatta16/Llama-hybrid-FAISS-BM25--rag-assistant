I think that AGENT would be correct to use for an organization as well; the only requirement is that it is something that is separately addressable which can act on behalf of the the intended recipient. The other option would just be to use the free-form LABEL field for the address of Foobar Widget Team, including everything from the "c/o" to the end. Given that there aren't likely to be a lot of consumers that will get any value out of specifying the relationship precisely, just putting it into a freeform text value will allow simple programs that just extract the address to produce an address label that contains the right information, without having to understand what the "c/o" line means.
