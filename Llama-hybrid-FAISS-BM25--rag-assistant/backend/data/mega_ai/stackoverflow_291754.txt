Is it really a good idea to give the ViewModel dependencies to WPF? .NET 4.0 will have System.Xaml.dll, so you won't have to take a dependency on an arbitrary framework to utilize it. See Rob Relyea's post about his PDC session. My take XAML is a language for describing objects, and WPF is a framework whose described objects are UI elements. Their relationship is similar to C#, a language for describing logic, and .NET, a framework which implements particular kinds of logic. XAML's purpose is declarative object graphs. The W*F technologies are great candidates for this paradigm, but XAML exists independently of them. XAML and the entire dependency system were implemented as separate stacks for WF and WPF, probably to leverage the experience of different teams without creating a dependency (no pun intended) between them.
