How can i find the variance of ATE by using g computation without bootstraping?

I have a binary treatment and binary outcome and have estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) by using g-computation, which involves training a model for the outcome given the covariates and treatment, generating predicted values by setting the treatment to 1 and then to 0, and taking the average of the differences between the predicted values. Most sources recommend using bootstrapping to estimate the variance of the resulting estimate. Is it possible to get the variance without bootstrapping?
