How can I send a file with the POST method from C# to a PHP file which (PHP) gets files from a HTML form by the '$_FILES' function?

First I have a PHP file that gets data and file from a HTML form and uploads a file to a specific directory by the $_POST and $_FILES methods. Second I have Windows aplication ( C# ). The user can drag and drop any file to a listview. I send the user's data to a PHP file by the POST method and it (the PHP file) upadtes the database. My problem is I won't to send file in listview drag and dropped by the user to the PHP file as it could get the file by the $_FILES method and access it.
