The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing is a lot more intuitive. Suppose you wish to calculate a two-sample T-test. You can use the T-statistic to do this and then find the p-value. One can argue this is not a very intuitive method, it is very ad hoc, and very specific to the problem. The Bayesian approach is to simply treat the two parameters as distributions. Once you feed the data into your problem you will get your posterior distributions. Now you can run some simulations to see how frequently your hypothesis is true in the space-of-all-possibilities. Interesting, the probability you will get from this method will be consistent with the non-Bayesian t-test method. However, this Bayesian approach is more intuitive to understand and can easily generalize to hypothesis tests which violate the assumptions of the t-test.
