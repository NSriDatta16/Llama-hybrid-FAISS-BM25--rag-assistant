Finding an association between two methods of medical intervention and a continuous variable

I have here with me, two methods of intervention; a standard care method, and a specialised intervention. Different individuals receive different method, its all randomly allocated. I am trying to find the association of the specialised intervention and a 'well being score' which is a numerical value. What is the best way to find any associations? E.g. logistic regression model?
