This is a great discussion. I feel that Bayesian credible intervals and likelihood support intervals are the way to go, as well as Bayesian posterior probabilities of events of interest (e.g., a drug is efficacious). But supplanting P-values with confidence intervals is a major gain. Virtually every issue of the finest medical journals such as NEJM and JAMA has a paper with the "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" problem in their abstracts. The use of confidence intervals will largely prevent such blunders. A great little text is http://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Confidence-Intervals-Statistical-Guidelines/dp/0727913751
