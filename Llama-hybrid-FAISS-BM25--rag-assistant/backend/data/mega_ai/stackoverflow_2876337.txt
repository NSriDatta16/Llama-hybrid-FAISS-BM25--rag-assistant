How should I go about learning Python?

I am currently learning PHP and want to learn about OOP. I know Python is a well-organized and is all OOP, so would learning Python be a wise choose to learn OOP? The thing is I am more towards web development then just general programming, and I know Python is just a general purpose language, but there is Django. So how should I go about learning Python if I am lending towards web development? Is there any good books/websites that help me learn Python for web development? Is there any free webhosting companies that allow Python? I never used Python before, only PHP, and not sure how it works? Is there like a "xampp" for python?
