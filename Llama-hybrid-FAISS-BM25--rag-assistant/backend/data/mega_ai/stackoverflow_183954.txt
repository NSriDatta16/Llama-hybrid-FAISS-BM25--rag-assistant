I once wrote a programming language and a virtual machine to run it on. The language was able to interface to function written specifically for in that were contained in a DLL (this was before OLE automation) on 16 bit Windows. Doing the whole front-to-back thing gave me a great understanding on a language from both ends. I'd read various compiler books at the time (such as the infamous Dragon book) but it never really sunk in until I wrote something concrete. Now, many years on, the work I did have given me a richer appreciation and understanding of have things like the Java VM and the CLR work.
