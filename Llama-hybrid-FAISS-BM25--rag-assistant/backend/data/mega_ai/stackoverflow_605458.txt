I'd probably read the syntax specification enough times to know it, and get a feel for how to parse it. Reading the existing parser code is of course brilliant, both to see what seems to be the main source of complexity, and if any special clever tricks are being used. The use of MD5 checksumming seems a bit weird, but I haven't studied the code enough to understand why it's being done. A comment in a routine called _EscapeSpecialChars() states: We're replacing each such character with its corresponding MD5 checksum value; this is likely overkill, but it should prevent us from colliding with the escape values by accident. Replacing a single character by a full MD5 does seem extravagant, but perhaps it really makes sense. Of course, it'd be clever to consider creating a "true" syntax, for a tool such as Flex to get out of the regex bog.
