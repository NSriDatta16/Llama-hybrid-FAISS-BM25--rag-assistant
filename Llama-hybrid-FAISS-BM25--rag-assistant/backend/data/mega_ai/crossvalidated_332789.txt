rate of improvment in sampling

I sequentially sample values from a distribution, say normal distribution. so I have: x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_t, ... as iid sequence. However, I keep record of only the samples that are higher than the average samples I've kept on record. y_1 = x_i1, y_2=x_i2, ..., y_n =y_in, ... obviously i1 = 1 and y_k >= mean(y_1,...,y_{k-1}) my questions are: how does E(Y_n) behaves as a function of n? (obviously it is an increasing function, and E(Y_1)=E(X)) how does n behaves as a function of t? (as the recorded average increases we need to "wait" more time until we sample a good enough value, but how much more time do we need at each step)
