Estimate Conditonal Moments from Conditonal Quantiles

In Chang et al. "The Higher Moments of Future Earnings" (2014), the authors say say that based on (predicted) conditonal quantiles of a variable $y$ , one can derive the (predicted) conditional variance of $y$ as follows (A3, page 34): $$ var(y|\cdot) = \frac{1}{Q}\Sigma_{q\in Q}(quant_q(y|\cdot))^2 - (e(y|\cdot))^2, $$ where $quant_q$ denotes the $q$ th of $Q$ evenly distributed quantiles and $e(y|\cdot)$ denotes the average of the $Q$ estimated quantiles. In words: Average of squared quantiles minus squared average of quantiles equals variance. They do not provide a reference and I have not seen this approach in the quantile context before. I tried to find another reference but I could not. Is this a common approach?
