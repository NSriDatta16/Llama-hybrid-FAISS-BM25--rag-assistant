First, Have you made sure your template has the enctype="multipart/form-data" flag in it? ... First, there's no need to override save() in your ModelForm since you're not doing any extra work in it. Second, there's no need to store the new_application variable, simply call form.save() . Third, you should be using a slug field in your JobOpening model and passing that in the querystring. Remember, this isn't PHP, use pretty urls like /jobs/opening/my-cool-job-opening/ , that's what slugs are for; unique human readable urls. Your GET code in your view is very fragile as it stands. Finally, you may want to use the render_to_response shortcut function as it will save you having to verbosely call template loaders, create context and render them manually.
