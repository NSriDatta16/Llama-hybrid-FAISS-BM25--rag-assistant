How to cluster univariate time series

I have different univariate time series and the goal is to detect outliers automatically. Therefore I used different algorithms for different time series. But the first step would be to detect automatically the time series class. Attached you could see different univariate time series (continuous1, binary, continuous2). HOW could I distinguish between these? I have already tried kmeans with some simple generated features but it doesn't work. The first main goal should be to distinguish between binary and continuous data.
