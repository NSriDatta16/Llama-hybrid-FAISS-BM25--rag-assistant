R implementation of some new Principal Component Pursuit methods

I'm looking for R packages implementing some new PCA methods. The first one is the Stable Principal Component Pursuit method of Zhou et al. (2010) . The second one is the PCA via Outlier Pursuit algorithm of Xu et al. (2012) . Both are highly cited papers in statistics, yet I could not find either of them on the robust or multivariate R task view and was wondering whether somebody more knowledgeable could point me in the right direction. Zihan Zhou, Xiaodong Li, John Wright, Emmanuel Candes and Yi Ma (2010). Stable Principal Component Pursuit. H. Xu, C. Caramanis, S. Sanghavi (2012). "Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 58(5), pp 3047-3064, 2012.
