There may be such resources, but they aren't really necessary. Core Data and MapKit are very separate frameworks and you should be able to use them both in an app successfully by applying the appropriate tips and tricks for each separately. Core Data has been covered by many of the Cocoa blogs. For example, check out this search on COCOA IS MY GIRLFRIEND. Marcus Zarra wrote the book on Core Data. For MapKit, I recommend anything that Bill Dudney has done. He has been on some podcast(s) and has a screencast at the Pragmatic Bookshelf and a chapter in this book .
