I beg to differ with all the other answers to date. Immutability and static methods may not be strictly technically related, but I have found that using F# has encouraged me to make C# methods static whenever I can. The thinking is analogue, in that it is easier to handle an immutable object because you don't have to worry about it changing state. In the same way, you don't have to worry about state when using a static method (unless you use a global singleton or something...).
