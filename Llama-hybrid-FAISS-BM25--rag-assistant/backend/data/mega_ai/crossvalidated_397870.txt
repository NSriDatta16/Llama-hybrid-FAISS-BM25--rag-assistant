How to get PCA of the testing data?

I'd like to transform my data into pca (preprocessing data before I use data into classification model). I separate my data into data training and data testing. I used princomp in R to process pca with my data training, and I've got the loadings(eigenvector) of the pca data training. Is it correct if I multiplied datatest with the loadings from the datatraining and get the scores of pca datatesting?
