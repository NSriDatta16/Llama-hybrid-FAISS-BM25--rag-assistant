The gold standard optimization criterion is the log likelihood (including penalized log likelihood) and the Bayesian counterpart log posterior (log likelihood + log prior). In the binary outcome $Y$ case an observation observing $Y=y$ when the current predicted probability is $p$ has a log-likelihood of $y \log(p) + (1 - y) \log(1 - p)$ . Observations contribute to either the first or the second part to the log-likelihood. No observation is ignored. For multi-category $Y$ (multinomial) results are similar. The probability element for $Y=y, y=1, 2, \ldots, k$ is $p_{y} = \Pr(Y=y)$ .
