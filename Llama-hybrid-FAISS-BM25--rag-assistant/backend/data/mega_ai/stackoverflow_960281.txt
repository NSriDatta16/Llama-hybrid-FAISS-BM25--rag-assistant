Sure, you can use Papervision3D to do this. http://code.google.com/p/papervision3d/ There are also some pre-built Flex effects that leverage PV3D available here: http://www.tink.ws/blog/papervision3d-effects-for-flex-source/ You can use Tink's "Flip" effect just like you would any other built-in Flex effect.
