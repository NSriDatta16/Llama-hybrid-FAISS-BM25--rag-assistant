How to use regression of data linked in space and over time?

I have an R data frame, set up like so: Site Year Species Total_Observed A 2000 Bird_1 4 B 2000 Bird_1 2 C 2000 Bird_1 9 A 2000 Bird_2 0 B 2000 Bird_2 1 C 2000 Bird_2 3 A 2001 Bird_1 7 B 2001 Bird_1 2 etc And it goes on like this for some time. Lots of data, multiple sites, over many years. I'd like to do some kind of regression to see whether bird_1 is increasing over time in the same areas that bird_2 is decreasing over time, but I'm not sure how since this is partly a geospatial problem and it seems to me that bird_1/bird_2 observations can't be averaged due to their correlation by site. How do I approach this problem?
