This is unfortunately a known bug apparently introduced in Service Release 1 of Ganymede (Eclipse Ganymede SR1, v 3.4.1). See the following pages for more information: http://www.coderanch.com/t/106846/IDEs-Version-Control-other-tools/Ganymede-bug-using-jsp-include http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=17447&group=eclipse.webtools#17447 The bug is fixed in WTP 3.0.3. Note that to get the fix through the Eclipse "Software Updates" function, you have to manually add the WTP update site to the list of sites that get searched during updates, by using the "Maage Sites..." function and check the Eclipse Webtools site.
