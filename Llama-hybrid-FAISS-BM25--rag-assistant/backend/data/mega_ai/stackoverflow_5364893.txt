Organizing JDBC Project

I have some very long SQL statements that need to be run through JDBC. I am wondering what the best procedure is for organizing them? Should I make a separate class, define them as variables and just reference those class variables from my main application class? Or should I just put them into the application class and deal with it being hard to read? Any help would be great.
