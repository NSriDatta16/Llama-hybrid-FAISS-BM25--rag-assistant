simultaneous edits to xml file in C#

I am working on an application that reads and makes edits to an xml file but using the XDocument class Load() and Save() methods. If another application, or another instance of my application is running then one document could potentially overwrite changes that the other has made if it's in memory xdocument is not continually updating (reLoading). The simultaneous running programs would never edit the same section of the xml file at the same time. What is the best way to solve this problem? Should I just do a Load right before I make every change or is there a more elegant approach?
