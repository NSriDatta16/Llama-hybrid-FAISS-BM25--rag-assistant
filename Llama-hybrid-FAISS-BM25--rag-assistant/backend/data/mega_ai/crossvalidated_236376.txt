Meaning that additional knowledge of one event does not change the probability of occurrence of the other event. But I can't seem to fully wrap my mind around this. What does independent mean here? How can two events have a nonzero intersection and yet have nothing to do with one another? "two events have nothing to do with one another" means that both could occur simultaneously, or one could occur but not the other, or both might not occur. If two events have zero intersection, then they very much do have something to do with each other. If we know (or we are told or we assume) that one event has occurred, then we know that the other event cannot possibly have occurred. (Remember that an event (a collection of outcomes) is said to have occurred on a trial if the outcome of the trial is a member of that event). If $A\cap B = \emptyset$, then whenever the outcome $x \in A$, we know for sure that $x \notin B$. In short, the occurrence of $A$ tells us for sure that $B$ did not occur, but instead $B^c$ has occurred. Thus, $P(B\mid A) = 0$, $P(B^c\mid A) = 1$. Unless $P(B)$ happens to have value $0$, it is clear that knowledge of the occurrence of $A$ has indeed "changed the probability of the occurrence of $B$." Thus, at the very least, I hope that you can disabuse yourself of the notion that "nothing to do with one another" means disjoint. But, just having $P(A\cap B)$, $P(A\cap B^c)$, $P(A^c \cap B)$, and $P(A^c \cap B^c)$ all be nonzero is not sufficient to assert independence. As pointed out by @dsaxton, what is needed to assert independence is $$P(B\mid A) = P(B),$$ that is, "knowledge of one event does not change the probability of occurrence of the other event": the conditional probability that $B$ occurs conditioned on the occurrence of $A$ is the same as the unconditional probability. For a more extensive discussion of these matters as well as an answer to the query posed in the penultimate paragraph of dsaxton's answer, I refer you to this previous answer of mine from four years ago.
