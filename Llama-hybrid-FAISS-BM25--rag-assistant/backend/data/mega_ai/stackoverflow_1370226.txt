getting the path of a application at runtime + cocoa

i want my application to run from removable storage devices and it should get the path of the removable storage it is running from or the rem storage device from which the app is launched. I have seen nsworkspace to get path of removable storage device but dont know how to get the path at run time. please suggest a way to do this. also i have searched the net and came to know that there is no autorun feature on mac systems. I want my app to auto launch itself whenever a removable storage is attached to a mac system. is there any workaround for this? Thanks
