Can I make a structured reference absolute in excel 07?

I have a table "A" with 2 columns "Foo" and "Bar". I have a formula with the structured reference A[Foo]. When I fill this formula horizontally I want the reference to stay A[Foo] but now, in the second column, the reference turns to A[Bar]. Is there a way to make this structured reference absolute? It'd be shocking that this isn't supported if not. Example Formula: =A[Foo] Drag that horizontally and Foo changes if the table has multiple columns
