This one is very hard to do, and I can see lots of problems with syncing to 'the slowest'. Can you loosen this up so the clients could be 'eventually consistent'? Sounds good. I would send short action events from front ends to backend, have the backend modify game state and publish game state modification events back to the clients, with much attention to only sending the necessary events out to the right subscribers. At this point you can discard any events that don't seem to match or that seem like fakes/hacks.
