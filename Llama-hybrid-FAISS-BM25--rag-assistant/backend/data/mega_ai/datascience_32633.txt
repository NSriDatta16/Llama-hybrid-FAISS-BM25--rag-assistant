It does, it's an API called Keras , written on top of TensorFlow . With that you can rapidly prototype any "standard" NN architecture, such as feedforward NN, RNN, or CNN. With it you can export the trained model with one line of code and save it for later use. As for visualization, Keras offers integration with pydot (GraphViz) to plot the whole NN as a graph for you to inspect.
