Drupal has its own mechanism for this, involving adding a property to Drupal.behaviors . See this page: http://drupal.org/node/205296 Drupal.behaviors.redipsDragBehavior = function() { REDIPS.drag.init(); }; From the linked page: Any function defined as a property of Drupal.behaviors will get called when the DOM has loaded.
