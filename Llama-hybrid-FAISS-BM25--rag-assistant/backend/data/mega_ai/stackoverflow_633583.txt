Serialization is turning data into a linear "string" of bytes. Others have said more or less the same thing, but I stress that computer models require that data fits in the one-dimensionally addressed RAM or persistent storage. Most things that are "data" are inherently serializable (even if you must reduce the abstract model to a linear one); not serializable are say a network connection or a complicated state-based machine like a parser.
