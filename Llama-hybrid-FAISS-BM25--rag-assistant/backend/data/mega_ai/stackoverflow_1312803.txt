Works fine here in mac/safari 4.0.3. However I do notice one thing - your flashvars for the object and param bits don't match up. They should be the same. Also, you make want to look into a more flexible embedding solution such as SWFObject (it helps you do player detection and will let your document validate as XHTML as well)
