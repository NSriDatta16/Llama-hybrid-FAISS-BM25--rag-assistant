nuSOAP static class method naming

I'm trying to get the nuSOAP library to expose a SOAP method that isn't named the same. Right now I am doing: $server->register('receiveResponseXML'); function receiveResponseXML () ... This works and I'm using it currently, but it's hard to organize and if I have a method name conflict I don't have a way to resolve it. How would I declare a static method but expose it named as above? Something like this: $server->register('receiveResponseXML', array('MyClass', 'theStaticMethod')); class MyClass { public static function theStaticMethod() ... Also if anyone knows a legit nuSOAP reference I would much appreciate. Currently I have to read source.
