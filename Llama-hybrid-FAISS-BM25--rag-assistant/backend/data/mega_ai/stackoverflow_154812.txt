The algorithm is pretty generic, but the benefits are rather Python-specific. Unlike most sorting routines, what Python's list.sort (which is what uses timsort) cares about is avoiding unnecessary comparisons, because generally comparisons are a lot more expensive than swapping items (which is always just a set of pointer copies) or even allocating some extra memory (because it's always just an array of pointers, and the overhead is small compared to the average overhead in any Python operation.) If you're under similar constraints, then it may be suitable. I've yet to see any other case where comparisons are really that expensive, though :-)
