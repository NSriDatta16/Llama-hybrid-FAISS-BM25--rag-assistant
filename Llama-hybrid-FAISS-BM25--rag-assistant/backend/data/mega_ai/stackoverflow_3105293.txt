Response.redirect puts extra characters in the url Error 400

I am trying to use response.redirect on a button click event server side but it gives me http 400 bad request error. I was not getting this error before but I just moved the projectto vs 2010 framework 4.0 and I started getting this error. This is what I am writing: protected void bOrganizationAddID_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { string MyURL; MyURL = "addNewPopup.aspx?orgID=" + this.OrganizationID; Response.Redirect(MyURL); } and when i try to build it, the url shown on the page with error is : http://localhost:2504/padrap/pages/admin/%2fpadrap%2fpages%2fadmin%2faddNewPopup.aspx%3forgID%3d33 instead of being just: localhost:2504/padrap/pages/admin/addNewPopup.aspx?orgID=33 Can anyone help me out here please. How do I get the redirect to take me to the correct url? Thanks!
