Metropolis-Hastings algorithms used in practice

I was reading Christian Robert's Blog today and quite liked the new Metropolis-Hastings algorithm he was discussing. It seemed simple and easy to implement. Whenever I code up MCMC, I tend to stick with very basic MH algorithms, such as independent moves or random walks on the log scale. What MH algorithms do people routinely use? In particular: Why do you use them? In some sense you must think that they are optimal - after all you use them routinely! So how do you judge optimality: ease-of-coding, convergence, ... I'm particularly interested in what is used in practice, i.e. when you code up your own schemes.
