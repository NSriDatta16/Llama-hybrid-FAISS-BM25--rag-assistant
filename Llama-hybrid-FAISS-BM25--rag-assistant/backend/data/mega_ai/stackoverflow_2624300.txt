Save part of matching pattern to variable

I want to extract a substring matching a pattern and save it to a file. An example string: Apr 12 19:24:17 PC_NMG kernel: sd 11:0:0:0: [sdf] Attached SCSI removable disk I want to extract the part between the brackets, in this case [sdf] . I tried to do something like grep -e '[$subtext]' to save the text in the brackets to a variable. Of course it doesn't work, but I am looking for a way similar to this. It would be very elegant to include a variable in a regex like this. What can I do best? Thanks!
