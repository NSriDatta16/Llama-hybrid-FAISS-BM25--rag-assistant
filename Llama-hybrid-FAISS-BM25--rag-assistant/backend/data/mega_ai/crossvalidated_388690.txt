Is there a way to check the full learnt function by Neural Network, not only the weights?

The training is mostly learning about the wights.But what about the full function learnt by NN? In typical deep learning framework, is there a way to example the function learnt? For example: Y = w1x1 + w2X2 ...wnxn More specifically, for a model structure like the following: model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(20, input_dim=13, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(6, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, kernel_initializer='normal')) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') How would the function learnt look like?
