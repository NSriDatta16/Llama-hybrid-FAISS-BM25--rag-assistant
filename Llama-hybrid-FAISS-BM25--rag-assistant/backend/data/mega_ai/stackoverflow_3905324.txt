Ok, I got an answer from Gallio support that it actually requires MSTest.exe to be present on the box. I'll test the package that Aseem suggested whether it provides enough stuff to run the tests. Update : I installed Microsoft Visual Studio Test Agent 2010 from the package. I had to add the string value InstallDir to [HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0] and set the value to something like “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE” Now my CI box runs those tests perfectly.
