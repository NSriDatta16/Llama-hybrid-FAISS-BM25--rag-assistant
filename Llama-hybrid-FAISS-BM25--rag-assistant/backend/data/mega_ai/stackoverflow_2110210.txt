The reaction of form widgets to keyboard interaction is not standardised and different browsers don't agree. This is always an issue when creating ersatz form controls from script. In HTML, when you repeatedly press the same key, it will rotate between all options starting with that character. This feature comes from Windows and is quite unintuitive. The exact rule isn't that exactly, is quite obscure, and gives different results in IE and Opera versus the other browsers. IMO this behaviour is highly undesirable. Since no average user is going to be able to predict how the rule works, I personally would leave it out and simply select the first option to match the typed leftstring. This is easier for you to code and easier for the user to understand.
