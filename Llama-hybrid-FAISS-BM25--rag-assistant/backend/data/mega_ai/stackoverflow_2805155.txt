How have you implemented SCRUM for working alone?

I am working alone at the beginning of a sizable open source project and would like to leverage some of the core ideas/methods from Scrum to help manage my time and remain focused on development and deploying early, demonstrable functionality. I would like to hear from others who have used Scrum alone and what you have found particularly useful to these ends. Thanks.
