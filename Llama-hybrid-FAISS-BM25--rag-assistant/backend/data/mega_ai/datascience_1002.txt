What initial steps should I use to make sense of large data sets, and what tools should I use?

Caveat: I am a complete beginner when it comes to machine learning, but eager to learn. I have a large dataset and I'm trying to find pattern in it. There may / may not be correlation across the data, either with known variables, or variables that are contained in the data but which I haven't yet realised are actually variables / relevant. I'm guessing this would be a familiar problem in the world of data analysis, so I have a few questions: The 'silver bullet' would be to throw this all this data into a stats / data analysis program and for it to crunch the data looking for known / unknown patterns trying to find relations. Is SPSS suitable, or are there other applications which may be better suited. Should I learn a language like R, and figure out how to manually process the data. Wouldn't this comprimise finding relations as I would have to manually specify what and how to analyse the data? How would a professional data miner approach this problem and what steps would s/he take?
