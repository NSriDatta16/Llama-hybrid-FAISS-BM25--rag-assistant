You don't say exactly how you are compiling, but here are some options: 1 - Inside Visual Studio, you can set the warning level for individual source files via the Properties for each source file 2 - You can also change the the warning level dynamically within a file using #pragma warning(push, 3) // Some code, perhaps #includes #pragma warning(pop) which sets the warning level to 3 between the two pragmas.
