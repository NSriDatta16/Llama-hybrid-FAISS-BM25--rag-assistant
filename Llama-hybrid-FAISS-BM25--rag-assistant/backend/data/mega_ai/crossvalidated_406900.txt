We use regularized Linear Regression to prevent the model from overfitting (reduce model complexity). Does the same idea hold with regularized Logistic Regression? Yes. The bias-variance trade-off exists in all areas of statistics. Is regularized Logistic Regression a solution to the problem of separation? Yes; even a small penalty on the coefficients will bound them away from infinity. This is because you will not be able to improve model fit to be arbitrarily good without eventually trading-off with an increase in penalty on coefficients.
