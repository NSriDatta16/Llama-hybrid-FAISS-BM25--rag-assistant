Microsoft historically has used a Neural Network Ranking Function as its ranking function. The Neural Network combines the hundreds of variables that a Url will have associated with it related to ranking. Paper They would typically score more than 100 docs using a detailed ranker. Each query node will need to score its top documents in isolation and return them to the aggregator. Ranking is actually very complex and scoring algorithms are typically multileveled. For compute jobs, factor generation etc... Microsoft Search uses SCOPE which I believe is built on top of Dryad but does not use DryadLINQ. SCOPE is basically a SQL language on top of a cluster. Actually Microsoft is far more open about their technology in search than Google is. Microsoft Research Asia and Microsoft Research Silicon Valley
