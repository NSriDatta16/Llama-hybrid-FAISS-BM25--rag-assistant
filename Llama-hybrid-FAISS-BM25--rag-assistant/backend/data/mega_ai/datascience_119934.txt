Survey on image retrieval datasets

I am on a survey about image retrieval datasets. I have found some, such as: NUS-WIDE Oxford5k Oxford105k Paris6k MSCOCO I have been way too confused about the detection metrics and the metrics they use inside these datasets for image retrieval purposes. For example: AP Recall Precison Mean Average Precision My question is, how I can identify the metrics that these datasets use for image retrieval purposes.
