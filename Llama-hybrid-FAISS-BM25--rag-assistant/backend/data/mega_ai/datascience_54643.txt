Can Facebook's Prophet be considered a “type” of AI? Like and CNN or RNN

I'm facing a problem to determine if the model Prophet developed by Facebook team is some kind of Neural Network or similar. Someone has an answer for it? In Github repository has the following explanation: "Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality(...)". But reading the Prophet paper , by Sean J. Taylor and Benjamin Letham. It really seems to be and Machine Learning algorithm. Even the way that use it seems to be a Neural Network. Any discussion or reference would be apreciate
