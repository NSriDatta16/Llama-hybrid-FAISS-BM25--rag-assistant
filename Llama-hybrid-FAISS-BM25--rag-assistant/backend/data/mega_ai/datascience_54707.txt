Using nlp to analyze accident report

I want to use Natural Language Processing to analyze traffic accident reports and from the text determine two things: Direction of vehicle travel (just compass directions like north, southeast, etc.) Vehicle movement descriptions (e.g. backing, turning left on a red, stopped in traffic, turning right, parked). A fragment of an accident report narrative looks something like this: TU2 was parked and attended on the west side of Main St, facing west, engine turned off. TU1 was parked on the east side of Main St, facing east and exited the parking spot, driving backwards. TU1's rear collided with TU2's rear. TU2 was still parked with the engine off when rear ended by TU1. The accident reports are in thousands of files, with all accident reports for one year in one city in a single file. The "answers" (labels) to vehicle travel direction and movement descriptions are provided, along with the narrative of the accident report. So I have a decent training dataset. I was thinking about starting with an approach like an n-gram bag of words and a simple classifier for vehicle direction (north, southwest, etc.). Would that be a good start?
