Passing events to parent

I'd like to create an app where some events are supposed to be handled as if they were delivered to parent containers. For example I've got a JPanel which contains JLabel . The top JPanel implements mousepress and dragging right now. What do I need to do, in order to make the events look like they arrived to JPanel instead of the label itself. (changing source object is important) Is there some better solution than actually implementing the events and replicating them in the parent? (this would get tedious after some objects with >5 children).
