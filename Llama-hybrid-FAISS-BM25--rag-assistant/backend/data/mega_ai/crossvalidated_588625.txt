Updated book or review paper on MCMC methods (2022)

For a self-study course, I'm looking for bibliography that describes current MCMC algorithms. I'd prefer a book or a review paper. My background knowledge is at the level of Gamerman-Lopes or Gilks-Richardson-Spiegelhalter and I will read Liu soon, but I'd like to find other good updated material that will help me understand the current directions of research.
