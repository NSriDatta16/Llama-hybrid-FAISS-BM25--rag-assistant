Determine whether a time series is ergodic

How to determine if this time series is ergodic? According to the ergodic theorem the mean must converge to the expected value starting point. How do I determine that? Hoverever I have plotted the mean observations for the last 500 days, and it seems that it doesn't converge so I can conclude it is not ergodic?
