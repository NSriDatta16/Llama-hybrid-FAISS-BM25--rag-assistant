Rendering issue FireFox

I am creating a website and it looks differently in firefox and Safari. This is the link to the website http://storminacupcake.com/ and you will see that there is a small issue : it looks fine in Safari, but there is a small gap between to cells in Firefox. Could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong ? Thank you, Alex
