In CSS z-index is a CSS property that sets the stack order of specific elements. An element with greater stack order is always in front of another element with lower stack order. p { position: relative; z-index: -1; } This paragraph will be positioned behind the rest of the page, as long as the rest of the page has z-index: 0 , which is specified by default. Negative stack orders can also be used in the same manner. A negative value will appear behind a more positive one. z-index only works on elements that have a position value (i.e. position: relative;). Like all other CSS properties, it can be set with javascript as well with the following syntax: object.style.zIndex = "1"; In WPF Panel.ZIndex Attached Property In Silverlight Canvas.ZIndex Attached Property See also z-order regarding the general concept.
