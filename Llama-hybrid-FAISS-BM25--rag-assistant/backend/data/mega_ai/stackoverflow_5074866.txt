svm classification

I am a beginner in MATLAB and doing my Programming project in Digital Image Processing,i.e. Magnetic Resonance image classification using wavelet features+SVM+PCA+ANN. I executed the example SVM classification from MATLAB tool and modified that to fit my requirements. I am facing problems in storing more than one feature in an input vector and in giving new input to SVM. Please help.
