Intrepretation of a term that is insiginficant but which when removed causes a significant increase in deviance

I began with a maximal model which looked something like this: Response ~ Predictor 1 + Predictor 2 + Predictor 3 I used backwards stepwise elimination and likeilhood ratio tests to then try and find the mininmal model. But I got a strange result for one of the predictor terms. It was insignificant (p=0.5), and plotting the data showed no obvious correlation with it and the response variable. But when I remove it from the model and do a likelihood ratio test comparing the model with the predictor to the model without it, this says that the increase in deviance is highly significant (p=1.752173e-48). I'm really confused by this and was wondering whether anyone experienced could weigh in on how I should be intrepreting this. The factor of interest is msize. Here are the outputs: model_one F) pop 6 946 157.7 2.8336 0.009653 ** carcass 1 4742 4742.1 85.1937 F) pop 6 1067 177.8 3.1920 0.0041225 ** carcass 1 4633 4632.9 83.1951
