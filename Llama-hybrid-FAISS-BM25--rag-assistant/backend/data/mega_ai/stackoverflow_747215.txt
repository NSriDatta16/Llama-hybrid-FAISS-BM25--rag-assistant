Use relative units to set the padding. Adding padding: 0.2ex 0; background: red; using Firebug/Dragonfly to the example link in the question works just fine for me, whatever the font size (set through CSS or zooming in). The only problem with changing the font-size in Firefox is that the background starts overlapping the previous line; but that's a line-height issue.
