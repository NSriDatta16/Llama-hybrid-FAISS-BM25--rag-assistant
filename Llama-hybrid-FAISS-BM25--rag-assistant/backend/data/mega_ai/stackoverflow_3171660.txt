Silverlight 4, RIA Services Multi-step Server Side Validation

Newbie question, I have a simple Silverlight 4 client. I'm creating some methods on the server side to handle new user creation / validation. Before I create the user, I'd like to validate a number of things. Does the user name already exist? Is the email address valid? Does the password pass strictness checking? Etc, etc. I'm not really finding a clear way of handling this and I'm looking for some suggestions. I have multiple calls that I need to make to the server for each condition I want to check for. All calls are asynchronous. The way I see it I can do the following: Call each validation function on the server and do mock synchronous calls using waits. ew. Try and stitch all of the various callback functions completed events. Ew. Combine all of the validation calls into one on the server side. Seems clean now, but what happens when I want to perform different validations or different combinations of validations? That means more new functions. Seems like it could become a maintenance headache down the road. Is there an elegant solution that is evading me? Thank you.
