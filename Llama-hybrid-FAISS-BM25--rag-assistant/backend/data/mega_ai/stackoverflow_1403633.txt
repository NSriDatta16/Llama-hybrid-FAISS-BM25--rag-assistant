I had the wrong idea.... 3 themes are loaded. According to the hierarchy, from lowest priority to highest- default - this theme must be called default. I will be planning on using the magento default theme untouched as this theme. This cannot be currently overwriten. your custom default theme - specified in configuration->design->theme->default I will be using the Magento blank theme as base for developing an everyday store theme. your custom non-default theme - specified in configuration->design->theme->(layout, templates and skin) I will be using this to create special occasion themes, e.g. Christmas or sale, that will override only a subset of the default theme.
