Core Data Pre-populated SQLite issue, z-metadata

I have this issue with Core Data. I am creating a core-data-based application, for one of the tabs, to populate a UITableViewController. Basically, I have read somewhere that there is an issue with providing a pre-populated sqllite file to be used to load up the data. I created a pre-populated data file and at first had issues with Z_METADATA and other anomalies like that. If we are creating our own sqllite file, is there somethign we have to include, such as certain table names etc? Note, I didnt create teh application with use core data for storage ticked at beginning, so im not sure if that makes a difference.
