I handle it with Javascript: function resizerows(classname) { //init some vars var tablerowlist = new Array(); var maxheight=0; //get all elements with same class var rowlist = document.getElementsByTagName("li"); //loop through items and check class name for (var r=0; r tags) for(var c=0; c maxheight) { maxheight = childlist[c].offsetHeight; } } }//end loop through child elements //now we have the maxheight loop through all the rows and set the height to max height for (var ch=0; ch It's a little blunt, you can get more elegant code using a framework like jquery but this has worked for me, cross browser and platform. Edit: This is for HTML code formatted thus: Item 1 Item 2 Item 3, which is really really long text that'll be bigger than the other two items Item 1 Item 2 Item 3, which is really really long text that'll be bigger than the other two items
