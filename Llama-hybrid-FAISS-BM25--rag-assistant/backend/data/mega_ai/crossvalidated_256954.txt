Equation 6.3 from "deep learning book"

I have been working through Deep Learning and found that there seems to be a disconnect between equation 6.3 and the steps taken to solve that equation. Equation 6.3 is $f(x;W,c,w,b) = w^Tmax\{0,W^Tx+c\}+b$ yet in solving this equation the design matrix $X$ is used instead of $x$, 6.7, and the transpose of $W$ is never applied. What am I missing? Thanks for the help
