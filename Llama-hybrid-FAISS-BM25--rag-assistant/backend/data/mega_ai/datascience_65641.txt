How can I compare my regressors?

I am trying to build a regressor for a dataset which gives info about students' school performance and the probability of getting admitted in the University of their choice. The first 5 observations look like this : GRE_Score TOEFL_Score Uni_Rating LOR CGPA Research Chance_of_admit 0 337 118 4 4.5 9.65 1 0.92 1 324 107 4 4.5 8.87 1 0.76 2 316 104 3 3.5 8.00 1 0.72 3 322 110 3 2.5 8.67 1 0.80 4 314 103 2 3.0 8.21 0 0.65 I have build the following regressors so far : linear regressor, knn regressor and a recurrent neural network. ( I will try a few more later. ) So far, in order to chose among my models, I used the "score" method on the test set for the first two regressors ( it returns the $R^2$ for each one of them ) and the "evaluate" method on the test set for the network ( it returns the MeanSquaredError ). So, keeping in mind that $R^2$ and MeanSquaredError have different formulas, how can I compare my network with the other two models ?? Any help is much appreciated.
