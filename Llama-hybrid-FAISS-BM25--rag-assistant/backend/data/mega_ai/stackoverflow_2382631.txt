Style property on Blocks/Inlines - Is there a way to get this?

I'm using the new RichTextBox control in SL4Beta and want to create styles for paragraphs and runs (blocks and inlines). I noticed that I can create a style for a , like so: But I can't set that to a as The member "Style" member is not recognized or not accessible . Like this: Can't set a style for a paragraph. Is there anyway to make "Style" exposed for the RichTextBox? I'm open to all ideas.
