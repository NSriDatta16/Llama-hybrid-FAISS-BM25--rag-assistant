I'm trying to figure out an algorithm: 1) get the width of container containing the blocks (container should be relative, so that it expands when you resize the window). To get the width use .width or .outerWidth 2) divide the width of the container by the block's width, floor it. Now you know how many blocks fit in one row. 3) To calculate the height, this can be tricky because you may have a header or navigation etc. which cuts the vertical space down. So do this: 3.1) Get the height of the window $(window).height(); 3.2) Get the container's top offset $('#container').offset().top 3.3) Subtract the offset from the window height - now you have the "real" height available (note: if you have a footer etc. you have to subtract this reserverd space, too) 4) Divide the real available vertical space through the block's height (spend attention on margins/paddings) and floor this number. Now you know how many rows may fit in your space. 5) multiply max. rows and max. columns we've calculated, that's the maximum amount of blocks that fit in. 6) Get your blocks like $('.block') and iterate thru it $('.block').each(function(index) { ... }); now if the index is bigger than the max. number of blocks we've calculated, hide them! 7) Attach an event handler to $(window).resize(function() { }) and do the steps above on resize
