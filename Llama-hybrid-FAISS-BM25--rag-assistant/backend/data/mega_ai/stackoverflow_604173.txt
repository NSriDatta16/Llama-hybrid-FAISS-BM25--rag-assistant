I think I chimed in when you asked this question about the differences in dev -> test. Have you tried rebuilding the indexes and recalculating statistics? Generally, forcing an index is a bad idea as the optimizer usually makes good choices as to which indexes to use. However, that assumes that it has good statistics to work from and that the indexes aren't seriously fragmented. ETA: To rebuild indexes, use: REPAIR TABLE tbl_name QUICK; To recalculate statistics: ANALYZE TABLE tbl_name;
