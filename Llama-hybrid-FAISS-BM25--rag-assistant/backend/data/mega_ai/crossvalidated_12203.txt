All I can do is an educated guess: on ICML this year, there is a paper Support Vector Machines as Probabilistic Models by Vojtech Franc, Alexander Zien, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf. You might find something in there on how to formulate SVR as a probabilistic model and thus use it in a Bayesian framework. Looks like a tough road, though.
