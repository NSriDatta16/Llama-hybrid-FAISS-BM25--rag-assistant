You should keep in mind, that HTML is intended to DESCRIBE the content it contains. So, if you wish to convey a paragraph, then do so. Your comparison isn't exactly right, though. The more direct comparison would be When to use a instead of a ? as both are block level elements. A is inline, much like an anchor ( ), , emphasis ( ), etc., so bear in mind that by it's default nature in both html and in natural writing, that a paragraph will cause a break before and after itself, like a . Sometimes, when styling things — inline things — a is great to give you something to "hook" the css to, but it is otherwise an empty tag devoid of semantic or stylistic meaning.
