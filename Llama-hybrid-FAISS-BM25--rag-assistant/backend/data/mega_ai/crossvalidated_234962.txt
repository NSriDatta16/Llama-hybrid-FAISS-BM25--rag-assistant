Why do we keep a testing set when doing research?

I am really curious about this. From my exploring of research in Machine Learning, I've seen that the same test set is used from paper to paper. While i can understand keeping the same set for different approaches so as to make results comparable, doesn't it make it so that the approaches are eventually getting more and more optimized to the test sets, rather than applicable to numerous problems?
