A tricky thing about good frequentist properties is that they are properties of a procedure rather than properties of a particular result or inference. A good frequentist procedure yields correct inferences on the specified proportion of cases in the long run, but a good Bayesian procedure is often the one that yields correct inferences in the individual case in question. For example, consider a Bayesian procedure that is "good" in a general sense because it supplies a posterior probability distribution or credible interval that correctly represents combination of the evidence (likelihood function) with the prior probability distribution. If the prior contains accurate information (say, rather than empty opinion or some form of uninformative prior), that posterior or interval might result in better inference than a frequentist result from the same data. Better in the sense of leading to more accurate inference about this particular case or a narrower estimation interval because the procedure utilises a customised prior containing accurate information. In the long run the coverage percentage of the intervals and the correctness of inferences is influenced by the quality of each prior. Such a procedure will not have "good frequentist properties" because it is dependent on the quality of the prior and the prior is not appropriately customised in the long run accounting. Notice that the procedure does not specify how the prior is to be obtained and so the long run accounting of performance would, presumably, assume any-old prior rather than a custom-designed prior for each case. A Bayesian procedure can have good frequentist properties. For example, in many cases a Bayesian procedure with a recipe-provided uninformative prior will have fairly good to excellent frequentist properties. Those good properties would be an accident rather than design feature, and would be a straightforward consequence of such a procedure yielding similar intervals to the frequentist procedures. Thus a Bayesian procedure can have superior inferential properties in an individual experiment while having poor frequentist properties in the long run. Equivalently, frequentist procedures with good long run frequentist properties often have poor performance in the case of individual experiments.
