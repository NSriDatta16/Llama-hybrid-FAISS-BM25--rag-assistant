Purpose Of PHP Sessions and Cookies and Their Differences

I am just starting to learn to program in PHP and have ran into a slightly confusing area, Sessions and Cookies. I understand the server-side and client-side storage differences but i cant see how they differentiate and in what circumstances would each be appropriate for? Also, i have seen people say that the cookie could be used to store a session id, How would this be done and why would this be advantageous? Thanks for any feedback.
