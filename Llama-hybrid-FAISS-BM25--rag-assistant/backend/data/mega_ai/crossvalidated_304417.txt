When there are several plausible models model uncertainty should not be ignored. If you select just one model and then do inference as if this were the only model you ever considered, you will get problems (estimates, p-values, confidence intervals etc. will not have their usual repeat sampling properties, out of sample predictions will be problematic etc.). It is usually preferable to account for model uncertainty by e.g. doing model averaging (e.g. with weights proportional to exp(-(AIC-min AIC)/2)) unless one model is so much better in terms of AIC that it gets all the weight anyway.
