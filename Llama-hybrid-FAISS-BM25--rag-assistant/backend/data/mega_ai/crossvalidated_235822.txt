Development of classifiers for datasets with imbalanced classes is a common problem in machine learning. Density-based methods can have significant merits over "traditional classifers" in such situation. A density-based method estimates the unknown density $\hat{p}(x|y \in C)$, where $C$ is the most dominant class (In your example, $C = \{x: y_i = 0\}$). Once a density estimate is trained, you can predict the probability that an unseen test record $x^*$ belongs to this density estimate or not. If the probability is sufficiently small, less than a specified threshold (usually obtained through a validation phase), then $\hat{y}(x^*) \notin C$, otherwise $\hat{y}(x^*) \in C$ You can refer to the following paper: "A computable Plug-in estimator of Minimum Volume Sets for Novelty Detection," C. Park, J. Huang and Y. Ding, Operations Research, 58(5), 2013.
