Batch adding attribute to attribute sets

I have a Magento installation with around 60 attribute sets. I need to add a new attribute to each of the attribute sets. There doesn't seem to anyway of doing this in the admin control panel. I am sure I can work it out by manually entering the correct fields into the database, but is there a way of doing this through the API or through the Import / Export profiles? Any suggestions would be gladly received.
