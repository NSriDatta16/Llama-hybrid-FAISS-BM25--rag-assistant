While Alex provides the correct and proximal answer to your question, I prefer to use TryParse : int value; int? EmployeeNumber = int.TryParse(employeeNumberTextBox.Text, out value) ? (int?)value : null; It's safer and takes care of cases of invalid input as well as your empty string scenario. Otherwise if the user inputs something like 1b they will be presented with an error page with the unhandled exception caused in Convert.ToInt32(string) .
