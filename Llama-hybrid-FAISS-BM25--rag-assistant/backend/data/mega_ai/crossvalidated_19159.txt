Probably the soundest and most comprehensive method is through Generalizability Theory. It will allow you to apportion variance in ratings to raters as well as to the translation systems and/or to other conditions of the ratings. Short of that, there are probably ways to adjust, in a more ad hoc fashion, for the biases you describe. Just off the top of my head, one thing you could do is always characterize a translation system by the average of the 3 raters' scores--that would neutralize any bias.
