R - Get average values of steps in line chart

Consider this data #Create the dataframe values I would like to get the mean and SD of each step. They can be of different widths and heights. I tried calculating the rolling standard deviation then detect the maximas then measure average values between maximas of SD but due to the difference in length of the steps I was unsuccesfull to accuratelly detect the start and end of steps.
