If I understand your problem correctly, you have some data $D$ that is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean $\mu(\phi)$ and known covariance $\Sigma$ , namely $$ D = \mu(\phi) + \mathcal N (0,\Sigma) $$ As well as a simulation output $M(\phi,n)$ which is also assumed to normally distributed with known covariance $S(\phi,n)$ $$ M(\phi,n) = \mu(\phi) + \mathcal N (0, S(\phi,n)) $$ (Where we can think of $\mu(\phi)$ as being equal to $\mu(\phi) = M(\phi,\infty)$ , since $S(\phi,\infty)=0$ ) But notice that this just implies that $$ D = M(\phi,n) + \mathcal N (0,\Sigma + S(\phi,n)) $$ So your likelihood should be $$ \log \mathcal L(\phi) = -\frac{1}{2}(D - M(\phi,n))^T(\Sigma + S(\phi,n))^{-1}(D - M(\phi,n) )$$ Now you can sample it using MCMC as you did, or try to optimize it using something like simulated annealing or Bayesian optimization , or any combination of the above (get close to the global minimum and sample around it).
