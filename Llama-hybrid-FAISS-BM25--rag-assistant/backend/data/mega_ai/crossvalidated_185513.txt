Sampling and design problem

Suppose there are quite many (hundreds/thousands) variables, $X_1$,...,$X_m$, in a computer model, following some multivariate distribution. How can we get a sample of these variables that has good coverage of the possible values while the sample size is not large saying 100-500? In addition, if a low-dimensional transformation is applied to these variables saying $Z_1=T_1X$,...,$Z_d=T_dX$, where $X=(X_1,...,X_N)'$ and $d Many thanks!
