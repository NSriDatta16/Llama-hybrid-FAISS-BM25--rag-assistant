If you're on one specific platform/OS, you should use report functions, spectific to that OS. If you're eritiong cross-platform program, you shouldn't rely on any free memory checking algorithm. Reasons are: OS may refuse to give all available memory due to own reasons: fragmentation, alloc limits or so. OS may not really give a memory, just allocate the space if it have VMM. Algorithm may change internal state of MM, so memory available before and after call to check may be different. As OS runs several processes in parallel, available memory may be changed sponteneously due to other process activity.
