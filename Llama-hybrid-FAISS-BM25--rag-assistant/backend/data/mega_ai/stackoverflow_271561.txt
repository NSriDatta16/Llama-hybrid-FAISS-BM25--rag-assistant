Why does one often see "null != variable" instead of "variable != null" in C#?

In c#, is there any difference in the excecution speed for the order in which you state the condition? if (null != variable) ... if (variable != null) ... Since recently, I saw the first one quite often, and it caught my attention since I was used to the second one. If there is no difference, what is the advantage of the first one?
