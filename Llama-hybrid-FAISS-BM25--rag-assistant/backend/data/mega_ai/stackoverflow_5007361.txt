Give the controller_action_layout_generate_blocks_after event a try. The Layout object and its child blocks should be instantiated by the point that event fires. There's only ever one Layout object, and you can grab the handles in play with // get the layout->get the updates manager->get the handles $handles = Mage::getSingleton('core/layout')->getUpdate()->getHandles(); var_dump($handles); If you're working on front-end code and trying to stick to magento conventions, it's probably better to add a layout.xml file to your module, and use the layout file to add your blocks. It's less fun than figuring out something new though!
