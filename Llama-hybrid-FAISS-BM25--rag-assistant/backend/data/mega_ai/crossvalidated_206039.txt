Logistic regression doesn't fit this Infection risk analysis. Wrong model?

I am looking at a logistic regression model for predicting hospital acquired infection likelihood (HAI) from predictors of whether germs are found on the x number of patients (Patient), x number of environmental spots (Env), x number of air samples (Air) or x number of nurses' hands (Hand). Month Patient Env Air Hand HAI HAIcat BedOccupancy 1 4 0 0 1 1 yes 9 2 2 0 2 0 0 no 9 3 2 1 0 1 0 no 5 4 1 2 0 2 2 yes 7 5 2 3 0 1 1 yes 6 6 1 2 0 0 1 yes 5 7 4 0 0 2 1 yes 7 8 2 0 0 1 3 yes 7 9 3 2 2 0 1 yes 8 10 3 0 0 1 1 yes 8 For example for Month 1, the percentage of HAI would be HAI/BedOccupancy=1/9. So I'd like to know if bed occupancy or other contamination is significant in predicting HAI. I run a Logistic regression, but it says it's junk. What does a statistician do now? model But I get a bad fit and non-significant correlation: Call: glm(formula = cbind(MR$HAI, MR$BedOccupancy) ~ MR$Patient + MR$Env + MR$Air + MR$Hand, family = "binomial") Deviance Residuals: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -0.12882 -1.08046 -1.33787 0.01400 -0.10685 -0.02229 -0.04008 1.03688 0.75723 -0.23824 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
