Counterintuitive Augmented Dickey Fuller test results

I am trying to determine wether the time series data I have is (covariance) stationary or not. This is the hourly data: I proceeded to look at the acf as well as pacf plots in order to determine what kind of stochastic process might underlie the data. Looking at the plots I would strongly assume that the data follows an AR(1) process, which to my understanding implies that the expected mean of the data $E(y_t)$ has to be 0 in order for the data to be covariance stationary ( Wooldridge "Introductory Econometrics" pp.371) . This is obviously not the case. So simply based on that, I would assume that the data is not covariance stationary . Yet, computing the Augmented Dickey Fuller Test in R results in the following > adf.test(Data_H_XTS$Data) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: Data_H_XTS$Data Dickey-Fuller = -4.6938, Lag order = 20, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Warning message: In adf.test(Data_H_XTS$Data) : p-value smaller than printed p-value Is my above mentioned conclusion wrong? Or is the Augmented Dickey Fuller Test wrongly specified (i.e. the k-parameter, which is $P_{max}=[12(\frac{T}{100})^{1/4}]$ where T is the number of observations)? My goal is to use this data in some kind of model so this diagnosis is basically the first step and right now, I am unsure what to do. Edit : I think I might have mixed something up. In an AR(1) process $E(y_t)$ does not have to be 0, but rather constant, correct me if I am wrong.
