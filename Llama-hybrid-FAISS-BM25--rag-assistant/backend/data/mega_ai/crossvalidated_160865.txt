How to combine multiple time series or linear models?

What would be the best suited method to analyze the following: Week Location Revenue($MM) TrainingEvent 1 abc 1.2 0 2 abc 1.2 1 3 abc 1.6 0 4 abc 1.5 0 .... abc ... ... 1 xyz 2.1 0 2 xyz 2.0 0 3 xyz 2.2 1 4 xyz 2.9 0 ... xyz ... ... The idea is that there are several hundred locations and 1 year worth of weeks, and training is conducted periodically to coach employees on proper sales techniques. I want to quantify the impact of training on revenue in future weeks. Rather than performing several hundred linear regressions with lagged variables and/or time series ARIMA type models, and somehow determining an average effect after standardizing the revenue variable, I'd like to think there is some sort of method that will essentially allow me to do all of this as one model. Any suggestions?
