Add New Object Class in Deep Learning Network

Assuming that I have a trained deep learning network that can detect 10 classes of objects (road, sky, tree, etc.) in images. It takes in RGB images and outputs a probability map of size (img_col, img_row, n_class) , and the final segmentation will be a argmax operation over the last dimension. Now I want to add a new class to the network, for example, pedestrians, so that after training, the network will be able to detect pedestrians in images. But I no longer have the old training data. Instead, I've got a new dataset which also contains pedestrians, but only the pedestrians are labeled . Training with the new dataset (using the old weights as initialization) will be the most straightforward way, but I would like to hear some other approaches. Could anyone share some thoughts on how to realize this?
