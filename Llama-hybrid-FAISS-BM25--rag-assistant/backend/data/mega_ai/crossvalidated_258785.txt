Covariance in Gaussian Process

I am a little confused over formula for calculating covariance in Gaussian process (addition of variance always confuses me as it is not always explicitly denoted). The origin of confusion is that the formulas are given in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop and Gaussian process for Machine Learning by Rasmussen are different. Mean of GP is given by relation: $$\mu = K(X_*, X)[K(X,X)+\sigma^2\mathrm{I}]^{-1}y$$ Variance according to Bishop (page no: 308) is: $$\Sigma = [K(X_*, X_*)+\sigma^2] - K(X_*, X)[K(X,X)+\sigma^2\mathrm{I}]^{-1}K(X, X_*)$$ Variance according to Rasmussen (page no: 16) is: $$\Sigma = K(X_*, X_*) - K(X_*, X)[K(X,X)+\sigma^2\mathrm{I}]^{-1}K(X, X_*)$$ My doubt is whether the variance is there or not in first term in RHS for covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Or have I messed up things? Let me know if I need to provide more information.
