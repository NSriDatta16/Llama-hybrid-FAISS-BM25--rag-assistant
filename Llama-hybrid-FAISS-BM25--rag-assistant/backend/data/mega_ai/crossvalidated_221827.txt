As @Peter said, ordinal logistic regression is the approach to use if y is ordinal. There are several options in R. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/93482 for a good description of these options. If your data collection involved repeated measures, then you should consider the Ordinal package, which implements mixed model ordinal regression.
