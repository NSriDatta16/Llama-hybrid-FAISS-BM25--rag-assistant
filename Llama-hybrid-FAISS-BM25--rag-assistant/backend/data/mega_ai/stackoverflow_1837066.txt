My company is in the same sort of situation. We have a custom developed framework in Perl that never seems to get quite as much attention paid to developing new features and fixing bugs as the open source frameworks do. I and most other developers would love to switch to something open source for the benefits you mention, but nobody has the budget to spend the time porting code over. Our current plan is to use an open source framework if we have any small, new projects come up, and if that's successful consider moving older apps over. I've mostly worked with Perl and Ruby, but a trend I'm seeing more of these days is frameworks allowing you to mix and match framework core components. For example, we're considering integrating parts of our custom framework into Catalyst . That way we can still use some of our custom developed code components (our own DBI class and some Mason templates) and porting our applications won't be as difficult. Ruby on Rails is also moving in the direction of being more modular. Perhaps there's a PHP framework that might allow you to use some of your code, or at least make it easier to shoehorn some of your code into the framework instead of starting from scratch. Googling I see most of the PHP frameworks claim to be modular, but some appear to just allow you to develop add-ons, not swap out core components. Sounds like you're doing some good analysis and I wish you luck in your search.
