Country is a categorical variable, so you should definitely use dummy encoding. I do not know Stata, so I am not sure what Stata did in the other case, but nevertheless it does not matter, since you should only do the analysis with Country represented as a dummy. Looking at the odds ratios (and their standard errors), it certainly looks like Country is an important variable, but note that with logistic regression, those asymptotic results (based on a normal approximation to the log likelihood function) can be terrible, so don't trust them as is. This is the Hauck-Donner phenomenon. What you should do is to test the variable Country as a whole, which you can do by fitting a model without that variable, then with it (otherwise identical), and compare the loglikelihoods. There could be a direct way of doing it in Stata. But there are also other problems with binomial GLMs (generalized linear models), so you need some serious study before using them! For instance, overdispersion . You should check for that also, as a matter of routine. You could also have a look at Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? .
