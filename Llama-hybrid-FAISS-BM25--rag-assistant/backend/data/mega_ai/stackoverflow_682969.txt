Hash Join Showing up on Full Text Query - SQL Server 2005

I have the following Query in SQL Server 2005: SELECT PRODUCT_ID FROM PRODUCTS P WHERE SUPPLIER_ORGANIZATION_ID = 13225 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 'Y' AND CONTAINS(*, 'FORMSOF(Inflectional, "%clip%") ') What's interesting is that using this generates a Hash Match whereas if I use a different SUPPLIER_ORGANIZATION_ID (older supplier), it uses a Merge Join. Obviously the Hash is much slower than the Merge Join. What I don't get is why there is a difference, and what's needed to make it run faster? FYI, there are about 5 million records in the PRODUCTS table. When supplier organization id is selected (13225), there are about 25000 products for that supplier. Thanks in advance.
