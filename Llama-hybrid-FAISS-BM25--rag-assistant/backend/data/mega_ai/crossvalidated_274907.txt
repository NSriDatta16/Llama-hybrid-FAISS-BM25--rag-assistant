I think you're describing an impact of model uncertainty - you worry that your inference about an unknown parameter $x$ in light of data $d$ is conditional upon a model, $m$, $$ p (x|d, m), $$ as well as the data. What if $m$ is an implausible model? If there exist alternative models, with the same unknown parameter $x$, then you can marginalize model uncertainty with Bayesian model averaging, $$ p (x|d) = \sum_m p (x|d, m) p(m|d) $$ though this is a functional of the models considered and their priors. If , on the other hand, the definition of parameter $x$ is intrinsically tied to the model $m$, such that there are no alternatives, it's hardly surprising that inferences about $x$ are conditional on $m$.
