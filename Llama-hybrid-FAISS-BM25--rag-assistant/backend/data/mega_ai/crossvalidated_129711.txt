You already got two valid answers but let me add my two cents. Bayes theorem is often defined as: $$P(\text{model}~ | ~\text{data}) \propto P(\text{model}) \times P(\text{data}~|~\text{model})$$ because the only reason why you need the constant is so that it integrates to 1 (see the answers by others). This is not needed in most MCMC simulation approaches to Bayesian analysis and hence the constant is dropped from the equation. So for most simulations it is not even required. I love the description by Kruschke : the last puppy (constant) is sleepy because he has nothing to do in the formula. Also some, like Andrew Gelman, consider the constant as "overrated" and "basically meaningless when people use flat priors" (check the discussion here ).
