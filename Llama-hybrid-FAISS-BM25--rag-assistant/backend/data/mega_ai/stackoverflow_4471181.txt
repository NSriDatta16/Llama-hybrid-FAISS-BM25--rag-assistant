Good method to handle large amounts of unused or deprecated feature implemenations in code

What i am currently doing is removing all the old code while not trying to break anything, manually. The Question is: Would you remove the old Code, or hope that it may awake some time ... zombie - like Do you think that it is worth the Effort to remove the Code (less work to find stuff in the clutter, better test coverage, easier for other people to find their way) Should we keep the Code somewhere, as a reference? ( We are using Version Control, but i find it is pretty hard to find old code in the Revision Jungle ... any tips for that? ) Do you have arguments for convincing the team / management / developers that wrote said code? Reasons to not deprecate and then delete Code? TL;DR: Delete unused code or leave it as it is? Discuss! u
