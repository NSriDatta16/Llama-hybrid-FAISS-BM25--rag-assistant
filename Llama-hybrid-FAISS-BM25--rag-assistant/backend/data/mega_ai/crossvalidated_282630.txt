Designing better Metropolis-Hastings proposal distributions (for correlated parameters)

Question: Is there a rule of thumb for setting a non-diagonal covariance matrix for your Metropolis-Hastings proposal distribution? References are appreciated. Background: Say I have some posterior distribution I am interested in obtaining samples from $p(\theta|y)$. I choose an initial proposal distribution for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is $$ q(\theta^*|\theta) = \text{N}(\theta^*; \theta, \text{diag}[\sigma_1^2, \ldots, \sigma_p^2]). $$ Notice that the covariance matrix is diagonal. I choose the elements of this diagonal covariance matrix according to some other rule of thumb (e.g. $\sigma_i \overset{set}{=}2.38/\sqrt{d}).$ It goes for a while, but then it gets stuck. I assume that this is because of the fact that elements of $\theta$ are correlated. Is there any justification for setting $q$'s correlation matrix to the sample correlation matrix? Here's a pairwise scatterplot of all the iterations: Edit: I just opened my copy of a Bayesian textbook, and it describes something similar to what I suggested. It's a little light on references, though. So I am primarily interested in references, here.
