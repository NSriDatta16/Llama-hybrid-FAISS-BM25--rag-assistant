I am actually still struggling with the same problem (a year later ... need iOS 3.0 compatibility). The rotation part was easy. However, the views and buttons don't seem to process touch and move/drag events. I've verified that the window (UIWindow) is receiving the touch events and at the right locations. It's as if the last 1/3 of the screen (i.e. 480-320) doesn't propagate events to receivers after a rotation to landscape from portrait. The example in the link by slf doesn't help since the rotated view controller doesn't have responders. I just figured it out after some view digging. So, I was rotating the viewController.view and doing a bunch of setNeedsLayout on subviews of viewController.view. However, what I needed to do was [self.navigationController.view setNeedsLayout]. That one call fixed everything for me. For whatever reason, the navigationController.view wasn't passing touch events to the part of the subviews that were previously hidden (as far as the frame/bound is concerned). That actually fixed a number of other issues as well.
