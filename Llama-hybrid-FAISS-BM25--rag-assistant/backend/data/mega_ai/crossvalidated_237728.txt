Good defaults of hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms have to be found empirically on datasets (if there would be a good theory for setting them, they would not be a hyperparameter anymore). Probably it has shown good performances for the creator of the specific package on some datasets, so he has chosen this value. I am doing some studies on many datasets and one of my aims is to find the best defaults in general.
