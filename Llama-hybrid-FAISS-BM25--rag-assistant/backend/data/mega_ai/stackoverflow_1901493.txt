How can i be notified that the user is logging out?

I am writing a user agent that needs to perform some cleanup when the user logs out of OS X. The agent is NOT receiving a SIGINT (neither SIGTERM, and neither SIGKILL) signal. Because of this, the agent process is remaining as a "ghost" process running on the Mac, and it will no longer respond to any attempts I do to kill it. I need to be notified that the user is logging out and then I can handle the shut-down of the Agent gracefully. I know about the CFNotificationCenter, but I could not find any example on how to use it for logout. Actually I did not find a list describing the possible notifications (at least the standard ones) that I can observe using the CFNotificationCenter. Can anyone help me please ? Regards Alan
