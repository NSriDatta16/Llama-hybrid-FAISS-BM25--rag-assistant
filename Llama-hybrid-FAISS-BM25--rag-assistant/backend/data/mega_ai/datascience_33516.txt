Newly installed Pollution Control Sensory Platforms are dumping Continous/Discrete Environment Pollution Parametric Data from various locations. Whats the best format structured or Unstructured of data storing efficient from day one and compatible to ML ? What should be the strategy : Supervised or Reinforced or UnSupervised form of ML ? End objective is to predict the pollution levels in a specific route and recommend/alert the time for Bicycling , Walking and Running for sports enthusiasts .
