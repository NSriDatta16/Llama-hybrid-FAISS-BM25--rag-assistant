Non-Continuous Time Series Forecasting

I have the following time series that contains the past 12 months data as well as data for the 24 th month:- Time Sales 2021-06-30 0.00 2021-07-31 64.40 2021-08-31 82.61 2021-09-30 93.37 2021-10-31 97.74 2021-11-30 98.56 2021-12-31 103.01 2022-01-31 104.97 2022-02-28 108.55 2022-03-31 115.36 2022-04-30 123.87 2022-05-31 122.36 (12th month observation) 2023-05-31 978.88 (24th month observation, which is 8 times that of sales for 12th month observation) Here, the 24 th month sales can have value anywhere between 2 times to 8 times the sales appeared for the 12 th month. While forecasting the sales for the 13 th month to the 23 rd month time period ( 2022-06-30 to 2023-04-30 ), I want the original scale to be maintained among the forecasted sales values for these 11 months and the 24 th month sales , otherwise there would be a high difference reflected between the 23 rd month sales and the 24 th month sales . Here, the point of concern is that the time series that needs to be fed as input to the model is not continuous, as can be seen from the data sample mentioned above, and that I need to perform reverse forecasting for these 11 months as I already have data for the 24 th month. Any help/suggestion/advice on how to solve this problem would be highly appreciated.
