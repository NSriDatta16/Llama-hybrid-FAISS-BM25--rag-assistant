Well they're not quite the same; servlet-context-scope is private to the webapp, whereas static scope is private to the classloader. Depending on your container and how it's configured, these may or may not be the same. When thinking in terms of webapps and JavaEE, using a context-coped field is going to be more reliably portable. Also, context-scoped attributes are easier to access from JSPs, i.e. you don't need scriptlets to get to them.
