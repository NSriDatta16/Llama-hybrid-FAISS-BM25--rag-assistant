I don't fully see what you're really asking here.... but I'll try to give some tips anyway. Relaying messages or routing is not very well supported in WCF in .NET 3.5 - the infrastructure is there, but it's still a lot of work to set it up manually. The best intro I know into this topic for WCF in .NET 3.5 is a two-part article by Michele Leroux Bustamante on MSDN magazine: Building a WCF Router, Part 1 Building a WCF Router, Part 2 Part 2 has a section on duplex routers - does that help you in your quest at all?? WCF in .NET 4.0 promises to bring additional support for routing - there will be a RoutingService base class which can be leveraged to write routing services, and it will allow for configurable, content- or metadata-based routing - whatever it is that you need. .NET 4.0 is scheduled to be released sometime later this year (2009) - hopefully! So while this is still the future, it's looking rosy! Marc
