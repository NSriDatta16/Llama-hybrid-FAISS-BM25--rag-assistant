This is by no means a comprehensive or an elegant solution, but I found using negative margins on adjacent elements can "cover" the animation. I don't know if this method works in all cases, but for my particular case it worked. The animation appeared next to a binded text field, to the right of which was a submit button. The layer was floated to the right. I used negative margin on the submit button and it covered the animation without affecting the layer alignment. Another measure I did was to check the layer structure, and added the following code to my css be sure: #TitleNameloadingicon {visibility:hidden;} #TitleName_cf_button {visibility:hidden;} #TitleNameautosuggest {background-color:#ffffff;}
