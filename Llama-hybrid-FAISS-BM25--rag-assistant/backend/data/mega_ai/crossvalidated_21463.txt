Voting in Multi-Class SVM

I am currently trying to classify 6 class of facial expression using SVM. I am using MATLAB and LIBSVM to do my classification. The problem i face is the pred label below produces 0 and 1. It treats it as binary classifer. I am able to do multi-class svm but there is one more step that is voting or sum-pooling which i am not sure how to do it. Need some help in it. Code: u=unique(TrainLabel); N=length(u); if(N>2) itr=1; classes=0; while((classes~=1)&&(itr Any help is appreciated
