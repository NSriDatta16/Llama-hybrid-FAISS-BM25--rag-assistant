Determine drift

I would like to determine potential drift in the data/device. Is there a general acknowledged procedure and/or method to do so? I know how to visually "detect" a drift but I would like to know how to describe it mathematically. And also how to prove it statistically. Btw, is there a difference between drift and trend? I guess the later applies only to a time series while the first one doesn't need to?
