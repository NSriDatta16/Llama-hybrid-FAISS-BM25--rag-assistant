+1 to Dimitriy's answer. To elaborate this a bit more: The average treatment effect in the population is: $E[\tau] = E[Y^1 -Y^0] = E[Y^1]- E[Y^0]$. We can drop the subscript $i$ not because we assume constant effect but because we assume the expected causal effect of a randomly selected individual from the population to be equal to the average causal effect across individuals in the population.
