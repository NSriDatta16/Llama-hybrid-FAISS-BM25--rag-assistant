You can consult the following page for more information: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y31yhkeb.aspx Unsafe code provides the ability to declare pointers for virtually any primitive variable (fundamental types); you're allowed to cast between pointer types. Pointer arithmetic is based on the storage size of the pointer type, so applying post-increment or post-decrement to a pointer will increase the address by sizeof(type).
