jQueryUI dialog - button text not appearing

I have a strange error occurring with the dialog box, I'm loading the dialog box fine, but whenever I assign a button to it, although it'll display the button, it won't display the name of the button. Here is my code that launches the dialog successfully... jQuery('#'+message_div_id).dialog({ modal: ui_popup_modal , width: ui_popup_width , height: ui_popup_height , resizable: false , draggable: false , buttons: { "Ok": function() { jQuery( this ).dialog( "close" ); } } }); This is the resulting html from bugzilla after the popup has loaded... The span class is the area that should contain the text, but as you can see, it is not. Any ideas?
