Packaging a magento extension

I have a magento script which works fine through FTP upload to store. I want to package it as an extension. I have read many articles about it but seems not to be very helpful, either due to changes on magento site or the articles are not indepth enough. http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/7_-_magento_connect/packaging_a_magento_extension http://asia-connect.com.vn/2009/07/packaging-a-magento-extension/ Anyway, how can i navigate to this page? seems its not possible. Any help? thanks. Admin Panel: » System » Magento Connect » Package Extensions
