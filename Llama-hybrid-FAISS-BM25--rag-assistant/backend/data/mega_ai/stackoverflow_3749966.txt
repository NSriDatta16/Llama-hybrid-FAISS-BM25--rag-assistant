Delphi: How can I add a new category in ActionManager?

I'd like my actions to be organized in categories, but in the "Categories" box, I can't add a new category. When I click add standard action, it has different categories like "Edit", "Internet",... . Is it even possible to have custom categories or I am stuck with default categories?
