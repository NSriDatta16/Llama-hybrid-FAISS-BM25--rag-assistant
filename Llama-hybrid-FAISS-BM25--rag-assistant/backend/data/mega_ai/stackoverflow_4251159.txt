Set python indent to 2 spaces in emacs 23?

I am using emacs 23.1.1 on Ubuntu 10.04. I wish to program in Python with a 2-space indent. emacs looks to have a default mode for python (python.el?). I put the following in my .emacs: ;; Only spaces, no tabs (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) ;; Always end a file with a newline (setq require-final-newline nil) ;; Don't know which of these might work (setq-default tab-width 2) (setq-default python-indent 2) (setq-default py-indent-offset 2) When I edit a Python file, it uses a 4-space indent. When I try C-h v python-indent it says: python-indent's value is 4 Local in buffer webpage_cache.py; global value is 2 This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value satisfies the predicate `integerp'. Documentation: Number of columns for a unit of indentation in Python mode. See also `M-x python-guess-indent' You can customize this variable. That is, it is 4, not 2. Grr. I tried customizing the variable and saving, still 4. I tried customize-group indent, still 4. How do I get emacs to pay attention?
