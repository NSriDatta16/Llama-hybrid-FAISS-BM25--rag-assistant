jQuery: The scrollbar sticks when i click it, causing it to scroll when my mouse isn't down. (with jsfiddle example)

http://jsfiddle.net/nicktheandroid/7raYa/9/ My script allows me to scroll the page like a PDF, allowing you to grab the page and drag down or up. My problem, is that when i use the scrollbar, then mouseup from the scroll bar, the scrollbar will stick and scroll with my mouse up and down, even though my mouse is up. So when clicking on the scrollbar, its like i never moused up. how do I fix this? THANKS!
