You have to create a new formula field just for the Report Footer. So if your detail formula is like this: {Test.Cost} / {Test.Qty} Then you need to create new formula with the following: Sum ({Test.Cost}) / Sum ({Test.Qty}) and place it in the Report Footer. This will return the correct average ( 300 / 4 = 75 ) EDIT: If you want to do this for a Group Footer a similar principle applies. You have to create a new formula field and add it to the Group Footer. If you were grouping by the Category field for instance then your formula to calculate the average over the group would look like this: Sum ({Test.Cost}, {Test.Category}) / Sum ({Test.Qty}, {Test.Category})
