The two-horse-race should be modeled as a binomial logistic model, with Candidate 1 winning coded as a 1, and Candidate 2 coded as 0, Using (in R): glm(..., family = 'binomial') The answer to this question is the 3-horse-race of (Trump, Kasich, Cruz) should be modeled as a Multinomial logit model, coding a win for Candidate 1 as 1, Candidate 2, as 2, and Candidate 3 as 3. Then using R (as mentioned in the last paragraph), this website provides a walkthrough of how to model the outcomes of the race. http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/ ml$prog2
