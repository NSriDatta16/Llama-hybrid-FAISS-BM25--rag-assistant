The code shown here is a recursive implementation of dynamic programming used for time series analysis for similiarity, there is though a more optimal implementation named Fast Dynamic Time Warping which significantly reduces time and memory complexity to $O(n)$. You will see a significant improvement from original DTW although the measured distance will be directly impacted depending on the distance measurement used (usually is the ecludidean distance as shown here). But there are others that would provide better results depending on the time series nature.
