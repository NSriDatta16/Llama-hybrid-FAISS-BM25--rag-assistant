Table 2 in the paper by " Sensitivity Analysis in Observational Research: Introducing the E-Value " by Tyler J. VanderWeele and Peng Ding summarises how to approximate risk ratio from odds ratio. Also, from what I understand, odds in logistic regression based on case-control data cannot be used to calculate probability, therefore, cannot be directly used to calculate risk.
