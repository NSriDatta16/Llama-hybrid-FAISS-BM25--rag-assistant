Marking as a community wiki. Overview Blog post comparing of ColdFusion and Railo - comments are just as interesting. Aggregation of items I've called "notable": Open Bluedragon Web based line debugger : Adobe Eclipse based is finicky. Memcached intregration : Adobe ehcache solution works well, but memcached still appears to have better failover and sharding. In fact, sharding appears to only be available in Adobe with Terracotta or rolling your own. Runs on Google App Engine Railo : video transcoding, pay feature, but low cost, free option is ffmpeg , but that has legal question marks cluster scope : interesting way of solving messaging between servers, pay feature.
