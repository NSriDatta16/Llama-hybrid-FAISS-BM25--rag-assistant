Using an array and a loop and the push function

what I'm trying to do is to get 4 movieclipps (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3, leaf4) to play the sound that is attached to them when is dragged onto another movieclip (NatureTarget) and the play button is pressed so that the sounds are played in the order they are dragged on. I know I need to use an array and the push function and a loop...but I am lost. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks.
