I call those types of methods "copy methods" . While the clone() method creates an exact copy, a copy method makes a copy of an instance, usually with an implied or explicit variation. For example, String#toUpperCase() would be a copy method of the immutable String class - it copies an instance with a variation: it upcases all the letters. I would consider withOffset() method in your example to be a similar copy method. I don't know of any references that document the term "copy method". I'm borrowing the term "copy" from its use in C++: copy constructors and the "copy" naming guideline from the Taligent Coding Standards ( more info ). As for the term "fluent factory methods", I don't know why "fluent" would make a difference, since a "fluent interface" is just an API style (separate from the builder pattern). If the term "factory method" doesn't apply here, I don't see how calling it a "fluent factory method" makes it apply any better.
