If an OLS model is estimated without an intercept (no constant term) but the average residual is close to zero, are we OK?

Let's suppose an OLS model is estimated without an intercept (no constant term), but the mean residual is very close to zero (2.2E-11) does that mean the model is OK to have been estimated without a constant term? P.S.: All the variables are standardized to have zero mean and 1 standard deviation.
