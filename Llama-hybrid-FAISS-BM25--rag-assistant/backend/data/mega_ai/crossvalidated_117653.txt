If you have 20 "good time series" one could test the hypothesis of a common set of parameters using the CHOW test which is incorporated in a commercial piece of software that I have helped develop . Alternatively one could write code to estimate the common parameters based upon the 20 samples and then perform the required F test. Now given that you have been able to conclude about a common set one could then introduce a "new time series" and test the hypothesis that the parameters from this new time series are similar i.e. not statistically significantly different from the common set.
