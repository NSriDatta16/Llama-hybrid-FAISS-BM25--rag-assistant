Python / Django - Organizing Stylesheets and Scripts

I am looking for a simple way to organize stylesheets and scripts in Django. I am relatively new to the framework and language of python. I'm coming from a PHP background. In the world of PHP / Zend there are functions that are implemented with the view/layout object. By including a single line inside your head tag for scripts and for stylsheets you can easily add a stylesheet/script in the view -> method level. I have read the Django Form Media Documentation, but this only pertains to forms needing specific styles and scripts. Any direction?
