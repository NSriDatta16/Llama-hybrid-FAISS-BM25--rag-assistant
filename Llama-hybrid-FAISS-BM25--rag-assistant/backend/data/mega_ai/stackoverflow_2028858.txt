The default way of documenting C# code in Visual Studio is by XML documentation comments . In my opinion this is the best way to go for C# code because support for this is already integrated in Visual Studio (comment tag auto completion, warning about missing or incorrectly spelled parameters, ...). To document a method, just type three slashes ( /// ) in front of the method body, and Visual Studio will insert an empty comment template for you to fill, like so: /// /// /// /// private void Foo(int bar) { // ... } You can configure Visual Studio to generate an XML file from all the comments, which would then be fed into a documentation generator like Sandcastle . If you want to use Doxygen , this is no problem as it supports parsing XML comments. To sum up: I would recommend to use XML comments over special Doxygen comments for C# code. This way you have all the options. You can generate documentation in the standard Doxygen layout your organization is familiar with (becauses Doxygen supports XML comments) plus you have the option to generate documentation in a format known to .NET developers (with Sandcastle and Sandcastle Help FileBuilder ). Ah, and also try GhostDoc ...
