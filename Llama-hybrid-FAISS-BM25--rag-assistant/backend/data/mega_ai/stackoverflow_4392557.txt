Need help with a syntax error (COBOL)

I am working on my last homework assignment for COBOL this semester and I am being hit with a syntax error that is stopping my progress cold. Here is what I got: ENVIRONMENT DIVISION. INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION. FILE-CONTROL. SELECT USED-CAR-FILE-OUT ASSIGN TO 'USED-CAR.RPT' ORGANIZATION IS LINE SEQUENTIAL. DATA DIVISION. FILE SECTION. FD USED-CAR-FILE-OUT. 01 USED-CAR-RECORD-OUT PIC X(80). WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 ID-CODE PIC X(3). 01 TOTAL-CASH-PAYMENT PIC 9(5). 01 MONTHLY-PAYMENT PIC 9(4). 01 NUMBER-OF-MONTHS PIC 9(3). 01 BALANCE-TOTAL PIC S9(6)V99 VALUE ZEROS. 01 INTEREST-EARNED PIC S99V99 VALUE ZEROS. 01 COMPARE-MONTH PIC 99 VALUE ZEROS. 01 YEAR-NUMBER PIC 99 VALUE ZEROS. 01 MONTH-NUMBER PIC 99 VALUE ZEROS. 01 DETAIL-LINE. 05 ID-CODE-DL PIC X(3). 05 PIC X(3) VALUE SPACES. 05 PIC X(4) VALUE 'Yr='. 05 YEAR-NUMBER-DL PIC Z9 VALUE ZEROS. 05 PIC X(4) VALUE SPACES. 05 PIC X(4) VALUE 'Mo='. 05 MONTH-NUMBER-DL PIC Z9. 05 PIC X(4) VALUE SPACES. 05 PIC X(5) VALUE 'Pmt='. 05 PAYMENT-DL PIC $$$,$$$. 05 PIC X(4) VALUE SPACES. 05 PIC X(5) VALUE 'Int='. 05 INTEREST-EARNED-DL PIC $$$$.99. 05 PIC X(3) VALUE SPACES. 05 PIC X(5) VALUE 'Bal='. 05 BALANCE-DL PIC $$$,$$$.99. PROCEDURE DIVISION. 100-MAIN. OPEN OUTPUT USED-CAR-FILE-OUT PERFORM 200-INPUT THRU 299-EXIT CLOSE USED-CAR-FILE-OUT STOP RUN. 200-INPUT. DISPLAY 'Used Car Sales Report' DISPLAY 'Enter the ID Code (or END) - maximum three char.' ACCEPT ID-CODE IF ID-CODE = 'END' GO TO 299-EXIT END-IF DISPLAY 'Enter the Total Cash Payment - maximum five digits' ACCEPT TOTAL-CASH-PAYMENT DISPLAY 'Enter the Monthly Payment - maximum four digits' ACCEPT MONTHLY-PAYMENT DISPLAY 'Enter the Number of Months - maximum three digits' ACCEPT NUMBER-OF-MONTHS PERFORM 300-PROCESS. 299-EXIT. EXIT. 300-PROCESS. IF TOTAL-CASH-PAYMENT > 0 MOVE TOTAL-CASH-PAYMENT TO PAYMENT-DL END-IF IF MONTHLY-PAYMENT > 0 MOVE MONTHLY-PAYMENT TO PAYMENT-DL END-IF ADD PAYMENT-DL TO BALANCE-TOTAL COMPUTE INTEREST-EARNED ROUNDED = .0175 / BALANCE-TOTAL ADD INTEREST-EARNED TO BALANCE-TOTAL MOVE BALANCE-TOTAL TO BALANCE-DL ADD 1 TO COMPARE-MONTH IF MONTH-NUMBER-DL > 13 ADD 1 TO MONTH-NUMBER MOVE MONTH-NUMBER TO MONTH-NUMBER-DL END-IF IF MONTH-NUMBER-DL = 13 MOVE 1 TO MONTH-NUMBER MOVE MONTH-NUMBER TO MONTH-NUMBER-DL END-IF IF MONTH-NUMBER = 1 ADD 1 TO YEAR-NUMBER MOVE YEAR-NUMBER TO YEAR-NUMBER-DL END-IF MOVE DETAIL-LINE TO USED-CAR-RECORD-OUT WRITE USED-CAR-RECORD-OUT AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE IF TOTAL-CASH-PAYMENT > 0 MOVE 0 TO TOTAL-CASH-PAYMENT MOVE 0 TO PAYMENT-DL END-IF IF COMPARE-MONTH > NUMBER-OF-MONTHS PERFORM 300-PROCESS END-IF The problem is with PAYMENT-DL, INTEREST-EARNED-DL and BALANCE-DL. It says that an illegal character, but I know that it should work as it shows those pic clauses in my book and the teacher handed out an incomplete version of the program that I have to write. What do I have to do to get rid of those errors?
