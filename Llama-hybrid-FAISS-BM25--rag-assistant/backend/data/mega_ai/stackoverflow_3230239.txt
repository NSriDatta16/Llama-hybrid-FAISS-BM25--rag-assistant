Subversion does have a concept of changesets, you can specify a changeset with the -c option . You can merge individual changesets, or a range of changesets. Behind the scenes, this is actually how Subversion stores each commit, in /db/revs/ (for file based storage at least). What I see as an advantage in Git compared to Subversion, is that when merging multiple changsets from branch A to branch B, branch B retains each individual changeset, while in Subversion it gets squeezed together as one changeset and it "looks" like all changes are done by the user who committed the merge. While you can follow the history back to the old branch to see each changeset in Subversion, it's not that convenient. Git also has some powerful commands to see the differences of changesets between branches. The merge tracking introduced in Subversion 1.5 tries to do something like this, but is IMHO overcomplicated and not intuitive.
