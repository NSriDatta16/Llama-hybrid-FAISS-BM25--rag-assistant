What options does a person have for showing evidence in favour of the null hypothesis?

I have a linear mixed-effects model with a theoretically important null result. Of course a reviewer asked for a Bayesian approach to "show evidence" for it. However I am struggling with Bayes Factors because of their dependence on a prior, and in this case, my best bet seems to just be trying it with a range of default priors. I don't find this very convincing. I wonder if there are other, better, options?
