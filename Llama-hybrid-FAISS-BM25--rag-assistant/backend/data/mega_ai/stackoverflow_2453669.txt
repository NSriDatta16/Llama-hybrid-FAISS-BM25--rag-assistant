I've run into a similar problem, when trying to paginate a resultset using an associated model. I ended up having to manually bind my models together, run the query, and then unbind them in order to get Cake to contain the right data together. ( http://book.cakephp.org/view/86/Creating-and-Destroying-Associations-on-the-Fly ) You could also try the containable behaviour which will allow you to specify which models you want to include in your result set. Containable is core in 1.2+ ( http://book.cakephp.org/view/474/Containable ), otherwise you'll need to grab it yourself. I'm not too sure on why you have such a gargantuan query there though. I would be more inclined to do something similar to the following. $this->Model->recursive = 2; $this->Model->paginate(); And let Cake get all the related data for me through my associations. Then I would adjust the return using a conditions array ( http://api.cakephp.org/class/controller#method-Controllerpaginate ) to specify the category. Sorry it's not a defacto solution, but I'm a CakePHP amateur myself! You might find it easier to view the queries, results etc, using DebugKit, http://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit
