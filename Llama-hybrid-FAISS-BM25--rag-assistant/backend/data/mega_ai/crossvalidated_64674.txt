Confused with MCMC Metropolis-Hastings variations: Random-Walk, Non-Random-Walk, Independent, Metropolis

Over the past few weeks I have been trying to understand MCMC and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm(s). Every time I think I understand it I realise that I am wrong. Most of the code examples I find on-line implement something that is not consistent with the description. i.e.: They say they implement Metropolis-Hastings but they actually implement random-walk metropolis. Others (almost always) silently skip the implementation of the Hastings correction ratio because they are using a symmetric proposal distribution. Actually, I haven't found a single simple example that calculates the ratio so far. That makes me even more confused. Can someone give me code examples (in any language) of the following: Vanilla Non-Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm with Hastings correction ratio calculation (even if this will end up being 1 when using a symmetric proposal distribution). Vanilla Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Vanilla Independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. No need to provide the Metropolis algorithms because if I am not mistaken the only difference between Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings is that the first ones always sample from a symmetric distribution and thus they don't have the Hastings correction ratio. No need to give detailed explanation of the algorithms. I do understand the basics but I am kinda confused with all the different names for the different variations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm but also with how you practically implement the Hastings correction ratio on the Vanilla non-random-walk MH. Please don't copy paste links that partially answer my questions because most likely I have already seen them. Those links led me to this confusion. Thank you.
