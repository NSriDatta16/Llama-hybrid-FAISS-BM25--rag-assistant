Debugging services is a pain, particularly since startup seems to be when many of the problems manifest (at least for us). What we typically do is extract as much of the logic as possible to a single class that has start and stop methods. Those class methods are all that the service calls directly. We then create a WinForm application that has two buttons: one to invoke start, another to invoke stop. We can then run this WinForm applicaiton directly from the debugger and see what is happening. Not the most elegant solution, but it works for us.
