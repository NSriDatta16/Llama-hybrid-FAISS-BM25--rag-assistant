Something to research a bit further here. SQL Server 2005+ has the function - ENCRYPTBYKEY and its mate DECRYPTBYKEY EncryptByKey Params: key_GUID - the GUID of the key to be used to encrypt the cleartext. uniqueidentifier. This requires you to have a SYMMETRIC KEY open on the server. cleartex - some text to be encrypted Returns a varbinary up to 8000. If you wanted to leverage these methods, you could create a column of type varbinary up to 8000, and save the output here. I'd be interested to hear comments on real world usages of this function, and any anecdotes on its performance.
