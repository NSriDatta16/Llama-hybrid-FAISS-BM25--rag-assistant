For each pair of strategies (x,y) you can easily test your hypothesis using CLT for proportions (see for example here ). Your null hypothesis would be "no strategy is better" or p = 0.5, and your alternative hypothesis may be p is smaller / larger / different than 0.5. Since you have n strategies, we need to better define what a 'better strategy' is. If you carefully select a sample of k n (n-1) games, where there are k games for each pair of strategies, then define n subgroups, where subgroup s contains all the k*(n-1) games of strategy s , a null hypothesis "strategy s is not better that average" would again translate to p(s) = 0.5 for subgroup s . If your alternative hypothesis is "strategy s is worse / better / different than average" - you may repeat the same test as before. As for draws, I would count them as half-win half-loss - to keep p(s) = 0.5. If the null hypothesis is "strategy s is not better than all others" and your alternative hypothesis is "strategy s in better than all others", you may use the method suggested by Dan Nettleton in "Testing for the Supremacy of a Multinomial Cell Probability" (available here ) or the method suggested by Alessio Farcomeni in "Testing Supremacy or Inferiority of Multinomial Cell Probabilities with Application to Biting Preferences of Loggerhead Marine Turtles" (available here ).
