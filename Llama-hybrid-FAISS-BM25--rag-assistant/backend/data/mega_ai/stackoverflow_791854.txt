How do I consolidate my Xcode project files?

When I started working on my first app, i assumed dragging files into xcode put them in my project's actual directory. Not so. Apparently Xcode references them all on the desktop. Is there an easy way to copy all referenced files into the project directory? My desktop is a mess.
