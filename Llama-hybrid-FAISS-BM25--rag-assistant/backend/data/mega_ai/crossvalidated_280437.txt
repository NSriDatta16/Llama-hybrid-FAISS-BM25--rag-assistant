Summarize multiple distributions into one, specifically in the topic modeling context

My specific case is this: There are a number of categories (Science, Health, Religion, etc.), each containing multiple documents. Assume for documents within each category, I perform topic modeling (LDA) with 10 topics ($k=10$). For example, for the Science category, each topic will correspond to Biology, Chemistry, etc. The topic distribution, $\theta_{category=c}^d$, for each one of the documents, shows how likely it is that they are generated by each of those 10 topic. In this example, $\theta_{category=c}^d$ will be a list of size 10. I want to get the topic distribution over all documents of category $c$, $\theta_{category=c}$. A simple way that I have seen people use is to average each element of $\theta_{category=c}^d$: $$ \theta_{category=c} = mean(\theta_{category=c}^d)$$ But it seems very naive. Is there a better, more rigorous way to combine all these distributions into one?
