Unable to unbind the window beforeunload event in Jquery

I have a page where the user can drag and drop objects and save them as an image.When a user navigates away from the page, the event beforeunload is fired. Now, this happens every time. What i want to do is, unbind the event if the user has saved his work, so that the message may not pop up again.To do this i have used the unbind method in jQuery . But, it does not seem to work. Below is the code for binding and unbinding the events. var notSaved = function() { return 'You have not yet saved your work.Do you want to continue? Doing so, may cause loss of your work' ; } $(window).bind('beforeunload', notSaved); After save method has been called, $(window).unbind('beforeunload', notSaved); What am i doing wrong here? Also, the save method is actually an Ajax call.
