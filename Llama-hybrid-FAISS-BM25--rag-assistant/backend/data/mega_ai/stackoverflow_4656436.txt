What to add to PHP if statment to display certain text?

I have the following statement in magento and was wondering what I need to add to get it to show that if the TotalNum is equal to 1 then it should only show the text 'item' rather than 'item(s)' getLastPageNum()>1): ?> __(' %s items found. Showing %s to %s.', $this->getTotalNum(), $this->getFirstNum(), $this->getLastNum()) ?> __(' %s item(s) found.', $this->getTotalNum()) ?>
