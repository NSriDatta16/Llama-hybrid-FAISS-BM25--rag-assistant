SQL Index Seek

I've got an odd thing going on with a query. I have a table with two bigints, StartNum and EndNum that defines number ranges. I have an index on these two columns. The query takes a given number and returns the range it falls into. The WHERE clause is where @Num >= StartNum and @Num . There's a big difference in the Profiler between searching for a number near the start of the list and one near the end. The further down the list the number is, the more Reads and Duration it takes. The query plan shows that it's using a seek on my index. As an index is a balanced tree, surely there shouldn't be that much difference. Can anybody explain this to me, please? Small print: This is on SQL 2005 Workgoup edition. There are about 200,000 rows in the table. The index is nonclustered (the clustered index is on an identity column but the data was inserted in StartNum order). The index has 716 pages, has a depth of 3, is 3% fragmented.
