Durbin-Watson test for residuals of SARIMA(1,1,1) in R

I'm modelling a time series data using ARIMA. Now, I'm trying to test for the serial correlation of my model SARIMA(1,1,1) using the durbin watson test. My problem is that I don't know what linear model I would put on the formula of the dwtest function in R. Here's the usage of the function, dwtest(formula, order.by = NULL, alternative = c("greater", "two.sided", "less"), iterations = 15, exact = NULL, tol = 1e-10, data = list()) Here's my code below, Data: http://iitstat.weebly.com/uploads/7/3/4/0/7340846/chickenprod.rdata To download the data just right click the link and click "Save Link As..." library(forecast) library(lmtest) ChickenProd The residuals of my model SARIMA111 is obtain by SARIMA111[["residuals"]] Now, I want to test the serial correlation of it using the Durbin-Watson test, but I don't know what linear model I would use in the formula argument of dwtest function in R. Is it the SARIMA(1,1,1) model? If so, how will I extract the coefficients of the SARIMA(1,1,1) model, and make a linear model formula in R? Thank you in Advance!
