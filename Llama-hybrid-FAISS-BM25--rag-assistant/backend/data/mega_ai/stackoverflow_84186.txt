The answer to your question is broader than just GUIs. Feature/Scope creep will always happen, when someone isn't paying attention to what the contract has stipulated and when there isn't a formal process for handling change requests. If you lack the ability to implement the formal process or influence its creation, I suggest you get all feature change requests documented in email, and that you notify your management of the possible consequences in email. This isn't to get anyone, but rather to protect yourself from the fallout of the eventual failure.
