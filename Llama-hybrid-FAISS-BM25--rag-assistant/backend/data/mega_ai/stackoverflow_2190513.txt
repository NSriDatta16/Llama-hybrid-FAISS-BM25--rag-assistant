Stick a read-write property, let's call it viewBeingTouched , in your app delegate or some other singleton. Make sure you use @property without nonatomic . Make your two views instances of a class that overrides the UIResponder methods thusly: In touchesBegan, check the value of viewBeingTouched . If it's nil , set it to self and call the super's implementation. Otherwise, do nothing. In touchesEnded, check the value of viewBeingTouched . If it's self , set it to nil. Get it? The first view to get a touch grabs the property and prevents the other from registering it.
