We can't tell you. It depends on your situation and how easy prediction is in your situation. How many coin tosses do you need to observe before you can predict the next one with 90% accuracy? Related: How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? And of course, in many situations you can predict with "better than 90% accuracy" without learning at all, namely when one outcome occurs in more than 90% of cases - then just always predict that. For instance: always classify a credit card transaction as non-fraudulent. Most CC transactions are non-fraudulent, so such a useless prediction will look very good in terms of accuracy... because accuracy is not a good evaluation measure .
