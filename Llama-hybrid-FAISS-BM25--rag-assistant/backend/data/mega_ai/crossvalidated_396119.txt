Long run proportion of transitions in a Markov chain

Let $S$ be a set of states for a Markov chain and let $S^C$ be the remaining states. Explain the identity $$\sum_{i\in S}\sum_{j\in S^C}\pi_iP_{ij}=\sum_{i\in S^C}\sum_{j\in S}\pi_iP_{ij}$$ I know that LHS refers the long run proportion of transitions going from one state in $S$ to another in $S^C$ and vice versa for RHS, but how do I explain that they are equal? A qualitative answer would be sufficient.
