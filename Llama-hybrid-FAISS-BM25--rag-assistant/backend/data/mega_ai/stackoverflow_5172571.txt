Well you could start up an interval timer to just check every 100 milliseconds or so. $('input:file').click(function() { var file = this, form = this.form, val = this.value, interval; function checkValue() { if (file.value !== val) { cancelInterval(interval); form.submit(); } } interval = setInterval(checkValue, 100); }); Thing is, this is a little fragile because the "value" of a file input is not a complete path. However, since you're submitting the whole form anyway, the user really doesn't have a chance to click on the file element more than once. edit â€” this is presuming that the "change" event really isn't working for you; I don't have Firefox available at the moment to see.
