Is paired t test same with two sample t test for correlated data?

I was asked to perform a two-sample t-test for correlated data. When I search for that, I barely found a source mentioning this name. Almost all the sources used paired sample t-test but I want to be sure if paired sample t-test and two sample t-test for correlated data are the same test. I have 4 samples (4 huts with different roofs) with 4000 data points for each. (temperature (Â°C)). It is time series data.
