How to scrape web pages that are in different format/layouts?

I need to scrape Form 10-K reports (i.e. annual reports of US companies) from SEC website for a project. The trouble is, companies do not use the exact same format for filing this data. So for ex., real estate data for 2 different companies could be displayed as below 1st company Property name State City Ownership Year Occupancy Total Area ------------- ----- ------ --------- ---- --------- ---------- ABC Mall TX Dallas Fee 2007 97% 1,347,377 XYZ Plaza CA Ontario Fee 2008 85% 2,252,117 2nd company Property % Ownership %Occupany Rent Square Feet --------------- ----------- --------- ----- ----------- New York City ABC Plaza 100.0% 89.0% 38.07 2,249,000 123 Stores 100.0% 50.0% 18.00 1,547,000 Washington DC Office 12th street ....... 2001, J Drive ....... etc. Likewise, the data layout could be entirely different for other companies. I would like to know if there are better ways to scrape this type of heterogenous data other than writing complex regex searches. I have the liberty to use Java, Perl, Python or Groovy for this work.
