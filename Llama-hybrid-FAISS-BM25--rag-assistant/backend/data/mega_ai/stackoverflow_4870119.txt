My understanding is that when you create a subsription to a report, SSRS creates a SQL Agent job on the backend. what you should be able to do, assuming that you have access to the Reporting Server, is to modify/copy the SQL Agent Job to what you need it to do. Failing that you could also create an SSIS package that does the same thing.
