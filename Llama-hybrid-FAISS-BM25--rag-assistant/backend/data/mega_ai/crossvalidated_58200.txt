(1) Have you correctly fitted an ARIMA with some coefficients forced to zero? - Yes. But did you heed the Warnmeldung ? If you didn't, & want to make sure your model is causal & invertible, check the roots of the AR & MA polynomials ( abs(polyroot(your.polynomial)) is convenient in R). (2) Is your model-building approach sensible? - I don't think it's the most sensible. Setting various coefficients to zero just because they're "not significant" is no more principled in ARIMA than in multiple regression - see the 'model selection' & 'variable selection' tags - & can lead to the same sorts of problems. The estimate for one parameter depends on all the others that are in the model, so by removing a whole bunch at once you can badly degrade the model. Stepwise selection is a little better, but after doing lots of tests you can't really justify the result overall. Approaches vary, & depend on the goals of modelling, but I would suggest confining your attention to a smallish set of plausible models (is it really likely that an observation's affected by what happened four & five observations ago but by nothing in the intervening time?), picking a model using AIC, & validating it by out-of-sample forecasts.
