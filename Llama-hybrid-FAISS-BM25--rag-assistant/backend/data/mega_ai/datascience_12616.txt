There is no clear cut answer for this. It depends on the size of your dataset, the computing power you have at your disposal and the accuracy you get compared to the number of classes. Some signs or rules of a thumb are: The smaller the dataset (both in data points and feature space dimensionality) the less class labels you can manage successfully. How fast can you train your model for each class? If adding that for all the classes results in acceptable time you can keep them. This applies to cases where you are training a model to predict classes in a one vs all setting. K-means clustering on the other will not be significantly affected by increasing the number of classes. Can you get good accuracy from your dataset with all those classes? If not reduce them to decrease the complexity of your problem. For each case the balance of the above factors may give a different answer. Last but not least the number of classes to keep is influenced by the specific domain that gave you the dataset. You should use domain knowledge in addition to machine learning methods to assess whether you have too many classes or not.
