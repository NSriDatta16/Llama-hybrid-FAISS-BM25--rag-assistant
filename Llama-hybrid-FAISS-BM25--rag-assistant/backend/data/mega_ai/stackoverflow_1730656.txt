User jQuery to drag a DIV and drop in a TD ... and have the DIV "snap" into place

I am finishing up a rewrite of task management system, and am in the process of adding drag and drop capabilities. I want the user to be able to drag a task DIV from one column (TD) and drop it in another column (TD). I have this working correctly, save for some minor formatting issues. I have the TD with a class called droppable that accepts draggable classes. What I would like to happen is actually remove the task DIV from the current TD and append it to the dropped on TD. Here is my script: $(function() { $(".draggable").draggable({ cursor: 'move', cancel: 'a', revert: 'invalid', snap: 'true' }); }); $(function() { $(".droppable").droppable({ accept: '.draggable', hoverClass: 'droppable-hover', drop: function(event, ui) { } }); }); Here is my Html: My Queue Customer Project 100001 Customer Project 100002 Pending (0) Ready (0) In Progress (2) Ready for Testing (0) Testing (0) Ready for Release (0) Struggling with the drop event and how to implement this. Any help is appreciated!
