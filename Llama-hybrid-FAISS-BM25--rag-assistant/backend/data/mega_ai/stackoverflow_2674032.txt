Best way to change the content of 2 divs at once using jquery roundabout?

I'm using jQuery roundabout to build an animated logo on my site - I want content to change when I click on each item, something like this: http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/demo/images/ I have already implemented the JS on that page, which is working fine, but I was wondering what would be the best way to also make another div change at the side? The problem I have is that the script uses string values in an array, whereas I probably want to create the different hidden divs, and show/hide depending on the element clicked. Simple example: Content here Content here Here is the JS: $(document).ready(function(){ var titles = { blue: 'Superior Service', aqua: 'Bill Checking &amp; Validation' }; $('img').focus(function() { var useText = (typeof titles[$(this).attr('id')] != 'undefined') ? titles[$(this).attr('id')] : ''; $('#item-title').html(useText).fadeIn(200); }).blur(function() { $('#item-title').fadeOut(100); }); So you can see atm the script changed the content of item-title based on the key of the titles array, what I would also like to do is show aquapanel when aqua is in focus, and obviously hide all of the other elements (there are more than 1 in the real example.) My javascript knowledge only really takes me as far as: $('#aqua').focus(function(){ $('#bluepanel').hide(); $('#aquapanel').show(); }); And i realise this is incredibly inelegant, and inefficient, considering there are 8 or elements in the list. So is there a way create an array of the div ids, and show the one selected, while hiding all others in that array? I hope I made this clear, and any help is very much appreciated.
