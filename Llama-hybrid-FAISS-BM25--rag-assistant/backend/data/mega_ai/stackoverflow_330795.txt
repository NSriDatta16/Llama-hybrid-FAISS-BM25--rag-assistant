Mike Spears suggestion is right on the money you need to put error handlers in all your events as assigning a string to a combo box's text causes a number of events to fire. My contribution is to try the following. Dim TempS as String TempS = clsTonyToolkit.GetSetting("ExportAIDFile",gtypmetadata.gcnnCentral) & "" cmbAIDFile.Text = TempS There may be something funky going on with Unicode. This is indicated by Error 0 "Invalid procedure call or argument" on otherwise normal assignment. Again if you have event procedures for cmbAIDfile then you need to trap them so you can see if the error is occuring there.
