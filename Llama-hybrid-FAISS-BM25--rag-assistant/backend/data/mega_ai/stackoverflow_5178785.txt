NBP rich client in a multi-tier enterprise application?

Just started a project that involves a rich client implemented in Netbeans Platform (NBP), Spring framework is chosen to implement business logic and for data access. Since I've come from a web application development background, I have some questions and would also like some suggestions. What are the options for a rich client to integrate with Spring? Any best practices/books/docs regarding a rich client in a multi-tier Java EE environment? Anything that needs special attention?
