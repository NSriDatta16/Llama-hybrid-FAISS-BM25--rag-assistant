Suppose you make a histogram, of bin size b, and the largest bin has k entries, from your total sample of size n. Then the average PDF within that bin can be estimated as b*k/n. The problem is that another bin, which has fewer total members, could have a high spot density. You can only know about this if you have a reasonable assumption about the rate of change of the PDF. If you do, then you can estimate the probability that the second largest bin actually contains the mode. The underlying problem is this. A sample provides good knowledge of the CDF, by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov theorem, and so a good estimate of median and other quantiles. But knowing an approximation to a function in L1 does not provide approximate knowledge of its derivative. So no sample provides good knowledge of the PDF, without additional assumptions.
