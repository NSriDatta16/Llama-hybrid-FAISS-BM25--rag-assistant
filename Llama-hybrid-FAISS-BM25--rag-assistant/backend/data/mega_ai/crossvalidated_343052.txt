Minority class misclassification penalty in logistic regression (sklearn)

I am facing the problem of class imbalance in my dataset. Due to some constraints, I cannot use any other classifier than logistic regression in sklearn. Given that, Can I impose a penalty for misclassification of the minority class to improve the model?
