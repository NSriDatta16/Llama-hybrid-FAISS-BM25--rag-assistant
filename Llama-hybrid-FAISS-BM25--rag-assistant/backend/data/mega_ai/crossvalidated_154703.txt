averaging after n trials of monte carlo simulation or not? which is better statistically?

related to my job I want to code a realistic monte carlo simulation for availability, reliability and related sensitivity analysis. Scenario will be complex and there will be many parameters. What I want to ask however is I think a basic knowledge for statisticians. My question is Assuming both procedures uses same computational resources which procedure below is better by means of statistics discipline and why? What I mean by better is smaller variance from the true value. Procedure 1) 10K Monte carlo simulations find expected value by using 10K results above repeat step 1 & step 2 10 times. (Now we have 10 expected values) find expected value by averaging result of step 3. Procedure 2) 100K Monte carlo simulations find expected value by using 100K results above My question is arived after reading tutorial: http://weibull.com/hotwire/issue3/hottopics3.htm best regards
