Does Eclipse Ganymede have a mouse-click bug in the Navigator view?

I've had to downgrade from Galileo to Ganymede in order to use the version of the FlexBuilder plugin that we are licensed for. Since the downgrade, I have several times accidentally dragged files or entire folders from one part of my project into another (or even into another project). I blamed this on fatfingers the first couple times, but I just now watched it do it to me on what I definitely know to have been a single left click on the folder that the file ended up moving to. Does anybody know if this is a known issue with Ganymede?
