This sounds like it is similar to a certain application of Information Retrieval (IR). A few years ago I attended a talk about gait recognition that sounds similar to what you are doing. In Information Retrieval, "documents" (in your case: a person's angle data) are compared to some query (which in your case could be "is there a person with angle data (.., ..)"). Then the documents are listed in the order of the one that matches the closest down to the one that matches the least. That, in turn, means that one central component of IR is putting a document in some kind of vector space (in your case: angle space) and comparing it to one specific query or example document or measuring their distance. (See below.) If you have a sound definition of the distance between two individual vectors, all you have to do is coming up with a measure for the distance of two data sets. (Traditionally in IR the distance in vector space model is calculated either by the cosine measure or Euclidean distance but I don't remember how they did it in that case.) In IR there is also a mechanism called "relevance feedback" that, conceptually, works with the distance of two sets of documents. That mechanism normally uses a measure of distance that sums up all individual distances between all pairs of documents (or in your case: person vectors). Maybe that is of use to you. The following page has some papers that seem relevant to your issue: http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mmueller/index_publications.html Especially this one http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mmueller/publications/2006_DemuthRoederMuellerEberhardt_MocapRetrievalSystem_ECIR.pdf seems interesting. The talk of MÃ¼ller that I attended mentions similarity measures from Kovar and Gleicher called "point cloud" (see http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1186562.1015760&coll=DL&dl=ACM ) and one called "quaternions". Hope, it helps.
