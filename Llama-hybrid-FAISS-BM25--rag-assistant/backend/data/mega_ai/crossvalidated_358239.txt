Does Granger causality imply superior forecasting with ADL over AR models?

I have two stationary time series, ts1 and ts2 . I applied grangertest() in R and the result was that ts2 Granger causes ts1 . I then applied an auto-regressive distributed lag model and also a auto-regressive model (removing ts2 ). I performed a rolling forecast cross-validation to test the performance of the two models, and to my surprise, the AR model outperformed the ARDL model. How is this possible if the Granger test showed that the ARDL model is more valuable for forecasting? I have plotted the MASE results for each of the cross-validation tests on this plot: and the reproducible R code is: ts
