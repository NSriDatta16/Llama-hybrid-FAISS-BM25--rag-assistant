Is an Isometric engine used for social games like farmville, happy island, etc

1) Is an isometric engine used to render the world in social games. If yes, can you guide me somewhere where I can learn how to use it. 2) Also, how are the houses, buildings, farms and other objects placed via drag and drop. Is there any tutorial for that? Thank you.
