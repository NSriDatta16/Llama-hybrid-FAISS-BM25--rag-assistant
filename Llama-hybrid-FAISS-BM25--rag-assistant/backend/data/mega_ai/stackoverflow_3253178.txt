First thing, TDD takes time to get adapted to. We as a team started with TDD a year ago. Initially, we started with first writing the code(class/a single module) and then writing tests covering that code. We then progressed to writing tests in parallel with the code(write a method/group of methods and then write test cases coverring those methods).During this period, we used coverage tools to check our coverage. Now after doing this for a year, the team is well versed with test-first approach. @Scozzard has mentioned valid points about using AAA / mocking frameworks.
