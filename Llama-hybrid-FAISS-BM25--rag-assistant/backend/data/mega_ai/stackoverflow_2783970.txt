How to create wordpress-like option table and get values for each row?

I'm looking to create an options table in my db that makes every record a system option, so I can work with a little number of fields. My db has the following structure: 3 columns named id , name , and value The following data is inserted as an example: +--+-----------+--------------------------+ |id|name |value | +--+-----------+--------------------------+ | 1|uri |www.example.com | | 2|sitename |Working it out | | 3|base_folder|/folder1/folder2/ | | 4|slogan |Just a slogan for the site| +--+-----------+--------------------------+ That way I can include a large number of customizable system options very easily. The problem is that I don't know how to retrieve them. How do I get the value of uri and store it as a var? And better yet, how do I get, for exmaple, values of id 1 and 4 only without making a query each time? (I assume multiple queries are useless and a pretty ugly method.) I know the question is pretty basic but I'm lost here. I'd really appreciate your answer!
