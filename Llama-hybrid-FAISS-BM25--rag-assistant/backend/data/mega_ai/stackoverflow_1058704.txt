Problem Loading SSIS Custom Connection Manager/Type

I'm currently trying to build a custom connection manager and custom data flow source for a proprietary system at work, and I'm running into an odd problem when I attempt to execute a task containing my custom manager (from BIDS, DTEXEC, or the agent) Error: 0xC0014005 at : The connection type "AF" specified for connection manager "AFConnection" is not recognized as a valid connection manager type. This error is returned when an attempt is made to create a connection manager for an unknown connection type. Check the spelling in the connection type name. Error: 0xC0010018 at : Error loading value " 0 AFConnection {43304F2E-0C3F-4C00-9221-BD88C50EDDFC}" from node "DTS:ConnectionManager". I have the relevant DLLs in the GAC as well as the \90\DTS\Connections folder. All other connection managers work fine. Here is the connection manager boilerplate: [DtsConnection(ConnectionType="AF", Description="Connection manager for AF2", DisplayName="AF Connection" , UITypeName = "AnalysisFrameworkCustomTask.AFConnectionManagerUI,AnalysisFrameworkCustomTask,Version=1.0.0.0,Culture=neutral,PublicKeyToken=e11db2e10378dc29")] public class AFConnectionManager : ConnectionManagerBase { #region Overrides public override DTSExecResult Validate(IDTSInfoEvents infoEvents) { // Code omitted that determines success or failure return DTSExecResult.Success; } public override object AcquireConnection(object txn) { // Code ommitted to return new connection; works fine when debugged // in the development environment } public override void ReleaseConnection(object connection) { // Code ommitted to release connection; works fine when debugged // in the development environment } #endregion } Has anyone seen this before and have any idea how to move forward?
