I've at least glanced at most of these on this list and none are as good as the new Bayesian Ideas and Data Analysis in my opinion. Edit: It is easy to immediately begin doing Bayesian analysis while reading this book. Not just model the mean from a Normal distribution with known variance, but actual data analysis after the first couple of chapters. All code examples and data are on the book's website. Covers a decent amount of theory but the focus is applications. Lots of examples over a wide range of models. Nice chapter on Bayesian Nonparametrics. Winbugs, R, and SAS examples. I prefer it over Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (I have both). Most of the books on here (Gelman, Robert, ...) are not introductory in my opinion and unless you have someone to talk to you will probably be left with more questions then answers. Albert's book does not cover enough material to feel comfortable analyzing data different from what is presented in the book (again my opinion).
