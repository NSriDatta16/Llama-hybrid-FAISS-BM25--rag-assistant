First read: " What are the basic clearcase concepts every developer should know? ". In this answer, I compare ClearCase to Git, but the general idea remains true: ClearCase (Central VCS) is very different from Git or Mercurial (DVCS) and this answer details the main differences. If you can put as many data as you want in a ClearCase VOB, any migration path will involve reorganizing your data into coherent repo (i.e. repositories with coherent data in them) The issues when planning for a migration from ClearCase are similar to: Migrating from clearcase to mercurial (which you may have already read) Migrating away from ClearCase which reminds you that you will need to establish policies for branching and labelling quite different from those done with ClearCase (especially ClearCase UCM), since publication (push/pull) is another dimension unknown from a CVCS like ClearCase.
