Sending out Ping Requests

Using WinpCap and trying to generate my own ping requests. On both machines I see the ping request and the only differences between the ones I've generated the ones Windows has generated is my checksum is 0 (been told that's ok) and the identified is 100 instead of an ever increasing value like Windows uses. (I increase each time I try to send a ping request). Should I paste the hex dump here? :P EDIT: I guess my question here is to find out what could cause Windows to NOT respond to ping requests that show up as valid in Wireshark.
