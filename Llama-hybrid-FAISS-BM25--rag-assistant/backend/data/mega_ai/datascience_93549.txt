How to limit a Julia notebook to a single core?

I'm running a Julia 1.4 notebook, via Jupyter lab. I need to limit the notebook to a single logical CPU core, on average. In Python I use the following incantation to restrict Numpy's CPU usage: from threadpoolctl import threadpool_info,threadpool_limits with threadpool_limits(limits=1, user_api='blas'): >> code here Would anyone happen to know whether its possible to similarly limit Julia's CPU usage from within a notebook?
