http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2011/03/maps-apis-over-ssl-now-available-to-all.html Ismail is right - check out the thread on Options for Google Maps over SSL. Personally I had to migrate my Google maps to Bing for the https connection api. The Google map apis should now be available over https - but at least from my point of view there may be clashes with the licence (not-for-profit organisation but the site is access protected). Have a look at Mapstraction if you want to swap map interfaces around to try them out.
