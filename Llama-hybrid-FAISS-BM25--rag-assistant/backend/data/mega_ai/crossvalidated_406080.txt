How can I identify these time series processes? (AR/MA/ARIMA/random walk with drift)

I don't understand how one would identify the stochastic process of the following models, if they are AR or MA or ARIMA etc. Consider the following models estimated over a sample $t = 1, 2, \dots,T$ . In each case $\epsilon_t$ is white noise and $p$ and $\mu$ are less than one in absolute value. \begin{align} y_{t} &=\alpha+\rho y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t} \tag1\\ y_{t} &=\alpha+y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t} \tag2\\ y_{t} &=\alpha+\epsilon_{t}+\mu \epsilon_{t-1}\tag3 \\ \Delta y_{t}&=\alpha +\rho \Delta y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}+\mu \epsilon_{t-1} \tag4 \end{align}
