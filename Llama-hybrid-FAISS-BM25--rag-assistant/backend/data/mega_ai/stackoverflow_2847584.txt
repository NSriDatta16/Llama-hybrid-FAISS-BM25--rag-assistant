jQuery not and classes

I have 2 anchor links (a.selector) and when one is clicked it has a class applied to it of 'active-arrow' and the click also removes the class of the same name from the other anchor as well as lowering the opacity to 0.2. I then want to have a fade effect when the user hovers over the anchor that doesn't have 'active-arrow' applied to it so that it goes to full opacity when mouseenters and back to 0.2 when mouseleaves. The problem im having is that both .not and :not don't seem to be working as expected, the hover effect works but if I click on the anchor whilst hovering the 'active-arrow' class is applied but when mouseleaves the opacity is faded down to 0.2 again even though the 'active-arrow' class is applied. Also the hover then doesn't work for the other a link which has had 'active-arrow' removed. Bit of a hard one to explain so heres some code that hopefully helps a bit. *//If a.selector doesn't have the class 'active-arrow' then run the hoverFade function* $("a.selector").not(".active-arrow").hoverFade(); //Functions for first element $('a.selector-1').click(function () { $('a.selector-2').removeClass('active-arrow'); //Remove background image from corresponding element $('ul#storage-items-2').fadeOut(1200).addClass('hide'); //Fade out then hide corresponding list $(this).addClass('active-arrow', 'fast'); //Add background image to current element $('ul#storage-items-1').removeClass('hide').fadeIn(1800); //Unhide and fade in the list $('a.selector-2').fadeTo(500, 0.2); //Fade corresponding element $(this).fadeTo(800, 1);//Fade this element to full opacity }); I only included the code for teh first anchor (a.selector-1) as the code for the second anchor is identical but just changes the class names to a.selector-2. Also the hoverFade function is in a seperate file so we can re-use it. jQuery.fn.hoverFade = function() { return this.each(function(){ $(this).hover( function () { $(this).fadeTo(500, 0.8); }, function () { $(this).fadeTo(500, 0.2); }); }); } Each anchor link fades in and fades out a UL as well. Any help is most appreciated Thanks Giles
