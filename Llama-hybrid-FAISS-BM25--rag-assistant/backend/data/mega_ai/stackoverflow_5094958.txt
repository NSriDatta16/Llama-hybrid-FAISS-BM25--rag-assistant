I have used Restful-Authentication, Authlogic, and Devise. Based upon feedback from the rails community, I would encourage you to look at Devise. I recently switched one of my Rails 1.2.5 applications using Restful-Authentication into a Rails 3.x application using Devise. Using Devise was much easier than Restful-Authentication. (I know this doesn't answer you immediate question, but I wished someone told me this when I was doing my selection.)
