According to Nokogiri searching for div using xpath we can't get there from here. I usually do what you reverted to. I'll pass the results through a .select or .reject and filter out what I want. It's not the prettiest way of doing it when it'd be cooler to pass it to the selection engine, but getting it done often beats elegance.
