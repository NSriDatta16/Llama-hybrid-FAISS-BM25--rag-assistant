why predict a distribution in pixelcnn++

I know that in the original pixelcnn paper, they predicted a 255 vector for each subpixel, and argmaxed to get the value. in the pixelcnn++ paper, if I understand it correctly, they model the pixel value as a mixture of logistic distributions. I understand why the mixture approach is better than a 255 vector - but why not just predict a single value- the value of the pixel. you can scale all the images to range (0,1) and use a sigmoid activation, for example.
