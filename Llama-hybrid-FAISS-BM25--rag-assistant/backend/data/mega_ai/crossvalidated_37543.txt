If you run PCA on ${\bf Y}_i - \hat f({\bf X}_i)$, you are visualizing residuals $\epsilon_i$, not the original data ${\bf Y}_i$. In other words, you will analyze the conditional variance of ${\bf Y}_i$, and that may be of interest per se. If it is the variability of ${\bf Y}_i$ that you want to visualize, and you know these outcomes are affected by ${\bf X}_i$'s, then what you are describing appears a moderately sensible visualization, with the caveat that 5D graphs are difficult to read and interpret. You could also look into principal curves if the dependence on ${\bf X}_i$'s is heavily non-linear.
