From DomDocument::getElementById For this function to work, you will need either to set some ID attributes with DOMElement::setIdAttribute or a DTD which defines an attribute to be of type ID. In the later case, you will need to validate your document with DOMDocument::validate or DOMDocument->validateOnParse before using this function. For some additional information Simplify PHP DOM XML parsing - how? How do you parse and process HTML/XML in PHP? And since someone will mention doing it with a Regular Expression sooner or later, here is the pattern you could use: / (.*) /simU In addition, you could just use regular string functions to extract the div part, e.g. $div = strstr($html, ' '); $div = substr($div, 0, strpos($div, ' ') + 6); echo $div; While I agree, you should not use RegEx or String functions for parsing HTML or XML, I find it absolutely okay to do so, as long as your only concern is to get this single div from the fragments. Keep it simple.
