Research on neural networks mimicking behavior

My question is regarding neural networks mimicking noise specifically. The idea. I have clinically clean image generated by a ray tracer and a neural network (type does not matter) that is mimicking noise of the environment. Environment meaning: Perlin noise, lens noise, noise from the sun, noise from fog, or for behavior, etc. I would like to produce the nose onto the ray tracer images, I'm aware that for each type one should use a new network. What I would like to know if someone tried something like this and is there research published regarding something like that. The noise is specifically for images and 2D matrices.
