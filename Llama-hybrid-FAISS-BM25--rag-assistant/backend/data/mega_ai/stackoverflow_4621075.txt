Azure Storage (tables, blobs, queues) only run on the actual Windows Azure environment in the cloud. There is a simulated development environment that runs a facsimile on a local SQL Server database, but that is only meant for development purposes and cannot be used for running an actual site. Theoretically, you could run your webapp locally and connect to Azure Storage over the internet (e.g. by using the REST api), but latency would almost certainly be too high for any interactive site. So, if you want to be able to run your site on premise on your own IIS environment, you will need to remove all the specific Azure platform dependencies and build in non-Azure alternatives. For Azure Storage, you could either do a relational database (SQL Server, mySQL) or look at a nosql/document database.
