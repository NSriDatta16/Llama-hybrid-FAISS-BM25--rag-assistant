I strongly disagree with the answer provided by Jason. The whole point of Scrum is to get rid of the method where designers first "do their thing" and then go on to other stuff. That's completely and 100% against all lean / Scrum principles! The way to incorporate designers in a Scrum process? Throw 'em into the mix! Make sure you're not just wrapping a waterfall project into Scrum as that's the best way towards failure! Scrum only works when it's implemented without exceptions. "Scrum, but..." is the worst project model. Organize work so that it's possible for concurrent designing and developing. Don't overdo initial design, but make it a push-pull situation, where both sides of the coin influence the other. The point of Scrum is to iterate, iterate and iterate, so take full benefit from that. Also, it's pretty lean to actually shun traditional Photoshop-based design altogether.
