Yes. What you propose is entirely standard and it is the way that standard k-means software works automatically. In the case of k-means you compute the euclidean distance between each observation (data point) and each cluster mean (centroid) and assign the observations to the most similar cluster. Then, the label of the cluster is determined by examining that average characteristics of the observations classified to the cluster relative to the averages of those relative to the other clusters.
