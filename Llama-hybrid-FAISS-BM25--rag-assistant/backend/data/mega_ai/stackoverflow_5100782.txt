cassandra upgrade from 0.6 to 0.7.2

I followed the instructions in NEWS.txt to upgrade cassandra 0.6 to 0.7.2. The instructions are: The process to upgrade is: 1) run "nodetool drain" on each 0.6 node. When drain finishes (log message "Node is drained" appears), stop the process. 2) Convert your storage-conf.xml to the new cassandra.yaml using "bin/config-converter". 3) Rename any of your keyspace or column family names that do not adhere to the '^\w+' regex convention. 4) Start up your cluster with the 0.7 version. 5) Initialize your Keyspace and ColumnFamily definitions using "bin/schematool import". You only need to do this to one node . I did the first three steps. drain node, stop cassandra 0.6, convert old storage-conf.xml to cassandra.yaml. I start cassandra 0.7.2 using: "bin/cassandra -f". But it always complains the following errors. I am wondering whether I followed the right instructions. If so, how could i fix this problem? "Fatal configuration error org.apache.cassandra.config.ConfigurationException: saved_caches_directory missing"
