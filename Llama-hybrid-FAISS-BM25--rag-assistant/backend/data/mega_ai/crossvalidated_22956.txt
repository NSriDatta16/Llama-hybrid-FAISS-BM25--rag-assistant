Using autocorrelation plots to choose the number of inputs for a neural network predicting time series

A neural network applied to time series needs to have the number of input nodes defined. Each input is applied to a time point previous to the current point being predicted. If $D$ is the number of past time points taken, how is this number determined? Can the autocorrelation function be used for the lag correlation plot to give insight as to the best number of previous values to use? If so how?
