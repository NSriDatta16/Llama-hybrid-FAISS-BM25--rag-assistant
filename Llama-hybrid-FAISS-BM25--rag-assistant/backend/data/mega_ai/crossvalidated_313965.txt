The conditional expectation gives you what you would expect to be an estimate $\hat{x}$ for some quantity measured by a random variable X, given that the "true" value of X would be x. Let's say I'm flipping a coin and X can either be 0 or 1 (modeling tails or heads respectively), then the expectation conditioned on e.g. (x=1) would give me an average value I would estimate for x, given that coin flipped heads. Of course, this value could be different from 0 or 1, e.g. 0.5 if I would expect the estimator to randomly choose between the two predictions when the coin flipped heads.
