the CLT is just telling you how the average of the sample is distributed. Just as if I tell you the throws of a die are distributed equally with probability 1/6, or that a particular coin is fair (50% heads, 50% tails) how you check this is a different issue eg by throwing the die multiple times and creating a histogram.
