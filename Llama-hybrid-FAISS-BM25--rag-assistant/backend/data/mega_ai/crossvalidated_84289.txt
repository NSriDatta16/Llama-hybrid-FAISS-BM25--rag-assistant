weight parameter elimination in neural network

I am a little new to neural network. I have two questions: 1. Can we use neural network in the small $n$ large $p$ situation? 2. Any regularization methods designed for parameter elimination? (Shrink some $\omega$ to 0). For example to add $L_1$ regularizer as Lasso? I know some methods for avoiding over-fitting, (weight decay, early stopping, ect.) but none of them shrink parameters to 0.
