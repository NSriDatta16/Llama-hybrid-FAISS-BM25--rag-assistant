Average within-cluster distance using divisive clustering

I have to prove that the average within-cluster distance for 10 data points cannot increase when going from 1 cluster to 2 clusters (divisive clustering). Intuitively, it seems obvious that this is true because each time you allocate a point to the second group, it will have a smaller distance from the centre of that group, so on average it will be closer to the other points in that group than the points in the first group. Otherwise you would keep that point in the first group. I'm not sure how to formally prove it though. Can anyone offer any guidance? Thanks Edit: So the definition of average distance I was given was this $$\frac{\sum\limits_{l=1}^k \sum\limits_{1\leq i Where $C_i$ is the number of observations in cluster $i$.
