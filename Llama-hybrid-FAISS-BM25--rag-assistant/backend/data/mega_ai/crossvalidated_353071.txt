Mean square convergence of linear processes

In Brockwell and Davis's book (Introduction to time series and forecasting), a linear process is defined as $ X_t = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} \psi_jZ_{t-j}$ where $Z_{t} \sim WN(0, \sigma^2)$, $\psi_j$'s are constants such that $\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\psi_j| It states that $\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\psi_j| I am not sure how these three conditions help in proving almost sure convergence of the infinite sum.
