You can indeed use the negative hypergeometric distribution to solve that problem. When drawing from a population of $N$ elements without replacement where $K$ of them are successes, the mean number of successes you'll draw until you draw $R$ failures is given by: $$ f(N,K,R) = E[x \sim NHG_{N,K,R}] = R ~ \frac{K}{N-K-1} $$ Back to your problem. Consider two cases: one in which the first ball drawn is black (p = 18/20) and the other in which the first ball is white (p = 2/20). You can then calculate your average for each case and weigh them as follows: $$ \frac{18}{20} ~ f(19, 17, 1) + \frac{2}{20} ~ f(19, 1, 1) + 2 $$ The last term refers to the first draw (which is considered separately) and the last "failure" draw, which is not counted by the negative hypergeometric distribution.
