Threading.Timer application is consuming more than 50% of CPU, why?

I have written below console application in VB.net. My intention is to write an application that triggers every one minute and perform some task. But when I run this application it is consuming 50% of CPU. How can I make it to consume less CPU? Am I calling the timer in the right place (In the main method)? Later I would like to make a windows service with this same task and install on the server. How can I make the application consume less CPU? Module Module1 Dim inputPath As String = "C:\Input" Dim outputPath As String = "C:\Output" Dim folder As Directory Sub Main() Dim tmr As Timer = New Timer(New TimerCallback(AddressOf Upload), Nothing, 1000, 60000) While Not tmr Is Nothing End While End Sub Public Sub Upload(ByVal o As Object) Dim sr As StreamReader Dim conStr1 As String = "Data Source=TNS Name;User ID=xx; Password=xx;" 'Look up for pending requests in RQST_TBL Dim cnn1 As New OracleConnection(conStr1) Dim datReader As OracleDataReader Dim cmd1 As New OracleCommand cnn1.Open() ..... ..... End Sub End Module Thank you..
