J2ME SIM card change detection

I wanted to create J2ME application, in which the application should work only with the SIM card that was used during installation. On SIM card (GSM) change the application should now work. For achieving this, i thought of taking an signature of the simcard and save it in a persistent storage. On every start of the application the signature can be verified. Any idea of how to implement this. Thanks in advance
