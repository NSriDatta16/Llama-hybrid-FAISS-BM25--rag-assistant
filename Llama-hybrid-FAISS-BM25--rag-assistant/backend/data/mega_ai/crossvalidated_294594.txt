Since your response variable is spending, it might be plausible to assume it's log normal and use a log transformation, which could remove the skewness. I believe the distribution of income is often fit well by a log normal, so maybe spending is as well. What do you mean by time sensitive? Do you have measurements through time? If so you might be dealing with a time series problem where your errors are not independent. This will invalidate things like standard errors for a typical regression. You may want to look into models that account for correlation through time.
