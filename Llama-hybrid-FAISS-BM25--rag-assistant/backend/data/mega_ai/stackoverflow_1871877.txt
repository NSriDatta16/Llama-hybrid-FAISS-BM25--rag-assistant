Generally , if your talking about steganography, then basically you are stuffing information into the nooks and crannies of the image file. You can use nearly any image library out there as long as the image library doesn't validate the image file strictly against a schema. You can use nearly any programming language you fancy. There are numerous techniques. Here are some which are easy to program. Use an image format which stores the image in chunks. You can move the chunks to allow gaps in the file. You can then hide strings of information in the gaps. Convert the image to an indexed image. Declare a pallete larger than the number of colors. Now you can hide extra information in the pallete colors not used in the image. If you are using an image format which has layers, you can declare a layer in which the alpha channel is maximum. This causes the layer to be fully transparent. You can use another color channel to hide your data. There are numerous more techniques. Remember to use generous amounts of compression and random misleading data to make the image file look legitimate.
