API Controlled Email

If I wanted to build an application that gave people "custom" email addresses (like posterous or flickr email for sending content) for use within my web app, is there an application, webservice or specific server that someone could recommend for me to build my code against? It seems like setting something up like smartermail,and then having an agent poll several thousand accounts every 10 min or so would be a rather unscalable method..? Thanks!
