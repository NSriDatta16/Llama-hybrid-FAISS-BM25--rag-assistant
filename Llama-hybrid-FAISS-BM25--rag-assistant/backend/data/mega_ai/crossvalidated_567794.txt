I think you have time as a continuous predictor in these models, rather than as a factor. When there are only 2 different times, that makes no difference in terms of predictions, and emmeans by default treats it like a factor. But when there are more than 2 distinct times, it does make a difference. And emmeans will use the average time. My guess is the second model is wrong and you should refit it with factor(time) instead of time. Addendum If it is indeed deemed appropriate to model times as a linear effect, it is easy to obtain the results you want for a selected set of times... To use all the different values of time : emmeans(model2.12nymph, trt.vs.ctrl ~ treatment | time, cov.reduce = FALSE) To use a selected set of times, say 3, 5, and 7: emmeans(model2.12nymph, trt.vs.ctrl ~ treatment | time, at = list(time = c(3, 5, 7)) But another style of post hoc comparisons may be more appropriate -- estimating and comparing the slopes of the fitted trend lines: emtrends(model2.12nymph, trt.vs.ctrl ~ treatment, var = "time") Consider this last option, because the changes with time are linear, so the contrasts at specified times have systematic relationships with one another.
