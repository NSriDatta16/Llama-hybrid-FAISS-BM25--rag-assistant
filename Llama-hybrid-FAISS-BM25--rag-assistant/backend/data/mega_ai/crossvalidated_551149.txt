How many unique values can you expect after throwing a dice with k sides? If you only need the expectation value then the answer is relatively simple. We can compute the probability that a specific number is rolled which is $$P = 1-\left(\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^n$$ For the other numbers, this is the same. So on average you will have a number in the sample a fraction $P$ of the time. The number of unique values to expect is then $k$ times that fraction $$Pk = k \left[ 1-\left(\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^n \right]$$
