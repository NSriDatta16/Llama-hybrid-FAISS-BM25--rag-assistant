There is an "include everything and the kitchen sink" maven dependency for Sesame: groupId: org.openrdf.sesame artifactId: sesame-runtime That includes the entire framework. If you want to trim that down and only include specific features, you can instead add specific dependencies on subparts. For example, if all you need is a simple in-memory triplestore, you could probably do with adding these two dependencies: for the repository API: groupId: org.openrdf.sesame artifactId: sesame-repository-sail for the actual storage backend: groupId: org.openrdf.sesame artifactId: sesame-sail-memory
