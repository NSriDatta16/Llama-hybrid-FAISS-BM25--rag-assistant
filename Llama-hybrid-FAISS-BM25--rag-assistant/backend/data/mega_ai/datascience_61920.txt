Suggestion for stacked modelling in machine learning

I have built several models on the training dataset and i am not happy with the results and I wish to club them all together and generate a new model, so here is my idea as i already have the results for the existing models i would like to create a new dataset with the existing model results as separate features on top of the original feature dataset applying a clustering to filter some data in the original dataset and would like to train the model across all the same models and get the result, Would that be called as stacked modelling?
