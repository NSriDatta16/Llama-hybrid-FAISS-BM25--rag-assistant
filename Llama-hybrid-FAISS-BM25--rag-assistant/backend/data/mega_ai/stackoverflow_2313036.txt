I'd suggest instead of two tables create one table Poster. It's ok to have some fields empty if they are not applicable to one kind of poster. Poster: ID (guid), type, name, phone, email, password where type is 1 for company, 2 - for unregistered user. OR Keep your users and companies separate, but require each company to have a user in users table. That table should have a CompanyID field. I think it would be more logical and elegant.
