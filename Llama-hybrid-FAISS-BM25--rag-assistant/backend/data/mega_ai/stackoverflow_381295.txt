Distinct stylesheets for type, color and layout. What goes where?

I came across this article on "A List Apart" that suggests spliting css information in (at least) three separate files, one for typography, one for layout and one for color information. Color seems pretty obvious, but how would you explain to your average programmer (that would be me) what's type and what's layout?
