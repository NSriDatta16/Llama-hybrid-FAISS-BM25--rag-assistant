How to disable the users abilities for the Devexpress GridView

I am using the DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView within my Visual Studio 2008 application and thought I limited the abilities of the user but I was mistaken. I am programming in VB.NET but I can easily translate from C#. I went into the properties of the gridview and set ShowGroupPanel , AllowAddRows , AddNewColumns , AllowDeleteRows , RemoveOldColumns , and Editable to false. Doing this I thought I disabled the ability of the user to delete, add and update rows along with disabling the grouping panel. However I ran the program and when I select a row and press delete the program complains that I don't have a deleteStoredProcedure set. I looked this up and the here it tells me to disable the command column ((GridViewCommandColumn)ASPxGridView1.Columns["CommandColumn"]).EditButton.Visible = Convert.ToBoolean(e.Parameters); Yet when I loop through my columns I don't have a command column. This site tells me to catch the delete button press using GridView1_CommandButtonInitialize but I can't access CommandButtonInitialize . In addition I discovered if I right click on the grid while the program is running I am able to make the group by panel show up which I specifically thought I disabled. Also by right-clicking I can open the column chooser which allows the user to access the columns that I don't want them to see and set to visible=false . How do I completely disable the ability of the user to delete rows, open/use the column chooser and show the group by panel in the DevExpress Gridview? EDIT: I'm using a DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView within a DevExpress.XtraEditors.PanelControl on a DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraForm . I wasn't able to find any examples that were specifically for DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView though the first link (ASP.NET) is from the DevExpress site so I was hoping they would have some correlation.
