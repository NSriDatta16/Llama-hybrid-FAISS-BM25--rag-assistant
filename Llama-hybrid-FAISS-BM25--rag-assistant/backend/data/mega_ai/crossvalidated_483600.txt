What is the Correct Model for Count Data with a Linear Conditional Mean?

This is my first question on Stack Exchange! I have looked extensively for an answer and it does not seem to exist so hopefully this will help many people with a similar problem. I am working on a question where the dependent variable is a whole number (# of applications from a HS to a college) which is highly skewed. By my understanding, this makes it an excellent candidate for a traditional count model (Poisson, Negative Binomial, etcetera). The problem with these models is that the effect of covariates are multiplicative. Such models predict that a one unit increase in say the average SAT score at a given HS will increase applications far more at those schools which already send a lot of applications. However, when I split the sample by the dependent variable and estimate on each subsample using OLS, I find that some important variables have similar coefficients across the entire range of DV values. In other words, the conditional mean is linear in these variables. Does anyone know of a count model that allows for a conditional mean which is linear in covariates over a certain range? I understand that a model which is purely linear probably wouldn't exist since it would predict negative values for some covariate combinations. Thank you for your help. Best, Jordan
