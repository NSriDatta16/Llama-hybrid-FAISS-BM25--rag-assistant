Search the .vcproj file, and the project source code for "Helpers.lib". There are a couple places it can get linked in, and this is the simplest way to find it. Otherwise, look for: Project properties -> linker -> inputs In the solution explorer, see if the .lib is included anywhere in the project tree. Anywhere in the source code, #pragma comment(lib, "helpers.lib") If Helpers is a project in your solution, check project dependencies for the project. By default, thisk linking is done implicitly if the project depends on it.
