I believe your compiler is attempting to treat \Èöê as an escape character. It's not a valid escape, of course. In fact, the backslash character isn't quite legal for a URI, per section 2.4.3 of RFC 2396 . Other characters are excluded because gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify such characters, or they are used as delimiters. unwise = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "[" | "]" | "`" However, some systems (e.g. IIS ) convert backslashes into forward slashes silently. I tried to run your code but ran into a number of errors that ultimately crashed MyEclipse, so this may not be the only issue.
