Yes what you are referring to is known as Aspect oriented programming. A typical library providing this for Java is AspectJ. You define what are called pointcuts, essentially regular expressions for classes and method names, including wildcards, and the code to execute at each pointcut, known as an advice. This is useful for logging and also security checks and similar cross cutting concerns. You can turn pointcut advices on and off through configuration. You can have an advice execute before a method call, after it returns or even after it throws an exception. Arguments are also available. An aspectj java agent is needed for this to work.
