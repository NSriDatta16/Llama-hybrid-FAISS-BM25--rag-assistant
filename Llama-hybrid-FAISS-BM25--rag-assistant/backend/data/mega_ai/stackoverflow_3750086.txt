How to capture mouse click with Javascript when the mouse has moved between mousedown and mouseup

I am building a website with a scrolling Javascript time line, using code from this tutorial . There is a demo to go with the tutorial here . My problem is as follows: if the user clicks on the timeline to drag it, and they happen to click on a link, then when the mouse button is released, the browser interprets that as a click on the link. Hence, it's very easy to navigate away from the timeline by accident. The behaviour I would like is as follows: clicking on a link only triggers navigation if the mouse has not been moved between mousedown and mouseup . If the mouse has been moved while the button is held down, then the link is not followed, since the user is trying to move the timeline rather than click on a link. Is this possible? I have a feeling we need a is_mouse_moved boolean variable that is set to false on mousedown and set to true on mousemove . Then on mouseup we check whether to "pass on" the mouseup event to the browser. As you can tell, I'm not overly familiar with js! Any help appreciated.
