Performing spatial logistic regression in R

I am trying to perform a logistic regression with the following code Y ~ x1+x2+x3,data=data, family=binomial(link="logit") . However on inspection of both the outcome and predictors i noticed that they are characterized by spatial auto-correlation. My question is, how do I account for the spatial auto-correlation, to get better coefficients?
