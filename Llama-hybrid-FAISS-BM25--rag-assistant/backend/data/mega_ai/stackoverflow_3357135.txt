Click and drag event handler

I have an app with a custom window (transparency and no borders). I made a header with a dragmove behavior on left mouse button down. This allows me to drag the window to the top so it maximizes. Now I want to write the code so that when I click the header and drag it, it restores the windowstate to normal... Is there a click & drag event handler, or another way? EDIT: Platform C#, in WPF
