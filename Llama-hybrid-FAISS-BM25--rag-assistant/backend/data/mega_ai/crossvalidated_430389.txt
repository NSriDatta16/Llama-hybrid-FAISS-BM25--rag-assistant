This problem falls in the category of meta-learning, for which there are many proposed methods. A key paper in this topic is the MAML (pronounced "mammal") paper by Chelsea Finn, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, " Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks ". The core concept of MAML is that the method of training allows models to rapidly adapt to new tasks with only a small amount of examples. The gist of the paper is that the ordinary way of training a neural network doesn't adapt well to a new problem which is similar to the one it was trained on. The authors use the example of sine waves with different amplitudes, but a cubic function with different coefficients seems like the same idea, in the sense that the MAML network may be able to quickly adapt from one cubic function to another.
