It depends which method are you using. I think it will work if you use Matcher.find(). It will not work if you are using Matcher.matches() because match works on whole line. If you are using matches() fix your pattern as following: ^\d+\.\s{1}[A-Z]+.* (pay attention on trailing .* ) And I'd also use \. instead of [.] . It is more readable.
