How to find Linear regression independent variables for future dates

I am new to the forum and Machine learning world. I have been through multiple linear regression tutorials where the example is stock prices. The dependent variable is closing price and independent variables are date, opening price. Always, the data set is split in 70:30 train:test respectively, and when predicting we use the test set. My question is, when we want to predict for dates that are not in the data set, how to find out what is the opening price, because it is also an unknown value in the future, should there be a regression for it as well. Please help in understanding this problem. I apologise if I might not have used all the technical terms. Thanks
