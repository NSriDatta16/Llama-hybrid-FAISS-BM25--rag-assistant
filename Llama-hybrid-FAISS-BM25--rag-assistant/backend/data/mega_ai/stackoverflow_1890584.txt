Multidimensional data feedback

This is hardly a programming question, so if you're a purest feel free to read no further. Are there any good examples on how to display multidimensional data on a computer screen? I don't know how many dimensions there will be, though anything more than 10 I suspect will be rare. I can think of the obvious solution, but I don't know if this results in truly humanly readable feedback: map first dimension onto x axis map second dimension onto y axis map third dimension onto dot Radius map fourth dimension onto dot Red component map fifth dimension onto dot Green component map sixth dimension onto dot Blue component map seventh dimension onto dot spiky-edge-property Manual sketch http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/md_map.png Does anyone know of any existing software that elegantly handles this problem?
