Wipe external storage doesn't work

Has anyone tried this flag for wipeData()? I think WIPE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE flag doesn't work because after calling the function, it will reset the phone to factory settings leaving the previous data on the external storage device. I hope someone can confirm about this one. Thanks
