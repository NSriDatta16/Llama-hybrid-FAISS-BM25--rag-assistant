Conversion of ARMA to ARIMA in R using coefficient

I wanted to know given generated data from an ARMA(p,q) model, can I create data from an ARIMA (p,1,q) model?I tried in the web but unable to find anything . For the ARMA parameters, choose μ,φ1,φ2,θ1, and θ2 so that the model is stationary and invertible. Based on above parameter Generate three time series for the ARIMA(2,2,2) for each of the following values of σa: 0.8, 0.1, and 0.01. I attempted the question like this: #Check whether AR root are stationary rootsar=polyroot(c(1,0.15,-0.20)) Mod(rootar) #Check whether MA root are invertibe rootsma=polyroot(c(1,0.05,-0.25)) Mod(rootsma) #Generating ARMA for different value of sigma(assuming n=1008) arma=arima.sim(n=1004,list(ar=c(0.15,-0.20),ma=c(0.05,-0.25)),mean=1,s=0.8) But above code will ARMA process data but I want to generate ARIMA(2,2,2).Also how to check if mean(mu) is stationary and invertible.Like I use polyroot function to check for stationary/invertible My apologies for long post.Would appreciate any input. Use R for explanation.
