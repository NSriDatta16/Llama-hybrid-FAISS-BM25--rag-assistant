This isn't something that jQuery is generally helpful with--it works more at the node level than the text/html level. However, this might help ( source ): $('p:contains(&)').each(function(){ $(this).html( $(this).html().replace('&amp;',' &amp; ') ); }); Obviously if you can restrict the initial search to something better than all paragraphs, it'd perform better. You should also test it to see if the :contains filter actually helps. It's not pretty but it seems to work.
