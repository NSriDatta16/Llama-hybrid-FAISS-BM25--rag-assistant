Maybe you should think of breaking this up. When you initiate your object, get only what details you need for that object to function. If and when you need more details, then go and get them. You distribute your load and processing this way: the object only gets the load and processing it needs to function, and when more is needed, it gets it then. So, in your example - create the complex first. When you need to access a unit, then create that unit, when you need the agent, then get that agent, etc. $complexDetails = array('id' => $id, etc); $complexUnits = array(); ......... $complexUnits[] = new unit(); ......... $complexDetails['agent'] = new Agent();
