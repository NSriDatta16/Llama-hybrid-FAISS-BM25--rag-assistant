You can pass a method to the revert option as well, for example if we take the example demo like this: I revert when I'm not dropped Drop me here â€‹ Then on your draggable you can calculate whether to revert, like this: $("#draggable").draggable({ revert: function(dropped) { var dropped = dropped && dropped[0].id == "droppable"; if(!dropped) alert("I'm reverting, what a cruel world!"); return !dropped; } }); You can give it a try here , the dropped parameter passed in is the element it was dropped on that's a .droppable() , it's just false if it landed anywhere else. Or if you're using the accept option you may want to calculate off that, like this: var dropped = dropped && $(this).is(dropped.droppable('option', 'accept')); This uses the accept selector and uses .is() to see if the droppable matches. You can view a demo of that here .
