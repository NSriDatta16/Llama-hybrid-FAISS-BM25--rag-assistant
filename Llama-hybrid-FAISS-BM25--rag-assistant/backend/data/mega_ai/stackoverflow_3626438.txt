A Out of Memory error message is not the server hitting a memory limit; It is the script-instance-specific memory_limit setting in PHP. Meaning, it's not necessarily a malicious act on the admin's end. What you need to do is to change PHP's memory_limit setting to a higher value, like 32 MB. How Magento ever managed to run with 13 Megabytes is a mystery to me. It could be that this value has been changed recently, for whatever reason.
