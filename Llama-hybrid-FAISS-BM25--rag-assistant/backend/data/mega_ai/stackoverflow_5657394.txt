You can use a gsub with a regex that matches the first character of each word and replaces it with the uppercase character: ruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 > 'omega-3 (DHA)'.gsub(/\b\w/){ $&.upcase } => "Omega-3 (DHA)" [Oh... but that's overly complicated if you just want the first character of the string... the gsub will do the first character of each word. s[0] = s[0].upcase would work just fine.]
