Reasonable hyperparameter range for Latent Dirichlet Allocation?

What are good ranges for the hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (explained well here ) in LDA? I appreciate hyperparameter tuning always depends on the use case, data, content of documents etc., but is there any general rule or heuristic to choose these hyperparameters for LDA? Additional Info For extra info on my particular use case and data (although I'd like a generalizeable answer if possible): 29 documents with an average length of 5,177 words (after parsing). This number of documents is expected to grow to between 50-200. 3,500 unique words (after parsing and keeping the top 3,500 words by frequency) 155,309 total words (again, after parsing) All documents are finance related, and more specifically investment outlook whitepapers. So there isn't a lot of "variety" between documents This is quite a small dataset, but I think there's enough words and structure in each document to train an LDA model (if not, please let me know).
