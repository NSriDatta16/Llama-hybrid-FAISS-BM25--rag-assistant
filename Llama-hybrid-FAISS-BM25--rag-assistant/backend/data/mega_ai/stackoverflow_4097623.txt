Since you already have ATL you can examine its sources and see how IDispatchImpl does all that stuff. IDispatch methods are implemented therehby reading data from the type library in the same module since it's the easiest and most reliable way when a type library is already present. It's also worth noting that it's a rather hard topic for making a demonstration on it - you'll need to write a lot of code that doesn't really bring any insight. IMO you'll be much better off if you implement an events interface that doesn't inherit from IDispatch but rather inherits directly from IUnknown - this will demonstrate how events work without dragging too much of attention to IDispatch inner workings.
