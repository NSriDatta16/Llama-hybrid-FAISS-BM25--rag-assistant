Set bean property from JSF page

I need to do very simple thing - pass current URL from JSF (2.0) page to the managed bean. This is needed to get URL of the login form which will redirect user back to the current page after login. (I use GAE and the bean is the wrapping around its user service, if it does matter). Any obvious way I tried doesn't work - doesn't work (w/o any error or warning message) getter which takes current URL as a parameter - doesn't work. So many questions and many recipes, but all are complex and not elegant. Why? May be I (as other who asking) missed a key design principle? I'll appreciate any answer - simple and straightforward recipe or explanation why not to do so.
