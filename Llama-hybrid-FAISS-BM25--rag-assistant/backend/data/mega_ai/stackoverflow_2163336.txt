I found a method that while not very elegant it is simple and works pretty well using serialize(). my form code snippet: Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas The FBJS needed to get this to work: 0 && params.radioPicks!="") return true; else var myDialog = new Dialog(Dialog.DIALOG_POP); myDialog.showMessage('Almost Done!', 'Please complete all fields', button_confirm='Close'); return false; } --> The key to this validation method relies on a empty option tag to return "" for the selected tag value and a "" for the radio buttons. I added a hidden input and named it the same name as the radio buttons to add its data to the array returned. the "" value is used in the conditional to check and say if these fields are not empty give the form the ok to send the info to the server. I hope this helps.
