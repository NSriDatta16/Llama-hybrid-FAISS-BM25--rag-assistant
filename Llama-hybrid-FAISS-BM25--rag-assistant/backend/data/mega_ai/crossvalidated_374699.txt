Can anyone help explain this basic example of posterior

I am having trouble understanding the authors reasoning here. It is from " The Bayesian Choice " I am confused about why the posterior is initially written without depending on the data, and why we integrate the numerator. It is, Consider one observation $x$ , from a normal $$N(\frac{\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}}{2},1)$$ Then (From the book, page 24).
