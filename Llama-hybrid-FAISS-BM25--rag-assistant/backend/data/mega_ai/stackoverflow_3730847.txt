Function and Cast create function expcast_int_to_bool(i integer) returning boolean; if (i is null) then return null; elif (i != 0) then return 't'; else return 'f'; end if; end function; create explicit cast (integer as boolean with expcast_int_to_bool); Demonstration create table mytable ( id integer not null, isavailable boolean not null ); insert into mytable values(1, 't'); insert into mytable values(2, 'f'); select id from mytable where isavailable = cast(0 as boolean); select id from mytable where isavailable = cast(1 as boolean); select id from mytable where isavailable = cast(-1 as boolean); select id from mytable where isavailable = cast('t' as boolean); select id from mytable where isavailable = cast('f' as boolean); This demonstration can be run through DB-Access - and it correctly returns ID 2 for the first and last SELECT statements and ID 1 for the other three. I have not formally demonstrated that it still works when the integer or boolean literals are replaced by '?'. There is at least a moderate chance that it will work, though.
