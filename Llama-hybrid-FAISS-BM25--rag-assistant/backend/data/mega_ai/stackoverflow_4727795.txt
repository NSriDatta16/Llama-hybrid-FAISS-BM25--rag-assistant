Using XAML, you can provide a template for different types contained within the form. For example, in this case, you can specify that ListBoxItem's fire off a certain event handler. This is the bulk of the XAML markup code (details found here: How to catch Click on ListboxItem when the item is templated? ) ... Another thing to check before is to try and change your DragDrop.DoDragDrop() method call to something else to see if the issue has to do with that method. Since the Label's content is changing, I would imagine it has something to do with that method.
