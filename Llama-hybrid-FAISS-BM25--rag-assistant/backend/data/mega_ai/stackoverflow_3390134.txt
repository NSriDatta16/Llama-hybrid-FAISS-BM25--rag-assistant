iphone - will it leak?

This is something I don't understand. Look at this method (copied from http://blog.blackwhale.at/2009/07/uibutton-in-uitableview-footer/ ) See that footerView is allocated on the beginning of the code and never released. As far as I understand, the object should be autoreleased or at least released after used on a regular case, but as this method is run automatically by the tables when they are built, where exactly will this view be released... or will it leak? I have seen Apple samples of code with stuff like that, so I suppose the object is being released somewhere... but where? // custom view for footer. will be adjusted to default or specified footer height // Notice: this will work only for one section within the table view - (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForFooterInSection:(NSInteger)section { if(footerView == nil) { //allocate the view if it doesn't exist yet footerView = [[UIView alloc] init]; //we would like to show a gloosy red button, so get the image first UIImage *image = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"button_red.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:8 topCapHeight:8]; //create the button UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect]; [button setBackgroundImage:image forState:UIControlStateNormal]; //the button should be as big as a table view cell [button setFrame:CGRectMake(10, 3, 300, 44)]; //set title, font size and font color [button setTitle:@"Remove" forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [button.titleLabel setFont:[UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:20]]; [button setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; //set action of the button [button addTarget:self action:@selector(removeAction:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; //add the button to the view [footerView addSubview:button]; } //return the view for the footer return footerView; } thanks.
