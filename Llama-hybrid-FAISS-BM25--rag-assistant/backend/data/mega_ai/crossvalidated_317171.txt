Both answers that I have seen so far are correct: The unconditional variance of a (covariance-) stationary process does not depend on the point in time. However, the conditional variance (to which you might be refering to) may depend on the past of the process. You might want to check out Conditonally Heteroskedastic Models . Autoregressive Moving Average models are used to model the conditional mean of a time series while GARCH models are used to describe the conditional variance of a time series.
