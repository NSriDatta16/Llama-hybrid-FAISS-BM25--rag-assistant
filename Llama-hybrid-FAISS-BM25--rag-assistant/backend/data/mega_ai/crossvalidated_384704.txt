Which test applicable to compare means across time series?

I am currently writing my Master thesis and seek some advise how to best analyse my data and what the appropriate test for significance would be. To give you some background: I want to analyse whether a certain type of event has a significant impact on the trading volume of a company's stock price. For this, I have compiled a sample of ~400 different companies, each with a unique company ticker. For every company, I have an event date - the date at which the event happens which I want to analyse. My analysis in a nutshell: I compute the average trading volume before and after the event date for each company. For each company, I have a series of stock market data, which I use to compute the mean around the event date. Data Excerpt: PERMNO Names.Date Volume 1 10028 02.01.2009 1.7100 2 10028 05.01.2009 1.7100 3 10028 06.01.2009 1.7100 4 10028 07.01.2009 1.7208 5 10028 08.01.2009 1.8000 R computes the means for me - for each of the 400 PERMNO codes. Example Output: EventExcerpt # PERMNO Event.Date Event.Date.min Event.Date.max AvgBefore AvgAfter #1 10028 2009-02-06 2009-01-07 2009-03-08 1.528468 1.066490 #2 14093 2014-03-25 2014-02-23 2014-04-24 6.628968 5.679082 #3 35554 2015-10-07 2015-09-07 2015-11-06 119.761364 119.816087 I now want to statistically analyze the data with the goal of saying: Does the event have a significant influence on the trading volume by comparing the average before and after the event. If the average before is higher/lower - than I would conclude that there is a statistically significant event influence. I had an analysis like an ANOVA analysis in mind - however, I have not two subgroups here but rather two different time intervals which I want to compare and am not sure whether this works here. Therefore, I am asking for advice which test could be applied here to achieve the goal I described above.
