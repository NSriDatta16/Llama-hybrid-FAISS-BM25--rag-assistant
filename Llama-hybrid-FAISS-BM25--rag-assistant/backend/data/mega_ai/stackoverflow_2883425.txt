How can I allow Drag and Drop from Windows Explorer into a C# WPF application?

I know there have been tons of answers on this subject, but I still cannot get it to work at all. I've enabled AllowDrop on every control at every level of the application, and tried to catch DragEnter and Drop on every control to no avail. I can drag and drop items inside the application, but any time I try to bring something in from Windows Explorer or the desktop, etc. it gives me the No icon. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? Here's an example of what I'm doing. Still does not show the move cursor and won't hit the MainWindow_DragEnter function. namespace WpfApplication1 { /// /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml /// public partial class MainWindow : Window { public MainWindow() { InitializeComponent(); this.AllowDrop = true; this.DragEnter += new DragEventHandler(MainWindow_DragEnter); } void MainWindow_DragEnter(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { e.Effects = DragDropEffects.Move; } } }
