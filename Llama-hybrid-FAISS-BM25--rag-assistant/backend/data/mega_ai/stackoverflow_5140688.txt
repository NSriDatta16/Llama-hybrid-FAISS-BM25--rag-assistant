URL pattern to match n terms

I'm trying to write a Django URL pattern that matches 1 to n strings separated by slashes. It should match any of these and pass each term to the view: foo.com/apples foo.com/apples/oranges foo.com/oranges/apples/lizards/google_android/adama In Django I could just pass the entire thing to a view as a string and parse it manually, but I was curious if there is some kind of regex to do this more elegantly.
