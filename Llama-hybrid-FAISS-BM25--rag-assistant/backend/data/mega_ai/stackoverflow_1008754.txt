If you have no business need to switch to unicode, then don't do it. I'm basing this on the fact that you thought you'd need to change code unrelated to component you already need to change to make it all work with Unicode. If you can make the component/feature you're working on "Unicode ready" without spreading code churn to lots of other components (especially other components without good test coverage) then go ahead and make it unicode ready. But don't go churn your whole codebase without business need. If the business need arises later, address it then. Otherwise, you aren't going to need it. People in this thread may suppose scenarios where it becomes a business requirement. Run those scenarios by your product managers before considering them scenarios worth addressing. Make sure they know the cost of addressing them when you ask.
