How Important is Machine Learning to a Data Scientist?

When ever the word data science pops up people generally become quick to move to machine learning. Is that the right thing? For a data scientist isn't the handling of data (collection, pre-processing, visualization, etc.,) more important? I am aware of the thread What is valued more in the data science job market, statistical analysis or data processing? , but the answers really didn't help me and the job market has changed since then!
