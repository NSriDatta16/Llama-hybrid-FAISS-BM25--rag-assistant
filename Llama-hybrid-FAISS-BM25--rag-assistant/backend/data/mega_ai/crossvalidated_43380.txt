Normalizing data before applying MDS with strain criterion

The features of my dataset are like below: • BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal) • Age: patient's age in years (integer) ranges from 18 to 96 • Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal) • Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal) • Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal) When I run MDS with "strain" criterion on such a dataset without normalizing it first, I get a result as follows: However, if I normalize the data the result is as follows: The second results is pretty similar to results that I have got for other criteria and also for the PCA even I didn't normalize the data for them also. So, my question is: Why does normalizing data make difference for "strain" criterion? Thanks in advance...
