Once you get past the FFT stuff that Lennart mentioned, you might want to have a look at Markov chains for analyzing intervals between notes, and aggregated patterns. This is kind of treaded ground, but Markov chains have been used in the past to build a kind of statistical model of melodies from various songs which can be used to generate new melodies. Markov chains can do the same with written english sentences. For an example of how that looks, have a play with the megahal chatterbot to see how markov chains can produce mangled output that statistically looks like its input (in megahal's case, it looks like english sentences) You could concievably mash up the top 100, and have a markov chain generator blast out the next big hit. On the other hand, you may want to consider the possibility that it is not any quality of the music itself that makes a song popular. Or perhaps it is a quality of music issue combined with marketing.
