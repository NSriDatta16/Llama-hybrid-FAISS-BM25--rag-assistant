A good guiding principle should be that instead of worrying about whether the browser can handle the volume of data you're sending it, worry about whether your user can handle it. It all depends on the presentation of course (i.e., a lot of data bound for a visualization tool that'll render a complex graph in a canvas is different than a lot of raw numbers bound for a gigantic table), but in my experience a user's brain reaches data overload before the browser/network/client computer.
