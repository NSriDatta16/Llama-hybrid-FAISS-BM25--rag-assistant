I looked at your data and it is extremely skewed with outliers. Thus you do not have perfect separation but the warning is occurring because some of the extreme observations have predicted probabilities indistinguishable from 1. If you fit the model on the log of avg_load_time you will not get the error (I tested this on your sample data). This answer explains what's going on well: Issue with complete separation in logistic regression (in R)
