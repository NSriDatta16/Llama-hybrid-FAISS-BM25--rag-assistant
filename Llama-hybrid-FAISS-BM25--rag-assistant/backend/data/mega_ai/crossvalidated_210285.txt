How to get Cox & Snell, Nagelkerke R-Square in R logistic regression output?

I'm new to R (used to work with SPSS), and looking for a function that will output the Cox & Snell and Nagelkerke R-Square measures of logistic regression. In SPSS they are displayed as part of the regular output, but in R I'm not sure what manipulation should I employ on the glm summary to output those measures.
