No - the user agent chooses its own default style, and there is (to my knowledge) no CSS attributes you can change to determine the masking character. Of course, this would be possible if the password field was just a standard text field, and you manually masked the input with a javascript event handler (onKeyPress, probably). You could even declare the field as type="password" in the HTML, then have your JS function modify the DOM to change its type. I'd be a little wary about doing this, though; the browser implementation is almost certainly pretty solid, and circumventing established security functionality to roll your own is rarely a good idea.
