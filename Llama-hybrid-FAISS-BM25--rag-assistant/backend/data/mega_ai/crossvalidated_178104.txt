The methodology you have described is sound as others have said. You should perform the exact same transformation on your test set features as you do on features from your training set. I think it's worth adding that another reason for feature normalization is to enhance the performance of certain processes that are sensitive to differences to the scale of certain variables. For example principal components analysis (PCA) aims to capture the greatest proportion of variance, and as a result will give more weight to variables that exhibit the largest variance if feature normalization is not performed initially.
