Neural architectures: data-informed automatic design

The recent progress in neural networks is summarized by a sequence of novel architectures characterized mainly by its growing design complexity. From LeNet5 (1994) to AlexNet (2012), to Overfeat (2013) and GoogleLeNet/Inception (2014) and so on... Is there any attempt to let the machine decide/design which architecture to be used depending on the data?
