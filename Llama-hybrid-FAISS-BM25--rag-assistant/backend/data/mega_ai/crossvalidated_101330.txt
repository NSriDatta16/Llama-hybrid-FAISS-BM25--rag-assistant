If elasticity is the changes in probability as a result of 1% change in an independent variable, then first you have to: 1- Calculate probability of model, in stata predict, p1 2-Increase interested variable by 1%, in stata: var*1.01 3-Again calculate probability, predict, p2 4-The differences between two probabilities are elasticity. E=average(p2-p1)
