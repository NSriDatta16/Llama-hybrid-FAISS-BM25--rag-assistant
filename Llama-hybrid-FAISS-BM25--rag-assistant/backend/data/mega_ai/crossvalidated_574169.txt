Logistic regression - One model trained on different groups

I have a logistic regression model that trains a set of binary independent variables (X) on a binary response variable (Y). The data was gathered from different individuals for who also e.g. socio-demographic data exists. I can therefore split my X and Y into subsets (e.g. by gender) and train the same model for the individual subgroups. I get for the individual groups different independent variable coefficients. Say e.g. I have for group 1 and x1 the coefficient β1=0.123 and for group 2 and x1 the coefficient β1=-0.456. How can I use the coefficients to compare the two groups with respect to the independent variable x1? What else does me the coefficients tell? How can I show statistically significant differences between the coefficients (and the independent variables)?
