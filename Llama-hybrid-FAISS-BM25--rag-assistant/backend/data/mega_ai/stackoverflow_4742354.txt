PHP day of week numeric to day of week text

This may be really easy but I can't find a PHP function to do this... OK so $dow_numeric = date('w'); gives the numeric day of the week 0-6 for Sunday to Saturday. And $dow_text = date('D'); gives the 3 letter abbreviation for the text day of the week (Sun, Mon, etc.) Is there a function or easy way to use $dow_numeric to get $dow_text ? If I have '0' as $dow_numeric , how can I make $dow_text = 'Sun' ? Yes a switch statement could do the job, but Iâ€™m looking for a more elegant solution.
