Minimizing Curve fit for predictive model

Let's assume we've found 100 independent variables that can predict y. Each of those independent variable are close to uncorrelated and they are all curve fitted. Using any single one to predict y equates to a large probability of failed out of sample predictive performance. But if we combine all of them via some sort of ensemble averaging, the final prediction would be more robust. The logic here is similar to diversifying across each independent variables predictiveness since it's highly unlikely that all of them will fail together. Does this logic make sense? Are there any literature in predictive modelling that discuss this subject more?
