Well, the XML is GETable. As for valid, it lacks , yet I think it's not required. Tested it on my local server (PHP 5.3), no errors reported. I've used your source code and it works. Here's a print_r(): SimpleXMLElement Object ( [results] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [meta] => Array ( [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [content] => HTML Tidy for Java (vers. 26 Sep 2004), see www.w3.org [name] => generator ) ) [1] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [content] => 1800;url=?refresh=1 [http-equiv] => refresh ) ) [2] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [content] => CNN.com delivers the latest breaking news and information on the latest top stories, weather, business, entertainment, politics, and more. For in-depth coverage, CNN.com provides special reports, video, audio, photo galleries, and interactive guides. [name] => Description ) ) [3] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [content] => CNN, CNN news, CNN.com, CNN TV, news, news online, breaking news, U.S. news, world news, weather, business, CNN Money, sports, politics, law, technology, entertainment, education, travel, health, special reports, autos, developing story, news video, CNN Intl [name] => Keywords ) ) [4] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [content] => text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 [http-equiv] => content-type ) ) ) ) ) I'd suggest you to encode the URL, but that's already done. You could try performing the query with cURL.
