It can be a pretty difficult endeavour to do right. If you don't have much knowledge in compiler theory you should probably first start reading about it. Just using "fun string parsing", if I understand that term correctly, isn't going to get you very far at all. The first basic step is to write your language grammar that defines the valid syntax for the language. A tool like ANTLR will help you get the pieces together, but I would suggest reading the Dragon book as it is the canonical starting point to get up to speed on the subject.
