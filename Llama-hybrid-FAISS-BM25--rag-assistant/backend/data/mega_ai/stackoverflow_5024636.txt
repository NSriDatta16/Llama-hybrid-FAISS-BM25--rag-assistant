I have never run a benchmark on this but my personal opinion is that the difference is negligible. What is better than both of those methods however is doing all your processing first, then printing the results into the HTML. A common method is to use a templating tool like Smarty . The reason for this is because you should almost always separate your concerns when programming applications, especially web applications. You should make sure that the data processing is separate from the application logic and also from application design. This is called Model View Controller (MVC) and is a great way to keep your application organised and maintainable. If that's a bit too complicated for you, then you should at least try out Smarty. It's very easy to use and will save you a lot of time and effort. Edit: Also, you should never print user-supplied data in your html without first escaping it. This is to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) which is a common yet very serious vulnerability in web pages. Rather than doing this: You should use the htmlspecialchars function: You should replace the 'UTF-8' with the correct encoding of your data. This is the reason you should also explicitly state the encoding: http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/may/character-encoding-and-xss
