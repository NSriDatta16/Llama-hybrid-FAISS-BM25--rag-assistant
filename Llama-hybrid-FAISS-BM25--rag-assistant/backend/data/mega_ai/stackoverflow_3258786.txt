Your question lacks any question marks. As such, I'm not sure I'm fully answering what you are asking. This information is largely derived from use of ELF files over BDM, not from actual documentation: ELF is a file specification, so all ELF files should be the same. The ELF file is generated by the linker, and contains symbol information as well as executable code organized into sections. When the user programs an ECM, the debugger/programmer reads through the ELF file, picks out addresses of sections and their associated code, then writes these as desired. Whether the executable is written to RAM or ROM depends on either the addresses of the sections in the ELF (usually configurable via a config file read by the linker) or the settings of the programmer when the program is "programmed". Most debuggers have an option to load an image to either ROM or RAM. The only difference in the program images is the locations of code and variables. In the situation that you describe, your programmer seems to not be able to pull the executable data from the elf file. I assume that your fls file is some sort of raw image file that can be written word for word to the target hardware.
