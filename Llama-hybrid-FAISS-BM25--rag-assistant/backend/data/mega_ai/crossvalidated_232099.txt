What exactly is the Bayesian model average probability of the following?

I am struggling to understand Bayesian Model Averaging. Suppose I have got a simple Bayesian network, $X\to Y$ where X and Y are binary variables and I have got 2 models: Model 1 (simple): $$P(Y=1\vert X=1)=\theta \quad\text{and}\quad P(Y=1\vert X=0)=\theta$$ Model 2 (complex): $$ P(Y=1\vert X=1)=\theta_1\quad\text{and}\quad P(Y=1\vert X=0)=\theta_2$$ If I assume the parameters prior to be Beta distributed and hence the posterior to be Beta distributed as well. What would be the averaged posterior of the 2 models? I am mainly confused as there are 1 parameter in model 1 and 2 parameters in model 2, I'm not sure what the posterior average would look like. Thanks! P.S. I understand how to derive posterior model weight $P(M_1\vert D)$ and $P(M_2\vert D)$
