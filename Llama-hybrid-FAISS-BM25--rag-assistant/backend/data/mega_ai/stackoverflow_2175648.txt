create a textbox that accepts only numeric values. Problem with designer mode

i have a form that has some six - seven text boxes. few text boxes needs to accept only numeric chars i.e from 0-9, a decimal poing and + or - i handled the textbox key press event private void textBox1_KeyPress(object sender, KeyPressEventArgs e) { if (!char.IsControl(e.KeyChar) && !char.IsDigit(e.KeyChar) && e.KeyChar != '.') { e.Handled = true; } } Now i have to write the same code for all the textboxes which i felt is redudant. I created a new class MyTextBox derived from TextBox and added the above code into it. In the designer mode i drag and drop the textbox control .. go to the Designer.cs file and change the line to private MyTextbox m_txtName = new MytextBox(); Now the problem is that if i add a new button or any control to teh form the designer.cs file is changed/updated... and the aboe line is changed to the normal TextBox and i got to go replace this everytime ... can i avoid this ? Note: I do not want to use MasktextBox or numericKeydown control.
