assume you have just three time series $Y,X_1,X_2$ then the model is \begin{align} Y&=\beta_1X_1+\beta_2 (X_2-a_1X_1)+\beta_3(X_3-a_2X_1)\\ &=X_1(\beta_1-\beta_2a_1-\beta_3a_2)+\beta_2X_2+\beta_3X_3\\ &=X_1\tilde\beta_1+\beta_2X_2+\beta_3X_3 \end{align} That is not more that a linear model (for simplicity I assumed variables are centered). If I understand your model well, that is a simple linear model that needs just one step to estimate parameters. Then proposing a two step optimization procedure is not necessary.
