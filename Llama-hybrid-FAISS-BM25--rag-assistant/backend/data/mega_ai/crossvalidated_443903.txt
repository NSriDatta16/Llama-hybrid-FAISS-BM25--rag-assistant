What is it called to classify easy inputs before hard ones?

For classifying a lot of inputs, it may be useful to handle the more unambiguous cases first and learn from them before tackling the harder ones. This is certainly how I personally grade student work; the idea must be ancient. What is it called to classify instances from easy to hard? I thought it would be a kind of reinforcement learning, but I'm having trouble framing this basic idea in the language of RL, as a balance between exploitation and exploration.
