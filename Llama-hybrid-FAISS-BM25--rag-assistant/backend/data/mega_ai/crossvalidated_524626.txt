This is probably best modeled with discrete-time survival analysis, which is essentially logistic or another binary-outcome regression that incorporates time as a predictor. That gets around the problems that you face: only knowing the event time to within a year (which otherwise would require specialized interval-censoring analysis), time-varying covariate values updated annually, and a potential lack of proportional hazards. As there is only 1 event per individual you don't have to take into account intra-individual correlations in outcomes (as you would if multiple events were possible per individual). The third paragraph from the end of this answer outlines discrete-time survival analysis, with a couple of links to further reading. With your data already formatted at 1 row per person per year through the event year, you just have to submit the data to a logistic regression (or possibly use a complementary log-log link for a grouped proportional-hazards model) with the outcome being the event marker (1 for event, 0 for no event) and your set of covariates as predictors. The question you need to resolve is how to handle time, which should be included in the model as a predictor if for no other reason than to make sure that you don't have an unexpected relationship between time and event probability. Simplest might be to set time = 0 to the study-entry year for each individual. If you think that time since a change in a particular covariate is important, you could consider re-setting time = 0 at each such change. Or if you think that calendar year is important (for example, if the event might have to do with underlying economic conditions), then use the earliest calendar year as the time = 0 reference. You can evaluate multiple such times if you wish; for example, you could include both calendar year and an individual's time since study entry if that makes sense. Those decisions need to be based on your knowledge of the subject matter and the goal of your study.
