Well given that FP counting is based on storage and end user interface, not sure if its even meaningful for EAI (from what little I remember). I would say you can't, at least not in a useful way. FP counting is generally viewed as a dubious practice of varying accuracy, doing it to an integration project would just add more fuzzyness.
