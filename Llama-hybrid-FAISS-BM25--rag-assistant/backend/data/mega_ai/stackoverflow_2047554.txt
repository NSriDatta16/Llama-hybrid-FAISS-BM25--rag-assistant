How to make ImageButton in Android automatically scale based on screen density?

I have an image put on an ImageButton , which looks good on a mdpi ( medium-dpi ) screen. However, when the device has a hdpi ( high-dpi ) screen, the image is still pixel-by-pixel accurate, which look small on the device screen. How do I make such that the image (and therefore the ImageButton ) scaled based on the density-independent pixels ( dp or dip ) instead of pixels?
