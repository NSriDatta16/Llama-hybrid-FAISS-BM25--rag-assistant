Don't trust web hosts that offer unlimited bandwidth and storage. It costs them money and they're not going to give it to you for free. If you have loads of static contents (mainly images), use a WordPress plugin that can throw it all to cheap offsite storage like Amazon S3. This way, you're paying minimal costs for this storage and using the 'regular' hosting for PHP (WordPress). Also, you should use a caching plugin, like WP Super Cache, to drastically decrease the processing load from your server. This way, you'll be making good use of resources, pay the minimal fee and get high performance.
