R - ordering in boxplot

I am trying to produce a series of box plots in R that is grouped by 2 factors. I've managed to make the plot, but I cannot get the boxes to order in the correct direction. My data farm I am using looks like this: Nitrogen Species Treatment 2 G L 3 R M 4 G H 4 B L 2 B M 1 G H I tried: boxplot(mydata$Nitrogen~mydata$Species*mydata$Treatment) this ordered the boxes alphabetically (first three were the "High" treatments, then within those three they were ordered by species name alphabetically). I want the box plot ordered Low>Medium>High then within each of those groups G>R>B for the species. So i tried using a factor in the formula: f = ordered(interaction(mydata$Treatment, mydata$Species), levels = c("L.G","L.R","L.B","M.G","M.R","M.B","H.G","H.R","H.B") then: boxplot(mydata$Nitrogen~f) however the boxes are still shoeing up in the same order. The labels are now different, but the boxes have not moved. I have pulled out each set of data and plotted them all together individually: lg = mydata[mydata$Treatment="L" & mydata$Species="G", "Nitrogen"] mg = mydata[mydata$Treatment="M" & mydata$Species="G", "Nitrogen"] hg = mydata[mydata$Treatment="H" & mydata$Species="G", "Nitrogen"] etc .. boxplot(lg, lr, lb, mg, mr, mb, hg, hr, hb) This gives what i want, but I would prefer to do this in a more elegant way, so I don't have to pull each one out individually for larger data sets. Loadable data: mydata
