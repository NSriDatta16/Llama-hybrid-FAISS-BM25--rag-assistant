If $\hat{\mu}$ is the mean error rate computed averaging $N$ error rates from different $N$ tests, an explanation could be: Let $X$ be the number of errors on $N$ tests, so $X$ is a binomial distributed random variable with mean $N\hat{\mu}$ and variance $N\hat{\mu}(1-\hat{\mu})$ (it is sum of $N$ Bernoulli random variables). Thus $X/N\sim Bin\bigg(\hat{\mu},\frac{\hat{\mu}(1-\hat{\mu})}{N}\bigg)$. By the central limit theorem it could be approximated to a normal random variable with same mean and variance. Then you can compute the $\alpha$ confidence interval with: $$P\bigg(-z_{1-\alpha/2}\leq\frac{\mu-\hat{\mu}}{\sqrt{\hat{\mu}(1-\hat{\mu})/N}}\leq z_{1-\alpha/2}\bigg) = 1 - \alpha$$ Bibliography: It is similar to estimate a confidence interval for accuracy using a $N$ values test set in a classification problem. You should take a look to P.N. Tan, M. Steinbach, V. Kumar Introduction to Data Mining. Addison Wesley, 2006.
