I found more elegant and more to the point answer. Track last N (say 20) mouse positions. Those positions are bounded by rectangle whose top is minimum(P(N).top), bottom = maximum(P(N).bottom), etc. Calculate the total distance the mouse moved during those last N times. If the total distance traveled is more than K times larger than that rectangle's perimeter then it's a shake. You may want to determine N based on time. Take only the mouse positions that are old at most 1.5 seconds, or so.
