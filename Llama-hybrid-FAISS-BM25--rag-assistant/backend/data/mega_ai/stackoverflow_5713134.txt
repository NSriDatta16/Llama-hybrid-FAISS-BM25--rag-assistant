There is no easy way to include Views in Entity Framework as it does not allow any table/view to be included without "Key" (PrimaryKey) which will cause more efforts as you will have to map view manually in EDMX and then map keys etc. Now we have found out an alternative approach, Create View called ChartItems in your DB Create LinqToSQL file ViewDB Drag View ChartItems in ViewDB Create ChartItem[] GetChartItems method in your RIA Domain Service Class as follow public ChartItem[] GetChartItems(..parameters...){ ViewDB db = new ViewDB(); return db.ChartItems.Where(...query mapping...).ToArray(); } RIA Domain Service Class can contain any arbitrary method that you can directly invoke from client with parameters. It is as simple as calling a web service. And you have to return an array because IQueryable may or may not work in some cases, but we prefer Array. You can try IQueryable but it may not work correctly against linq to SQL.
