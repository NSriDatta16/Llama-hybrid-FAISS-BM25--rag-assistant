As indicated in the earlier comments, once you get a sample from the joint distribution of $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$, $$(x_1^1,x_2^1,x_3^1),\ldots,(x_1^t,x_2^t,x_3^t)$$ the marginal sample $$(x_1^1,x_2^1),\ldots,(x_1^t,x_2^t)$$is indeed a sample from the marginal joint distribution of $(X_1,X_2)$ and you can ignore the simulated $x_3^j$'s. They can however be useful in Monte Carlo evaluations through a technique called Rao-Blackwellisation since the average$$\frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^t h(x_1^i,x_2^i)$$is improved by the average$$\frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^t \mathbb{E}[h(x_1^i,x_2^i)|x_3^i]$$as a conditional expectation shares the same expectation as the original but reduces the variance. See for instance this discussion on Cross Validated.
