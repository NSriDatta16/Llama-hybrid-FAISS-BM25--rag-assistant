svn commit fails svn: '/svn/!svn/bc/

After doing some refactoring, in Eclipse, Subversion starts to complain when commiting. I have no clue of how to fix it. I have managed to delete (and commited the deletion of GPFragmentRef.java . >niclas@nl:~/$svn commit -m "trying again" Adding core/doc/GDocSection.java Adding core/doc/GDocSectionID.java Adding core/doc/GDocSectionRef.java svn: Commit failed (details follow): svn: '/svn/!svn/bc/21791/DST/trunk/grammar-core/src/main/java/dts/grammar/core/policy/GPFragmentRef.java' path not found What does svn/!svn/bc mean?
