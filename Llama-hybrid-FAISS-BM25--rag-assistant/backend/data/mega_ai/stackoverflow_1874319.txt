You need to specify the technology involved in order to get a specific helpful answer. In general, when dealing with mixed Hebrew/English, there are two components. One is the paragraph orientation, and second is the characters orientation. In Hebrew, right-to-left mode would be the typical result for a paragraph, your text would be more like this: 1 (I can't imitate it using Hebrew characters due to the editor's limitation on SO, apparently). What you want is a left-to-right paragraph orientation, that happens to have a Hebrew item in the list. How you accomplish that (or indeed if it can be done) will depend on the technology you are using.
