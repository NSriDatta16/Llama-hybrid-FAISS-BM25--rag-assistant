Of course it is easy to keep one big list of public variables in the class. But even intuitively, you can tell that this is not the way to go. Define each variable right before you are going to use it. If a variable supports the function of a specific method, use it only in the scope of the method. Also think about security, a public class variable is susceptible to unwanted changes from "outside" code. Your main goal should be to keep all variables private, and any variable which is not, should have a very good reason to be so. About passing parameters all they way up the stack, this can get ugly very fast. A rule of thumb is to keep your method signatures clean and elegant. If you see many methods using the same data, decide either if it's important enough to be a class member, and if it's not, refactor your code to have it make more sense. It boils down to common sense. Think exactly where and why you are declaring each new variable, what it's function should be, and from there make a decision regarding which scope it should live in.
