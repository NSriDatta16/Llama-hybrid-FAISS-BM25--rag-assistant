Conjuage priors for linear combination

My knowledge of statistics in general and Bayesian statistics in particular is limited. With that in mind, I would sincerely appreciate if somebody could help me with the following problem that I have been trying to solve for quite some time. Hopefully I got the specification and wording correct. I am happy to clarify if something is unclear. I have a pair of parameters, $s_1$ and $s_2$ . Each $s_i$ is a vector $(s_{iA}, s_{iB})^T$ . New information about $s_1, s_2$ is obtained from sampling the following process: $ y = \begin{pmatrix} X_1 & X_2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} s_1 + e_1 \\ s_2 + e_2 \end{pmatrix} $ where $e_i$ is a error vector $(e_{iA}, e_{iB})^T$ drawn fron a zero mean Normal distribution with a 2x2 covariance matrix $\Sigma_i$ and $X_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ , $X_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ . For shorter notation let: $X = \begin{pmatrix} X_1 & X_2 \end{pmatrix}$ , $s = \begin{pmatrix} s_1 \\ s_2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \Sigma_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \Sigma_2 \end{pmatrix}$ . Note that $\Sigma$ is a block diagonal matrix since the error vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$ are indpendent. $y$ is then Normally distributed: $Y\sim N(X s, X \Sigma X^T)$ The parameters of the model are: $\{s_1, \Sigma_1, s_2, \Sigma_2\}$ and the likelihood function for $y$ is the density function of $Y$ : $f(y|s_1, \Sigma_1,s_2, \Sigma_2)$ , My objective is to find a conjugate prior for the likelihood $f(y|s_1, \Sigma_1,s_2, \Sigma_2)$ and a closed form expression for the posterior: $f(s_1, \Sigma_1,s_2, \Sigma_2|y)$ Does this likelihood have a conjugate prior? What is the conjugate prior? How do I update the hyperparameters of such a conjugate prior (given a single observation of $y$ )? (My best attempt has been using to 2 (Inverse) Wishart distributions for $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ , and conditioned on $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ , a single Normal distribution for $s$ . However, I have not been able to factor out $\Sigma$ in the trace expression (after after completing the square in the quadratic form for the hyperparameter for $s$ .) Update 2019-11-12: Since I have not found the solution to my question even though it should be in most textbooks, let me elaborate on a simpler special case. Consider the special case where $ \Sigma_i = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{iA}^2 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_{iB}^2 \end{pmatrix} $ This imlplies that the likelihood can be written: $f(y|s_1, \Sigma_1,s_2, \Sigma_2) = f(y_1|s_{1A}, s_{2B}, \sigma_{1A}^2,\sigma_{2B}^2) f(y_2|s_{1B}, s_{2A}, \sigma_{1B}^2,\sigma_{2A}^2) $ The priors for $(s_{1A}, s_{2B}, \sigma_{1A}^2,\sigma_{2B}^2)$ and $(s_{1B}, s_{2A}, \sigma_{1B}^2,\sigma_{2A}^2)$ can be updated separately but with the identical logic. Lets consider $(s_{1A}, s_{2B}, \sigma_{1A}^2,\sigma_{2B}^2)$ and note that: $Y_1 \sim N(s_{1A}-s_{2B}, \sigma_{1A}^2+\sigma_{2B}^2)$ Lets try with the following beliefs about our parameters: $ (s_{1A},\sigma_{1A}^2) \sim NIG(u_{1A},\lambda_{1A},\alpha_{1A},\beta_{1A}) $ and $ (s_{2B},\sigma_{2B}^2) \sim NIG(u_{2B},\lambda_{2B},\alpha_{2B},\beta_{2B}) $ The exponent in the numerator in Bayes formula for updating the priors would then be proportional to: $ \frac{(y_1-s_{1A}+s_{2B})^2}{2(\sigma_{1A}^2+\sigma_{2B}^2)} + \frac{2\beta_{1A} + \lambda_{1A}(s_{1A}-\mu_{1A})^2} {2\sigma_{1A}^2} + \frac{2\beta_{2B} + \lambda_{2B}(s_{2B}-\mu_{2B})^2} {2\sigma_{2B}^2} $ It seems to me that in order to proceed, it is neccessary to write $(\sigma_{1A}^2+\sigma_{2B}^2)^{-1}$ as a sum of $(\sigma_{1A}^2)^{-1}$ and $(\sigma_{2B}^2)^{-1}$ . Using Woodbury matrix identity this can be rewritten as: $ (2\sigma_{1A}^2)^{-1} + (2\sigma_{2B}^2)^{-1} - \frac{\sigma_{1A}^2 / \sigma_{2B}^2+\sigma_{2B}^2/\sigma_{1A}^2}{2(\sigma_{1A}^2+\sigma_{2B}^2)} $ And at this stage I do not know how to proceed since the thrid term contains $\sigma_{2A}^2$ and $\sigma_{2B}^2$ in a non-additive and non-trivial way. I would guess that the third term rules out any hope to have a Normal distribution as the prior for the $s$ parameter. Now I would be really happy if somebody could help me finding a conjugate prior, if such a exists, for $f(y_1|s_{1A}, s_{2B}, \sigma_{1A}^2,\sigma_{2B}^2)$ Please forgive me if I made any errors above or misunderstood something, this is all new to me.
