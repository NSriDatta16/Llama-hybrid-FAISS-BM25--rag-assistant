What I might suggest is using the Hamming distance. This metric takes each pair of corresponding elements in the data and reference group and records a $1$ if they are different and $0$ if they are the same and, once the $0$s and $1$s have been calculated for each pair, you sum up the numbers to get a measure of how different the two strings are. I would calculate the Hamming distance for each pair of data/reference strings that you have. You then have a set of data $X$ where $X_i=k_i$ and $k_i=$ the number of differences between data string $i$ and reference string $i$. With your data $X$, you can estimate the distribution to see how many differences there are on average (i.e. the mean of $X$) and how much variation there is in these differences (i.e. the standard deviation of $X$). There are perhaps better measures if your data set is skewed, but this might help you to get an idea of how much of a difference between the reference and data strings you should expect to see.
