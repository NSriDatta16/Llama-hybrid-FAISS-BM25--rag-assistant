Build document/sentence vectors as features. In my experience the model is less important (although a simple Naive Bayes typically performs quite well in document classification. SVMs are also well suited.) than providing it the right embeddings/vector representations. There are pre-compiled "dictionaries" for generating document vectors, such as Doc2Vec, but if you want to be sure to capture the "context" of the sentence as part of the embedding, you can generate your own document embeddings with an rnn or lstm.
