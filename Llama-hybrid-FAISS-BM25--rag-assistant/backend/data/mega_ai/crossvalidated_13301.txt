Assuming $u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ when y is highly skewed

does it make sense to assume $u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ when I know from a histogram that $y$ is highly skewed. Because from the assumption $u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ it follows that $y\sim N(x\beta,\sigma^2)$ and I'm absoluteley not sure if the assumption $u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ makes sense in a case where I know that the distribution of $y$ is not bell shaped. The alternative would be just to make OLS without any assumption about the error term, but in this case I can't analyze outliers and leverages (what I'd really like to do, because otherwise I can't present much more than a line which minimizes the sqaured sum of the residuals). [addendum: I can't make an outlier analysis because I can not define "outlier" in a context where I don't assume a normal distribution, because there is no outlying without a distribution] Besides your answers I'd really like to have a recommendation for a good book, where I can find some thoughts about what assumptions should we make when y is obviously not normal distributed. Thanks for your thoughts, they'll be helpful to me! Regards
