Qt - no such signal error

I'm trying to trigger a signal when a double click happens in one of the draggable widgets on the fridge magnets example . Here's the changes I made to the example source: DragLabel: class DragLabel : public QLabel { public: DragLabel(const QString &text, QWidget *parent); QString labelText() const; public slots: void testSlot(){qDebug() The only thing I changed in the implementation file is adding connect(this,SIGNAL(testSignal()),this,SLOT(testSlot())); to DragLabel's constructor. Trying to compile the project resulted in ' undefined reference to `DragLabel::testSignal() ' and ' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status ' errors. When I comment out the call to the signal, it compiles and runs, but gives off ' Object::connect: No such signal QLabel::testSignal() in draglabel.cpp ' warning in the application output. Apparently testSignal() isn't being recognized as a signal. I've tried to add the Q_OBJECT macro to DragLabel but it results in 4 ' undefined reference to `vtable for DragLabel' ' warnings and a ' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status ' error. What am I missing?
