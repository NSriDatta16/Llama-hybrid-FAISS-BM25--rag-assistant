In fact, Unit Testing is the only use that I've been able to bring myself to use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute for. With this you can implement a large portion of your 'private' methods as internal instead to expose them to the unit testing framework for more invasive testing of class-internal invariants. I've had great success with this technique. If nothing else it helps you approach that mythical 100% code coverage goal by letting you invoke private methods in situations that are otherwise inaccessible.
