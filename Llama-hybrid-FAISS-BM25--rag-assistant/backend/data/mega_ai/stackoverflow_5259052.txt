CKEditor custom image browser

I'm using CKEditor and I've successfully implemented the usual custom image browser which points to my php script. However, this opens in an ugly pop-up window. I would like to open it via ajax into a div somewhere on my page so it slides out and matches the rest feel of my cms. I'm seeing two ways to do this; 1) A custom plugin button for CKEditor that somehow opens my dialog box and passes back in the same ways as the pop-up does 2) Open my dialog through other means and then pass image details to CKEditor, either by clicking on an image or perhaps dragging it in the editor! If anyone has done this please let me know.
