Just another thought, if $db->insert_id returns an object, PHP variables assigned by reference. Therefore, you've essentially assigned another way to access $auftrag_id, but you haven't taken its value: $auftrag_id $preauftrag_id \ / ------memory------ (sorry for the terrible graphics) Therefore, decrementing $preauftrag_id would actually be decrementing the same reference as $auftrag_id, which may not be allowed because its a STATIC variable of the DB class?
