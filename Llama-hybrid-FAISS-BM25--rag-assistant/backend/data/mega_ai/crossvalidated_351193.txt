How are these odds created?

I've always been a bit baffled by how Vegas creates sports odds. Not so much the process of how did the oddsmakers decide that Option A has odds of X/Y (that obviously is fairly subjective and not something anyone here can answer) but the statistical methodology. Let me give an example. Here are some current odds for the 2018 Heisman trophy winner in college football: Player Odds Bryce Love 7/1 Jonathan Taylor 8/1 Khalil Tate 9/1 Tua Tagovailoa 10/1 J.K. Dobbins 12/1 Jake Fromm 12/1 Jarrett Stidham 12/1 Will Grier 12/1 Justin Herbert 15/1 Kelly Bryant 15/1 McKenzie Milton 18/1 Trace McSorley 18/1 Cam Akers 22/1 Jake Browning 22/1 Rodney Anderson 25/1 Ryan Finley 25/1 Brandon Wimbush 35/1 D'Andre Swift 35/1 Nick Fitzgerald 35/1 Travis Etienne 35/1 David Sills 45/1 Ed Oliver 55/1 Nick Bosa 75/1 So I guess what confuses me is the distribution of odds. Altogether, those add up to 557/1. I don't get that. Shouldn't odds add up to 100? What does this all mean percentage wise? So it's saying Bryce Love has X% to win. What's the percentage?
