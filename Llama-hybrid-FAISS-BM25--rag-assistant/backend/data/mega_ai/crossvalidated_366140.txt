Evaluate Bayesian SEM goodness of fit blavaan

I'm currently trying to identify how to evaluate model fit with Bayesian SEM. I've been reading that the posterior predictive p-value can be used, with a p-value of approximately 0.5 indicating good model fit (Song and Lee 2012). This source also suggests residual analysis can be used for BSEMs. I had two questions regarding this: 1.) Are there any additional fit indices or methods used to evaluate BSEMs? 2.) Does anyone know how to perform residual analysis with the blavaan package in R? Source: Song, X. and S. Lee. 2012. Basic and Advanced Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling. ISBN 978-0-470-66952-5.
