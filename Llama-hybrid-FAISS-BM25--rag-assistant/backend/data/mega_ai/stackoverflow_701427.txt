I would normally have two problems with putting a problem aside for a week: a) my boss probably wouldn't go for it because the business will usually need a solution sooner as opposed to later, and b) I have the attention span of a gold fish, so if I drop a problem for that long, I will have to take time to walk through the problem because I've filled my brain with dozens of other problems in the meantime. That's not entirely bad, because sometimes I do find a better, more elegant solution when I'm forced to refresh myself on the code and the business constraints that define the problem, but sometimes I just spend half a day running myself into the same dead-ends. All that being said, the idea of putting a problem aside is a good one, but it's the time frame that's important. I've often realized a solution while eating breakfast the morning following an end of the day spaghetti-code brain lock up fiasco. Trying to articulate the problem to colleagues often helps, just because the effort will expose gaps in your understanding of the problem. Usually the other person won't find a better solution unless they're actually working with you on the problem from the beginning, just because they won't understand all the constraints that you've probably spent days mapping out in your head. To answer the original question, my preferred method after taking a break and running it by some colleagues, is to implement the adequate solution and just get something working. One reason is that if the client decides that wasn't what they wanted, because they never really know what they want in the first place, you won't have spent too much time on something that'll be thrown out anyway. Another reason is that the adequate solution might just be that: adequate. You can move on. The best reason is that an implementation gets you into the hard questions quickly, and from there you might start to see a better solution. It's like building models as an architect. You can do lots of drawings, and even spend a lot of time on nice renderings, but it's really more effective to quickly get a glue gun and starting throwing cardboard models together. Once you can see it in 3D you can start to see where things don't line up properly, and you haven't wasted your time on nice renderings that will gloss over the shortcomings.
