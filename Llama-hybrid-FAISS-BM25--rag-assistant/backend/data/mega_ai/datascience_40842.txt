How to obtain and load a good initial data set for object localization?

I'm looking for a good data set for training a CNN based network to do object localization (i.e. a data set with class labels and bounding box data). What is a good initial data set to use? How can I obtain and load all the data (images, labels, bounding boxes)? I'm using python, so a python-friendly data source is ideal.
