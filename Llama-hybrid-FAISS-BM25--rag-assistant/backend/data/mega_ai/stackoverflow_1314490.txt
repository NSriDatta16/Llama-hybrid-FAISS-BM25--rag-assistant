Spring.NET has a nice expression evaluator that I continue to use. I don't have much to compare it against though. A summary (from their docs): The Spring.Expressions namespace provides a powerful expression language for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. The language supports setting and getting of property values, property assignment, method invocation, accessing the context of arrays, collections and indexers, logical and arithmetic operators, named variables, and retrieval of objects by name from Spring's IoC container. It also supports list projection and selection, as well as common list aggregators.
