Behind the scenes of most machine learning algorithms there is a confidence score associated to the models prediction. For sklearn you can retrieve them using model_name.predict_prob instead of model_name.predict. By default most models predict uses a .5 confidence score, i.e. anything above a .5 confidence score is predicted to be in the positive class. All you have to do is alter that threshold and you can tradeoff performance between the two classes. You can also try various methods for making the model "see" a more balanced dataset - upsampling, downsampling, SMOTE, and class sensitive weighting.
