It is fine if the feature in itself is a good predictor, since you're using XGBoost and it will do feature selection while modelling. But if the difference in predictive power between the 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 is not really strong, i'm not sure it will be very useful since most of your inputs will have 0, and even if you have an input with a different value it it won't change much.
