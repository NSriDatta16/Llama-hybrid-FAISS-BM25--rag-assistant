Benavoli et al (2018) argue for a Bayesian approach to model comparisons, based on performance on cross-validation folds. While the article emphasizes the advantages of Bayesian estimation of null-hypothesis significance testing (refering to the Kruschke (2013) paper Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test ), classical approaches that lead to p-values are discussed that could be implemented to placate a reviewer who wants a p-value. Again, such approaches are based on performance in cross-validation folds. REFERENCES Benavoli, Alessio, et al.
