I would suggest identifying an ARIMA model for each mice separately and then review them for similarities and generalization. For example if the first mice has an AR(1) and the second one has an AR(2), the most general (largest) model would be an AR(2). Estimate this model globally i.e. for the combined time series. Compare the error sum of squares for the combined set with the sum of the two individual error sum of squares to generate an F value to test the hypothesis of constant parameters across groups. I you wish you can post your data and I will illustrate this test precisely. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Since the data set is auto-correlated normality does not apply. If the observations are independent over time then one might apply some of the well-known non-time series methods. IN terms of your request about an easy to read book about time series, I suggest the Wei text by Addison-Wesley. Social scientists will find the non-mathematical approach of Mcleary and Hay (1980) to be more intuitive but lacking rigor.
