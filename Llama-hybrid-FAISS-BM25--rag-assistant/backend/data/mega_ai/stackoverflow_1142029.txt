Sounds like a feature to me, at least if the stack traces really are identical. Why would you want to make your logs bigger (and thus harder to search) without getting any more information? Will check for configurability of this feature... EDIT: I've had a look through the log4j code and there's no trace of it. This would strongly suggest that Robert's answer is correct. Nice VM feature IMO :)
