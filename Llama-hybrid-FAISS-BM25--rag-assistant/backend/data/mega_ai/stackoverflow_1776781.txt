UIView getting disabled

I have a UIView that's starting about 600 pt's off the screen, but when it comes on to the actual frame, it seems to be disabled. I've tried using a UIScrollView , but also can't because I need to access the touchesBegan and touchesMoved methods form my UIView , so how would I enable interaction after it comes back on to the screen. And yes I have tried setting userInteractionEnabled to YES
