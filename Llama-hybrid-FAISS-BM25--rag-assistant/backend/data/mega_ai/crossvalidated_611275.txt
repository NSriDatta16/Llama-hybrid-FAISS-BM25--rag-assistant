Title: How to fit a Frequentist Equivalent of Bayesian mixed-effects model with nlme or lme4 and obtain category-specific variances and intercepts?

I am interested in fitting a Bayesian mixed-effects model to my data using the brms package. My data includes three grouping variables (Category, BioRep, and TechRep), and I want to estimate category-specific variances and intercepts. I have already generated simulated data and fit a model with the following code: library(brms) library(tidyverse) # set up parameters n_categories This works great but I can't figure out how to generate the frequentist equivalent (if such exists??) for comparison. My best attempt: # fit mixed-effects model with category-specific variances # fit mixed-effects model with category-specific variances mixedmodel Is telling me that he grouping formula is wrong. (I also think the start parameter here could be wrong). Help?
