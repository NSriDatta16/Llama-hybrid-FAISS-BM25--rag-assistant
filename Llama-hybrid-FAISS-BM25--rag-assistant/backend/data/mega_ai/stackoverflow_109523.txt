What would you not test? Anything that could not possibly break. When it comes to code coverage you want to aim for 100% of the code you actually write - that is you need not test third-party library code, or operating system code since that code will have been delivered to you tested. Unless its not. In which case you might want to test it. Or if there are known bugs in which case you might want to test for the presence of the bugs, so that you get a notification of when they are fixed.
