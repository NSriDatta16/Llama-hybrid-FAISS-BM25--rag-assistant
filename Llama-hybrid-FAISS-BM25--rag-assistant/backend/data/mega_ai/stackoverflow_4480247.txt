Can't get Extended SNMP output in Perl

I have written a Perl script to put back some SNMP values, which works fine. I have now written a script on the remote server and used the extend function in SNMP to put the value from the script into SNMP. If I run: snmpget -v2c -c public 10.0.0.10 'NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Line."cc_power"' I get the result: NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Line."cc_power" = STRING: 544 But when I try to use my script to get the information back it doesn't get it. Here is the script: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use SNMP; use RRDs; my $rrd_db = "/storage/db/rrd/cc_power.rrd"; my $sess; my $val; my $error; $sess = new SNMP::Session(DestHost => "10.0.0.10", Community => "public", Version => 2); my $power = $sess->get('NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Line.\"cc_power\"'); $error=RRDs::error; die "ERROR while updating RRD: $error\n" if $error; my $date=time; print "Data Script has been run - Output: ${date}:${power}\n"; but nothing is returned, and I have no idea why... no errors or anything, have I missed something stupid? Hope someone can help as this is driving me nuts :)
