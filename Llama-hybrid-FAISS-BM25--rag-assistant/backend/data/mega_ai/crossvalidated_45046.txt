Daylight saving time in time series modelling (e.g. load data)

I would like to model intraday electricity load data. I have quarter-hourly data for each day of the year. In many countries daylight saving time is practive. This has the consequence that once a year a day is 1 hour longer (it has 25 hours) and once a year a day is shorter (only 23 hours). I don't think that changing the time (e.g. to UTC) is a solution here because people go to work at 8:00 a.m. in their "local" time not in UTC. What I have found in the literature is e.g. here MODELING AND FORECASTING SHORT-TERMELECTRICITY LOAD USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS . There the extra hour is discarded and the missing hours is filled with average values. What is the most used procedure here? How do you cope with this probem?
