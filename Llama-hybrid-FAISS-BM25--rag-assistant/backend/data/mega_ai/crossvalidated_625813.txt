I hesitate to say "always" in response to any statistics question. Why might you want to use averages instead? I think all the following would have to apply: You aren't interested in change over time. You aren't interested in variance within subjects Your variables are suitable for taking means. This isn't always the case. and maybe some other conditions that I am not thinking of. Given all that, the analysis on the averages will be simpler to specify and probably easier to interpret, and will be familiar to a wider audience.
