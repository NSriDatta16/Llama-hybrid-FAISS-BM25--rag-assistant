In order for this to be transparent to applications (i.e., would not need to have application implement a different API for saving/loading files to access these backup features), you'd want to do this in the Operating System, at its file system layer. ZFS filesystem could be wrapped to provide the user interface capabilities you describe, but it is doubtful this filesystem would ever reach Windows (directly, at least). A simpler way to think of this is to look at network storage systems which can provide you the features you need. NetApp Snapshot offers capabilities that could be tapped to do this at the network storage level. It implements CIFS, so is definitely available on windows. Open your wallet. If you think this is an extremely important feature, you may consider other OSes than Windows; filesystems and filesystem support in OSes other than Windows are more diverse.
