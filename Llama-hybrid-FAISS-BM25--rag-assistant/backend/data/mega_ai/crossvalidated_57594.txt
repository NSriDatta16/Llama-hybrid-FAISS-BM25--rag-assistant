How to calculate most congested roads from vehicle counts

I'm studying traffic flows, and I'd like to know what are the busiest/most congested roads. From this website http://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-counts/about.php , it looks like vehicle counts are typically measured in AADF which is the Annual Average Daily Flow - the average number of vehicles that will travel between two checkpoints on an average day. However, these AADFs are measured on road sections of varying lengths. The website seems to think that "Traffic" ie AADF x road length (measured in vehicle miles) is a useful measurement, but what is this number actually useful for? If this is the case, a very sparse but long road would have the same value as a busy short road. It doesn't seem to make any sense using this definition of "traffic". Surely, to figure out how congested a road is, you need to divide the AADF by the road length. Can anybody confirm this? Or make it clear how the AADF is useful? Thank you.
