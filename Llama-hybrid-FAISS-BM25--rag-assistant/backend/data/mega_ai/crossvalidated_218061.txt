What are supposedly the most important macro data to include in a regression analysis in retail?

I work in retail and we want to complie a regression analysis to see how different factors impact our business and retail in general. So far, I have started to educate myself on R (by suggestion from a fellow member here). We currently analyze promotions, cycles and marketing Campaigns within our own organization and their outcomes. But I want to create a regression to see how well things correlate and what is the coeffecient of determination. Basically, I want to find out how well I can trust certain conclusions. Macro factors so far: -Weather -Paydays -Strikes I'm considering factors such as inflation and real estate (rents). We have business all over the World so there would eventually have to be an analysis per country.
