Logistic regression, computation of the linear model used in given paper, how to apply to a different data set

I'm referring to this paper : Model building strategy for logistic regression: purposeful selection http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/atm.2016.02.15 Data is created at the start and I'm unsure about the $z$ term that's used. Here's the code from the start: # variables age There the probabilities are computed based on the $z$ that's given before. How have those coefficient values been solved for though? If $$ z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age} + \beta_2 \text{hb} + \beta_3 \text{lac} $$ Then my question is why $$ \begin{align} \beta_0 &= -10 \\ \beta_1 &= 0.1 \\ \beta_2 &= 0.02 \\ \beta_3 &= 1 \end{align} $$ I'm unsure how I would apply this process to my own data, given that $z$ doesn't seem to have an explanation within the paper.
