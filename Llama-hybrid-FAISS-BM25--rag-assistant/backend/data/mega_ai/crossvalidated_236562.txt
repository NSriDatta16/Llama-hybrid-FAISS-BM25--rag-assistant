A first approach could be to discretize the time and space variables and produce (sparse) boolean features : "Between time $[t_i,t_i+\delta]$, was the position in the square $[x_j,x_j+\epsilon],[y_k,y_k+\epsilon]$" ? For small enough $\delta,\epsilon$, the property "$\gamma_i = \gamma_j$ if and only if $T_i=T_j$ and $\gamma_i(t)=\gamma_j(t)$ $\forall t \in [0,T_i]$" will coincide will all the boolean values being equal. But there must be much more valuable information in some data science competitions related to your problem : axa-driver-telematics-analysis predict-taxi-service-trajectory-i
