You are not going to find a third party product that does this. The amount of effort required to build an app that 100% supports the Word formats is beyond consideration. Not just every feature, but every bug as well would have to be duplicated. Considering the potential legal pitfalls of doing such, no one in their right mind would bother trying. The legal aspects, incidentally, is one of the primary reasons for the new formats. Which means you have to go external. There are two really good options here. One would be to hook into Office Live to give them the ability to edit Microsoft Documents online. Another possibility is to just leverage Sharepoint in your application. It has built in methods for document workflow and integrates nicely with Office. A third possibility would be to write your own word add-in which would take care of saving / loading the documents from your system. I'd go with the first two above before going this route.
