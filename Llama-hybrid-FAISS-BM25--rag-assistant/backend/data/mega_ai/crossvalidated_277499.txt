Simple linear regression using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)

To understand how ABC works, I like to use it in a simple linear regression model. I am using EasyABC package in R. My problem is that the results I get are not good. In particular, the posterior distributions are extremely wide. I think this is partly because I am using prior distributions with a very large variance. In fact, if I use different priors (e.g., Unif(0,20) --- something much tighter), results are better. But I am using those priors to mean something commonly used as non-informative priors in Bayesian method. My question is that is there anything wrong in the way ABC is used in this example (the code is given below)? Why is the posterior so bad? library(EasyABC) ## data generation n
