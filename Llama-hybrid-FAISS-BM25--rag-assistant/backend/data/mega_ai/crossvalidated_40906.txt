Nested cross-validation for classification in MATLAB

I am trying to tackle a classification problem with Support Vector Machine in Matlab using SVM. Using sample codes in Bioinformatics Toolbox documentation (SVM Classification with Cross Validation) , I am able to train a SVM and find its optimal parameters. But from Inner loop overfitting in nested cross-validation and How does one appropriately apply cross-validation in the context of selecting learning parameters for support vector machines? , I will require another outer (leave-one-out) cross-validation to ensure that the final model isn't biased. My question is, so how do I implement this nested cross-validation? I understand that the inner cross-validation is to choose the optimal parameters, but what is the purpose of the outer cross-validation and how should I do it in code?
