My guess is the the kernel is having difficulty allocating the memory that it needs to keep up with this memory mapping. I don't know how swapped out pages are kept up with in the Linux kernel (and I assume that most of the file would be in the swapped out state most of the time), but it may end up needing an entry for each page of memory that the file takes up in a table. Since this file might be mmapped by more than one process the kernel has to keep up with the mapping from the process's point of view, which would map to another point of view, which would map to secondary storage (and include fields for device and location). This would fit into your addressable space, but might not fit (at least contiguously) within physical memory. If anyone knows more about how Linux does this I'd be interested to hear about it.
