This is not a thorough answer, but it should be useful. You're doing RTT, Render to Texture. You're going to set up a new renderbuffer, set that as your render target, and then use glGetPixels to get its value. When you make the renderbuffer with: void glRenderbufferStorage(GLenum target, GLenum internalformat, GLsizei width, GLsizei height); You can set its size, which doesn't have to match your screen's. Hopefully this helps!
