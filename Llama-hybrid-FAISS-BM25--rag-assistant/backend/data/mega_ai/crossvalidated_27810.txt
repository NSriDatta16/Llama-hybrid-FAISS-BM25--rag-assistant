I assume you can't just ask them if they prefer a laptop or a tablet; or you want to check what they think they prefer with what you think they should prefer... There are a number of ways to do this. This is in fact a version of the very common real life problem of evaluating job applicants, or tenders for contracting work - you need to decide on criteria, weight them, and rate the candidates against the criteria. You have emphasised the problem of weighting the criteria, but the rating of candidates (laptop and tablet) against the criteria is crucial, as was the choice of the six criteria in the first place. These are largely judgement rather than statistical questions. There are two steps necessary: combine the information in the two questions to give you weightings for the criteria; and the compare the importance given to the six qualities to the performance of the two products against those six qualities. Your first problem is that you have two questions that are apparently (see my comment) getting at basically the same underlying factor and that respondents will inevitably not be completely consistent in their answers (although hopefully not as much as in your example, where storage capacity is the lowest priority but "very important"!) One approach to combining these two is to convert the ranking to a rating on the same scale as the second question and then take an average. You could do this for example by $rate_{new}=\frac{rate+rank*\frac{4}{5}+0.2}{2}$. This is a bit crude, but the fact is there is no really satisfactory way of combining the two without drawbacks of some sort. Converting rankings to ratings and vice versa is a problem however you do it, and some kind of rule of thumb is needed to deal with ties in the ratings (if you want to turn them into rankings) or unknown range behind the rankings (if you want to turn them into ratings ie the user has been forced to rank from one to 6, but really might think they are all really important - or unimportant...). The next crudity is you will need to score the products against the six qualities. Often subjects would have been asked to do this, but in this case it looks like you have to do it yourself. You will produce a matrix like: Tablet Laptop Storage capacity 4 2 Portability 1 2 Touch interface 1 4 Keyboard 5 1 Long battery life 3 2 Entertainment on the go 1 3 I've kept to the convention you have of low scores being good. Then you just multiply and sum your importance ratings by these quality scores and you get a score for tablet and one for laptop. The one with the lowest score is the preference - you don't need a threshold, just to compare the two scores. Note that how you score the two products against the six qualities will be crucial in this - probably more important than how you generated the weightings. So you'd want to try a range of different scores and see which ones give plausible results. There's no statistical way of getting the "right" scores, with the information you've got. If you knew people's actual laptop/table preferences, you could perhaps generate a set of scores that produced those preferences, but then the whole exercise would be a different one. See below for some R code and output that implements this and suggests that your somewhat confused subject might actually want a laptop: > r1 r2 newrate products cbind(products, newrate) Tablet Laptop newrate [1,] 4 2 3.0 [2,] 1 2 3.6 [3,] 1 4 1.0 [4,] 5 1 2.2 [5,] 3 2 1.9 [6,] 1 3 3.3 > newrate%*%products Tablet Laptop [1,] 36.6 33.1
