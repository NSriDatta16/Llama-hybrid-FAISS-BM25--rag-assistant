As Siydub has said TeamCity allows for 3 build agents but these do not have to be on seperate machines. You could in the interim setup 1 or 2 aditional agents on the same machine. Multiple TeamCity Build Agents on one Server Also if someone is going to trigger a build manually, they can bump their build to the top of the queue (It will build after the currently running build). You do this by clicking the ellipsis (...) next to the run button of the build you want to run. At the bottom of the dialog is an option to put the build at the top of the queue. Additional you can change the order or the queue builds on the build queue tab, this is done via drag and drop.
