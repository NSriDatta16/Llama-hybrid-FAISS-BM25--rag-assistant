From my experiences of looking a while back the EQATEC profiler was the only "minimum effort" profiling option kicking around. It becomes more suitable for proper performance testing if you use the "clear snapshot" command after the code you're interested in has been JITed and if you use the mechanism of producing files you can parse them yourself to gain a: Min, Max, Average output. Obviously that then becomes more effort than "minimum effort" though! :D
