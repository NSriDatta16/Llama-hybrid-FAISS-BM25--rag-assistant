The only safe solution (in case no further information is known/guaranteed) is the way you described: Create a List from the Iterator and pick a random element. If the size of the underlying collection is always the same you can reduce the effort by a half in an average - just use the element you got after Iterator.next() after a random number of iterations. BTW : Are you really using a Collection which implements java.util.Iterator ?
