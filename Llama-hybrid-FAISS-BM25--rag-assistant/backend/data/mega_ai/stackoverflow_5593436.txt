Iphone app distribution only for selected customers

We want to build a iphone app for selected customers and not make the app public for everybody. The problem is that the "IOS Developer Program" only allows 100 users. The problem with the "iOS Developer Enterprise Program" is that only users in the own organisation are allowed. Questions: - How to get more than 100 selected users. - How to distribute to only selected customers and not make the app public Thanks in advance!
