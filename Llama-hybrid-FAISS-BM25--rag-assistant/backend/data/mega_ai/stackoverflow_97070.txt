The use constant pragma creates a subroutine prototyped to take no arguments. While it looks like a C-style constant, it's really a subroutine that returns a constant value. The => (fat comma) automatically quotes left operand if its a bareword, as does the $hash{key} notation. If your use of the constant name looks like a bareword, the quoting mechanisms will kick in and you'll get its name as the key instead of its value. To prevent this, change the usage so that it's not a bareword. For example: use constant X => 1; %hash = (X() => 1); %hash = (+X => 1); $hash{X()} = 1; $hash{+X} = 1; In initializers, you could also use the plain comma instead: %hash = (X, 1);
