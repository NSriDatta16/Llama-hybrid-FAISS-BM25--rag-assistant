Functional languages with concurrent garbage collectors?

Microsoft's new F# programming language provides the powerful combination of functional programming (first-class lexical closures and tail calls) with an efficient concurrent garbage collector that makes it easy to leverage multicores. OCaml, Haskell, Erlang and all free Lisp and Scheme implementations that I know of do not have concurrent GCs. Scala and Clojure have a concurrent GC but no tail calls. So there appear to be no open source programming languages that combine these features. Is that correct?
