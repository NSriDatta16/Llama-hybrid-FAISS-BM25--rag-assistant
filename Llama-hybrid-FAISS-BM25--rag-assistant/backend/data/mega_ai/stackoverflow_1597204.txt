It's a bad idea because they're not using existing tools to solve a problem, they're reinventing the wheel with a proprietary technology that does what WWF does, only less cleanly. It smells because it's code at the wrong level of generality. I can offer little advice on how to convince them of this, other than to point out that there are more elegant solutions available. Management may be swayed by the fact that you can hire perfectly good WWF coders off the rack, while nobody can be expected to know how to work with this smelly solution on day one. Good luck.
