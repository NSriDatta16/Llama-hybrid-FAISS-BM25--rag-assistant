Backing up your code to the cloud

I want to backup my code regularly to the cloud. What's the cheapest and easiest way to do this for a single developer? I was thinking of running my code completely from a DropBox share (continuous synchronization with their free storage plan), which seem to meet the requirement of cheap and easy -- but, any problems with this idea?
