multi-class classification with word2vec

My problem: The input data is a corpus of short documents (a few sentences each). In each document some expressions need to be classified to categories. A document must contain some categories (each expression has a single label), and the rest are optional. The task: given such an expression and its surrounding words, classify its category. As a solution I thought to convert my vocabulary words to vectors using word2vec, and then apply some multi-class classifier. Is there any classifier which is a particularly good fit to word2vec's output? I thought using svm, is there a recommended kernel?
