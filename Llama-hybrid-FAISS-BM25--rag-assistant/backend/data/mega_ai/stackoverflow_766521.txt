Not exactly what you are looking for, but: Something similar be done with code coverage tools (like Cobertura ). They do not do static inspection of the source code, but instrument the bytecode to gather metrics at runtime. Of course, you need to drive the application in a way that exercises all usage pattern, and might miss the rarer code paths. On the static analysis front, maybe these tools can help you (the Apache project uses them to check for API compatibility for new releases, seems like that task is somewhat related to what you are trying to do): Clirr is a tool that checks Java libraries for binary and source compatibility with older releases. Basically you give it two sets of jar files and Clirr dumps out a list of changes in the public api. JDiff is a Javadoc doclet which generates an HTML report of all the packages, classes, constructors, methods, and fields which have been removed, added or changed in any way, including their documentation, when two APIs are compared.
