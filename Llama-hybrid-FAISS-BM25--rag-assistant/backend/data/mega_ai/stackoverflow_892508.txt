I don't know .Net, so this is general object-oriented programming advice. However, you look like you're asking a general OO design question. It looks like you're trying to do double dispatch ; that is, choose the actual code that gets executed based on the runtime type of two different things. The traditional clean-OO way to accomplish double dispatch is with the visitor pattern . Don't get fooled by the name or by examples describing the pattern to walk some sort of containing strucutre; it's also very useful even if you only have one object at a time! Basically, what you would do is define some interface - CommonButtonHandler - and then have an implementation for both spreadsheets and documents. When the common "twiddle" button is clicked, you do: // Inside CommonTwiddleButton.onClick() currentCommonButtonHandler.twiddleButtonClicked() There are some nice examples online of using the visitor pattern for double dispatch; just be sure to search for both terms, or you'll end up with either a bunch of visitor pattern examples that assume you need to walk some sort of heterogeneous collection or a bunch of lisp weenies bragging about how their object system just does multiple dispatch by default.
