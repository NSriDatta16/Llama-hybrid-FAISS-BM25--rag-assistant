See section 3.1 of [ Morik, et al, 1999 ], which reads: "...Since we will be dealing with very unbalanced numbers of positive and negative examples, we introduce cost factors C_+ and C_- to be able to adjust the cost of false positives vs. false negatives...". The quadratic optimization problem follows that quote. When C_+ > C_-, precision is increased. Now, if you want just an out-of-the-box solution, the ratio of C_+ to C_- can be passed as the -j parameter to SVMLight .
