It is somewhat subjective - both are OK. I prefer UTC. You likely need to convert the time to client local anyway (and you should rely on information from the client to do so, since the user may login from different timezones). When storing in UTC, you have to worry less about the details of how storage is taking place, since all times are represented in the same timezone and it is much easier to compare (and thus sort).
