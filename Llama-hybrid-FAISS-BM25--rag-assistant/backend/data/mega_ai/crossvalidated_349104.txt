How to compare multiple ratios to test for significant differences

Please forgive my ignorance. I have return rates of a molecule (quantity returned per hour, determined from 4 time points) from compound x from 3 separate microcosms (n=3) and return rates of compound y from an additional 3 separate microcosms (n=3). I calculate the average of the slopes for each compound tested and then divide them to get a ratio. I did this same procedure with 4 different sets of microcosms and have four different ratios; I'll call them a,b,c,d. I would like to determine which sets are different from each other for all possible comparisons. For example, is a significantly different from b,c,d and/or is c only different from d.
