I want completion and compilation erros on eclipse for jsp fragments in eclipse. How can i have completion on test2.jnc for this files : And the interpreted included file that was on error in eclipse (ma_variable cannot be resolved) : ma_variable = "Hello World!"; If i launch that file in tomcat, all goes fine, but eclipse don't find ma_variable in the test2.jnc scope... any idea? I "googled" but i did'nt find anything relevent...
