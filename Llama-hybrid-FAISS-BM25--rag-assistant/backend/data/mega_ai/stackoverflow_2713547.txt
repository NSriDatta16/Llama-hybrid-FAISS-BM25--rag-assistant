Can't we use touchesBegan,touchesMoved,touchesEnded for a scrollview?

Actually I'm having a scroll-view. In that I'm using 30-buttons. what's my requirement is I need to rearrange the buttons. Like, when i touched any button it should be selected with our touch. and where ever we move in the scroll-view it should move along with our touch. after i ended the touch, the buttons should be swapped. Can any one help me regarding this.........
