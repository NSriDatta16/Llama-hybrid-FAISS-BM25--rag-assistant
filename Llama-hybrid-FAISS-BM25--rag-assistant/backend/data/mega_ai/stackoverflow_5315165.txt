MS CRM 2011: Auditing feature and Updates via IOrganizationService webservice

we are planning to use the auditing feature of CRM 2011 to track who has changed which infield for a couple of entities. But what happens if you update an entity via the IOrganizationService ? For example let's say you have an addres entity in your system with City="London" and Street="Baker Street" . Now in your Code you create an entity object (late bound) for this address. You set its GUID, City="London" but Street="Downing Street" ! Now you call IOrganizationService.Update for this entity. Will the auditing feature be aware of that the Street has changed but the City has not? Or will he tell me that the the City was changed when in fact it wasn't?
