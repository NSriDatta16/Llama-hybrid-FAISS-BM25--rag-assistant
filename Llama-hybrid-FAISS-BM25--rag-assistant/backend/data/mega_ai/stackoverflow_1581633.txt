I think what you are looking for is the SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN setting. You would set it like this: SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = 'foo.com' See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/sessions/#session-cookie-domain for more information on that. This does assume that both applications are using the same session storage backend.
