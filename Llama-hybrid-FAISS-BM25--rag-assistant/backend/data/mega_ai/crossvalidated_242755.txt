From my experience, often the mass calculation of different features with subsequent inspection of their significance can lead to interesting insights. You could use the python package tsfresh to automatically extract a huge of number of features and filter them for their importance. You described that you calculated both frequency domain, skewness and kurtosis features. Those are also contained in tsfresh. But there is a huge number of other time series characteristics that can be also used as potential features for audio classification. There are simple features such as the mean, time series related features such as the coefficients of an AR model or highly sophisticated features such as the test statistic of the augmented dickey fuller hypothesis test. So regarding your question: You can find inspiration about other features in the documentation about the calculated features of tsfresh here . Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of tsfresh.
