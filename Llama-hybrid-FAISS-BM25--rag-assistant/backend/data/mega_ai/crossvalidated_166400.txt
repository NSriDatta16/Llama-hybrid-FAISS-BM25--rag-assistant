The link between Distance Covariance and kernel tests (based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion) is given in the paper: Sejdinovic, D., Sriperumbudur, B., Gretton, A., and Fukumizu, K., Equivalence of distance-based and RKHS-based statistics in hypothesis testing, Annals of Statistics, 41 (5), pp.2263-2702, 2013 It's shown that distance covariance is a special case of the kernel statistic, for a particular family of kernels. If you're intent on using mutual information, a test based on a binned estimate of the MI is: Gretton, A. and Gyorfi, L., Consistent Nonparametric Tests of Independence, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11 , pp.1391--1423, 2010. If you're interested in getting the best test power, you're better off using the kernel tests, rather than binning and mutual information. That said, given your variables are univariate, classical nonparametric independence tests like Hoeffding's are probably fine.
