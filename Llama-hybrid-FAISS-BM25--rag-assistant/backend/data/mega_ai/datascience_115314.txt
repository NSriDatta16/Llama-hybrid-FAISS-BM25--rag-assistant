How to make a chrome extension which uses python machine learning model?

Actually, I made a video category classifier machine learning model (Deep Learning). Now, I want to make a chrome extension using that model. So, how I have to do that. I know it's a very broad question but I thankful if you provide some knowledge or some links about that. I am confused because Chrome extension code would be in JavaScript language. But my model is in python. So, I integrate them. How to run python code using Javascript ? Any help would be appreciable..
