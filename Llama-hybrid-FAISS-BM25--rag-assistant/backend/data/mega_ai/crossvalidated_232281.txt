Why does varimax applied to PCA outcome fail to do anything at all?

I am trying to perform PCA with varimax rotation on a set of data with 2 variables, in order to orthogonalise them (not for dimension reduction). I used prcomp() to perform PCA and it gave me results like this: > print(variable.pca) Standard deviations: [1] 1.1104314 0.8420727 Rotation: PC1 PC2 LogFreq -0.6646101 -0.7471903 Simulation -0.7471903 0.6646101 > summary(variable.pca) Importance of components: PC1 PC2 Standard deviation 1.1104 0.8421 Proportion of Variance 0.6349 0.3651 Cumulative Proportion 0.6349 1.0000 Then I applied varimax() to the variable.pca$rotation. And here's the results: $loadings Loadings: PC1 PC2 LogFreq -0.665 -0.747 Simulation -0.747 0.665 PC1 PC2 SS loadings 1.0 1.0 Proportion Var 0.5 0.5 Cumulative Var 0.5 1.0 $rotmat [,1] [,2] [1,] 1.000000e+00 -7.142042e-16 [2,] 7.142042e-16 1.000000e+00 This result is completely uninterpretable to me. I thought that, after varimax rotation, one variable should load heavily on one factor and nearly 0 on the other factor, whereas the other variable should be the reverse. Was there something I did wrong? Or should I not use prcomp() to perform orthogonalisation? I'm pretty new to using PCA for orthogonalisation.
