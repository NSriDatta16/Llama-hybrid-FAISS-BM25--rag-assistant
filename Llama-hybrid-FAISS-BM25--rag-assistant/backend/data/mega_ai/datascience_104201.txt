I guess this is a special NLP problem where you basically deal with "translating" $x$ into $y$ . Thus, you could look at "sequence-to-sequence" learning (neural translation model), where you try to "translate" a keyword or a set of keywords into a drug: bradycardia -> NSAIDS Poisoning There are a number of useful sources form Keras/Tensorflow, such as: A ten-minute introduction to sequence-to-sequence learning in Keras Character-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence model TensorFlow Addons Networks : Sequence-to-Sequence NMT with Attention Mechanism Natural Language Processing (some STS examples here)
