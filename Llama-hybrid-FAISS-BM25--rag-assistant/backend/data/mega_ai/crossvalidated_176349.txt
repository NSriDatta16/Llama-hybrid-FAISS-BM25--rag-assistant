Is there a reason why you are not using the fourier() function in the forecast package? When you try to build a fourier term of a seasonal time series object your K must be smaller than period/2 . Otherwise you get an error: fourier(ts(test, frequency=7),4) #3 works, 4+ doesn't Error in ...fourier(x, K, 1:length(x)) : K must be not be greater than period/2 Quote from ?fourier() fourier(x,K) When x is a ts object, the value of K should be an integer and specifies the number of sine and cosine terms to return. Thus, the matrix returned has 2*K columns. I don't have a theoretical explanation + i don't have enough reputation to write a comment under your post (answer was the only option). Hope i could still help you somehow!
