Using the 'Open XML Productivity Tool' I analyzed the structure of a docx-document, and concluded that merging documents with their style, headers, footers, ... is not possible out of the box using Altchunk . You can download the tool seperatly from the open xml sdk . What I'm doing now, and what is working, is copying everything manually into to document, making sure that all style-references, header-references, footer-references, ... are preserved. This means that I give them a new unique id before I copy them into the document and changing all references from the old id to the new id. There is a lot of code to do this, but the tool mentioned above really helped. Adding a section break is also quite difficult. You should know that the SectionProperties -tag describes all the properties of the section and that there can be one SectionProperties -tag under the Body -tag, describing the properties of the last section. So adding a new sectionbreak, means copying the last SectionProperties -tag to the last paragraph of the section and adding a new SectionProperties -tag under the Body -tag. I also got al lot of information from the productivity tool.
