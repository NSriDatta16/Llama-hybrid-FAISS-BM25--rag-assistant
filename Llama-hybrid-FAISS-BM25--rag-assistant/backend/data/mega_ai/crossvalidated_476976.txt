Question about fixed effects, and state-by -time fixed effects

I have seen papers at the US level where they include county fixed effects, and state-by-year fixed effects, i.e.: $y_{c,t}$ = $\beta$$x_{c,t}$ + $\lambda_c$ + $\mu_{s,t}$ + $\eta_{c,t}$ where c indexes county, t time, and s states, opposed to a more typical county and just year fixed effect. $\lambda_c$ are county fixed effects, $\mu_{s,t}$ are state-year fixed effects, and $\eta_{c,t}$ is the error term. They referred to this as 'comparing counties within states'. How does this accomplish that goal? so is this estimator of $\beta$ than estimating $dy/dx$ within a state, and then averaging the state effects over each state?
