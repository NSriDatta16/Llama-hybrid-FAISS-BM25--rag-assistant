Android. Searching over the listView

I have activity with ListView. That listView contains imageView and two textViews (aka first and last names). I want to organize searching with this listView by one of textView (e.g. by last name). How can I implement that? I found that Quick Search Box can be used but I didn't understand how to work with it. Help, plz :)
