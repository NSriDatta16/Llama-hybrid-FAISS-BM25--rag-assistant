Recently a friend of mine was asked whether decision tree algorithm a linear or nonlinear algorithm in an interview Decision trees is a non-linear classifier like the neural networks, etc. It is generally used for classifying non-linearly separable data. Even when you consider the regression example, decision tree is non-linear. For example, a linear regression line would look somewhat like this: The red dots are the data points. And a decision tree regression plot would look something like this: So, clearly decision trees are non-linear
