According to the SQLite opcode page : Depending on compile-time options, you can put the SQLite virtual machine in a mode where it will trace its execution by writing messages to standard output. The non-standard SQL "PRAGMA" comments can be used to turn tracing on and off. To turn tracing on, enter: PRAGMA vdbe_trace=on; You can turn tracing back off by entering a similar statement but changing the value "on" to "off". Also, the output from an EXPLAIN ... query is just a (an ordered) set of records that you can decode if you're up to it. See: this SQLite page
