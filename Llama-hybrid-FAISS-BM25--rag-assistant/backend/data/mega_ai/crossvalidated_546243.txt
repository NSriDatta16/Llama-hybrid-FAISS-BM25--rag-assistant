Determine Statistical Significance Between Two Data Points

To preface, I have not done stats of any sort in about a decade, so I am a bit rusty. I have a question to help determine statistical significance between two populations. I am working with a dataset of qualifying insurance members for multiple measures. For example, for any members that qualify for a certain measure, they will be identified by either a 0, meaning they are considered a part of the population or the denominator, and a 1, meaning they qualify for the measure or the numerator. With each measure, you can determine a rate by dividing Count(1)/(Count(1)+Count(0)). In the dataset there is a column for Race/Ethnicity, and I was tasked to do analyze if there is any large discrepancies in our measures. After the analysis, we need to determine if the discrepancies we are seeing are actually statistically significant. So, for one of the measures, non-White members show a rate variance of about an average of -6%, and we want to determine if that is caused by something we lack on our side or is the non-White population too small. For a data example: Measure Ethnicity Numerator Denominator Rate Mean Rate A White 2800 6750 41.5% 37.3% A African American 880 2280 38.6% 37.3% A Hispanic 230 720 31.9% 37.3% Given these rates, we hope to determine if the population of non-White members is statistically smaller than that of the White population and thus a comparison between the two rates would not be beneficial. I used Excel's built-in Data Analysis tool to perform a t-test, using the denominator of each measure for each ethnicity as an array. So, all White denominator members with the corresponding African American denominator members - which is a total of 18 different measures. I know t-tests require 2+ data points, but I do not know if this approach is the correct one.
