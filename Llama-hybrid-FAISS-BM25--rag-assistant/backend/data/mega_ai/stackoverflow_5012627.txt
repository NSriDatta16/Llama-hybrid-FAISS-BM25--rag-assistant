I disagree that NLP is not the path you need to follow. However, if you don't want to go the NLP route, you could generate some good sounding sentences without using NLP, by training a custom language model using n-grams to build a fourth or fifth order model. You would then use statistical probability to generate your sentences. Once you have your model, you randomly pick a starting word (in the domain of known sentence starting words, or words that begin with a capital letter), and then use conditional probablitily to pick the next word. An easy example of this is in this article: Wordmills are coming... Of course, you would need ample training material in order to accomplish this, as just training on a simple paragraph would not work well for the way you want to rephrase a paragraph. Without using NLP techniques to detect nouns, verbs, etc. from your sample paragraph (which would require well trained models as well), and then rearranging them using an opposite sentence structure would be more effort than just using NLP in the first place. What you are trying to do is perform entity extraction, and also location awareness. Not only that, but relationships between entities and locations. A very tall order if you are not going to use any NLP.
