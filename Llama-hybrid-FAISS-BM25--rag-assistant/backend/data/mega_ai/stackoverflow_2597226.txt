bibtex and label/ref

I was wondering how I can add \label into bibtex so that when I cite in my document and I can also \ref to it by clicking it and jumping to the Bibliography at the end? for example: @inproceedings{Boser92atraining, abstract = {A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training patterns and the decision boundary is presented. }, author = {Boser, Bernhard E. and Guyon, Isabelle M. and Vapnik, Vladimir N.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th Annual ACM Workshop on Computational Learning Theory}, citeulike-article-id = {4669426}, citeulike-linkout-0 = {http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.3818}, keywords = {learning, svm}, pages = {144--152}, posted-at = {2010-04-07 21:30:39}, priority = {2}, title = {A Training Algorithm for Optimal Margin Classifiers}, url = {http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.3818}, year = {1992} } Thanks and regards
