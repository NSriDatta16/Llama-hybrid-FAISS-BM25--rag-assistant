The more I use a functional style, the better I like it. Consider this Python fragment from another question : >>> testlist [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6] >>> [i for i,x in enumerate(testlist) if x == 1] [0, 5, 7] This is admittedly a more or less mathematical statement, but there are lots of generators in Python. Once you get used to it, using a list comprehension in place of a loop is both easy to understand, and less likely to have a bug (you don't get "off by one" bugs.)
