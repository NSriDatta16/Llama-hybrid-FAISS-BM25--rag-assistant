How do I interpret improvement in AUC ROC from the business perspective?

Let's say I'm training a logistic regression model to predict the click-through-rate (CTR) on online display ads. The training dataset consists of positive examples (ads were clicked) and negative ones (ads were not clicked). The binary classifier has achieved 0.7 AUC ROC on test dataset. Now, instead of using logistic regression, I found that gradient boosting trees performs better, yielding 0.75 AUC ROC on test dataset. How does the improvement in AUC ROC translate to potential improvement in CTR?
