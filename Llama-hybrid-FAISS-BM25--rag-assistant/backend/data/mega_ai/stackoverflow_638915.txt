Can't you make the trunk read-only for those specific people, using Subversion's access control mechanisms? In your svnaccess file: [/MyProject/trunk] me = rw albert = r bernard = r chris = rw would allow you and Chris to make changes (including merges) to the trunk of "MyProject", while only giving read permissions to Albert and Bernard.
