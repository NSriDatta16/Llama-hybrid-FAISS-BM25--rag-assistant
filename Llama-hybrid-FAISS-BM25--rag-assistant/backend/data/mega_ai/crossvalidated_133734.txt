I don't see the value in confidence intervals on (elements of) a contingency table. I suggest to consider ROC curves instead, because the confidence depends per prediction, not per class. That is assuming you have a model that is more informative than simply positive/negative. Consider logistic regression at the standard threshold of 50% probability to decide an instance is positive. In terms of a contingency table, probabilities of 51% and 99% are treated the same even though the model's output clearly shows that they are not. A confidence interval on precision (for instance) would abstract all this information away.
