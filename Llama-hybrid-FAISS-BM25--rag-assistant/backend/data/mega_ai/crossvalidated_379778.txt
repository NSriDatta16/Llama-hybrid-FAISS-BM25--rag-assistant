PCA on groups of variables on same dataset

Is it valid to perform a principal components analysis on different sets of variables for the same dataset? In the sample dataset I provide, can you take a PCA of parents_income, household_sz, financial_aid, and legacy in one analysis; GPA, SAT, and ACT in another; and the remaining in another? It would effectively be 3 analyses for family background, test scores, and extra curricular activities. Is there any statistical rule I am breaking by doing this?
