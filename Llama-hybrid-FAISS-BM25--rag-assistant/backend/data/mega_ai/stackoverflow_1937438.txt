I have always done it traditional way, which means user profile, because it was suggested in the docs, but this is not the very clearest and elegant solution. You must always handle the possibility of user not having a profile, which I don't like very much. In the next project I would like to use the subclassing and if only it is in stable version of Django, I will press co-workers in my company to try this. This seems much more natural. If you want to stay safe, use proile. If you prefer to take a little risk and benefit from a much better solution, use subclassing. It was introduced for a reason - there were several talks about weaknesses of profile solution.
