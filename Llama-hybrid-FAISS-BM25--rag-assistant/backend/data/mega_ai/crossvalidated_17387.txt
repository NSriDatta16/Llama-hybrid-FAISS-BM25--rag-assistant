Analysing group differences in average proportions

I have the following data and am really unsure how to analyse it. The actual scenario would take too long to explain so this is an analogous example: Two groups of participants (n = 8) are asked to roll a die 60 times (each participant rolls 60 times) and record how many of each number they roll. The relative proportions of each number for each participant are then averaged for each of the two groups so we have something like: GROUP 1 Number Av.f 1. 10 2. 10 3. 10 4. 10 5. 10 6. 10 GROUP 2 Number Av.f 1. 15 2. 15 3. 15 4. 5 5. 5 6. 5 I understand that if these were simple frequencies, then I could use chi-square, but these are averages of frequencies with variance. At the same time, I can't use ANOVA because the means are not independent from one another. (If I know the mean frequency of 5 of the numbers, I can determine the mean of the 6th.) Even if I would analyse just 5 of the 6, this wouldn't help unless ANOVA would somehow know what the total should be. Does anyone know of a test which would allow me to see whether the two groups differ in the distribution of die rolls? Thank you very much!! Melissa
