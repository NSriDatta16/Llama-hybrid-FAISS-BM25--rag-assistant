original answer Managed to actually pay attention to the detail of the intro to EXPANSION -> Parameter expansion in the manual. The final sentence before the list of expansion cases ( :- , :+ , etc.) explains that "Omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset." If the : is used, those tests will be for a parameter that is either unset or null . So: $ unset malkovich $ echo "${malkovich:-John} ${malkovich-Malkovich}" John Malkovich $ malkovich= $ echo "${malkovich:-John} ${malkovich-Malkovich}" John $ echo "$malkovich" $ Moral of the story: don't just scan the manual, RTFM. appendix At first glance, this answer may seem irrelevant; confused readers are advised to consider the case of echo "${malkovich-}" and then the original form as used in echo "${1-}" . This is an answer to my question in that it explains to myself, as well as others familiar with the :- form of default parameter expansion, that the the colon can be omitted. As Gilles points out, "${1-}" is effectively the same as "$1" unless set -u is in effect: in that case, the provision of a default value is necessary to avoid an error in cases where the variable is unset. See Johnathan Lefler's answer for a thorough explanation of the context and syntax.
