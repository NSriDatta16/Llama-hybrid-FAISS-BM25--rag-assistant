Web RAD tool suggestion?

I'm currently looking for good (and free if possible) Web RAD (Rapid Application Development) tool or Visual Ajax IDE, something like Morfik or Delphi for PHP with more usual deployment method (both create standalone application or web server modules). What i mean was IDE that support drag-n-drop component for building web application and the result was standard .(x)html & .js (and maybe .php) files so i can upload it to my favorite web host right away. I already inspecting VisualWebGui , Visual Ajax Studio , Visual Ajax Builder but all have same method as above for deployment (some using Java platform). I then take a look Sigma Visual , checked the demo, but it was too slow... Maybe better to wait Delphi for PHP with EXTJS as their GUI package
