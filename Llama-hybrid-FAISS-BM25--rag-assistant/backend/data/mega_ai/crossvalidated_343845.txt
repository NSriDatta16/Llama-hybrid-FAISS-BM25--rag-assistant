Density of features from density of principal components

I have used principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction on large number of features. But after some stack of unsupervised learning, I have calculated kernel densities for all these principal components which is needed for further analysis. These kernel densities make more sense/explainable when they get converted to original feature space than in the lower dimensional latent space. Is it possible to estimate the densities of the features from the densities of principal components? Let' say the number of original components is n and number of principal components is m . I am tempted to use the PCA.components_ to estimate the density values in the original space( n ). But the principal components( m ) are calculated from the original raw data and not the density components of original raw data, which is holding me back. PS: I have used scikit learn to compute the principal components.
