Using a Oracle subselect to replace a CASE statement

Hy guys, can anybody please help me with a subquery in Oracle database 10g? I need to extract the values for a column in the first table as value of another column in the second table. I currently use this statement: SELECT CASE WHEN A.column1 = 'A' THEN 'aaa' WHEN A.column1 = 'B' THEN 'bbb' ....... WHEN A.column1 = 'X' THEN 'xxx' ELSE 'bad' END AS COLUMN1, A.* FROM TRANSACTION_TABLE A, CATEGORY_TABLE B WHERE A.column1 IS NOT NULL AND A.column1 <> ' ' This is not an elegant approach, so I'm trying to use a subselect from CATEGORY_TABLE B like the following: SELECT A.column1, A.* FROM TRANSACTION_TABLE A, CATEGORY_TABLE B WHERE A.column1 IS NOT NULL AND A.column1 = B.column_b_1 AND A.column1 <> ' ' AND A.column1 IN (SELECT B.column_b_1_descr FROM CATEGORY_TABLE B WHERE B.FIELDNAME = 'column1' AND A.column1 = B.column_b_1) So, I cannot get any results by using the subquery and don't want to continue using the CASE against many conditions, just want to replace the A.column1 values with the descriptive values from B.column_b_1_descr , as they're easier to read. I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks
