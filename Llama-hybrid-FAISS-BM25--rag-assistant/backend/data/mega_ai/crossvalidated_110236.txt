Running logistic regression on survey data

I have a survey data which has one dependent variable ("Overall experience") and several independent variables(Quality of food, creativity of menu etc.). The response scorecard for both dependent and independent variables are as follows: Excellent 5 Very Good 4 Good 3 Fair 2 Poor 1 As per my understanding and from what I have read, I cannot run a simple linear regression and thus I have opted for logistic regression. Can anyone guide me in the right direction regarding logistic regression using R.
