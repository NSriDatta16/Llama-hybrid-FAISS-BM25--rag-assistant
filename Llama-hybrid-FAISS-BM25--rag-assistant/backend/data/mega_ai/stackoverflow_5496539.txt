You can do it programmatically in two ways: 1. If you need just to alter a procedure: // written from the head ... using System.Data.SqlClient; using Smo = Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo; using Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common; string strConnectionString = "......."; string strAlterProcCommandText = "ALTER PROC dbo.blablabla (..) AS .......\r\nGO"; using (var conn = new SqlConnection(strConnectionString)) { conn.Open(); var server = new Smo.Server(new ServerConnection(conn)); var result = server.ConnectionContext.ExecuteNonQuery(strAlterProcCommandText); Console.WriteLine("Result: " + result); } 2. Or if you want to do this with SQL Job, you may have to use the example above, but instead of strAlterProcCommandText = "ALTER PROC..." execute a command that will add a SQL Job. Usually I generate a sqljob query in this way: Open SQL Server Management Studio In "Object Explorer" window of some server I go to: SQL Server Agent » Jobs » Mouse-right-click » New Job... Then create a simple job that will look like I want to be executed, give the name to the created job Right click on added job and follow this way in the context menu: Script Job as » CREATE To » New Query Editor Window Copy the generated script, make it parameterized as you need, and then put to strAlterProcCommandText . Hope you got my idea.
