Although some languages try to make it easier for you to write secure code, .NET comes to mind. I agree with DroidIn that it's not as much about the language as it is about the design and the coder(s). For each language I could give you an example of some huge site using it successfully. PHP (Facebook) .NET (MSFT sites) C++ (some of Google probably) Java (Ebay C++ as well I think) Ruby (Twitter) etc... For the database I would say it's not as much about security as it is how big you are going to go and what you are trying to do. If you need 25 database servers with terabytes of storage then go for a free solution like MySQL. But if not, you can't beat the features of Microsoft SQL Server for any run of the mill database application.
