Drag-and-drop implementations in JavaScript - what is easiest component to use with a tree implemented via nested DIVs?

We have a collapsible tree implementation in our web app. I need to add support for simple drag-and-drop to it. The question is, what should I use? I know YUI has a drag-and-drop component, but people I worked with have stated it's a pain to use with multiple DIVs which overlap and comntain each other (like my tree does). Are there any suggestions on what to use that's easier/better than YUI's D-a-D? Or if you suggest I stick with YUI as the best available, are there any tutorials/examples of how to graft it on a tree implemented via nested DIVs (the complexity is figuring out which of the DIV's in the nest the drag and drop events apply to). Please note that I need to graft D-a-D onto an existing implementation. While it's fairly flexible, srapping it in favor of some pre-built tree that has D-a-D is not an option due to the implementation's specialized nature. P.S. I have not tried the YUI one myself, for the fear of spending a week wrestling with it only to be told there's something much better and simpler I should have used instead. But if the consensus is that YUI is my best shot and nobody comes up with a good tutorial, I will (pending successfully doing this project) post my approach for common consumption. Thanks!
