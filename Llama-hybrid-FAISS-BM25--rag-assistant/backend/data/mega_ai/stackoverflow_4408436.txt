Just to let people know $.browser.msie && /6.0/.test(navigator.userAgent) is not reliable, I've come to this question looking for an answer to a problem with the JQuery bgiframe which breaks on my machine because I have 'Media Center PC 6.0' in my navigator.userAgent string. I've now edited the source to use the $browser.version test. Its silly of JQuery to deprecate these browser tests because ugly as they may be they are necessary to deal with the ugly state of the browser ecosystem.
