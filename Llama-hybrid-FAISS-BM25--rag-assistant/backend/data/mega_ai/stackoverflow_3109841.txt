I'd go with .NET instead of sending emails from the DB. Sending emails in .NET is super-simple also, and won't require any kind of extensive setup or development time. On a related note, I have no idea why SQL Server can send emails, as this functionality does not seem to fit within the data storage model. Does SQL Server also do 3D rendering?
