Determine if Magento module is enabled

What is the best way to determine if a particular module is enabled/active in Magento? I've tried using class_exists to check if my code has been loaded and parsed by PHP but lately I've noticed its pretty unreliable (returns true even when I delete the module's .xml configuration). Is there a core function I can call?
