F1 is only useful if Precision and Recall are similar. That's why SKLearn has micro and macro (weighted) F1. In Data Science interviews, answering F1 is the most important measure is a sign of a beginner. I tend to agree ... there are so many things to watch out. E.g. Accuracy kFold cross-validation Standard Deviation high or low? A high level is a sign of a problem (e.g. >5%) What does the Learning Curve tell you? Do you have enough data? A Recall of 0.70 might be great if you have 0.01% label 1 With a highly unbalanced dataset, AUROC is important. I prefer a slightly lower F1 with a low variance algorithm (e.g. Logistic Regression) A high F1 score might not be that great if you overfit a Decision Tree .... good luck!
