Using QueryPerformanceCounter in c sharp but not getting precise results

I am using QueryPerformanceCounter to get the precise timing behaviour in my c sharp program. But if i measure the timing using thread.sleep it is not giving excpected results. I followed standard example given at msdn site: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650674.aspx myTimer.Start(); for (int i = 0; i Results are : Iterations: 5 Average time per iteration: 0.208957983452184 seconds Datetime.Now gives : Duration of test run: 5 seconds 5000 milliseconds Can you please suggest what could be possible error?
