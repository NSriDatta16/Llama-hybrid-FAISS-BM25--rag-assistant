After displaying and dismissing the Modal View Controller UIImagePickerController my Cocos2d iPhone app doesn't see multiple touches anymore

I have an app where I display the photo chooser (UIImagePickerController) but after the user dismisses it only single touches are working. And I think I know the root of the issue, but I don't know how to solve it... Before I show the modal dialog the stack during a touch is as follows: ... #3 0x00074de0 in -[EAGLView touchesBegan:withEvent:] at EAGLView.m:289 #4 0x30910f33 in -[UIWindow _sendTouchesForEvent:] ... But after showing and then removing the modal dialog the stack has these two mysterious forwardMethod2 calls: ... #3 0x00074de0 in -[EAGLView touchesBegan:withEvent:] at EAGLView.m:289 #4 0x3098dc95 in forwardMethod2 #5 0x3098dc95 in forwardMethod2 #6 0x30910f33 in -[UIWindow _sendTouchesForEvent:] ... Here is the code I use to display and remove the UIImagePickerController: Notes: 1. pickerViewController is a member of this class that extends UIViewController) 2. Director is from Cocos2D and contains only a single view attached directly in the root window called openGLView, which is why I made a UIViewController to house my image picker. -(void)choosePhoto: (id)sender{ UIImagePickerController *imagePickerController = pickerViewController.imagePickerController; imagePickerController.delegate = self; imagePickerController.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary; imagePickerController.allowsImageEditing = YES; UIView *theView = [[Director sharedDirector] openGLView]; UIView *pickerViewControllerView = pickerViewController.view; [theView addSubview:pickerViewControllerView]; [pickerViewController presentModalViewController:imagePickerController animated:YES]; } And the code to dismiss the dialog: - (void)imagePickerControllerDidCancel:(UIImagePickerController *)imagePickerController { // Dismiss the image selection [pickerViewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; [pickerViewController.view removeFromSuperview]; // HERE... IS THERE MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE PICKER VIEW???? } There must be something I'm missing in cleaning up the picker view... Help is greatly appreciated :)
