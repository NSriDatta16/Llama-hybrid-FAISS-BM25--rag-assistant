Is this training dataset enough for training and testing classification model?

My training dataset contains just 2 classes with 40 features. In case 1, class 1 has 35 samples and class 2 has 700 samples. In case 2, class 1 has 65 samples and class 2 has the same value as above. Is my training dataset enough for constructing the model using SVM classifier or some other classifiers? I'm using WEKA. Testing options are 10-fold cross-validation and %66 and i get very good results.
