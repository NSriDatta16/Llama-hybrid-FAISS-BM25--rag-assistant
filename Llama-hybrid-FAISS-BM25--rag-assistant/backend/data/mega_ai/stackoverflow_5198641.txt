How to create a re sizable only vertically div? (alike SO form)

What we need is simple - 3 divs whose width is static - not changable one on top (of page) - resizable ONLY vertically one draggable - "separator" in the middle (of page) (not resizable) one div just above that "separator". It shall move but not resize while the "separator" is beeng dragged. we need them to be divs - not text fields because I plan to host in resizable a flash object. jQuery can be used. How to create such thing?
