I also work with EEG signals in CNNs, for my experience, what you are doing is basically standardizing each channel $X' = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ centers it to zero and normalizes the data, that is a good practise. In my experience, EEG signals are quite non-linear, therefore feeding them to a CNN is usually a good idea. The main issue you will face is that it is difficult to obtain a number of samples (EEG recordings) big enough so that the network will be able to extract knowledge. Another suggestion I'd like to make would be to convert your signal to frequency domain, or even to time/freq domain (for example woth the spectrogram of the signal) since these transformations are non-trivial. And would help the network identify time/freq patterns in the EEG. Hope this helps!
