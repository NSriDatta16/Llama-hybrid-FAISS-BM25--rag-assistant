JRuby and Java objects

Please tell me if it is possible to do the following: create an instance of a specific class in Java pass it to JRuby to do something with it continue using the "modified" version in Java May you provide a small working example? EDIT: It turns out that embedding was the simplest way to achieve this. More information is available on Embedding JRuby .
