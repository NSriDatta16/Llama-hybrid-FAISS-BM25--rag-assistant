Get the name of a calling class without the use of Exceptions

Yes, getting the class name by using an exception is a plausible solution, but I'm looking for something that is a bit more elegant. String className = new Exception().getStackTrace()[1].getClassName(); This will be used mainly for logging purposes and making sure my cache keywords are component/caller-class specific.
