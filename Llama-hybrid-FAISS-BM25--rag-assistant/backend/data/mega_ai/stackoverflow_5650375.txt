Firefox's uses the system's preferred network adapter. As such, this behaviour is not controlled by Firefox and cannot be modified inside Firefox. You'll need to come up with another method. For the purpose of your Selenium tests, I'd suggest writing a debug behaviour which treats the IP as a debug-specific one when detects a certain user-agent. You can change the user-agent on your second profile by going to about:config and changing: general.useragent.override and general.useragent.compatMode.firefox
