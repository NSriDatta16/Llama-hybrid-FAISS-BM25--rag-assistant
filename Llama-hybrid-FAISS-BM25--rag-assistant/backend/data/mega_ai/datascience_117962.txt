(Started as a comment but it might be worth an answer) This is supervised learning, but the huge number of classes is likely going to be an issue. It might even cause trouble for the time needed to train a model and potentially the storage space. I'm not expert in this kind of case, I don't know if there are specific methods for it. I would suggest to at least simplify the problem a bit by focusing on the most frequent classes, since probably some of them are rarely used. Even so, i suspect that it will be hard. In principle apart from the number of classes it's a regular text classification problem: you could start with a basic model like Naive Bayes. The preprocessing is going to be important, probably you'd have to limit the number of features by removing rare words (use a minimum frequency), possibly using lemmas, removing stop words, this kind of stuff.
