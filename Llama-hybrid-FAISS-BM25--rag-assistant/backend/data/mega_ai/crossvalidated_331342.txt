The following is true when the predictors are continuous variables. I thought this was the predicted value when there x1 and x2 are set to zero. In the case of categorical (eg binary) predictors, the intercept might be interpreted differently as we need to introduce one or more auxiliary binary variables. Each of these variables represents one of the levels (i.e. the unique values in the domain of a categorical variable). Let me provide you an example: Assume we have a degree variable which can take undergraduate and postgraduate values, and we want to model the salary based on this variable, then we should model as: $\text{salary} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \,\text{degree:under} + \beta_2 \, \text{degree:higher}\hspace{1cm}$ Therefore, for a data point representing a higher degree graduate data point, we will have $\text{degree:under} = 0$ and $\text{degree:higher}=1$. Note that since $\text{degree:under}$ and $\text{degree:higher}$ are each other's compliment, there is no need to keep both of them (which increases the model complexity). For example, we can keep $\text{degree:under}$ and remove the other one: $\text{salary} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \,\text{degree:under}\hspace{1cm}$ In this case, $\beta_0$ is the estimated salary of $\text{degree:under} = 0$ or the average salary of the sampled higher degree graduates ($\text{degree:higher} = 1$). Therefore, in your case, $0.1222$ is the estimated response when both binary variables are False or both reference variables ($\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$) are True. Hope it helps.
