I found a work-around, although it doesn't allow me to visually prevent a drop. I leave the dragEnabled and dropEnabled properties of the Tree to true and I check for null in the _dropData.parent property in the dragDrop event. For now, this works. use namespace mx_internal; var dropData:Object = this.marksTree.mx_internal::_dropData; if( dropData.parent == null ){ event.preventDefault(); this.marksTree.hideDropFeedback(event); return; } It's very tricky working with the Tree. I hope at some point they expose the dropData property a little more clearly. I hope this helps someone.
