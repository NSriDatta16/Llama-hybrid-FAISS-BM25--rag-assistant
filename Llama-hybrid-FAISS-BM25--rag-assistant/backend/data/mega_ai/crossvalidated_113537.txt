I see two main alternatives, the scatterplot (see Stephan's post, or a slightly different version below which is sometimes worth trying with time series), and superimposed time series (see the second plot below), though there are a number of other possibilities. However, beware of interpreting the appearance of correlation as meaningful . Specifically, since both your quantities are both "per person, per annum", you have a classical situation where you expect spurious correlation in the original sense of the term.
