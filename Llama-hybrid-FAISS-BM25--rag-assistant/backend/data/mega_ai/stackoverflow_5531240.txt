Depending on what country you are in the rules for postal codes can get pretty dicey. You are pretty safe to assume that a postal code has one official city name, but both the U.S. and Canada allow for alternative city names for a postal code. I know this for a fact because I develop postal address validation software for North America. The non-official names are often recognized by the postal authorities and you typically have to permit their use. Therefore, if you want to be able to use non-official names you need m:n between city and postal code. I would question why you want a code table of postal codes in any case. It is better for address storage to treat these as independent attributes rather than trying to normalize them. If you somehow think that you will be able to use some data in your database to go backwards from postal code to city name or forwards from city name to postal code, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment! There are USPS and Canada Post recognized software solutions for doing address validation and if you spend any time actually looking into it, you'll find that the problem domain of address validation is much more complicated than you think it is. If address accuracy is important to your app (and it should be in most cases) then go buy 3rd party tools to do your address validation and store your addresses in a single table with as many columns as makes sense to you.
