My guess (and it is a guess, since I've never used Magento before) is that you can't, at least not through the TYPO3 backend. The Magento plugin is probably creating the output itself and then piping it into the plugin directly. So to alter the output you'd need to go into the Magento plugin's source code and edit that.
