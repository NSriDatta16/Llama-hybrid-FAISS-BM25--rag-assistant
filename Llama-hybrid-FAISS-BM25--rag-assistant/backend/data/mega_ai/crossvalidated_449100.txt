Having more feed forward layers as hidden layers in word2vec

Word2vec only have one hidden layer followed by a softmax layer. If we add more hidden layer(fully connected feed forward layers), then the model complexity is increased and likely we will get a more powerful model. As far as I know, DAN(deep averaging network) uses 2 feed forward layers. But why we haven't seen such models in word2vec published?
