problem Storing a list of Objects in Isolated Storage

I am trying to store a list of objects I created in the isolated storage and be able to display them in a list by auto generating a title for them. So far the code works but once I tombstone the app and start it up all my data is saved except for the list of objects. I think my problem may be with how I initialize the list in the first place, or possibly how I am displaying the names. Any help is appreciated. this code is in my App.xaml.cs: public partial class App : Application { public List testList = new List (); void loadvalues() { IsolatedStorageSettings settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; List L; if (settings.TryGetValue >("Storage", out L)) { testList = L; } } void savevalues() { IsolatedStorageSettings settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; settings["Storage"] = testList; settings.Save(); } } This code is on my mainPage to add the items to the list: (Application.Current as App).testList.Add(new my_type()); and this code is to implement the titles onto the screen on a different page: public different_class() { { InitializeComponent(); for (i = 0; i Thank you in advance!
