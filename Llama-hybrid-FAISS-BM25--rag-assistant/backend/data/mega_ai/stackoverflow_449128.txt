Use: git diff 15dc8^! as described in the following fragment of git-rev-parse(1) man page (or in modern Git gitrevisions(7) man page): Two other shorthands for naming a set that is formed by a commit and its parent commits exist. The r1^@ notation means all parents of r1. r1^! includes commit r1 but excludes all of its parents. This means that you can use 15dc8^! as a shorthand for 15dc8^..15dc8 anywhere in Git where revisions are needed. For the diff command, the git diff 15dc8^..15dc8 is understood as git diff 15dc8^ 15dc8 , which means the difference between parent of commit ( 15dc8^ ) and commit ( 15dc8 ). Note : the description in git-rev-parse(1) man page talks about revision ranges , where it needs to work also for merge commits, with more than one parent. Then r1^! is " r1 --not r1^@ " i.e. " r1 ^r1^1 ^r1^2 ... " Also, you can use git show COMMIT to get the commit description and diff for a commit. If you want only the diff, you can use git diff-tree -p COMMIT .
