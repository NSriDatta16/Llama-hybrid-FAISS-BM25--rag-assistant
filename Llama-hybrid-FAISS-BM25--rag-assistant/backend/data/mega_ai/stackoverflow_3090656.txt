You can think of your shape as an union of several shapes each of which is a simple closed polygon. the check for every object if it is inside any of the polygons in the following manner: All dots connected by lines - each line has an equation defining it. For every object - build an equation for a line passing through this object. now - for each object equation you need to check how many lines (those between the dots) intersects this object equation - but count only the intersection points that are in the rage between the two dots (and not in the rest of the line outside the two dots) and only the intersection points that are in one side of the object (pick a side - doesn't matter). If the count is even - the object is outside the shape - otherwise it is inside.
