I think MySQL fits the bill as a wrapper. One of the interesting features of MySQL is the separation from the storage engine. Thanks for asking this question it made me look it up! The current storage engines are listed here http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-engines.html . If none of these storage mechanism's satisfy your need you can create another one. I've always seen this as both a strength and a weakness of MySQL as people often confuse the interface with the engine.
