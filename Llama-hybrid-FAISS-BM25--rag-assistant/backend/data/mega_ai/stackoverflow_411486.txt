Maybe you could define a generic class named "NotNull", so that your method might be like: public NotNull methodWhichCannotReturnNull(int i) throws Exception { // the following would lead to a run-time error thown by the // NotNull constructor, if it's constructed with a null value return new NotNull (null); } This is still a run-time (not a compile-time) check, but: It's thrown in the implementation of the method (it's not a fault in the calling code) It's self-documenting (the caller knows he's geting NotNull as a return type)
