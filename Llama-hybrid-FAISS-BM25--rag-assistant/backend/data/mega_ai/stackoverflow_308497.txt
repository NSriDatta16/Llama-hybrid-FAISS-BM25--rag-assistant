You mean the same entries or the same entries in the same order? Anyway, assuming you want to compare if they contain the same entries in the same order, "brute force" is really your only option in C# 2.0. I know what you mean by non elegant, but if the atomic comparision itself is O(1), the whole process should be in O(N), which is not that bad.
