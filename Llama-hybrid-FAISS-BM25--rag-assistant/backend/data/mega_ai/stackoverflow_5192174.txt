How to initialize array of pointers to functions?

I have following code: typedef int (*t_Function) (int x); t_Function Functions[MAX_FUNCTIONS]; int f(int x) { return 0; } But I cannot initialize it properly. If I add following line: Functions[0] = f; then compiler generates following error: prog.c:217: warning: data definition has no type or storage class prog.c:217: error: conflicting types for Functions How to initialize this array of pointers to functions?
