There's a fair amount of information in the kernel structures about processes: page locations, memory statistics, I/O statistics and file handle information, CPU scheduling information, etc. While most of it might be available to the user through things like the proc filesystem, getting that information programmatically probably requires parsing the proc output, etc. Providing a way to get this type of information about a process (maybe paying less attention to security issues that might arise for the time being) could be useful.
