Cannot get any regression model to fit my heavily skewed data ( including parametric and non parametric regression), help!

I am currently working with a large data set where I have measurements of energetic expenditure (Jkg.1dur.1) as my response. Originally I tried to use a mixed effect model with animal ID as the random effect but eventually scraped this when it seemed to show very little variance. My data is heavily left skewed, and remains this way after a log transformation. I tried some Poisson and negative binomial regressions, but realized this wasn't really suited to my data (its integer rather than count). I then tried a Gamma GLM with both inverse and log gamma. I shifted the data towards 0 by subtracting the minimum value (and adding 0.1 so there wouldn't be zeros), but also tried the models without this adjustment. My models converge, but I have extremely low r2 and plotting the model residuals it shows they do not fit well. I am getting significant results which seem biologically meaningful but I do not trust my models. My original data set was hourly energy measures which resulted in a data set of I am at a loss as to what to try next? Is there sometimes just a case where you accept the your model does not fit well and your variables do not have the power to explain changes in the response? (example model structure is; m9 I would appreciate any help. ####################### EDIT BELOW Apologies I did not provide enough information. The predictors TRI and sad_dist are both numeric variables. TRI is the average terrain roughness at a given location and sal_dist is the average distance to salmon streams. Food_period is a categorical variable with two levels, peak an non_peak. I am interested to examine how intrinsic (sex and age) and extrinsic (food periods, proximity to salmon streams and terrain roughness) effect brown bear energetic expenditures. My top model has so far always been the full model, with age significantly negative, sal_dist significantly positive, peak food periods significantly positive and males significantly positive. response data
