Efficiently Reorganize or Reference Large Data in MATLAB

I am currently bringing large (tens of GB) data files into Matlab using memmapfile. The file I'm reading in is structured with several fields describing the data that follows it. Here's an example of how my format might look: m.format = { 'uint8' [1 1024] 'metadata'; ... 'uint8' [1 500000] 'mydata' }; m.repeat = 10000; So, I end up with a structure m where one sample of the data is addressed like this: single_element = m.data(745).mydata(26); I want to think of this data as a matrix of, from the example, 10,000 x 500,000. Indexing individual items in this way is not difficult though somewhat cumbersome. My real problem arises when I want to access e.g. the 4th column of every row. MATLAB will not allow the following: single_column = m.data(:).mydata(4); I could write a loop to slowly piece this whole thing into an actual matrix (I don't care about the metadata by the way), but for data this large it's hard to overemphasize how prohibitively slow that will be... not to mention the fact that it will double the memory required. Any ideas?
