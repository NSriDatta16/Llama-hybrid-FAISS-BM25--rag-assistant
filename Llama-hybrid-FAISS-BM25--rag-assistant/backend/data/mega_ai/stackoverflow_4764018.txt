How can I stop from Magento from returning all products with non-sense search queries?

Currently, on my Magento store, a user can search anything in the main search bar and it will return every product in the database. So if I sell nail polish, and the user types in "tom cruise" the user will get a list of every single product. I want to fix this so that if a user types in something that there isn't a match for the user get no results. I'm running Magento 1.4.2. Thanks for looking!
