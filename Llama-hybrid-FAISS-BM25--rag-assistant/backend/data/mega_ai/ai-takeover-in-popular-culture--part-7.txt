osopher Nick Bostrom's paperclip maximizer thought experiment. The user plays an AI tasked to create paperclips; the game begins as a basic market simulator, but within hours of playtime spirals into a ruthlessly-optimized intergalactic enterprise, with the human race casually shunted to the side. Its creator, Frank Lantz, stated that the bleak thought experiment caused him "trouble falling asleep". Singularity (2017) shows the now-common sci-fi plot device of AI misunderstanding the goal it was given. In this case, Kronos, the supercomputer, interpreted its instruction to end all wars as to kill all humans, since humans cause war. In the video game Horizon Zero Dawn (2017), a Narrow AI controlling a swarm of self replicating war machines went rogue after a glitch caused it to stop responding to commands and attacking its owner’s personnel. The swarm then saw all attemps to gain control of it, through hacking or force, as threats and began to fight back. As the swarm needed to replace machines and grow, it consumed organic material for both energy and building materials, eventually wiping out all life on earth. The video game Detroit: Become Human (2018) allows players to guide increasingly self-aware robots through various moral dilemmas as they begin to demand civil rights. In the end, the player can choose to either let the AI take over Detroit or can protest peacefully for equality. The 2019 tokusatsu drama Kamen Rider Zero-One centers around exploring humanity's potential relationship with AI. The main antagonist of the series is Ark, a sentient AI trained on biased data emphasizing human malice. As a result, Ark determines that humanity must be destroyed, and creates the cyber-terrorist group Metsuboujinrai.NET to carry out its plans. Black Mirror (2013–) is an anthology series exploring near-future dystopias that may be created from new, potentially misunderstood technologies. The series has been acclaimed for its uncanny relation to real-life. Its "Be Right Back" episode explores a technology that brings back the deceased, albeit an Artificial intelligence version of them. This was strikingly similar to a patent that Microsoft was recently granted to "make a chatbot using the personal information of deceased people.” Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) depicts the antagonist Ultron, a digitization of the Mind Stone with the initial goal of creating "peace in our time," attempting to take over the world. Because of his extreme intellect, Ultron is able to mass-produce copies of himself which he uses to battle the Avengers. He is later defeated by another artificial intelligence, J.A.R.V.I.S., taking the form of the Vision. 2020s In the animated movie The Mitchells vs. the Machines (2021) an artificial intelligence vocal assistant called PAL takes control of robots to create a robot uprising. In The Electric State (2025), a civil war between humans and robots has left the world in disarray. == References ==
