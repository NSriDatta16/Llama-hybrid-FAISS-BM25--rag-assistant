I had the exact same problem with the exact same problem - The newest version of jQuery is called on the master asp.net page, and I needed to include jQuery 1.2.6 in a page with the slider...There's lots of posts on here about using the noConflict(); argument w/ this exact same code. Anyways, here's what I did: //This was my conflicting code - lightboxes weren't working any more with the slider implemented //This is jQuery 1.2.6 that I renamed for organizational purposes //Here's the UI that the slider requires var jqSlider = $.noConflict(true);//You MUST use the noConflict method directly after loading the preferred library jqSlider(function(){ // Replace all $ as follows var container = jqSlider('div.sliderGallery'); var ul = jqSlider('ul', container); var itemsWidth = ul.innerWidth() - container.outerWidth(); jqSlider('.slider', container).slider({ min: 0, max: 5800, handle: '.handle', stop: function (event, ui) { ul.animate({'left' : ui.value * -1}, 500, 'linear'); }, slide: function (event, ui) { ul.css('left', ui.value * -1); } }); }); // After this the rest of my functions follow, using the normal $ and jQuery 1.5 Works for me now - the tricky part is just arranging the script calls and your function correctly. Hope this helps.
