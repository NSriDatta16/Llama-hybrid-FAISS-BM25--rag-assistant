Efficient way to draw from two distributions to get a specific correlation?

$x$ and $y$ are correlated random variables, but were randomly permuted. Their correlation can be treated as known. What are some efficient ways to draw joint samples that have (close to) the right correlation? For example, say that the variables are realizations of a process like the following: set.seed(1) A I can estimate from other data the correlation. So the goal is to form samples of $x$ and $y$ that can get me to a correlation of .5 (or so). The important thing is that I re-create a joint distribution with the correct properties. The actual application involves taking an average of simulates from two distributions that are known to be correlated, but from which the simulates were random. If I just take a pointwise average of the two distributions, I'll shrink the variance too much. Here is an inefficient way to do what I want to do: #sort the data xs .5){ pick Anything more efficient? EDIT: Actually, nevermind -- the thing I proposed just now is not good; should have been obvious: EDIT2: Here's another fairly slow way (but fun to watch): rho rho){ x EDIT3: Here's a method that uses a normal copula. It's fast, but its inexact and doesn't guarantee that I'll use all of the values in $x$ and $y$: qdist
