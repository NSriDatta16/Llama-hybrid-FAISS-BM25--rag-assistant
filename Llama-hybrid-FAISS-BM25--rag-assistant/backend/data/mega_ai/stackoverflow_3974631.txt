It's also bad because String concatenation is a relatively expensive operation. Using StringBuilder would likely be slightly more efficient than your first fragment. You might note that you will commonly see something like System.out.println(""+i) where i is an int but this concatenation is quite unnecessary, not to say wrong. This is the equivalent of ...println(""+Integer.valueOf(i).toString()) which looks a lot more messy but does the same thing. ...println(i) works just fine.
