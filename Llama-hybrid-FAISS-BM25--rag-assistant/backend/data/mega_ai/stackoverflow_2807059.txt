Dealing with Android devices that don't need a SD card

It seems that some Android devices like the HTC Incredible and the Archos 5 IT don't need a SD card for storage. How should apps that read and write files to "external" storage (so far the SD card) deal with this in the most backward and forward compatible way possible? Edit : Getting more reports about devices that use onboard memory as storage, like Pandigital Novel, in which IO operations that work with the SD card fail. Any ideas? Is it a permissions problem?
