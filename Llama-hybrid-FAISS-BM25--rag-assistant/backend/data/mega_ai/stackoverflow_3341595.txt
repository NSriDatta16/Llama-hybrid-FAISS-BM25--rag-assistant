Just to you for information, if you go to this page http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/support/status/servicedashboard.aspx you can see the status of all Azure datacenters and services , if you think Azure not "works" as expected, you can check this out to see if there is any issues around the "Azure world" Related to your other questions there is some Diagnostics monitor stuff you can set on your Azure Service, and from there transfer the logs to Azure storage account and check them out there. Check out Windows Azure MMC snap-in to connect to Azure and set up diagnostics and analysis.
