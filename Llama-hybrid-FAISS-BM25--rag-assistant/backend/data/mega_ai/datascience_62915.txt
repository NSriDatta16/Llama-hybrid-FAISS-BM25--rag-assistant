I suggest you learn what each layer in a CNN does in detail from a tutorial such as Machine Learning Mastery or if you prefer videos Sentdex . Building a CNN for handwritten text recognition is not very different from building a CNN for any other purpose so this would give you a good starting point. After that, you can turn back to this code, (or any other tutorial present online for handwritten text recognition) And for the errors, it is not very different from any Python code. It tells you on which line the error is and a brief description of it. I suppose it requires some getting used to but if you understand regular Python error messages, you can understand Keras errors. And of course you can always post here the errors you have problems figuring out.
