I am unsure why you need to approach this as a classification problem. Because the images seem like they will be so consistent, I think I would try to break this down into very interpretable steps. If you were doing this manually the steps would be something like this: Find the ruler and perform some calibration . In other words: determine how many mm a pixel is. If the ruler is consistently in the exact same position, this doesn't require any sort of neural network. Some basic image segmentation or pattern recognition technique should work. If not it might be trickier. Find the tip of the top tooth. . You would need to be able to segment that front tooth properly and then find the tip. The first part could benefit from NNs but finding the tip should be easy if your segmentation is good. It's sharp and points down. So it should be easily detected by a corner detection algorithm but you might get away by picking the lowest pixel of that tooth. Find the tip of the bottom tooth . Same thing as for top tooth. Measure the distance between the two tips or whatever exact definition people use for overbite. Actually, I would definitely start by completely clarifying that point to make sure the approach makes sense. I think I would prefer this approach over a Classifier because it is a lot more modular and if you need to adapt it to other measurements or if the reference ruler changes you can just change one part of the system. Also, I would expect it to be a lot more robust since you can easily evaluate each step and create some visualization that demonstrates the results in a clear way. Granted, you would need to label the dataset to be able to do this, which is pretty tedious but I think it is worth it. This seems fun. Best of luck!
