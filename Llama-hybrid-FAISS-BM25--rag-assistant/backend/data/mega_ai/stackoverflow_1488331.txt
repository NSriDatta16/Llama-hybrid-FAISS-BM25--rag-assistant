I had problems implementing this kind of thing to work in both IE and FireFox because of the way events work in those browsers. When I got it to work in one of them, the other would still cause a postback even if I cancelled out. Here's what we have in our code (the browser test was stolen from elsewhere). if (!window.confirm("Are you sure?")) { if (/MSIE (\d+\.\d+);/.test(navigator.userAgent)) window.event.returnValue = false; else e.preventDefault(); }
