A logistic regression proposes a conditional binomial distribution and then estimates the parameters of those conditional distributions. Binomial distributions are defined to give the probability of class $1$ instead of class $0$ . Yes, the theory could be tweaked to do the reverse, but there is no benefit to doing so (since all of the information about the probability of being in one class is contained in the probability of being in the other class), so we stick with the convention of a binomial distribution pertaining to the probability of class $1$ instead of class $0$ .
