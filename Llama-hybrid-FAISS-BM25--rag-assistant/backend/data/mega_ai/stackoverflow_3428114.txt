cache video content for offline iphone/ipad web apps in mobile safari (html5)?

i have seen a few (discouraging) questions related to this subject but I am still not clear on the answer. is it possible to cache video content for immediate playback in an offline web app on the iphone or ipad? (i believe that there is a 5mb limit for any cached file.) can videos cache the same way other files can, using the manifest? are there alternatives?
