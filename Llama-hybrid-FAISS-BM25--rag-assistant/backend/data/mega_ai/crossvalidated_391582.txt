You typically condition on the covariates (i.e. assume them to be given values, rather than also modelling them as some realization of an some underlying process that we also model - which is also possible, but not what you do when you add a variable to a regression equation), it's the regression coefficient that you might interpret in a Bayesian or frequentist manner. That really does not affect whether one wants to adjust for the covariates. See also this blog post proposing to use "try to adjust".
