The are a number of techniques that you can use - remember the purpose of colocation is to encourage collaboration and communication. A few things can help out. If your team is all nearby - think about having core days of when everybody can come into the office. My current team allows working from home on Mondays and Fridays - and everybody comes in the office Tuesday through Thursday For distributed teams, I have had good success with using Wikis instead of giant sheets of paper on the wall. The nice thing about wikis is that they encorage the team to edit the forms to meet the needs of the team as opposed to adapting to a more formal tool. Another advantage of having a Wiki is each person can have their own page to share pictures about their vacations and hobbies - this makes remote people more real. When you have a distributed team, I want to second the use of Instant Messaging that includes a status (Available, Away (grabbing a cub of coffee), Busy (in a meeting)) - these can include notes if people switch between working at home and at the office. Webcams are inexpensive and valuable tool Invest in a decent speaker phone (we like Polycom phones) for your group conference calls Use tools like LiveMeeting to promote remote pair programming A technique for doing stand ups over the phone is to have the person talking say the name of someone else in the group who has not gone yet - this keeps everyone paying attention. For iteration (sprint) planning meetings - follow up with meeting minutes or a communication plan to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Not being colocated means a tad more documentation and intentionality on communicating. Good luck
