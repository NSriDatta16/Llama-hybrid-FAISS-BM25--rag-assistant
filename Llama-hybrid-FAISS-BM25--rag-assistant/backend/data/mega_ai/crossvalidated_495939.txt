Bayesian updating can be done all-at-once, or sequentially. What this means is that you can apply Bayes theorem to the data updating the prior to posterior one sample at a time, so you take sample $x_1$ , use Bayes theorem to get posterior given this sample, use this posterior as a prior for sample $x_2$ , etc. Under some mild assumptions, this would be equivalent to looking at all the data and itâ€™s joint likelihood to update the prior. Batch mode means the all-at-once update, or part-of-data-at-once approach, as compared to sequential.
