One way is to use the delta method. The univariate delta method tells us that if $(\hat \theta - \theta) / \sqrt n \rightarrow_d N(0,\sigma^2)$ then $(f(\hat \theta) - f(\theta) )/ \sqrt n \rightarrow_d N(0, f'(\theta)^2\sigma^2) $. In our case, we have that $S(t) = \exp(-H(t))$, so if $\hat H$ is an estimate cumulative hazard value with standard error $s_h$, then we get standard that the standard error for the survival is $s_s = \sqrt{s_h^2 (-\exp(-H)^2)} = s_h \exp(-H) = S * s_h $ where $S = \exp(-H)$ (i.e. the corresponding survival value). With that said, I would suspect that a Wald CI built on the cumulative hazards scale and then transformed to the survival scale would actually provide better small sample coverage than a CI built from using the SE provided by the delta method on the survival scale and building a Wald CI from that.
