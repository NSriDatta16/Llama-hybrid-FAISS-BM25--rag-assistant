If you want to use random forest in an unsupervised setting, you'll be focusing on the distance metric obtained in what Breiman calls the "proximities". This should be an NxN matrix representing the times that the samples co-occur in terminal nodes. In R's randomForest, this is obtained via (I've never used Breiman's but I'm sure it's available): rf = randomForest( ... ) 1 - rf$proximities Now, in an unsupervised setting, random forest has no idea how many classes there should be, so that will be your job. This can be done in a variety of ways, e.g., KNN, PAM, etc., where you choose k = 2. As you can imagine, this is quite a bit different supervised random forest, so comparing the classification accuracy between the two procedures might not be illuminating.
