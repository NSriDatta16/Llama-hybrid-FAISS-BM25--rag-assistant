I believe that you have misunderstood the purpose of the setAttribute/getAttribute methods. The data placed into the request for retrieval by "getAttribute" can only be set with the setAttribute call on the server. The client cannot force values to be set there, as the only way to pass parameters from the client to the server is via parameters (or some sort of other structure inside of a POST request). getAttribute/setAttribute are really used for passing information between pieces of server code when using RequestDispatcher .
