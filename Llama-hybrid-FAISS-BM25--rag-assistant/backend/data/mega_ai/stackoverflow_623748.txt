How do I get my Emacs to *always* use 6x13 on X11

I recently declared .emacs bankrupcy and reorganized my init stuff. In the process, I ripped out all the hacky font selection stuff I had accrued over the years, figuring there are probably easier ways to accomplish what I want in the most modern version of emacs. GNU Emacs 23.0.91.1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.14.4) on a GNU/Linux System (Ubuntu 8.10). Let's ignore, for the moment, the fact that I also run emacs under Mac OS X (GUI+Terminal) and occasionally on Windows and just focus on the X11 case: (Background: The font 6x13 has been part of X11 for as long as I can remember. (a.k.a misc-fixed semi-condensed ...). It's a bitmap font.) I want emacs to always use the X11 bitmap font 6x13. (This gives me two buffers next to eachother on my netbook.) I don't want to see DejaVu Sans Mono 16pt or whatever the heck comes up by default on my netbook (it's huge!) I want every new frame and window to use this font. I want derived faces (like org-mode-column) to use 6x13 font and not mysteriously switch back to DejaVu Sans Mono I don't care what GNOME and X11 think the logical DPI of my screen is. I want 6x13. When I remote into my netbook (NX Machine) I don't want to see 6x10. I want 6x13. In case there's any doubt: I want 6x13 . What's the canonical way to do to make this happen? And before some smart-aleck tells me about menu: Options>>Set Default Font: the resulting dialog box doesn't even offer bitmap fonts, so there's no way to choose 6x13. Furthermore, it doesn't solve the problem with org-mode: table-views still come up with the wrong font.
