Why does the generator produce output in a different scale than the training sample?

I am currently trying to train a GAN (based on proGAN) to produce images in a Vaporwave-style which is quite distinct. The results so far have been underwhelming, which I suspect might be due to a very small training sample (only 909 images). However in trying to optimize the model and my code I stumbled upon the following problem: The output of the generator model has a different scale than my training samples! My input data are image arrays scaled from 0-1, however the generator produces arrays scaled from -1 to 2! Why does this happen? And is it a problem at all? My code You can find my code and the output so far here: Vaporgan - Kaggle Notebook
