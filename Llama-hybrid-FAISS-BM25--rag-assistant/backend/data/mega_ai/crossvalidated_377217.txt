Is it still called Machine Learning when the model does not learn anymore? And how is that called?

Maybe the question is too theoretical or even philosophical, maybe it's even the wrong SE-community. I am wondering how I would call a model which is no longer trained/maintained with new data. Do I still call it Machine Learning ? Since it does not learn any more. Based on the following definition of ML: “Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.” by Tom M. Mitchell I would argue, since there is no automatic improvement anymore its not a machine learning algorithm anymore. How do I call it when I used ML algorithms to train or fit a model to a certain point and then stop to improve the model?
