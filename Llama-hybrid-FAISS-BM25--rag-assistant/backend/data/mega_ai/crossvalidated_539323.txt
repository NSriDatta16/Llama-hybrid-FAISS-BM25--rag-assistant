How to calculate errors of best value of parameters that obtained from MCMC method and observational data

I had a model and some observational data. I used MCMC method to obtain the best value of free parameters and used some coding to plot contours of 1 to 3 sigma confidence levels (as you see in the plot). I want the +/- value of sigma for each best value in any confidence level but I know that it is not symmetric. So, I didn't find the common equation of square variance useful. Is there any other way to calculate +/- errors?
