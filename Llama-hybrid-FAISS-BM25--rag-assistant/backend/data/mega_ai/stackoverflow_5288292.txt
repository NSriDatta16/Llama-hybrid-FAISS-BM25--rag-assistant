...it will relatively set the left to its parents position. Actually, no. If you use left and top with a position: relative element, they'll offset it from where it otherwise would be if it weren't positioned (e.g., in the static flow), while continuing to reserve its space in the static flow. A subtle but important distinction (and hugely useful for drag-and-drop). If you want to animate it to the top left of the document, you can figure out its offset (via offset ), and then provide those as negative numbers for left and top , since of course if it's at (say) [100,50], then positioning it at [-100,-50] compared to its default position will...put it at [0,0]. Like this: $("selector_for_your_divs").click(function() { var pos, $this; $this = $(this); pos = $this.offset(); $this.animate({ left: "-" + pos.left + "px", top: "-" + pos.top + "px" }); }); Live example Similarly, if you want to move it to be where another element is, simply subtract its position from the other element's position â€” that gives you the delta to apply: $("selector_for_your_divs").click(function() { var mypos, otherpos, $this; // Move to the target element $this = $(this); pos = $this.offset(); otherpos = $('selector_for_other_element').offset(); pos.left = otherpos.left - pos.left; pos.top = otherpos.top - pos.top; $this.animate({ left: pos.left + "px", top: pos.top + "px" }); }); Live example
