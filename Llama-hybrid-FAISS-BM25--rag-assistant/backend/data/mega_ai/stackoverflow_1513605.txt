I use a script to switch my Python version, run the tests, switch to the next Python version, run the tests again, and so on. I use this to test on 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1. In addition, I run all my tests under two different configuration scenarios (C extension available, or not), so this runs my full test suite 10 times. I use a similar script to build kits, though I build windows installers for each version, then one source kit. For uploading, I just do it all manually. For docs, there's only one version to build, and that's done with a Makefile target. This is all for coverage.py, you can see the code at bitbucket , though I should warn you, they are .cmd Windows scripts.
