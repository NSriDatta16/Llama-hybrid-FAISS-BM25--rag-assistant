Well you're likely gonna get a lot of this as anyone who has to implement secure access of one sort or another will have had enough attacks that implementing any real crypto will be at the least difficult and require significant work. ( not that you aren't ) I'm going to hazard a guess that if you are MS charity license it sorta depends on what valuable property you have to protect - transmitting the result of a strong message digest is the same as transmitting the 'pw' in the clear, what Message Digest is used for is you store the Message Digest somewhere server-side, that way if Hairy Gorilla, the Muck Monster sends the evil twin in for a stroll through your system, the passwords cannot be recovered from the Message Digest. Even if the entire disk is lost, per standard pro-forma failure scenario at several places ( rather than attract attention, let me just tell you this is the nightmare scenario ) then no rash of fraud detectors go off at Big Time Finance World Corp,.... possibly a few here and there but no wave or rash of events. Keep the funds in the bank, read Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, use small-shop security model, and don't try to deal with Twisted Sister, leave that for someone else. Basic Authentication sends in the clear, it's not packet sniffers you should be worried about - if it is then recent breaks at Heartland tell the tale that only hardware encipherment / decipherment have any use in hostile userlands, a short distance from Alice in Wonderland. Most of the things that are valued now would get us a beating when I came up, today you get an award for it. Read Wenbo Mao's preface. Message edit: can you tell where 7c6a180b36896a0a8c02787eeafb0e4c came from? Neither can Twisted Twin ( ! ) Message edit: RFC 2617 - HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication RFC 3540 - Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces RFC 4418 - UMAC: Message Authentication Code using Universal Hashing Whatever you do, use established tools.
