Smoothing spline seems to fit too precisely?

I am trying to fit some time series data to a smoothing spline in R. However, it seems like the spline is fitting the data too perfectly, meaning overfitting. I was trying to figure out what settings to change to try and adjust the level of smoothing. I don't want to manually set the $\lambda$ parameter, because it seems like that should automatically be set according to some metric. I believe the default is generalized cross-validation, so that should work okay. Here is some data and code. Can anyone tell me the correct way to apply the splines to the dataset. I can manually change the number of Knots , but that seems a bit manual. I have a number of datasets to fit, so I don't want to manually fit the number of knots each time. Is there a better way to determine the penalty. I suppose having a twice differentiable function is optimal, so no sharp edges. library(npreg) y The corresponding picture is.
