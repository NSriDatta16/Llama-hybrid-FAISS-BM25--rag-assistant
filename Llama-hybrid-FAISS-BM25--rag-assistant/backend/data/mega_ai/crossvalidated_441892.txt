Logistic regression - what do parallel slopes mean?

I have fit two logistic regression models in which the probability for a student to succeed a course is fit against how many hours he/she studied, where the students of group one used one type of course and the other group used another type of course. I now am reasoning about any significant difference between the two models, was one type of course overall better at getting its students to succeed than the other one? I plotted the logistic regression model and I notice the two curves (one for each type of course) run almost in parallel, almost having the same slope at any point on the two curves. However, one curve lays higher than the other one at all times, meaning the probability of succeeding is higher for any hours of study using this type of course. Can I now conclude this type of course is overall better?
