Vaadin Entry Point

I am wondering if/where I can put some code to run the VERY first time the Vaadin server is initialized? (Not the first time a user hits the site) (For example for loading proxy settings from files, starting rss crawlers etc.) It's quite possible I'm missing a trick with the JavaEE stuff here, I'm pretty new to this stuff.
