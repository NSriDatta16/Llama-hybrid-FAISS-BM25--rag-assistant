Just set parindent to a negative value, and let each item be a paragraph: \documentclass{article} \parindent -4em \begin{document} Feb 22 06:00AM - Wake up Feb 22 06:15AM - Have breakfast Feb 22 08:00AM - A very long sentence that I will have to break at some point but maintaining indentation Feb 22 08:00AM - Or maybe just a list here\\ One\\ Two\\ Three\\ \end{document}
