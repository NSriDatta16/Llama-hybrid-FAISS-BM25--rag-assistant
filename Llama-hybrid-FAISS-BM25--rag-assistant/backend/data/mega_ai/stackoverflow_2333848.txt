Can't modify value returned by time.time() in Python code embedded in C++

I'm facing a very strange problem. The following code: import time target_time = time.time() + 30.0 doesn't work in Python code called from C++ (embedding)! target_time has the same value as time.time() and any attempt to modify it leaves the value unchanged in a pdb console... alt text http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3545118/time_bug.png It happens after I've called root.initialise() in Ogre3D graphics engine, but only when using Direct3D, not when using OpenGL. So this might be related to Direct3D...
