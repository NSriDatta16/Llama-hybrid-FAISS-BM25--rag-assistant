Unless its a paid for service or you can restrict the recipients to a pre-approved list and can establish the bona fides of the users I would strongly recommend you don't do this. However... Do have a look at spamassassin - but remember that one of its most important metrics is the Bayesian filtering engine - which needs to be trained using heuristics (but you can run spamassassin for your incoming mail and copy the database to your webserver). Do make sure that you only allow authenticated customers (with an authenticated email) to use the facility, and limit the rate at which they can send messages (and the number of recipients) using a dead-man's lever.
