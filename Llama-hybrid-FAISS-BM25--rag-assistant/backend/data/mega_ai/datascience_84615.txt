How to approach different image resolutions in deep learning for regression problem?

I have an image dataset of various resolutions and using regression DNN model with fixed n*n input resolution. As model learns certain positions in the image, I've been using zero padding to fit images resolutions to maintain 1:1 aspect ratio. Is there a better way to preprocess images? Without zero padding, I get worse results, and I guess maintaining aspect ratio is necessary to avoid objects' shape distortions in DNN input.
