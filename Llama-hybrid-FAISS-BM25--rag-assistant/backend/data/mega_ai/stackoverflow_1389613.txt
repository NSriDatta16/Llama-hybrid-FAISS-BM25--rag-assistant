You should normally redirect every POST to avoid problems with refreshing the page and the use of the back button. This is known as the PRG (POST Redirect Get) pattern: http://blog.httpwatch.com/2007/10/03/60-of-web-users-can%E2%80%99t-be-wrong-%E2%80%93-don%E2%80%99t-break-the-back-button/ Although, this does incur the cost of another round trip to the server it makes your web application much more user friendly. You could then add the fragment onto the redirected URL. There's an example of PRG with a fragment on this page: http://www.httpwatch.com/httpgallery/redirection/
