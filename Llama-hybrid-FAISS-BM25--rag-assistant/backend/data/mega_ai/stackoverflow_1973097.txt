Um, this is actually very easy for the sample you provided: start at left edge go right 1 column at a time until the current column contains black (a letter) this is the start of the character go right again till no black at all in current column end of character repeat till end of image (Incidentally, this also works for splitting a paragraph into lines.) If the letters overlap or share columns, it gets a little more difficult interesting. Edit: @Andres, no, it works fine for 'U', you have to look at all of each column U U U U U U U U UUU 01234 0,4:everything but bottom row 1-3:only bottom row
