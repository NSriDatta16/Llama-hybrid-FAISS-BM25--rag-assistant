What DB are you using? If it's MySQL, and certain other factors of your implementation align, you could always use INSERT IGNORE INTO ... . EDIT: Struck for SQL Server Alternatively, you could create "handler" pages, e.g. your process looks like this: User attempts to perform "action" User is sent to "doAction.xxx" "doAction.xxx" completes, and redirects to "actionDone.xxx" ??? Profit! EDIT: After re-reading your question, I'm going to lean more towards the second solution; by creating an intermediate page with a redirect (usually an HTTP/1.1 303 See Other ) you can usually prevent this kind of confusion. Checking uniques on the database is always a good idea, but for the simple case of not wanting a refresh to repeat the last action, this is an elegant and well-established solution.
