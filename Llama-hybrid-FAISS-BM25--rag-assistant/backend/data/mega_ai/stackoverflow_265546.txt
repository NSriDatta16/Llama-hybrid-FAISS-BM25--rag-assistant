The behavior of the group box is that you can drag controls into it, including other group box controls. If you let go of the mouse while dragging it over, it will become a child of that groupbox, and AFAIK there is no way to change the designer. Unless you work potentially with send to back first, than load the other on top. I assume you are trying to acheive a layout where you swap out the visible box?
