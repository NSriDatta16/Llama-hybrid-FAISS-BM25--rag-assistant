iphone: ubercab aka (uber) map coordinate

Can anyone describe how to get the map coordinate of a MKMapView by its position on center of screen? Check out Uber app (its free). They have a pin statically located in the middle of the screen and you drag the map but the pin stays there. The middle of the screen is they find your location (very very quickly) showing you the address you are close to.
