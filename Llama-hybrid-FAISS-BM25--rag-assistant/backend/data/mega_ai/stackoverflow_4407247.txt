You should go the route 1.3 to 1.4 , 1.4 to enterprise and switch to default skin while doing so. Skin/templates needs special attention later as the dom is quite different. Merging 1.3 templates to enterprise dom will take ~ 2-4 days experienced slicer who knows how to use diff tools my usual workflow for this is: add all three magento versions to git and tag by version , use your own magento installation as base and ignore your template folders and local/community extensions that are not installed by default on your web directory , checkout your base version git pull 1.4 to your installation and visit the website to get the upgrades git pull enterprise to your installation and visit the website to get the upgrades doing it in such order you also get rid of removed files that magento has removed from each version and you also get all changes and new files.
