Is there any sophisticated role-playing game framework available?

I'm looking for a role-playing game framework which fulfills the following critera: Open source / Free for non-commercial Targeted language doesn't matter as long as it's not too obscure (C# or Java would be great) The framework doesn't have to provide any graphics, sounds or other "low level" stuff The framework should support complex, non-linear story lines (like Fallout 1/2/3) The character should be highly configurable (again like Fallout or Dragon Age) Support for a party would be nice
