Char isn't obsolete, it just should only be used if the length of the field should never vary. In the average database, this would be very few fields mostly some kind of code field like State Abbreviations which are a standard 2 character filed if you use the postal codes. Using Char where the filed length is varaible means that there will be a lot of trimming going on and that is extra, unnecessary work and the database should be refactored.
