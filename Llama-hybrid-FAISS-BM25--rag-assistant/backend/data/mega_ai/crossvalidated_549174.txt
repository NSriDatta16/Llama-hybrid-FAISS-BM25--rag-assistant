How to interpret results of logistic regression?

I am struggling with interpreting the output of logistic regression correctly. The dependent variable is leaving the university (=1) and I have 7 significant independent variables. The coefficient for the independent variable "age" is -0,057. Is my interpretation correct that: exp(-0,057)=0,945 1-0,945=0,055 -> The increase of the age by one year reduces the possibility of leaving the university by 5,5%?
