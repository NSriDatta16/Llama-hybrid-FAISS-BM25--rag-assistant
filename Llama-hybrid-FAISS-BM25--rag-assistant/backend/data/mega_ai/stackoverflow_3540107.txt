I like OOP for one reason. Objects. Think of basketball game. Each player is an object. They all have the class human and the each have a different set of individual skills and attributes. If I was going to program a basketball game it would turn into spaghetti code without OOP. With OOP i can spawn individual humans and name them: Dan is tall and Bill is fast. $dan = new Human(Tall->increaseHeight()); $bill = new Human(Fast->increaseSpeed()); Without OOP It would be a mess to make a bunch of humans compete against one another and keep track of their attributes. I don't know alot about OOP, but organization is one reason to like it.
