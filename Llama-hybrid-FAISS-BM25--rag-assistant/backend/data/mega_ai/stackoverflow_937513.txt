I like my previous answer better, but building on that, if you have an app where you're constantly creating non-homogenous lists of animals, you can always do something like this: let Animalize (x:Animal) = x // define a function to upcast let animals4 = [ Animalize The last is almost certainly an abuse of operators, unless you're in a very highly specialized domain and you constantly need some coercion like this and you're willing to sacrifice inherent readability for terseness.
