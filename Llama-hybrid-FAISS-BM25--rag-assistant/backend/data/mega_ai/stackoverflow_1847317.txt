By default, the IIS server is not allowed to impersonate you towards the SQL Server. There's an MSDN article on how to configure it. The configuration process is complex and error prone. If your production ISS and SQL Server run on different servers, you'll need a domain admin to configure impersonation trust between the two servers. This is typically a no-go in a big organization. In addition to not being deployed by normal admins, impersonation also prevents users from sharing their connections in the SQL connection pool. This results in a very noticeable performance penalty for even small (5+ users) websites.
