Are power analyses of logistic regressions the same whether it is is one variable or multiple?

I conducted power analyses of a single logistic regression using the R WebPower package as such library(WebPower) M1 I am now working on a multiple logistic regression M1 , so I am wondering, is there anything that I need to change for the power analysis? WebPower seemingly only has one function for logistic regressions ( https://rdrr.io/cran/WebPower/man/wp.logistic.html ). Nothing specifies whether it is single or multiple.
