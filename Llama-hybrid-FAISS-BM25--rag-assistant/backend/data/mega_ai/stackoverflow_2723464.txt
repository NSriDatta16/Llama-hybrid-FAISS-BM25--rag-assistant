Since those types are typedefs there's not a great, reliable way to determine whether or not they're defined at the pre-processor stage. MSN's suggestion of testing the compiler version is pretty good, but as Anders indicated in a comment, a more recent SDK might be in use (I think VC6 was supported up through the 2003 SDK - I'm not sure if those types are in that SDK or not). You could check for something the SDK does define as a macro that uses these types, like GetWindowLongPtr : #if !defined( GetWindowLongPtr) typedef DWORD DWORD_PTR; #endif Kludgy, but I think you might be stuck with kludgy.
