They seem to be using some CSS shenanigans to hide the "Terms of use" link. If you look closely, there is always a closing - after the copyright notice. It is most likely a violation of Google's Terms of use that webmasters agree to when generating the API key. I would not recommend doing this. Update: This is the relevant CSS that hides the link (as said, don't try this at home! ): #map a, #map p { display:block; overflow:hidden; position:absolute; text-indent:-9999px; z-index:400; }
