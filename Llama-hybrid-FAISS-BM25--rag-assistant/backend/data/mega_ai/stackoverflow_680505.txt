I answered this question here : How to add a Code-behind page to a Partial View Seems this wasn't particularly tricky, and is quite do-able This answer worked for a Partial 'ViewUserControl' but the same should apply Ok. First: Add a Class file with the convention of .cs (i.e. view.ascx.cs) Second: Add "using System.Web.Mvc;" to the class Third: Change the Class to Inherit from "ViewUserControl<>" Fourth: Add the following to the View's header: CodeBehind="View.ascx.cs" Inherits="Project.Views.Shared.View" Fifthly: Copy the files out of the solution and drag back in to reassociate the two together Note: For this to work with a Normal MVC View you just need to inherit the class from "ViewPage"
