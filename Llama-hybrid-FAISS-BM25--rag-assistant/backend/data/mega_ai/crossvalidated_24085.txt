Just to help keep perspective, it is useful to remember that model averaging is a complex and hard to interpret process that does not surpass a global penalized model in terms of predictive accuracy. That is, if all the models are part of the same family so that a global all-inclusive model can be formed. So if you fit a more saturated model (e.g., include main effects of all potential predictors and expand them with regression splines so as to not assume linearity) but you use penalized maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation so as to avoid overfitting, you will get a very competitive result that is easier to interpret, as you can estimate the partial effect of any one variable by simply looking at its partial coefficients. Model simplification (also called pre-conditioning) can also be of help here.
