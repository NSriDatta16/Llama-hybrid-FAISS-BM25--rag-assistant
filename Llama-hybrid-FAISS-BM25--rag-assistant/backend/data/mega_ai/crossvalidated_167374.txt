The transformation is not differentiated with respect to u, but rather with respect to the error. There are two ways to reduce this reconstruction error: the first is by modifying u, and the second is by modifying the transformation parameters. Either or both of these can be done. Each requires back-propagating error through interpolation matrices, so it's a bit tricky in the implementation, but I'd encourage you to just work through it. It can work :)
