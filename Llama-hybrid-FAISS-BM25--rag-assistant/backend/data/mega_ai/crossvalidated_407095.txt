Probability of a event that happens N times in a range of time given others

I'm running an application for making shipments to any place around the globe. I have a set of rules which are like: A customer makes a shipment... Once a week (ie, 50 shipments/year) At least once a month (ie, 15 shipments/year) At least once a trimester (ie, 6 shipments/year) At least once a semester (ie, 4 shipments/year) At least once a year (ie, 2 shipments/year) Occasionally (ie, 1 shipment/year) Those are the different profiles of our customers... But I'd like to infer from those rules, what is the chance that a customer makes a shipment once a month (ie, 12 shipments/year)? What is the chance that a customer makes more than one shipment per month? Assume I have the data, that one can find in the appendix, permiting that to calculate both the mean and standard desviation. My approach I thought about using the Normal Distribution, but turned out that, when doing P(X=12) was null (and that obviously, does not make any sense at all). I have been exploring on the Internet, and I have found the Poisson Dist, which is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume (Wikipedia) $P(k\ events\ in\ interval\ t)=e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$ where: $\lambda$ is the average number of events per interval (How should I calculate the mean of my data? $\lambda=\frac{\sum_{1}^{i} X_i*N_i}{TOTAL}$ )?. $k$ number of events (in my case 12). Is this last approach the correct one? does it make sense? Should I use different approaches based on the question? Any help will be much appreciated.
