The omitted variable bias is not an irreducible error, but a model misspecification. Omitting a variable that belongs in the true model is a reducible error. There are different ways to account for omitted variables (when you don't have access to the 'true variable'). When omitting a variable your model will be biased and will be misspecified. Your coefficient won't be correct. This gives an easy explanation https://www.albert.io/blog/omitted-variable-bias-econometrics-review/ An irreducible error is an error that you get not because your model is not correct, but because of the data you have.
