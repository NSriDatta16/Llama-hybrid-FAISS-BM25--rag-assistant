How to get average of a column in terms of another column?

How to get average of a column in terms of another column and put this value in a third column, and this value will be evaluated for each retrieved record? "How to perform an opertaion on two columns in a report and insert the result in a third column?" FYI: I'm using CrystalReport Designer embedded with VisualStudio.NET 2005.
