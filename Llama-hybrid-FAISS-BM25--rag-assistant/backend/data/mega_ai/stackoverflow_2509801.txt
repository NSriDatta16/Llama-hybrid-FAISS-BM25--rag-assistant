jQuery Connected Sortable Lists, Save Order to MySQL

Hoping that using something like this demo it is possible to drag items within and between two columns, and update their order either live or with a "save" button to MySQL. Point being that you can make changes and return to the page later to view or update your ordering. http://pilotmade.com/examples/draggable/ Doing it for just one column is fine, but when I try to pass the order of both columns, the issue seems to be passing multiple serialized arrays with jQuery to a PHP/MySQL update script. Any insight would be much appreciated. If you look below, I want to pass say... sortable1 entry_1 => 0 entry_5 => 1 sortable2 entry_3 => 0 entry_2 => 1 entry_4 => 2 EDIT: This ended up doing the trick HTML blah jQuery $(function() { $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable( { connectWith: '.connectedSortable', update : function () { $.ajax( { type: "POST", url: "phpscript", data: { sort1:$("#sortable1").sortable('serialize'), sort2:$("#sortable2").sortable('serialize') }, success: function(html) { $('.success').fadeIn(500); $('.success').fadeOut(500); } }); } }).disableSelection(); }); This is the PHP query parse_str($_REQUEST['sort1'], $sort1); foreach($sort1['entry'] as $key=>$value) { do stuff }
