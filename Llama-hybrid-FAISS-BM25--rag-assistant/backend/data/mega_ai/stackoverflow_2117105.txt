Answers provided here are great. One idea that might be of interest, but is probably asking for more trouble than it's worth is to load both VMs in a single process (both the JVM and the CLR can be loaded within a native Windows application) and give them access to native code. Java via JNI and .Net via the mapping functions to native code that they allow. You could also leverage native queue semaphores to wake up a thread on one side or the other when data is updated. While JNI transitions are expense, they would probably still be faster than the native local socket implementation.
