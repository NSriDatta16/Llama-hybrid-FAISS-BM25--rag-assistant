I thought I would add to Regis A Ely very nice answer. His answer is not wrong, but using a VAR to forecast is different than using a VAR to do other VAR type things (i.e. IRF, FEVD, Historical Decomp. etc...). Consequently, some of the steps outlined by Regis A Ely will negatively effect your forecast in some cases. Disclaimer: When I refer to non-stationary data, I mean that the series contains a stochastic trend. If the data has a time/seasonal trend it must be filter appropriately. First Generally speaking, in an unrestricted VAR there is no need to worry about a spurious relationship. A spurious regression occurs when you regress a non-stationary series (Y) on another non-stationary series (X) and both series are not cointegrated. However, if you regress Y on X as well as lags of Y then the regression will not be spurious as the inclusion of the lag Y insures that the errors will be stationary. Said another way, lags of Y pick up the variation which was previous wrongly assigned to X. Since an unrestricted VAR is essentially a system of ARDL regressions where each equation contains the same number of lags and regressors, it should be clear that spurious regression are therefore not likely to be a problem. Said another way if your data is all I(1), regardless of whether of not it is co-integrated, you can run a VAR. VECM are only necessary when you want to both model and identify the short and long run/co-integration relationship between variables. The question now is, should you run the VAR in levels or in first differences. Second When forecasting, it is not necessary to first difference I(1) data. You can if you like, thought a surprisingly amount of practitioner don't. Remember when we have a non-stationary series, we can still obtain a consistent estimator. For a regression with a single lag of the dependent variable this is intuitive. If a series is following a random walk (i.e. non-stationary) we know the best estimate of where it will be next period is exactly were it was last period (i.e. beta is 1). The standard errors of estimates derived from models with non-stationary data, however, is different because strictly speaking the variance of the estimate approaches infinity as T approaches infinity. This, however, is not a problem for forecasting. Forecasting is essentially a conditional expectation and therefore only relies on the parameters estimates of your model and not standard errors. Further, prediction intervals of your forecast will either be obtained directly from your errors, by bootstrapping errors, or if you have a lot of data via empirical prediction intervals (my favorite!), all three of these approaches are unaffected by non-stationary data because again your errors will be stationary as per our spurious regression discussion above. Why do I care? The ADF test has low power, especially when the series is close to being unit root, but is not. Said another the ADF test will tend to mistakenly assert that a series is non-stationary when it in fact is not. Assume that your ADF test wrongly assures that the series is non-stationary. If you make all the necessary transformation and estimate a VECM, your forecast is going to be wrong, because your model is wrong. This is why people forecast in levels. What about Granger Causality??? You can even test GC with a VAR in levels when data is I(1). I know that sounds crazy. We know that inference is usually not possible with non-stationary data. It is however possible to test joint hypotheses, e.g. GC. This is shown in Toda and Yamamoto (1995) which draws on Sims, Stock and Watson (1990). For an application see http://davegiles.blogspot.com/2011/04/testing-for-granger-causality.html . Last thing If however, you want to use your VAR for things other than forecasting, be careful. A VAR in levels with non-stationary and co-integrated series can yield some weird results. For example, strictly speaking, the Moving Average representation of the VAR does not exist as the parameter matrix will not be invertible. Despite this fact IRF can still be obtained. Inference is also not feasible (thought joint hypotheses can be tested as discussed above). Also be worry of small samples. Everything I've discussed works well in large sample, but things can get wacky in small samples. This is especially true for GC with I(1) data.
