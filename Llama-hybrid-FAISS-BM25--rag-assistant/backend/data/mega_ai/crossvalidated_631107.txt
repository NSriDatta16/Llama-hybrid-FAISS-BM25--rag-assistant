Are population principal components scale invariant?

Are population principal components scale invariant? The answer is no. I'm not sure whether my understanding regarding the first two is correct; please, correct me if I'm wrong. Also, I don't understand the third proof at all. Graphical intuition. PCA results are sensitive to the shape of the data cloud (the ellipsoid). This is easy to visualize as the lengths of the major and minor axis change if we change the data cloud, changing the variances of the first two principal components. Theoretical proof. Consider $$X_{p\times1}=(X_1,X_2,...X_p)\overset{\text{scale transformation}}{\longrightarrow}\tilde{X}=(c_1X_1,c_2X_2,...c_pX_p)=D_{p\times p}X$$ $$\downarrow_\text{principal component transformation}\downarrow$$ $$Y=\Gamma'(X-\mu)\overset{\text{are these the same?}}{\longleftrightarrow}\tilde{Y}=\tilde{\Gamma}'(\tilde{X}-\tilde{\mu})$$ Transformation: $X\longrightarrow DX$ Covariance matrix: $\Sigma\longrightarrow D\Sigma D'$ Spectral decomposition: $\Sigma=\Gamma\Lambda\Gamma'\longrightarrow\tilde{\Sigma}=(D\Gamma)\Lambda(D\Gamma)'$ Principal components matrix: $Y=\Gamma'(X-\mu)\longrightarrow\tilde{Y}=\Gamma'D'(DX-D\mu)=\Gamma'(D'D)(X-\mu)$ So, $Y=\tilde{Y}$ iff $D'D=I_p$ i.e. if the scale transformation is orthogonal. The following proof is an excerpt taken from Multivariate Analysis by Mardia, Kent, Bibby. Proof by contradiction. For $p=2$ , consider $\Sigma=\pmatrix{\sigma_1^2&\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2\\\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2&\sigma_2^2}$ with $\rho>0$ . Then, the largest eigenvalue of $\Sigma$ is $\lambda_1=\frac{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\Delta$ where, $\Delta=\sqrt{(\sigma_1^2-\sigma_2^2)^2+4\sigma_1^2\sigma_2^2\rho^2}$ with eigenvector proportional to $(a_1,a_2)=(\sigma_1^2-\sigma_2^2+\Delta,2\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2)$ . When $ \sigma_1/\sigma_2= 1,$ the ratio $a_2/a_1$ is unity. If $\sigma_1=\sigma_2$ and the first variable is multiplied by a factor $k$ , then for scale-invariance we would like the new ratio $a_2/a_1$ , to be $k$ . However, changing $\sigma_1$ to $k\sigma_1$ shows that this is not the case.
