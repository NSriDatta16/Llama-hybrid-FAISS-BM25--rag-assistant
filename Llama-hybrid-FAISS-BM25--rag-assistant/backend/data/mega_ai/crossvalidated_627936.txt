What is the expected length of an interval on an arc of a circle that can be constructed using exponential variates?

I had asked this question on Math stackexchange once before and now again but this does not seem to be drawing too much attention. Since this is a question that can be safely classified as non-measure theoratic probability, I think this will get enough attention here. Consider a circle $S$ of length $\theta$ . Now suppose, we delete an interval $I$ of length $|I|$ (I'll drop the $|\cdot|$ notation for length and directly write $I$ ) from it. Now on $S-I$ , I choose a point $U$ uniformly at random and construct around $U$ , another interval $J_{U}$ having it's length distributed as a $\min(J^{+}+J^{-}, \theta)$ where $J^{+}$ and $J^{-}$ are iid exponential $(1)$ variates. What is the expected length of this interval constructed ? i.e. what is $E(J_{U})?$ What I did was I considered one end point of $I$ to be the origin(or the pole/reference point of the circle with coordinates measured in anticlockwise direction) and then it is equivalent to constructing $J$ around $0$ and the whole interval $I$ shifted anticlocklwise by $U$ . Then $J^{+}$ can be considered to be measured in anticlockwise direction and $J^{-}$ to be measured in clockwise direction about $0$ . Using the above, we get $E\left(\min(U,J^{+})+\min(\theta-I-U,J^{-})\right)$ . Now by conditioning on $U=u$ , \begin{align*} &U\int_{U}^{\infty}e^{-z}\,dz+\int_{0}^{U}ze^{-z}\,dz +(\theta-I-U)\int_{\theta-I-U}^{\infty}e^{-z}dz+\int_{0}^{\theta-I-U}ze^{-z}\\ &=(1-e^{-U})+(1-e^{-(x-U)})\end{align*} Now taking the expectation in $U$ , we get $\frac{2x-2(1-e^{-x})}{x}$ where $x=\theta - I$ . Is the above correct or am I missing some more terms? Or even going a step backwards, is the conditional expectation of the length of $J_{u}$ given $U=u$ correct? i.e. if $u$ is a fixed point on $S-I$ , then what is the expected length of an interval (distributed as $\min(J^{+}+J^{-},\theta)$ for iid expo $(1)$ ) that can be constructed about $U$ on the arc $S-I$ ? EDIT: I am now sure that I am missing more details. For example, what if $J^{+}>I+u$ and $\theta-J^{-}\leq J^{+}$ , then I am certainly ending up ignoring some parts. Can someone please help me with this. Edit: To be more explicit, in words, what I want to do is :- We are looking to find the expected length of the interval $I'$ that is built outside of $I$ when we imagine $I$ to be part of the original circle. This is the mental image I had while doing the problem EDIT Additionally in the paper, the description given ( this was the initial question posted on mathstackexchange which attracted close votes for needing more details ) that if $I'$ is an independent interval(arc) having length law $\min(J^{+}+J^{-},\theta)$ built around $0$ and if $I$ is a fixed interval not containing $0$ then note the following definition $I\cap_{0} I'=\{x\in I': x\nleftrightarrow 0 \,\text{within}\, I'\setminus I\}$ . Then $H_{0}(I):=E(I\cap_{0}I')$ and $UH_{0}=E(H_{0}(I-U))$ for an uniform $U$ variate on the circle. It is this $UH_{0}$ and $E(UH_{0})$ that I want to calculate. It is also claimed later in the paper(page 23) that $E(H_{0}(I-u)|U=u)$ equals the expected length of part of the interval $I'$ outside $I^c$ that can be constructed around $U=u$ This is all the details I have.
