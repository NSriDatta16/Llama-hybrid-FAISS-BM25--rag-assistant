I found out what the problem was already some time ago, and I should have posted it earlier ... sorry. Here it goes. The culprit was the Interface Builder - or perhaps me not using it correctly. I drag-dropped my view controller into a different nib file, and somehow managed to delete (or not fill) the NIB Name field. Either way, the view controller was instantiated without its NIB file.
