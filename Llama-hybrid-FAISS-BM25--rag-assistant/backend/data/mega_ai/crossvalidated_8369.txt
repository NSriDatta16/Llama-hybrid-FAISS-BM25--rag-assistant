Logistic regression seems appropriate for your problem. The variable you are trying to predict is the probability that an observation (which is either species A or species B) is species A. The covariates are $host$, $rain$ and optionally $host*rain$. The R command would be: glm(formula = species ~ host + rain, family = binomial(logit), weights=counts) and you will be interested in the $p$-values of the slopes. Keep in mind that you are testing multiple hypotheses, though.
