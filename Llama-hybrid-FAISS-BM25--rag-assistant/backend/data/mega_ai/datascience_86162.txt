This is how the problem is formulated as a Causal Inference problem: Take group 1 as the Control Group and group 2 the Treatment Group . Based on the observations ( "S-4","S-3","S-2","S-1","S+1","S+2","S+3"), a model is fit on the observations. How many models depend on the type of learning, S,T or X-learner . Basically, what these learners do, is separately fit the features to the target (S), conditionally on the features originating from control or treatment . Once you have fit the learners, a treatment effect is estimated. You can see the treatment effect as the difference between the predictions on either group, given the knowledge restricted to the opposite group . Here is a sample code from Uber's causalML from causalml.inference.meta import XGBTRegressor y, X, treatment = load_data() xg = XGBTRegressor(random_state=42) te, lb, ub = xg.estimate_ate(X, treatment, y) print('Average Treatment Effect (XGBoost): {:.2f} ({:.2f}, {:.2f})'.format(te[0], lb[0], ub[0]))
