Intuition / motivation for 2 "measure" values on a bullet chart

I am trying to understand a bit more about the statistical intuition behind bullet charts. This one in particular has two "measure" readouts, one is dark blue one is light blue: For clarity, the gray shadings that we see are the qualitative measures, often depicting ordinal thresholds (above xx level = good, above yy level = great, ect). The black marker is used as a "marker" to show the value of something (though I suppose it could be repurposed to show other descriptive stats, like median) Question Is there an existing convention regarding how to interpret the existence of two "measure" readouts (dark blue bar, light blue bar)? I concede the point that with visualization the sky is the limit, of course we can depict whatever we want. What I'm after is: what is the motivation, generally speaking, for wanting this kind of granularity in the visualization? Choose any of the examples: Revenue, profit, order size, new customers, satisfaction if you dont mind a basic worked out example / applied analysis to demonstrate why it would be meaningful to two colors for the inner blue bars. Data [ {"title":"Revenue","subtitle":"US $, in thousands","ranges":[150,225,300],"measures":[220,270],"markers":[250]}, {"title":"Profit","subtitle":"%","ranges":[20,25,30],"measures":[21,23],"markers":[26]}, {"title":"Order Size","subtitle":"US$ , average","ranges":[350,500,600],"measures":[100,320],"markers":[550]}, {"title":"New Customers","subtitle":"count","ranges":[1400,2000,2500],"measures":[1000,1650],"markers":[2100]}, {"title":"Satisfaction","subtitle":"out of 5","ranges":[3.5,4.25,5],"measures":[3.2,4.7],"markers":[4.4]} ]
