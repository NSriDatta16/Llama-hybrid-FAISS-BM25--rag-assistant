ZendX/Jquery ui - open dialog box on click

When a user clicks on the button delete , I want a dialog box to appear, to confirm the delete. I can get the dialog box to appear on page load, but am running into problems getting it to appear on a button click instead: dialogContainer( 'dialog', 'Are you sure you want to delete this postcode?', array( 'autoOpen' => false, 'draggable' => true, 'modal' => true, 'resizable' => true, 'title' => 'Confirm Delete', 'closeOnEscape' => true, 'buttons' => array( 'Delete' => new Zend_Json_Expr('function() { document.location=\''.$this->url(array( 'module' => 'crm', 'controller' => 'postcode', 'action' => 'delete' ),"", true) .'\' }'), 'Cancel' => new Zend_Json_Expr('function() { $(this).dialog(\'close\'); }') ), ), ); ?> Is there something in the dialogContainer that allows this, or do I need to create a separate function, which I load separately? Thanks.
