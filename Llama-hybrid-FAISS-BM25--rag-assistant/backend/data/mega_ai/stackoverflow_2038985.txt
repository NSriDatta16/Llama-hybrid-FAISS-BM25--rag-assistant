One way of dealing with this is to keep a Map around the same lifetime as your Adapter . The Map is simply a cache for getRingerTitle() calls. Be sure to flush the Map whenever you replace or requery() your Adapter. Or, wrap your original Cursor in a CursorWrapper and override the appropriate methods to effectively "extend" your original Cursor by one column. You'd hold the aforementioned Map in your CursorWrapper implementation and return the cached value (or call getRingerTitle() and cache it) for the extra column. This is the same basic approach as the one in the first paragraph, but provides a somewhat cleaner abstraction. You don't indicate what getRingerTitle() exactly does. If it is another database query, and your original Cursor came from a database query, consider using a join to avoid the extra database I/Os. Also, don't override getView() on a SimpleCursorAdapter . Override newView() and bindView() instead.
