Running a Cox regression on image features. Getting very large beta for some features. Is this valid?

I have a cohort of 534 cancer patients. I have pathology slides for each patient and used a convolutional neural network trained to predict survival to extract the relevant image features. I split the data into 40/30/30 where 40% of data was used to train the cnn. I then used the cnn to extract features from the validation set. I ran PCA on these features to reduce the number of features from 2048 to 50. I took these 50 image features and combined them with other features like age, stage, etc. With the combined image/clinical features I ran a Cox regression and got the following result: Iteration 1: norm_delta = 2.04734, step_size = 0.9500, ll = -531.23717, newton_decrement = 74.15919, seconds_since_start = 0.0 Iteration 2: norm_delta = 1.03262, step_size = 0.9500, ll = -479.57881, newton_decrement = 19.79851, seconds_since_start = 0.0 Iteration 3: norm_delta = 0.16658, step_size = 0.9500, ll = -460.93671, newton_decrement = 0.97542, seconds_since_start = 0.1 Iteration 4: norm_delta = 0.01867, step_size = 1.0000, ll = -459.95237, newton_decrement = 0.02205, seconds_since_start = 0.1 Iteration 5: norm_delta = 0.00068, step_size = 1.0000, ll = -459.92980, newton_decrement = 0.00004, seconds_since_start = 0.1 Iteration 6: norm_delta = 0.00000, step_size = 1.0000, ll = -459.92977, newton_decrement = 0.00000, seconds_since_start = 0.1 Convergence success after 6 iterations. model lifelines.CoxPHFitter duration col 'DxToFollowup' event col 'IsDead' number of observations 144 number of events observed 130 partial log-likelihood -459.93 time fit was run 2020-01-31 21:44:51 UTC coef exp(coef) se(coef) coef lower 95% coef upper 95% exp(coef) lower 95% exp(coef) upper 95% z p -log2(p) 0 0.01 1.01 0.04 -0.08 0.09 0.92 1.10 0.18 0.85 0.23 1 0.35 1.41 0.19 -0.03 0.72 0.97 2.06 1.81 0.07 3.84 2 0.78 2.18 0.38 0.02 1.53 1.02 4.63 2.02 0.04 4.54 3 -2.03 0.13 0.57 -3.15 -0.90 0.04 0.41 -3.54 Several of the image features have extremely high coefficients. I am new to survival analysis and I don't know if this is something that can occur in proper models. Also, I am not sure if I should be using the training and validation set together to train the cox model, or if just using the validation set is ok.
