How to let JavaScript know where I am on the site?

I have a single template file which renders pages that look very similar, but behave a bit different. I have a header and a few text boxes, which are filled by the template language, and there is a canvas, whose content actually differentiates the pages. It basically comes down to calling a different JavaScript function based on the page I am on, and I can't really think of an elegant (!) way to do that. I have a single JavaScript file that uses jQuery's document ready callback to add interactivity to the site, and also to do the drawing in the canvas. For that, I have to call a specific drawing function based on which page I am on, but I don't know it at that point. This is certainly not impossible, I can in fact think of several different solutions, but don't really like any of these. The script file is not run through a template engine, so I can't employ any server-side logic there. I could parse the URL in the script, but this sounds like a hack to me. I could also set a variable in a script block within the template file, set a hidden field's value or something like that, but I don't think this logic belongs into the template either. So how is this usually done?
