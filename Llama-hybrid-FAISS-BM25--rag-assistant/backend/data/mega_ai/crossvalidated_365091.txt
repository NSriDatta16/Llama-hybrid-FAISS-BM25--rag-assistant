Finding trends in subsamples of time series

Say I have a e-commerce that operates in multiples countries. I can check if my sales are decreasing in a particular country by looking at the plot of the sales for that country over time. Is there a way to identify a change of trend in various sub-series at a time? Besides a change of trend, can I identify other abrupt changes such as in the picture below?
