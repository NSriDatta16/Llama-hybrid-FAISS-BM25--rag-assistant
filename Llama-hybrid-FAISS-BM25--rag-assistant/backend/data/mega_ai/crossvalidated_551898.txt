SVM (and Random Forest) for stock prediction - training/test accuracy high and validation poor

i'm facing this kind of issue. I set up a good model (122 variables) with 1700 records: training accuracy and test are close to 80%. I'm trying to predict 8 days ahead, the movement of a stock index. Basically i did: use both SVMRadial and RF in R created a partition 70/30 to split training set and test use repeatedCV (5 folds x 5 times) at the end, i got encouraging accuracies in classification, both in training and test set. Finally i tried to validate the model, testing unseen data: i performed a direct 8-days step ahead to process current record (time t) to get the result for time t+8 (the latest Y to feed, the output of the classifier, is from 8 days in the past).Then i carried on training the model with the freshest data and jumping 8 records ahead on and on iteratively. Accuracy dramatically drops down to 50/55% making the classifier pointless. This happens both in SVMRadial and in RF: practically the model, even though always trained till the last available complete data (with the relevant y, that is +1 or -1), is unable to be accurate with new data.I also tried a recursive solution to fill the 8 missing Ys with random forest, getting poor results. Why my model is unable to generalize, providing good results just only 8 records ahead from the last training point? is the cause overfitting with cross validation? How can i manage it? thank in advance! regards
