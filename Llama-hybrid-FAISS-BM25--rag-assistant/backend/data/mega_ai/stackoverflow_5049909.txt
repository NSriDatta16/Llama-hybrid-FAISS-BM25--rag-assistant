Mistake #1: @dogbert & @wasim caught, you need to use the jQuery factory method of jQuery (which, by default, is aliased to $ ): $('#button')... Mistake #2: #button doesn't exist when get_comments.js is being executed, so if #1's just a copy-pasta issue, your script still wont work. You'll need to wait for the document to be ready or put the script after the button to select the button: //this is the jQuery way of setting the document.ready event //it aliases `jQuery` to `$` in case you ever feel like using `noConflict` jQuery(function($){ $('#button').css('color', 'blue'); //-or- $('#button').css({'color':'blue'}); //if you want to set more than one style at a time });
