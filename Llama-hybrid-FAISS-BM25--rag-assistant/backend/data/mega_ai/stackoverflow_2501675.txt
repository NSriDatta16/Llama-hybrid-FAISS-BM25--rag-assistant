Printing elements out of list

I have a certain check to be done and if the check satisfies, I want the result to be printed. Below is the code: import string import codecs import sys y=sys.argv[1] list_1=[] f=1.0 x=0.05 write_in = open ("new_file.txt", "w") write_in_1 = open ("new_file_1.txt", "w") ligand_file=open( y, "r" ) #Open the receptor.txt file ligand_lines=ligand_file.readlines() # Read all the lines into the array ligand_lines=map( string.strip, ligand_lines ) #Remove the newline character from all the pdb file names ligand_file.close() ligand_file=open( "unique_count_c_from_ac.txt", "r" ) #Open the receptor.txt file ligand_lines_1=ligand_file.readlines() # Read all the lines into the array ligand_lines_1=map( string.strip, ligand_lines_1 ) #Remove the newline character from all the pdb file names ligand_file.close() s=[] for i in ligand_lines: for j in ligand_lines_1: j = j.split() if i == j[1]: print j The above code works great but when I print j, it prints like ['351', '342'] but I am expecting to get 351 342 (with one space in between). Since it is more of a python question, I have not included the input files (basically they are just numbers). Can anyone help me? Cheers, Chavanak
