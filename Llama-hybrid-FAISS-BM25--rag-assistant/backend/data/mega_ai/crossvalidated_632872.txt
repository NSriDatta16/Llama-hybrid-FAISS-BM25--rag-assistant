mixed effect model question

Hi i have a certain task i want to solve: For two months, participants played an app, in which they played 5 different therapeutic games (TGs). At the beginning of each session, they also completed a 5-scale State-of-Mind questionnaire, rating the extent to which they feel tired (or rested), distracted (or focused), cautious (or adventurous), sad (or happy), and hungry (or full). Scores range from -1 to 1. Leverage playing data (time & levels played in each TG in each session) to predict/model changes in the participantâ€™s state of mind and a data set which contains these columns: Index(['Participant #', 'date', 'time_tg1', 'time_tg2', 'time_tg3', 'time_tg4', 'time_tg5', 'levels_tg1', 'levels_tg2', 'levels_tg3', 'levels_tg4', 'levels_tg5', 'rested', 'focused', 'adventaurous', 'happy', 'full', 'day of use'] I am not sure regarding the level columns if they are categorial or not. after centering and removing outliers i tried with rpy2 in order to add 2 random effects (participant + day of use): model_formula i am not sure if this correct/incorrect way or there is a better approach
