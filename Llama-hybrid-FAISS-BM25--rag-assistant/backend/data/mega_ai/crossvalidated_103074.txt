How to organise the variable names in R without messing up?

When I work in R, every time I create a new variable I try to name it simple so that it iss easy to type like x1, x2, ... or a1, a2, ... Sometimes I use temporary variables with names temp, and again I continue making variables temp1, temp2, ... . As a result finally I mess up everything to a point impossible to understand the data if looked at after some days. Is there any easy way or rule to follow in creating new variables and organizing them?
