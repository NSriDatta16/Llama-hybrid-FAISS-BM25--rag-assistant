how to construct and sample from conditional multi-variate normal distribution?

The two random variables $D$ and $W$ represent the uncertainty of average price of a product in the daily (short resolution) and weekly (long resolution) time-interval . On the other hand, the variation of the average price of the product over a longer period (week) is lower than a shorter (daily) period. Moreover, it is assumed that the both random variables (weekly and daily average price) follow a normal distribution. I want a probability distribution function (perhaps multi-variate and/or conditional) to represent the uncertainty around these two variables (Q1). Secondly, I want to draw $K$ samples from this distribution function (Q2). Let's say $w_1, ..., w_N$ represents the uncertainty around the weekly average price with a mean of $\overline{w}$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma_w$ . For each weekly sample, $w_i$ , the daily average price samples should have a mean equal to the corresponding weekly sample and the standard deviation as a function of the corresponding weekly price (or even constant). That is $D_{wi}^{dj},\ j=1:M$ are M daily average price sample corresponding the sample $w_i$ . The mean of $D_{wi}^{dj},\ j=1:M$ is equal to $w_i$ and its STD, $\sigma_d =w_i/10$ . For example, N=2 samples regarding the average oil price during a week with the mean of $\overline{w} = 100 $ and $\sigma_{w} = 20 $ are as follows. ${w_1} = 80, {w_2} = 120 $ % Two samples drawn from N(100,20) Also, for each weekly sample, we have M=3 samples characterizing the daily variation of the price with $D_{wi}^{dj=1:M} = w_i$ and $ \sigma_{d} = 30$ (Considered to be independent of the weekly samples for the sake of simplicity in this example). $D_{w1}^{d1}= 50, D_{w1}^{d2} = 80, D_{w1}^{d3} = 110 \quad \text{ Drawn from N($w_1$ = 80,$ \sigma_{d} = 30$)}\\ D_{w2}^{d1}= 90, D_{w2}^{d2} = 120, D_{w2}^{d3} = 150 \quad \text{ Drawn from N($w_2$=120,$ \sigma_{d} = 30$)}$ How can I address Q1 and Q2 (finding the probability distribution function and sampling from it) for the given problem?
