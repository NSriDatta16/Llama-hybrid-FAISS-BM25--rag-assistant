If the first few eigenvalues don't explain the bulk of the variance in your data, it means one of two things: The data is just random noise. Try running PCA on a matrix of independent points sampled from a standard Gaussian. You'd see that the eigenvalues are much more evenly dispersed. Basic PCA isn't sufficient for dimensionality reduction of your data. If this is the case, you may want to try more advanced methods, like kernel PCA.
