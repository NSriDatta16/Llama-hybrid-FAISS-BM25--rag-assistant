CSS link Spacing and Paragraph Spacing

Here is the site: http://wesbos.com/tf/shutterflow/?cat=1 The banner image at the side that says S&S photography adds a margin of a few pixels to the bottom. This only happens when I link it to a URL. Rollover an image to see the text that is highlighted. This works great except I would like to add some padding to the end of the lines. Normal CSS padding only applies it to the start and end of the P tags. My code needs to be formatted like this: (unless someone knows how to dupe this effect with each line being a paragraph tag Sorry for the formatting, the editor wont let me put code on multi lines for some reason. hey hows it going this one is short and this one is longer will this text .cover p { display: inline; color: #000; background-color: #fff; padding:5px; }
