Can you stop your PHP Code from being delivered to your Client just like JavaEE and .NET?

Can you stop your PHP Code from being delivered to your Client just like JavaEE and .NET? As in JavaEE we can compile all our classes into .class extensions and all .jsp pages calling backend (business logic) beans can access those pages while no person can acccess or alter it. Similarly in .Net we can compile our whole ASP.net website (Business Logic) classes into .dll files and again no one can access our code.although we have to ensure Obfuscation process also in both cases. But what to do in the case of PHP? Can anyone tell?
