What's the correct way for a cross-browser HTML layout?

I just read codes of a web product that is supposed to support multiple modern browser(including FireFox 3.X, Safari 3.X and IE7+, but not including IE6-). The HTML code uses div instead of table to create table-like effects. Actually, the div 's are organized like this: ... ... ... ... ... ... There is a piece of onload JavaScript code to read all "headerX" elements, calculate their max offsetWidth . Then assign the max offsetWidth to each of them. In this way, the div is well aligned to be like table. Actually, I don't think this is a good way to go, but I'm told that the product is designed this way to make it cross-browser supported , because table behaves different in different browsers. I'm not convinced. So, the question. Besides the approach mentioned above, is there any better to make table-like layout for all popular browsers?
