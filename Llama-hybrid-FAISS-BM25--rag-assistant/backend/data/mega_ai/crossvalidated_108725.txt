Using the results of a non-metric multidimensional scaling to derive a measure of deviance

I'm working with a dataset containing the taxonomic compositions of floras all over the world and performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on the relative proportions of plant families within each flora. My question: Is it mathematically correct to use the (Euclidean) distance to the coordinate origin in order to quantify the deviance of a flora from a hypothetical average composition?
