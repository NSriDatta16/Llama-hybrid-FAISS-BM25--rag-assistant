Finally figured it out...... I had the UINavigationController and the UITabBarController on the same level. After moving the Navigation Controller as a child to the tab bar controller, everything worked. You may add as many navigation controllers to a tab bar as you would like. In IB is is a little confusing. You need to drag the NavigationController into the TabBar to as it as a new Tab Bar item.
