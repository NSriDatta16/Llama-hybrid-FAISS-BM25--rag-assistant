To make it simple I will assume a study of individuals, but the same applies to any unit of analysis. It isn't complicated, time series is data collected over time, usually implying the same measurement from an equivalent population at separate time intervals - or collected continuously but analyzed at timed intervals. Longitudinal data much broader in scope. The equivalent population is replaced by the identical population, so individual data can be paired or joined over time. Longitudinal data can be repeated measurements or not depending on the goal of the study. When Longitudinal data looks like a time series is when we measure the same thing over time. The big difference is that in a time series we can measure the overall change in the measurement over time (or by group) while in a longitudinal analysis you actually have the measurement of change at the individual level. So you have much more potential for analysis and the measurement of change is without error if sampling is involved, so a longitudinal study can be more precise and informative.
