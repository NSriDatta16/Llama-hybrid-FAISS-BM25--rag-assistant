To answer this question of yours: "The goal here is to identify which variable is a stronger predictor" I think you can play around with MSE and variables to find the most important variable. Here are the steps I would follow: a. Add all variables and regress the model. You will obtain the weights and an MSE. b. One-by-one remove the variables and regress the model again. You will obtain new weights and a new MSE. c. Find the model which resulted in the lest MSE. d. Since all variables are scaled, the variable with the largest weight has the highest importance. This final steps answers this question of yours: "What would be the advice for feature selection?" Such analysis can be performed easily through MATLAB "Curve-Fitting" Toolbox. Since approach (1) is expensive when the number of variables are high, there are other techniques which give you the importance of the variables (i.e. ranking) like: Use Neural Networks and then read the "weights" of the neurons. (almost same as neural networks) Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and then read the "weights" of the neurons. RReliefF is another option. Pearson Correlation Spearman Correlation Kendall Correlation Mutual Information etc.
