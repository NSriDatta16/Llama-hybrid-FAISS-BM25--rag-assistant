Windows XP AutoPlay - Make all USB Devices behave the same way?

I set up event handlers and handlers within the registry to do a specific task I wanted. Then I set up the USB Autoplay settings to behave that way every time a device is inserted. I tried other USB storage devices and only the original one is behaving how I wanted, everything else has its own settings it seems and ignores the autoplay settings. How can I set up AutoPlay settings that behave for all inserted flash drives or is that not possible on Windows XP?
