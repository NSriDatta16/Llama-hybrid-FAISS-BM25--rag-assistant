How to handle machinery shut-down in Time Series for Anomaly Detection

I have this data coming from sensors installed in a industrial machinery and my ultimate goal is implementing an anomaly detection method on it. Now, the data is quite noisy and with lots of missing values and on top of that I have this regular pattern where every sunday the machine goes off and sensors either record a lower values than usual or they simply doesn't record any value at all. My problem here is how should I treat this particular situation? Remove completely sundays rows? Leave the data as is? A little guidance on the matter would be much appreciated.
