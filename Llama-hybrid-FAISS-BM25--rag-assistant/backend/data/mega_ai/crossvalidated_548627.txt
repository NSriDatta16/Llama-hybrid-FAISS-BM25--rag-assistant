I don't think it can be classified as common or uncommon in general, maybe for certain types of problems. But, it can certainly happen. In time series problems, it's not surprising to have date/time related features to play important roles on future predictability, because they may be certain patterns, periodicity or high autocorrelation. However, for example, if we're predicting the cash amount that will be withdrawn from an ATM for a certain region, and let's say we have a binary feature saying if tomorrow there is an event or not in that region, certainly it won't be an unimportant feature for most cases (unless the event can be explained with time related features as well). So, it's not possible to generalize and it highly depends on the problem. And, it's not surprising as well.
