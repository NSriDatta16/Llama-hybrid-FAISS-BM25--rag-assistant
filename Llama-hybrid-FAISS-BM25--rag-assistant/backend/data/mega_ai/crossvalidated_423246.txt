Is it possible to obtain learn specific information about a distribution from a GAN?

If I feed a GAN some images of Gaussian noise with some $\sigma$ and it is successful at generating similar images, is there some way to recover $\sigma$ from the gan or is the generator purely a black box? If so, would this work for more complex distributions?
