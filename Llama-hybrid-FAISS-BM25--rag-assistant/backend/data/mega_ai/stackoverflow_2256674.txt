UIScrollView should be used for scrolling, not dragging. And the 4 scroll views won't work if they're overlapped so don't even think of using UIScrollView in your case. A dedicate UIView subclass that overrides -touches*****:withEvent: is needed. See http://github.com/erica/iphone-3.0-cookbook-/tree/master/C08-Gestures/01-Direct%20Manipulation/ for example.
