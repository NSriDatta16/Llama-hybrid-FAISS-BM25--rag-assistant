I would not perform a t-test on random effect estimates. Such an approach would not be taking into account how those parameters were estimated, but rather treats them as observed quantities. The theoretical guarantees in this case would be questionable. Your hesitancy to add a random effect with a low number of groups is shared by many statisticians (e.g. see here and here and for counter arguments consider Gelman ) In such a case you can always add the group effect as a fixed effect. Regardless of which route you take I would prefer to fit the model in a Bayesian context rather than rely on frequentist asymptotics and p-values which are not well established for mixed effects models.
