The Random Change in your Monte Carlo Model is represented by a bell curve and the computation probably assumes normally distributed "error" or "Change". At least, your computer needs some assumption about the distribution from which to draw the "change". Bootstrapping does not necessarily make such assumptions. It takes observations as observations and if their error is asymetrically distributed, then it goes into the modell that way. Bootstrapping draws from the observation and thus needs a number of true observations. If you read in a book, that C averages at 5 with a standard deviation of 1, than you can set up a Monte Carlo Modell even if you don't have observations to draw from. If your observation is scarce (think: astronomy) you may set up a Monte Carlo Modell with 6 observations and some assumptions about their distribution but you will not bootstrap from 6 observations. Mixed modells with some input drawn from observed data and some from simulated (say hypothetical) data are possible. Edit: In the following discussion in the comments, the original poster found the following helpfull: The "original program" does not care, whether it gets a value, that you computed from a mean and a deviation or that is a true realisation of a mean and a deviation in a natural process.
