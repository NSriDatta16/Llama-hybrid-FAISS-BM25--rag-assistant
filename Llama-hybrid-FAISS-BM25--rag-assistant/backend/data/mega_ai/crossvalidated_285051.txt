how to predict how many years stay in college?

I have a data set to predict how long in years does a student stay in college. The dependent has value like 0.5, 1, 1.5.etc,. I used classification methods like SVM, decision tree but the accuracy is like 30%, which is so low. I tried to round up 0.5 to decrease the levels but still got low accuracy. So I doubt if it is a classification. The frequency of number of years is like this 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.25 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.25 4.5 5 5.25 5.5 758 223 357 118 2 182 120 840 287 1 576 158 1 261 I also tried linear regression and svm. RMSE is like 1.4 which translate to 1.4 years? I am not sure if the accuracy here is very bad or bad? And also, I tried Cox PH regression, the question is that some students graduated before say 4 years and I do not know what is the right censoring time here.
