For my current project, I still write stub objects for my unit tests most of the time. Only once I really felt the need for a mock object and I wrote it manually. I'd like to advise to take this on very pragmatically: if you need mock objects a lot, consider learning a mocking framework (this also comes with a price of course), otherwise use stub objects or your occasional hand-written mock object.
