Hugging face Model Output 'last_hidden_state'

I am using the Huggingface BERTModel, The model gives Seq2SeqModelOutput as output. The output contains the past hidden states and the last hidden state. These are my questions What is the use of the hidden states? How do I pass my hidden states to my output layer? What I actually want is the output tokens, from the model how do I get the prediction tokens?
