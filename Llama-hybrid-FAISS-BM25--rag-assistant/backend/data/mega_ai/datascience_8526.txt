For another alternative approach, you can take a look at the PyMC library. There is a good gist created by Fonnesbeck which walks you through the HMM creation. And if you become really eager about the PyMC, there is an awesome open-source book about Bayesian Modeling. It does not explicitly describe Hidden Markov Processes, but it gives a very good tutorial on the library itself with plenty of examples.
