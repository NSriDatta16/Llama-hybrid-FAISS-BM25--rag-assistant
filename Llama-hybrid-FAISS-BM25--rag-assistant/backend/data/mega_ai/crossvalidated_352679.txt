MLE in context: why is maximum likelihood estimation a thing?

I am trying to understand maximum likelihood estimation and the role it plays in the context of machine learning . I think MLE basically says: Find such parameters so that the model best describes the data you have. This sounds like a no-brainer to me. I can't think of any other parameters one could possibly be looking for. Clearly, I am missing something. Can MLE be put in contrast with any other method of estimating model parameters ? Can one choose not to use MLE when doing machine learning?
