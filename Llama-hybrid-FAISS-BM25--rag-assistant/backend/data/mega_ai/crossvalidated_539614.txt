Random Forests and bootstrapping

As a follow-up on Randomness in Random Forests I wonder if the Random Forest approach, by using bootstrap samples, is really making usage of the bootstrapping. This means, are RFs really trying to estimate the underlying distribution of the samples? When I think about it, it makes sense as it's probably a difference wether the data follows a uniform distribution or a gaussian distribution. So, I'd assume the growing of the trees depends on it? But to be honest, I also wouldn't be surprised wether the trees are really random and independent of the samples itself.
