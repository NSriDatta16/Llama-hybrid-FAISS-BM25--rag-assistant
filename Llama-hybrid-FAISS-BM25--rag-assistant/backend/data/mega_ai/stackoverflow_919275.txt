Embedding Mono in Delphi Win32

Does anyone know the specifics of how to embed the Mono runtime in a Delphi Win32 application? The official documentations is not very helpful with regards to the Win32 environment ( www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono ). Update: I am very familiar with the vagaries of static linking in Delphi and would be perfectly happy with a DLL. Mono itself has dependencies so one more DLL is really no big deal. The comment about FPU control word is one of my concerns since I believe the CG default settings are different than Microsoft tools. Here is what I believe is needed: Header translation from "C" to Delphi (probably not too hard) Compilation of the Mono DLL (is the one shipped with Mono usable?) A better understanding of FPU control word goctha's (hopefully none) Some feedback from someone that has the battle scars from having tried this stunt ;) Update (6-12-2011): In case anyone is interested, I just found a project on Google Code for embedding Mono in a Delphi application: monoemb4delphi
