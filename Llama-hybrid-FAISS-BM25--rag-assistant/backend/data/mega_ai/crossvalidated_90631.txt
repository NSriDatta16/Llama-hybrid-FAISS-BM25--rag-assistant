Different formulations for SVM with slack variables (primal)

I have seen two different ways to formulate the SVM optimization but I was not sure what the difference was between them or if there was any difference. First formulation: $$min \frac{1}{2}||\theta||^2 + C \sum^n_{i=1}\xi_i $$ $$\text{s.t. }\ \ y^{(i)}(\theta \cdot x^{(i)} +\theta_0) \geq 1 - \xi_i$$ Second formulation: $$min \frac{\lambda}{2}||\theta||^2 + \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}\xi_i $$ $$\text{s.t. }\ \ y^{(i)}(\theta \cdot x^{(i)} +\theta_0) \geq 1 - \xi_i$$ Are they the same formulation? The thing that is confusing me is that I think what they mean that: $$min \frac{1}{2}||\theta||^2 + \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum^n_{i=1}\xi_i $$ where: $$C = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$ Is the same as: $$min \frac{\lambda}{2}||\theta||^2 + \sum^n_{i=1}\xi_i $$ Am I right that there should not be and 1/n? Or does it make a difference?
