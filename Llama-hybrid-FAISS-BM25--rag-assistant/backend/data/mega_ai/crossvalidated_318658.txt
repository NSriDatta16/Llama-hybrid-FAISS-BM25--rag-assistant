I'm a beginner in machine learning and this is just my opinion but Sequential Bayesian Learning might prove to be an effective approach to this style of problems. Basically you start with some prior probability distribution of the model parameters and in light of the observations your prior distribution changes to a posterior distribution. Now you can discard this used data and choose this posterior to be your new prior and given the new observations in the data this changes to posterior.And this goes on. So as we keep on providing new data our model tries to adapt rather than the likelihood approach where the model parameters are fixed after optimising a loss function.
