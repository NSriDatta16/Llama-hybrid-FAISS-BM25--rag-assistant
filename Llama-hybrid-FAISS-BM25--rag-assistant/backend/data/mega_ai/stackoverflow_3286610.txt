Thanks for everyone's input, After creating what was (I thought) fancy procedure using a CURSOR and while loop to iterate through the tables, I decided since it is a once off to build an ALTER query for each of the tables from a select statement thus: SELECT DISTINCT 'ALTER TABLE ' || 'CTP0610' || '.' || name || ' ADD COLUMN SOURCE_SYSTEM_CODE CHAR(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''CCR'' ' || ' ADD COLUMN RECORD_TYPE VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''INSERT'' ' || ' ADD COLUMN COMMIT_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT ' || ' ADD COLUMN EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT; ' FROM sysibm.systables WHERE (NAME LIKE 'CCTL_%') OR (NAME LIKE 'CCX_%') OR (NAME LIKE 'CC_%'); I pasted the resultant queries into a query window and ran it, it turned out to be around 1500 tables. I guess sometimes the least elegant solution is good enough :-)
