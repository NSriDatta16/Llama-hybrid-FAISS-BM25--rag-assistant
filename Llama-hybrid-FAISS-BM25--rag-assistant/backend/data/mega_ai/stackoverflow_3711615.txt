Drupal.. images compression issue

for some reasons the images I upload to my Drupal website are downsampled. For example the image I'm uploading is 857x947 I've checked the following settings: - the size of the CCK ImageField: 420x840 - the size of image cache used to re-sample the image: 420x840 Image Toolkit: Compression: 100% I'm using cropping functionality. But I'm not dragging a small area, just almost all the original image is selected. What am I missing ? Maybe php is compressing the image while uploading it ? Thanks
