For ad-hoc queries, have you tried LINQPad ? It is .NET oriented, so it may not work for you. I work day-in and day-out with both SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Visual Studio. However, we usually use SQL statements to maintain schema instead of a UI tool. Some advantages of using queries to maintain schema is being able to check the queries into source control and reusability in install programs. So if you find any random SQL execution tool, you should be able to use it to maintain schema. We also use queries to maintain our SQL Server Agent jobs. I also use SSMS Activity Monitor daily. It's nice, though I wish it could export and load its data.
