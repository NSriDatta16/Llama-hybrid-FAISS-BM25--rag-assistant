In the configuration that's not working, type "10.4" into the Build Settings search field and see what comes up. I expect the Framework Search Paths build setting has an explicit path to the 10.4 SDK somewhere. It would indeed be helpful to have the text of the compiler invocation, just drag and drop the "Compiling" build step that's failing. UPDATE Thanks for posting the log. It's very clearly in there: -F/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks That means that you have a Framework Search Path pointing directly into the 10.4u SDK even when you're using the 10.5 SDK. You have to go through your target and project Framework Search Path and find this path and delete it.
