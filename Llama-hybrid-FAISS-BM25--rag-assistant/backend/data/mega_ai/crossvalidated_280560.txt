There are a number of formal methods for Bayesian variable selection. A slightly outdated review of Bayesian variable selection methods is presented in: A review of Bayesian variable selection methods: what, how and which A more recent review, which also includes a comparison of different methods and the performance of R packages where they are implemented is: Methods and Tools for Bayesian Variable Selection and Model Averaging in Univariate Linear Regression This reference is particularly useful in that it points you to specific R packages where you just need to plug in the response and the covariate values (and in some cases the hyperparameter values) in order to run the variable selection. Another, quick and dirty and non-recommended, way of conducting "Bayesian" variable selection is to use stepwise selection (forward, backward, both) using BIC and the R command stepAIC(), which can be tweaked to perform selection in terms of BIC. https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/stepAIC.html Another quick and dirty way of testing $\beta_4=0$ is by using the Savage-Dickey density ratio and the posterior simulation you already got: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.1452.pdf
