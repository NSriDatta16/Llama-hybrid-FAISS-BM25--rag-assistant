Wrote my thesis on this, also using the RANSAC algorithm in my paper. There is more to this topic than can be captured in a few paragraphs here. Consider getting the excellent book Multiple View Geometry . Snag 1 RANSAC will find a model, in this case the fundamental matrix F , even in the presence of huge amount of outliers . In this case, some point-correspondance candidates are way off. This is an outlier. Basically you just keep fitting the F matrix from randomly drawn points. Eventually you find some set of points that together creates a consistent model. These are the inliers . They can now be used to estimate the model ( F ) more accurately. There is an easy example in my paper with a line-fitting example to get you started and a easy-to-grasp explanation of RANSAC applied to the correspondance problem. Snag 2 The most important thing about the F matrix is that it maps a point in one image to a line in the other: Fx = l ' where x is a point in one image and l ' is a line in the other. The F matrix has 9 elements but must have rank 2 and also the scale does not matter, thus it has only 7 degrees of freedom. There is no easy explanation for the elements of the F matrix. Using a point correspondance x x ' and F the world 3d coordinate, X , of the depicted point can be extracted if you know the cameras internal parameters, like focal length. Note that when using consecutive movie frames the camera usually moves very little and it might be hard to compute the fundamental matrix. It can be worked around though. I suggest looking into the works of Marc Pollefeys'
