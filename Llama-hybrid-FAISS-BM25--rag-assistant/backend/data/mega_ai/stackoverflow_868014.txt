I suspect you are saving images with transparency into a BITMAP format. Bitmaps do not support transparency as such, but usually use a colour replacement technology to give the illusion of transparency. The default colour for this is magenta I believe. You might try saving the images either as PNG's, or perhaps there is a way to specify the transparency colour (I'm not sure).
