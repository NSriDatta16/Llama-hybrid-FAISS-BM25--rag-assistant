I don't know the code you would have to write, but a point in the right direction: http://www.nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html#querycriteria-associations (14.4) The key seems to be: .SetResultTransformer(CriteriaUtil.AliasToEntityMap) The documentation shows an example with cats and kittens. Note that the kittens collections held by the Cat instances returned by the previous two queries are not pre-filtered by the criteria! If you wish to retrieve just the kittens that match the criteria, you must use SetResultTransformer(CriteriaUtil.AliasToEntityMap).
