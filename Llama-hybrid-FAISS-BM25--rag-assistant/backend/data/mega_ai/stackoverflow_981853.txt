Take readability and maintenance into account. If you have a rather complex set of boolean expressions that are difficult to read, DeMorgan's theorm might be a great approach to reducing the expression to something easier to read/maintain but that is still valid/consistent with the original expressiom. If on the other hand, a more verbose expression is much easier to read and reducing the expression, while logically equivelant, makes it more difficult to understand, leave it as is.
