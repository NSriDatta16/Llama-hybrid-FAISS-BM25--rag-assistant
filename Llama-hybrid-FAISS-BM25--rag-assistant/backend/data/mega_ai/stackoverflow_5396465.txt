How to organize F# source of large project (>300 classes) in Visual Studio?

In C# you can put files in folders corresponding to their namespaces and view them in the Solution explorer. In F# it seems I have to put everything in plain specifically ordered list for compilation. When I get to scale of ~300 of classes it gets a bit confusing and disorganized and I start to envy C# and think that probably it is the price for type inference. Are there better options than splitting to several assemblies? Judging by F# compiler source its the route they have taken but I have pretty large system of interconnected components (Controller - ViewModel - View, > 300 classes) I want to be in one assembly because of circular dependencies even at level of interfaces. Should I forget about one file - one class and create some huge files? (e.g. in F# compiler you have several source files in 100kb to 300kb range and some auto generated around 1Mb!) What is your experience with large F# projects?
