You are not overfitting your model and in general random forest is less prone to overfitting than other techniques (for example boosting). you can find a good overview of how to handle imbalanced datasets here: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/imbalanced-classification-problem/ As additional note: your event rate is 20% that is not too horrible as imbalance. You can try to fit a model without sampling the standard data and see how the accuracy on the test set compare with the averaged model
