As far as I can tell, no, there is still no good way to accomplish this seemingly simple task. For future readers, there are two methods (one of which the OP mentions) which you can consider to add context menu items. Registry Method Unfortunately, there is no way to create "rich" menus in Internet Explorer using the registry method . Simple 'context' filtering is available, but nothing more. To summarize this method described in the link, first add an new subkey at: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MenuExt\ is the text which shows up in the context menu in Internet Explorer. Using & for accelerator keys does work as expected. Set the (Default) value to the path of a script file to execute. This may be Javsascript, VB Script, etc. If you are creating a BHO, it would be wise to package it in with your DLL/EXE; access it using res:// . For example, my system has an entry named E&xport to Microsoft Excel with the value: res://C:\PROGRA~2\MICROS~1\Office12\EXCEL.EXE/3000 IDocHostUIHandler Method This method effectively replaces IE's entire context menu with one your BHO generates programmatically. While extremely flexible, it is highly discouraged . If more than one BHO attempts this, the results could be disastrous. I found a working example of this method on CodeProject's Pop-Up Blocker tutorial , but have not tried it myself for the reasons mentioned. Further reading: I am actively working on a project which includes many of these components. I will try to keep this post updated if I find any straightforward solutions. http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/17781.html http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nicd/archive/2007/04/18/calling-into-your-bho-from-a-client-script.aspx http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/view/62253#DownloadId=215004 http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/ieextensiondevelopment/thread/1dc29a00-12e9-45ff-a281-d72553dc79ad
