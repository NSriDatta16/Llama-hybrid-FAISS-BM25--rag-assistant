I have the equation $(1 − B)y_t = (1 − B)a_t$, can I conclude from this that $y_t=a_t$ for all $t$?

I have the equation $(1 − B)y_t = (1 − B)a_t$, am I able to say that this equation implies that $y_t = a_t$ for all t? $B$ is the backward shift operator where $Bz_t = z_{t-1}$ and $y_t = y_{t-1} + \mu + \sigma a_t$ where $a_t$ is a sequence of independent random variable $N(0,1)$, $\sigma$ is the volatility, and $\mu$ the mean growth rate. I know: $y_t = y_{t-1} + \mu + \sigma *a_t$ $y_t -\mu * t= y_{t-1} - \mu * (t-1) + \sigma *a_t$ where $z_t = z_{t-1} + \sigma * a_t$ so $a_t = (z_t - z_{t-1})/ \sigma$ I Guess I just don't know how to show whether or not $y_t$ and $a_t$ are defined for the same t. I know according to time series that t is today where as t-1 was yesterday (or the past) and t+1 is the future.
