Can you recommend a machine learning challenge that is suitable for novices?

I am looking for a challenge that is suitable for a group of novices who want to learn the basics of data science and machine learning. The challenge should match the following criteria: is based on a real application or is at least realistic has a clearly defined goal and partial progress is measurable includes a machine learning component, but also other aspects of data science should be doable within 3 to 6 weeks is suitable for novices it should be an actual challenge in the sense that you cannot just look up near-optimal solutions from the internet
