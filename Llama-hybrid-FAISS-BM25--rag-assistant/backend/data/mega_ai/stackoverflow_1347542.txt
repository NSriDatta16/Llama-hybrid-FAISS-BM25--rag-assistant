Don't. You do not want to automatically sign builds. Most builds don't need signing anyway; they're only used for automating tests. Some builds may be handed to your in-house testers. But only builds that you actually release outside your organization need Authenticode signatures. In that case, you should have a manual verification step after signing anyway. So, signing manually doesn't insert an extra manual step in the release process, and automating it saves very little time. In exchange, there will be far fewer signed files floating around in your organization, and you can make much stronger guarantees about the files that are.
