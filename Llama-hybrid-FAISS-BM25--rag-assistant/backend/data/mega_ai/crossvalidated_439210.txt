Your 4 questions are difficult to answer because your are presenting summary info . The ACF and PACF are descriptive/summary statistics but not always easily inferential. Your 1000 valued time series may have either level/step shifts or be a series that needs to be differenced or transformed or segmented. There may be some seasonality but only your data knows for sure. Post your actual data and given time and motivation some SE reader might be able to help further.
