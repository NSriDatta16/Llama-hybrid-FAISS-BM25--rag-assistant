This sounds to me more like a change point problem. You should investigate the bcp package, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcp/index.html , as well as strucchange, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/strucchange/index.html John Emerson maintains the bcp package, and when I met him, he seemed very willing to engage the community and potential users: john.emerson at yale.edu Alternatively, if your data are time series data, you may wish to investigate the qcc package, and read some of Douglas Montgomery's work on Statistical Quality Control.
