Fire next event up, but not after that

For a page, I've been given a link wrapped inside a label, like this: Links to another page. When the user clicks on the link in all browser, the page is spawned in a new tab as envisioned, but in Firefox the checkbox linked to the label is also selected. This is a non-desired behavior. I want to run some jQuery to allow the link to pop, but to kill the event thereafter. I have the following, which works, but isn't very elegant: $(document).ready(function(){ $('label a').click(function(e){ open($(this).attr('href'), $(this).attr('target')); return false; }); }); Can any of you think of a more elegant way to do this than to replicate the element's behavior manually and kill the event? As an aside, I've been trying with stopPropagation , but haven't had much success. Also, please note that the above solution does work , but I am looking for something more elegant for generically stopping events from propagating past their first call. (The first native call. If I add a callback, I still want the native element behavior to fire, but not that of its parent) .
