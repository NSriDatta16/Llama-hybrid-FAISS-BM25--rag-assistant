There are two solutions that are worth looking at: InfluxDB is an open source database platform specifically designed for time series data. The platform includes many optimized functions related to time and you can collect data on any interval and compute rollups/aggregations when reporting. The company recently launched a query app called Chronograf . I have not used this - but if its no good, you can also check out Grafana (which is very widely used and stable). The alternative strategy you may want to pursue is an elasticsearch index. Elasticsearch is great at running aggregations and other mathematical functions on data. Many use it to store server log data and then query said data using Kibana.
