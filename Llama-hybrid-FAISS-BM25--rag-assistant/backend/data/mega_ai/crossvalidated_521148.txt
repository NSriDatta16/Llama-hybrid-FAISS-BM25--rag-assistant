Is my model defensible for my setting? Help checking assumptions of dynamic panel data model

I have panel data for 150 countries, with daily data from the start of 2018. I want to estimate the effect of the lags of one variable (x) on another variable (y), accounting for some covariates. I have selected a model I think works, but I'm not sure, and I could use some help checking that I'm not violating any key assumptions of the model. Here is my model (Sorry for the length.) I am using a linear regression model that includes lags of x and y as an explanatory variable, with random coefficients and random effects for each unit. Specifically: The form of the equation is y_i,t = a_i + j_1 * y_i,t-1 + j_2 * y_i,t-2 + B_1 * x_i,t-1 + B_2 * x_i,t-2... a_i is a unit-specific intercept / random effect (not a fixed effect, as explained below) In the equation, y is regressed on the past values of y, in addition to the past values of x There are also 8 other covariates / other explanatory variables with the same form as x One issue is that while y, x vary day by day, some covariates vary much more slowly - e.g. year by year. I run a separate regression for each unit, which includes an intercept I use the weighted average of the coefficients (each unit has its own coefficients) see page 204 here The coefficients are just estimated with Ordinary Least Squares. I can either find a way to Wald-test the coefficients of x, or just use the variance of the coefficents of x to test for significance. Here are my concerns about the model Some reasons I chose this model, and some concerns I had about it: The data are non-stationary, and their order of integration is 1 (first-differencing the data yields stationary data). I think this could be a problem but I'm not sure how to fix it. The Toda-Yamamoto procedure recommends only modeling with p+1 lags of x and only Wald-testing the first p lags, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Because of the equation's form, the error term correlates with the first-difference of y. I think this is called Nickell bias, which I know disappears as T grows - my T is large so I think it should be okay. x is lagged because it cannot have an immediate effect on y - the effect could be delayed by between 1 and 14 days (from domain knowledge) The Granger Causality test is an intuitive choice for my data, and this equation has the same form as the equation used in the Granger test . Intuitively, if x has a causal effect on y, x should affect y beyond the past values of y alone. I tested for serial correlation in the residuals and there isn't any, for any of the panel units.
