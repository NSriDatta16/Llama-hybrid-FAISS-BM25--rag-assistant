Hmm, well for starters, that infographic is pretty, but it rather simplifies things, for better or worse. R0 is just one of several parameters that govern the dynamics of disease spread. And even it is misleading as an average. Take, for example, HIV, which is transmitted at a higher rate from men (both to women and other men) and a lower rate from women (both to men and other women). The statistical number of new infections from a single person (R0) really depends on the person's sex -- or for a population, on the sex ratio. But it's not linear, so you can't just do an arithmetic mean if you know the R0 for subsets of the population. Moreover it depends also on behavior (number and sex of sex partners, needle use, having babies). So coming up with an average R0 is both really tricky and subject to fast modification based on social structure change as well as behavior change. The concept of R0 works best for what are termed "well mixed" populations, meaning that every individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with each other individual. This is a mathematically useful assumption, and can sometimes be a good enough approximation. But for large scale human diseases, the assumption is obviously violated. It also assumes that an unvaccinated and non-immune (termed "naive") population -- at least on that infographic. The goal of vaccination programs is to reduce R0 to below 1, i.e. below replacement. If the average infected individual infects fewer than 1 other, the disease will die out. You'll also notice that some of those diseases are vectored (Lyme, e.g.), and some (like tuberculosis) have a complex manifestation as a disease. This further violates the well mixed population assumption. Also, you use the word "epidemic", which typically implies a rapid spread of the disease. Some diseases hang out in individuals for a long time and spread relatively slowly (like tuberculosis). That R0 tells you the lifetime exposure to others based on the length of infectiousness. A disease that has an R0=10, but infects those 10 people over a decade is not likely to cause an epidemic. Instead, that disease will be deemed "endemic", meaning that it has a high enough R0 that it will spread to everyone, but not very quickly. These diseases tend to have relatively stable proportion of individuals infected, as old infected individuals die or become immune and new susceptible individuals are born. So... if you have two diseases that have different R0 values and transmit at the same rate and don't manifest in a complex way and you have a really truly naive well-mixed population, then you can specify the relative rate (exponential, like you said) at which the two diseases spread through the population. Which, I should note, is not the same thing as the probability of an epidemic. In the case I describe, the probably of an epidemic for both diseases (assuming a fast enough rate of transmission) is 1. The probability of an epidemic for a real disease in our messy world is going to have to do more with immunity, social contact patterns, the particular manifestation of the disease, and the means of transmission.
