I would say the sd is a measure of 'spread' rather than 'error'. One way of thinking of when the sd is appropriate is "If the mean is a good measure of central tendency, the sd is often a good measure of spread". Other things that can make the sd not so good: Skewness. For a skewed distribution we tend to use the median; where we use the median, often the interquartile range is a good measure of spread. Rates: The arithmetic mean is not a good way of averaging rates, because it also depends on the length of time at each rate. Here you want the harmonic mean. I am not sure what measure is best for spread of rates. Different scales: If you are trying to combine numbers that are on different scales, the mean is not good. Consider a college admissions office that wants to combine math SAT score (0 to 800), verbal SAT (ditto), GPA (0-4) and a rating of the college essay (0-10). Then the arithmetic mean would weight SAT score and you want the geometric mean. Here, you could get a measure of spread by standardizing the variables.
