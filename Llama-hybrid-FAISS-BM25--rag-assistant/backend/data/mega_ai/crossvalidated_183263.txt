It's quite simple. Think of your dataset as a matrix with rows (examples) and columns (features). Two options: Don't include that company (delete row) Impute some other value into that missing column value Imputation has a number of methods: Mean of column Median of column Mode of column Model based (generate a value based on other rows with similar values in other columns) like Bayesian inference imputation, etc etc, etc For (4), imagine imputing the value of the missing column for the k closest companies in the same sector by market cap. You might imagine even better schemes that build a regression model to actually predict the value based on other examples (rows) on certain columns. This is just an example. You'll have to find what works best for you. Imputation, however, is always bad - the question is whether it is worse than a smaller dataset and by what degree. The only arbiter is your test or CV target - does imputation or deletion deliver better, more generalizable models as a result?
