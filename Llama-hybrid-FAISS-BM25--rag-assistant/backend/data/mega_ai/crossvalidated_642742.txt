How many z-scores should be used when determining a p-value?

Suppose one wants to test whether the average sum of tickets in a box is X. Since the z-score is computed by sampling N tickets and then seeing how many SE's away the average is from the expected value. One would then use this z-score to compute a p-value, and based on that they will decide if they can reject the null hypothesis. Why isn't this process repeated many times? It would seem more sensible to obtain more z-scores and then get a more "holistic" p-value out of that.
