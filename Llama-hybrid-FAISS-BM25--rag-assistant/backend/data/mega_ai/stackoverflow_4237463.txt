Asserting the type seems appropriate in this case - handling a common misuse that seems legal because of duck typing. Another way to handle this common case would be to test for string and handle it correctly as a special case. Finally, you could encourage passing the table names as positional parameters which would make this scenario less likely: def pg_dump(*tables, **kwargs): file = kwargs['file'] port = kwargs['port'] name = kwargs['name'] ... pg_dump('stack', 'overflow', file='/tmp/dump.sql', port=5434, name='europe')
