If you read this thread you will find that:"validation data is not used in the fitting process" and "this data is not passed to the training process so the optimiser doesn't update the parameters with respect to this data". In autoencoder, this validation_data set is used just for calculating the loss function. So, the test error of an autocencoder is nothing but the output of your selected loss function on this validation set.
