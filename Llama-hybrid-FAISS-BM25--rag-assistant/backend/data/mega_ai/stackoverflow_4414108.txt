HTML Encoded strings recognized by the javascript engine, how's it possible?

Well. This night was a very strange night to me. I am sorry to create a new question after creating two other questions previously, but this is another argument at all. If I get an answer here, I'll get an answer to those questions too so please somebody listen to me and try to understand. It all began with a simple script JS to be generated through an aspx codebehind file. On a control, I had to put a JavaScript in this way: this.MyTxtBox.Attributes["onfocus"] = "windows.alert('Hello World!');"; OK. You might think, where's the problem? The problem is that ASP.NET 4.0 encodes everything, and I say everything in order to avoid XSS to be performed on a site. Well this might not seem a problem but if you look at the rendered page you'll make a jump on the chair like I did: As you can see the html, the final html is a bit odd... JavaScript engine should not accept this situation. So I started this questions: ASP.NET quote character encoding causes problems when setting a control's property Asp.Net encoding configuration Well I still haven't got any answer YES we could not understand what the hell it is necessary to modify in the .net configuration in order not to let this situation happen. But now I consider one thing, one important thing: JavaScript engine works! Even with that odd code that should not be interpreted... I hope everything was clear until now... The question now comes: Is this a normal situation for the JavaScript engine? Does every browser will correctly interpret a JavaScript having quotes replaced with their encoded strings? If this is true I have to suppose that the .net does not provide a mechanism to avoid encoding just for this reason!
