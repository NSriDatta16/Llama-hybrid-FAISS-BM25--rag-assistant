Strange Pearson Correlation Coefficient Given DataFrame

I have a Python DataFrame that looks something like: pageviews, type 100 0 50 1 ... When I run: df.corr() pageviews type pageviews 1.000000 -0.009611 type -0.009611 1.000000 So there's less than a 0.01 correlation between type and pageviews. However, when I do: df.groupby('type')['pageviews'].mean() I get back: type 0 1421.406621 1 885.092874 Name: pageviews, dtype: float64 So type 0 has almost twice the number of average pageviews but there's very little correlation. How is this possible? Thanks!
