What's the most elegant way of commenting / uncommenting blocks of ruby code in Vim?

In VIM, at the moment when I need to comment out a section of Ruby code: I navigate to the first column in the row I want to comment out I press CTRL-v to enter visual block mode I navigate down till the place I want to end the operation I type r if I want to uncomment the code or r# if I want to comment it out. This workflow seems ok to me, are there any ways of improving this process? Are there any other tricks for commenting or uncommenting ruby code sections in vim?
