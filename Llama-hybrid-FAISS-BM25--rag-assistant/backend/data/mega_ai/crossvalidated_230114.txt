How to show non-convexity of the geometrical motivated SVM Optimization Problem

Geometrically the SVM tries to classify each data point rightly, while maximize the margin $\gamma$. In the linear seperable case this can be formulated as \begin{align} \max_{\gamma,b \in \mathbb{R}, w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \gamma \ \ \textit{s.t.} \ \ \gamma - y_i \dfrac{w^T x_i + b}{||w||} &\leq 0 \ \ \forall i = 1,\dots,n \label{eq:hardsvm} \end{align} Is there a simple and mathematical exact way to show that the unequality constraint of this problem is not convex?
