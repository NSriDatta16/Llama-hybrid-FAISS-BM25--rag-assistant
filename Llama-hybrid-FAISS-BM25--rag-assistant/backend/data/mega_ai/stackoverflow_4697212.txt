One option that you might want to consider is the Oracle Berkeley DB Java Edition library. It's a simple JAR file that can read/write data to persistent storage. Because of it's small footprint and ease of use, it's used for applications running on small to very large data sets. It's designed to be linked into the application, so that it's embedded and doesn't require complex client/server installation or protocol stacks. What's even better is that it's extremely scalable (which works well if you end up with larger data sets than you expect), is very fast, and supports both a Java Collections API and a Direct Persistence Layer API (POJO-like). So you can use it seamlessly with Java Collections. Berkeley DB Java Edition was designed specifically with Java application developers in mind. It's designed to be simple to use, light weight in terms of resources required, but very fast, scalable and reliable.
