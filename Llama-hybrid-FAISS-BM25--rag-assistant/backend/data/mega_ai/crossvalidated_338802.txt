How to measure similarity/agreement between two temperature time series?

I am developing an application to compare temperatures from two locations, in the same span of time. For example, temperature is measured every hour for three months straight in two different cities. What would be a good way to compare these two data sets, and to come up with a agreement measure? What I am asking for is some measure of how identical or different the temperatures are. For example, if at 11 o'clock in a certain day in Oslo it is 3 degrees and in Athens it's 26 degrees, they would be markedly different, while if the temperatures were 23 and 21 degrees, respectively, we would consider them to be closer to the same measurement for these two cities. What I desire is to compare the lists of temperatures to make a combined report of how these temperatures agree/disagree overall.
