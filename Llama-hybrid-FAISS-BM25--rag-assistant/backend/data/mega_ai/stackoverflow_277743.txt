While clustering on a GUID is normally a bad idea, be aware that GUIDs can under some circumstances cause fragmentation even in non-clustered indexes . Note that if you're using SQL Server 2005, the newsequentialid() function produces sequential GUIDs. This helps to prevent the fragmentation problem. I suggest using a SQL query like the following to measure fragmentation before making any decisions (excuse the non-ANSI syntax): SELECT OBJECT_NAME (ips.[object_id]) AS 'Object Name', si.name AS 'Index Name', ROUND (ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent, 2) AS 'Fragmentation', ips.page_count AS 'Pages', ROUND (ips.avg_page_space_used_in_percent, 2) AS 'Page Density' FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (DB_ID ('MyDatabase'), NULL, NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED') ips CROSS APPLY sys.indexes si WHERE si.object_id = ips.object_id AND si.index_id = ips.index_id AND ips.index_level = 0;
