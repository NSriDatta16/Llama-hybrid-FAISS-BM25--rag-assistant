For large organizations, you generally eventually get to a point where there are dedicated teams to manage the middle tier web servers and application servers. The problem for smaller organizations generally comes that when you first deploy the app servers, there may not be enough admin work to justify a separate person in that role, at which point you have to cobble together time from other teams. It's not particularly unusual for DBAs to manage the app server (particularly for Oracle DBAs managing Oracle Application Servers). It's also not particularly unusual for the Unix admins to manage the app server. Either way, though, some of the work will inevitably benefit from input from the other team.
