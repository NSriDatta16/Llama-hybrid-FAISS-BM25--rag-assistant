WAMP Test Server and magento

I already have a website with magento but I never created a test server which I want to do now. I downloaded WAMP to use as a test server, i put all my files to the /www folder but when I go to the localhost I am getting a log error. Basically I don't know how to transfer the website files to WAMP. The website is set up with Magento. When I was transfering all the files I would receive an error message saying Mage.php file was not found.
