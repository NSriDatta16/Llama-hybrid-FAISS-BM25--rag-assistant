what is a more elegant way of toggling a javascript timer

I made and use this one, but I know theres better ways : function toggle_timer() { if(timer_id > 0){ clearTimeout(timer_id); timer_id=0; } else timer_id = setInterval("go()", interv); } Its based on the assumption that youll only use 1 timer (otherwise, who knows which timer youll clear?) So far this hasnt caused a problem (miracles, I know).
