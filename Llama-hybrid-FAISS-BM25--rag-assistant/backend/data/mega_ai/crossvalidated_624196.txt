Nonlinear Sparse PCA

Given data $x_1, \dots, x_n \in\mathbb{R}^d$ , I am looking for a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^q$ that only uses a limited number of dimensions to represent the data in $\mathbb{R}^q$ . In the linear setting, the natural candidate is sparse PCA, which limits the number of variables used to determine a low-dimensional representation of the data (i.e. $f(x) = Ax$ where the matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times d}$ has sparse rows). Arguably, the natural nonlinear generalization of PCA is Kernel PCA. However, sparse Kernel PCA does not limit the number of input dimensions used to construct the representations. Instead, it limits the number of points that are used to construct the nonlinear representation. This leads me to my question: Which nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods impose sparsity on the variables used for the transformation?
