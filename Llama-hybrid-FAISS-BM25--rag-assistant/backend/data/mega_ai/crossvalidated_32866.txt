Trending algorithm for performance monitoring

Situation description I'm trying to implement a prediction (or trending) algorithm for my performance gathering system in order to see when a Linux server's resources will end (for example, free space on a storage or free memory). The result of the performance gathering process is a graph. So, I need to get on my graph something like this: This is an example of RRDtool graph (data collected from Cacti monitoring tool). Here are 3 dashed lines that are trend lines for the disk utilization history graph. That is similar to what I need. What I would like to get The prediction of when the performance will reach some value (e.g. 90%). Which one of the plenty of prediction (trending) algorithms should I use in my case? What I've researched Holt-Winters algorithm, time series prediction. But I do not know how to use them in this particular case. May be there is other solution? Additional information [30,45,50,10,20,30]-> this is example of disk utilization array (in %). --------------------> Time, minutes Critical threshold boundary is 90%. I need to know when the disk utilization will reach 90% threshold (based on the already collected history of data). Any examples in Matlab or in R are welcome.
