I'm backing @1800 Information on this one. Serializing objects for long-term storage is never a good idea while i appreciate your stance on the matter, this is a special case of data that I get from a webservice that gets refreshed only about once a month. It's not a matter of stances. It's because one day, you will change your code. Then you will try de-serialize the old object, and YOUR PROGRAM WILL CRASH.
