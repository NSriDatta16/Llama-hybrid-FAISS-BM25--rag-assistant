Time series with erroneous data

I have time series gravity variation data with inherent uncertainty in the data itself e.g. ($x+\sigma_x$) where $\sigma_x$ represent the error in data. Now I am doing time series modeling (ARIMA) for the same data. Whatever theory I have read, they consider that original data has no error but this is not true in my data. When I do modelling, definitely the error in data itself is going to affect the model parameter. I want to know how to incorporate inherent error $\sigma_x$ in my modeling and check its impact on model.
