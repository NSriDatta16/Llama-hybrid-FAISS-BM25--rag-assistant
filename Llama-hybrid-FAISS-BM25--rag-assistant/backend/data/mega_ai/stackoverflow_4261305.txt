any luck finding a solution to this, I'm having the same issue. --- update --- I finally figured out what was happening on this one for me. I had the Custom Shipping Admin module installed and it was overriding the address controller that validates the order. I updated the overrided module to reflect the version of Magento I was on and it worked.. no problems. Hope this helps someone.
