Getting pagefile.sys' handle

How to use createfile api open pagefile.sys and get it's handle ? How does pagedfrg.exe tool open pagefile.sys and get it's file cluster info? I want to using FSCTL_QUERY_RETRIEVAL_POINTERS to get this file's cluster info. The intent is to send strictly this FSCTL to analyze the used clusters for statistical purposes.
