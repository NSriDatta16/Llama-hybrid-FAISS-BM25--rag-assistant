I develop in both but C# would be my preferance. You can do the majority of things in both languages and I certianly wouldnt re write any vb projects in c#. However with C#: New language features generally come to c# first of all e.g. lamda expressions in linq You can write code in c# C# will force you to be neater C# developers get paid on average more and most larger projects will only be c# C# has similar syntax and function names to javascript There is some snobbery in the .net community towards vb developers
