Theoretical Random Forrest question - Predicting winners of a competition - Teaching model to focus on accuracy of only one class prediction

Apologies for the confusing title - I've built a random forest model that predicts where someone is likely to finish in a competition based on about 50 variables and 12,000 observations. People can finish from 1-20th (Example). It's Accuracy across the entire population of prediction is encouraging. However I'm only really concerned with trying to predict the winner. So while Overall accuracy is 70% prediction of the winner is only 40%. My question is, "Is it possible to ask the model to make tree decisions that are weighted towards achieving the greatest accuracy in winner prediction above all else..?" I may be using the wrong model here (random forest) but am a little lost as to finding the answer.
