Continue rolling your own with jquery isn't a bad idea but obviously you'll have to "reinvent the wheel" creating basic ajax support in existing controls. The fastest way to complete the project would be to track down the last versions of Infragistic controls that support .NET 1.1. I wouldn't be surprised if they still had 1.1 flavors in their 2007 packages as they are pretty good about compatibility.
