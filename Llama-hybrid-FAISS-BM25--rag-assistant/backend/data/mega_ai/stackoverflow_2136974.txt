Of course $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] can be modified by the client - because in fact IT IS sent by the client. This is part of the http protocol. If you want to get the primary server name defined in the vhost configuration of apache or whatever you can access $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] as proposed by the others. I suggest it is not wise to extract the domain name from the file path of the server (which is stored in __FILE__ ) as it may render your application non-relocatable (it will no longer be storage location agnostic). You may see the contents of the array by dumping it within the script using var_dump($_SERVER) but keep in mind the not all web servers and all web server settings expose the same environment. This is documented in the web server documentation and I think it is partly documented in the php online docs. Update / Important notice: As others pointed out, the content of $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] could be spoofed if apache is configured for UseCanonicalName off (which may be a default setting if you are using eg Plesk-based hosting). So actually going with the __FILE__ can solve this (if your doc root contains the host name). The bigger problem of the first approach is that it can be used to inject any sort of stuff into your application (SQL, JavaScript) because php programmers usually take it granted that SERVER_NAME is no user input and thus apply no sanitizing to it.
