You should have something like [Association( Name="FK_OtherImages_Images", Storage="_OtherImages", OtherKey="ImageId", DeleteRule="NO ACTION")] public EntitySet OtherImages{ ... } in your Image class. DataContext.OtherImages.DeleteOnSubmit(myOtherImage); DataContext.Images.DeleteOnSubmit(myImage); DataContext.SubmitChanges(); should work fine. My guess is that you're forgetting about another foreign key. You can see what query is being run by doing DataContext.Log = Console.Out; or something equivalent. I wouldn't recommend cascading the deletes just to make this work since it should work without doing that.
