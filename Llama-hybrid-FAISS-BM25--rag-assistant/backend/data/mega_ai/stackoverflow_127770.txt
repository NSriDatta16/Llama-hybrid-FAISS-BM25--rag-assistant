I'm pretty sure you have to do it the hard way. At a previous job of mine, we had a very elegant error handling process for VB6 with DCOM components. However, it was a lot redundant code that had to be added to every method, so much that we had home-grown tools to insert it all for you. I can't provide too much insight on its implementation (both because I've forgotten most of it and there's a chance they may consider it a trade secret). One thing that does stand out was that the method name couldn't be derived at run-time so it was added as a string variable (some developers would copy-paste instead of using the tool and it would lead to error stacks that lied...). HTH
