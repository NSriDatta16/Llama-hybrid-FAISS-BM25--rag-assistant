Not really an answer but 2 things you could perhaps try. package { import flash.display.MovieClip; import flash.events.Event; public class OneMovieToRuleThemAll extends MovieClip { public subClips:Array; //vector for cs4 private var index:int = 0; public function OneMovieToRuleThemAll(subClips:Array) { this.subClips = subClips; } //pre subClips.length > 0 public function playAll() { for(var i:int = 0; i = subClips.length) { //dispatchEvent finished removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame); } if(subClips[index].currentFrame It's usually discouraged to use enter_Frame and gotoAndStop(currentFrame) because it's slow, but maybe this is equally slow for each frame so you wont notice any 'stitching' An alternative could also be to build a new movieclip with a Bitmap for each frame of each movie with BitmapData.draw(..); Then use the same enter_frame loop and toggle visible properties for each frame. Probably uses allot of memory and I have no idea if it's even remotely feasible speed wise.
