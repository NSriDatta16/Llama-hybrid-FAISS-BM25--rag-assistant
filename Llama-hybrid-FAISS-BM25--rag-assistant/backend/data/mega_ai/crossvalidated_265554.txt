XGBoost - Removing Important Parameter, Improved score?

This is a generic question about xgboost. I ran the following code to see the important features of my data imp Weirdly, when I remove one of the most important features, my model improves (aka my ability to predict test data on Kaggle improves). Why would this be? How can you determine which features to leave in the data, and which to remove? Thanks
