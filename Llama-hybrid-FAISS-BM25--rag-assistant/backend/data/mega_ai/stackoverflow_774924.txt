Where do I put my custom Levels folder in XNA game?

I am quite lost with where and how to store the *.txt level files in my game. What I want in my game is the availability of a few "prebaked" levels that come installed with the game but also the ability for users to create their OWN levels. So what I did is created a new directory inside visual studio in the "Content" called levels, and put a "level1.txt" there. But the only way I can access the level *.txt files is by using full path, and I cannot INCLUDE them in my visual studio solution because it does not build: "C:\My Documents\blahblabh....\levels\level1.txt" Do I put these "prebaked" maps instead into some directory near the executable? How do I create a directory inside the /bin directory Before I compile the project? How do I dissalow users from deleting the "prebaked" levels that come installed with the game? (I no longer need this) Also, Where do I store the User Custom created levels? I assume that should be done with StorageDevice. But that ties in with the first question on how to create a directory after game is deployed. Any pointers would be welcome! Thank you EDIT: Re: custom content processor. This seems way more complicated then I need. But I need to deploy my game to xbox360 as well, so will the Storage Device work?
