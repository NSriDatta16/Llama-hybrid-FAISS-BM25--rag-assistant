R: Filling missing dates in a time series?

I have a zoo time series with missing days. In order to fill it and have a continuous series I do... I generate a chron date-time sequence from start to end. I merge my series with this one. I use na.locf to substitute NAs with las obsservation. I remove the syntetic chron sequence. Can I do same easier? Maybe with some index function related to the frequency?
