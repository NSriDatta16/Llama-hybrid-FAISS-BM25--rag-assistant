hypothesis testing using poisson distribution

At a nuclear plant great care is taken to measure the employees health.These are the number of visits made by each of the 10 employees to the doctor during a calender year. 3,6,5,7,4,2,3,5,1,4 Assuming the number of visits made by employee has a poisson distribution ,test the hypothesis that the annual mean per employee is greater than 3. I am using the graphical method and I am not sure of which p[X=x] should i consider. X: no.of visits by each employee to the doctor. H0:lambda=3 H1:lambda>3 X follows a Poisson(3) Then what is the probability that I should check? What I did was as the average of sample data is 4.73636. Therfore calculated p[X>=4] and checked if it was in the critical region. Is this the correct probability to calculate? In a poisson distribution the expected value is calculated as x*p[X=x] right?Not as (sigma x*f(x))/(sigma x)
