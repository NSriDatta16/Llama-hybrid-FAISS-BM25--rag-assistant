Assuming you'd like the work done ASAP, don't use cron. Cron is good for things that need to happen at specific times. It's often abused to simulate a background process that would ideally process work as soon as work appears. You should probably write a daemon that runs continuously. (Note: you could also look at a message/work-queue type system, there are nice libraries out there to do this too) You can write a daemon from scratch using the pcntl functions (since you don't care about multiple worker processes, it's super-easy to get a process running in the background.), or cheat and just make a script that runs forever and run it via screen , or leverage some solid library code like PEAR's System:Daemon or nanoserv Once the daemonization stuff is taken care of, all you really care about is having a loop that runs forever. You'll want to take care that your script doesn't leak memory, or consume too many resources. Generally, you can do something like: And it'll work pretty well.
