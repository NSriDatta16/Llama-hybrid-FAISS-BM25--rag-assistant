One of the most overlooked is that many file systems use binary trees to manage directory listings. They rarely use a plain binary tree, but some variation such as a B-tree. This is because the question of on-disk storage of the tree is quite important to the details of implementation. The reason they use this sort of structure is for efficiency and speed. This lets them do things like support thousands of files in a directory. Comparisons for file creation and deletion times highlight efficiencies for this aspect of the filesystem. Binary trees are also used on many games that render 3D objects. Again, the reason is speed. In fact, speed is so important that some game engines, such as the Quake engine actually have the binary tree pre-generated and pre-optimized as part of the map build process.
