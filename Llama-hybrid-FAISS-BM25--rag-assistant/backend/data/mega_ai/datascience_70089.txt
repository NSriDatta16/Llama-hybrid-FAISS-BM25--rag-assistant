How to identify word in a sentence representing the song genre?

I am training a model to identify a word that represents a song genre given a sentence. For example, the model is given a sentence "Beethoven songs are part of the classical genre." The model will categorize the word, "classical" as "song genre". Can I use an RNN classifier to do this or is there another algorithm that can accomplish this task?
