The inner product properties seem to clash with the RKHS property for RBF kernels. What is off?

By the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) property, given a P.S.D. kernel function $\kappa:X\times X \rightarrow \mathbb R$ , there exists a Hilbert space $H$ and a map $\phi:X\rightarrow H$ such that $$ \kappa(x,y) = \langle \phi(x), \phi(y) \rangle_H. $$ Define $$ \kappa(x,y) = \exp\left(\frac{-\|x-y\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) $$ and denote by $H$ the corresponding RKHS. The definition of the kernel implies that $H$ is defined over field $\mathbb R$ . By the properties of the inner product, it should be that for any $\alpha \in \mathbb R$ , $$ \langle \alpha\phi(x), \phi(y) \rangle_H = \alpha\langle \phi(x), \phi(y) \rangle_H. $$ This means that we can choose vectors $\phi(x),\phi(y) \in H$ to achieve any real value as a result of $\kappa(x,y)$ . However, the image of $\kappa$ is $(0,1]$ , so I guess that something must be off in my reasoning. What is it?
