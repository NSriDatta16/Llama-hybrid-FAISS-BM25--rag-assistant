Color attribute won't work for e-mails, for most mail agents it might work the first time the e-mail is sent but it'll be ignored if the e-mail is forwarded. Best thing is to use very old HTML tags and tables to format and style the e-mail, such as pre-tableless code. Sad but true, support for e-mails is still incredibly poor.
