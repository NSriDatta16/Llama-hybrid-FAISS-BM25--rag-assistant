How to model a biased coin with time varying bias?

Models of biased coins typically have one parameter $\theta = P(\text{Head} | \theta)$. One way to estimate $\theta$ from a series of draws is to use a beta prior and compute posterior distribution with binomial likelihood. In my settings, because of some weird physical process, my coin properties are slowly changing and $\theta$ becomes a function of time $t$. My data is a set of ordered draws i.e. $\{H,T,H,H,H,T,...\}$. I can consider that I have only one draw for each $t$ on a discrete and regular time grid. How would you model this? I'm thinking of something like a Kalman filter adapted to the fact that hidden variable is $\theta$ and keeping the binomial likelihood. What could I use to model $P(\theta(t+1)|\theta(t))$ to keep inference tractable? Edit following answers (thanks!) : I would like to model $\theta(t)$ as a Markov Chain of order 1 like it is done in HMM or Kalman filters. The only assumption I can make is that $\theta(t)$ is smooth. I could write $P(\theta(t+1)|\theta(t)) = \theta(t) + \epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ a small Gaussian noise (Kalman filter idea), but this would break the requirement that $\theta$ must remain in $[0,1]$. Following idea from @J Dav, I could use a probit function to map the real line to $[0,1]$, but I have the intuition that this would give a non-analytical solution. A beta distribution with mean $\theta(t) $ and a wider variance could do the trick. I'm asking this question since I have the feeling that this problem is so simple that it must have been studied before.
