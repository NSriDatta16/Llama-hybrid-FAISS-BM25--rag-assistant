MOSS - Which would you choose - 120+ additional columns, or a separate linked List?

I have a design conundrum that I could use some feedback on, so I'm hoping my fellow SharePoint experts can help me work this out. I am managing a set of Projects in a single MOSS List (List1), where the "Project Name" column will be treated as a 'primary key' (at least in my mind) for related Lists. Each Project will have associated with it a set of defined deliverables (up to 37 separate activities throughout each project's lifetime), and each deliverable will track one significant activity that is recommended to complete during the project. My initial thinking was to define the 37 deliverables in a separate 'lookup List' (List2), so that each deliverable had not just a "Deliverable Name" but also: "URL" - linking to a separate non-MOSS wiki, where the user can find more info on how to accomplish the deliverable "Description" - to give a quick explanation of what the deliverable means (without having to send the user off to a separate server to get any details) "Project phase" - to help us filter and sort the deliverables into the order in which they're required to be completed "Role" - to identify the primary project role that owns completion of the deliverable Then I would create individual items in another List (List3), each of which was associated with (1) the Project and (2) the 'template' item in the 'deliverables lookup List', so that we could track additional these per-project/per-deliverable fields: "Completion date" - date when deliverable was finished (if ever) "How dispositioned" - a drop-down list, from which the user can choose states such as "completed", "postponed", "n/a" or "still in process" "Notes" - free-form text to record more explanations/rationale on what was done and why The one major problem with this approach is that Microsoft's best practices guidance strongly discourages MOSS Lists with > 2000 items in the List. Even if we never added more deliverables to each Project, I'm afraid that we'll scale beyond 54 projects (which how many I'm "allowed" = 2000/37) in very short order. Creating multiple instances of List3 is theoretically possible, but strikes me as a nightmare to automate (as my set of tracked Projects grows). The first alternative I can think of is to pre-define 37 additional columns in the Projects list, plus the (37 x 3) columns needed to enable the "date", "disposition" and "notes" fields that the users will need to track for each deliverable. Plus having to manage a brittle configuration/design of each of the SPD Forms & web part Pages that I'd like to use to "pretty up" the UI for all this data entry & data management. Another alternative someone suggested to me is to create sub-Sites for each Project, and list the project's deliverables in a single List in the project's sub-Site. Seems awfully heavyweight to me, and I'm considering this only as my last resort. How would any of you pull this off in MOSS (without relying on an outside database, or any code that would have to be installed to the server)? Is there some trick to making this work, that isn't obvious from the usual MOSS List functionality? Is there some hidden feature of MOSS I should use? Some neat aspect of SharePoint Designer I haven't discovered yet? I have to believe that many others have faced this same limitation, and have figured out some way to make it work. I'd appreciate any ideas you folks can suggest - thanks in advance!
