I am by no means an expert, but found this while looking into this problem for my own work. https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/tr_217.pdf In a nutshell, they used grouped lasso (reference below) on the variables, where a "group" of variables actually refers to the same variable, but "grouped" across the imputed datasets. ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Manuscripts/buhlmann/lukas-sara-peter.pdf I have also seen somewhere that you just average the zeros in like any other estimate. I'll post a reference if I find one.
