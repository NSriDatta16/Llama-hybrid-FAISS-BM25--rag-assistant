PyCrypto uses .pyd files for its native code, which are in the same folder as the Python files. I don't believe that IronPython supports that arrangement. Ideally you only want to implement the native parts of PyCrypto so that you can leverage the existing Python package. One option could be to create a single module (say IronPyCrypto ) with the necessary classes and modify the __init__.py files in PyCrypto to say # for the Hash package if sys.platfrom == 'cli': from IronPyCrypto import MD2, MD4, SHA256 You lose complete compatibility with the PyCrypto source, but at least it will work.
