I think this is an interesting post. My suggestion would be to average the three data points to get a smooth time series to fit. As you point out, if you do this ignoring that you took the average of three observations, you are throwing away information. But for each time point, you can sum the squared deviations from the mean. Pool those sums of squares over all the time periods and divide by n-1 where n is the total number of points used in the calculation. If you have a model with a time series structure (e.g. trends, seasonal component, AR dependence structure) this calculation could be an independent and unbiased estimate of the variance of the error term in the model.
