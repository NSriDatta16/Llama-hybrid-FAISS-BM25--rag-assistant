They're different. It is valid to estimate the coefficients by using absolute loss: $L(y, \hat y) = \sum_i \vert y_i - \hat y_i\vert$ . This results in a nonlinear estimate of $\beta$ , yet the model is linear. (This explicitly models the median of the conditional distribution, not the mean, but empirical median could be a perfectly reasonable way to estimate the population mean.) If we have a nonlinear model, like a logistic regression, nothing keeps us from estimating the parameters linearly, though I have a hard time believing that any such estimate would be reasonable e.g., calculate the logistic regression $\hat\beta$ as you would in OLS: $\hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ . Your predictions might not be so good, but that is a linear estimator of $\beta$ .
