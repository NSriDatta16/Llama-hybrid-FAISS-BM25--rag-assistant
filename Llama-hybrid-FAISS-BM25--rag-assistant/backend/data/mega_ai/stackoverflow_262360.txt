I'm with you. Fussy attention to detail is a pain in the neck and has limited value. Once upon a time, disk was a precious commodity and we used to sweat bullets to optimize it. The price of storage has fallen by a factor of 1,000, making the time spent on squeezing every byte less valuable. If you use only CHAR fields, you can get fixed-length rows. This can save some disk real-restate if you picked accurate sizes for fields. You might get more densely-packed data (fewer I/O's for table scans) and faster updates (easier to locate open spaces in a block for updates and inserts.) However, if you over-estimate your sizes, or your actual data sizes are variable, you'll wind up wasting space with CHAR fields. The data will wind up less densely packed (leading to more I/O's for big retrievals). Generally, the performance benefits from attempting to put a size on variable fields are minor. You can easily benchmark by using VARCHAR(255) compared with CHAR(x) to see if you can measure the difference. However, sometimes, I need to provide a "small", "medium", "large" hint. So I use 16, 64, and 255 for the sizes.
