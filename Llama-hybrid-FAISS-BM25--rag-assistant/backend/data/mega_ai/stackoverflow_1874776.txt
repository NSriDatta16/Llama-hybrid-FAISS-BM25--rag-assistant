My suggestions: 1) Think of a couple string operations you would need to do in the scraping process. Write those up in C and then in Lua. I wrote up examples at one point which were 30-40 lines of C compared with 1-2 of Lua. 2) Try to rapidly prototype some aspect of your system in Lua and then in C to compare and contrast. Only you can determine if this prototyping time would be acceptable to your manager or not. 3) Find a like minded ally (or two or three) in your team to show examples and talking points to. They can help support you if you need to do a design review. 4) Be prepared to accept that while you might have a very good design solution, it might not be right for your organization. Not everyone wants to learn or try something new. If a bunch of 'hostiles' have to use or maintain your project, you could be opening yourself to more trouble than its worth.
