tempCar->vin = 1234 The explanation is quite simple : car* is a pointer on car . It's mean you have to use the operator -> to access data. By the way, car* must be allocated if you want to use it. The other solution is to use a declaration such as car tempCar; . The car struct is now on the stack you can use it as long as you are in this scope. With this kind of declaration you can use tempCar.vin to access data.
