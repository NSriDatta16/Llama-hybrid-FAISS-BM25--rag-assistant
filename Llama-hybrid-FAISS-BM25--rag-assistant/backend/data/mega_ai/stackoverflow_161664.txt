Also see my comment on Andrew Hedges' test ... I just tried to run a test to compare a simple iteration, the optimization I introduced and the reverse do/while, where the elements in an array was tested in every loop. And alas, no surprise, the three browsers I tested had very different results, though the optimized simple iteration was fastest in all !-) Test: An array with 500,000 elements build outside the real test, for every iteration the value of the specific array-element is revealed. Test run 10 times. IE6: Results: Simple: 984,922,937,984,891,907,906,891,906,906 Average: 923.40 ms. Optimized: 766,766,844,797,750,750,765,765,766,766 Average: 773.50 ms. Reverse do/while: 3375,1328,1516,1344,1375,1406,1688,1344,1297,1265 Average: 1593.80 ms. (Note one especially awkward result) Opera 9.52: Results: Simple: 344,343,344,359,343,359,344,359,359,359 Average: 351.30 ms. Optimized: 281,297,297,297,297,281,281,297,281,281 Average: 289.00 ms Reverse do/while: 391,407,391,391,500,407,407,406,406,406 Average: 411.20 ms. FireFox 3.0.1: Results: Simple: 278,251,259,245,243,242,259,246,247,256 Average: 252.60 ms. Optimized: 267,222,223,226,223,230,221,231,224,230 Average: 229.70 ms. Reverse do/while: 414,381,389,383,388,389,381,387,400,379 Average: 389.10 ms.
