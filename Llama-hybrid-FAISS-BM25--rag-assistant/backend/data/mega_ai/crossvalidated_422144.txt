In case you are interested in the independent effect of each separate yes/no on your outcome, a simple logistic regression should suffice in giving you some insights to start with. For example, if you coded all your campaign choices into zero if 'No' and one if 'Yes', you could just add all campaign choice related columns as independent variables and your outcome as the dependent variable and evaluate the coefficients. Note that this assumes there is no compound effect into using different campaign choices jointly (e.g. that Mass Media has a different effect in case some campaign includes Audits relative to a campagin which doesnt - I just choose two variables in your set at random in this example, no idea if this is a reasonable one). This analysis would 'just' yield insights into whether switching from no to yes on one of your variables is associated with an increase in the succes change you defined, ceteris paribus (everything else being equal). In other words, all variables affect your dependent variable independently from one another and in an additive manner. If you are interested in just predicting the outcome, perhaps classification models like Random Forests would be more successful.
