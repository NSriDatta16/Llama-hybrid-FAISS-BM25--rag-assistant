True. Let me use the simple example of calculating an average of a sample $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$, which is a special case of the above when $X$ is a vector of ones. Then, $\hat\beta$ is equal to the sample average $\bar y$. Now, of course, $\bar y$ can be computed without any assumptions (what you call "statistics independent"), as merely a descriptive statistic. But, "no result without assumptions" - if you want your sample average to be representative for some feature of an underlying distribution/population, you need to assume something for example about the sampling process that generated $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$. For example, if the sample is a random sample from a population with expected value $\mu$, it is well-known that $\bar y$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$: $$ E(\bar y)=E\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_iY_i\right)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_iE(Y_i)=\frac{n}{n}E(Y_i)=\mu, $$ as random sampling implies that each $Y_i$ has the same distribution, hence same expected value.
