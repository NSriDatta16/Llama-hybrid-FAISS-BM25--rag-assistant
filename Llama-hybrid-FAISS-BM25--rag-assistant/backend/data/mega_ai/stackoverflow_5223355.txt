Firewalls are the reason why duplex HTTP doesn't work. Given the number of times this very problem comes up, I really wish Microsoft would have never created dualHttpBinding. The solution for this is to use something like netTcpBinding instead, as that one allows actual duplex communication over a single connection (the one the client creates), thus solving the firewall problem. If for some reason you need to use HTTP though, your only option is to have the agents poll the service.
