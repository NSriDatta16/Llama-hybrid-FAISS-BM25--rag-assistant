A database connection would be a good use for a static function. You dont need direct access to an entire DB object, you just need access to the connection resource. So you can call $connection = new DatabaseConnection(); StaticClass::setDatabase($connection); $result = StaticClass::getDatabaseConnection()->query(); But if you need access to the class for storage later or multiple instances of the same object, then you would not want to go static. Your class also now lives in a global scope, so you can access it from any class, in any scope, anywhere in your codebase. function getUsers() { $users = StaticClass::getDatabaseConnection()->query('SELECT * FROM users'); }
