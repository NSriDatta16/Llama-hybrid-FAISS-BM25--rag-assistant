While it is definitely a good thing knowing how to build at the command line, for most work it might be easier to use an IDE. The C# express edition is free and very good for the money ;-p Alternatively, things like snippy can be used to run fragments of C# code. Finally - note that the command line is implementation specific; for MS, it is csc ; for mono , it is gmcs and friends.... Likewise, to execute: it is just "exename" for the MS version, but typically "mono exename" for mono. Finally, many projects are build with build script tools; MSBuild , NAnt , etc.
