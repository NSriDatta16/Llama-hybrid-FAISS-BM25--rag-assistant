Close set and open set classification at the same time

Is it possible to use a neural network(or another approach) to classify image based on trained data and at the same time if new image classes are introduced in the test set it should classify those unseen images(open set data) to new classes(kind of telling me which new class this new unseen data belongs to?) on which training is not done.
