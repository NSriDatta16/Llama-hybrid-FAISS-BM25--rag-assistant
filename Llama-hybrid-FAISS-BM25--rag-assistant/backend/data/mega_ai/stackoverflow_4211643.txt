Simulate gravity ^^ you mario will have a delta to control its move on X, then make it 2D vect that will include a Y componnent this Y will always have a -gravity add to the vertical acceleration. this way when your jumping you'll have the forward the jumping force+the gravity that will progressively drag mario back down giving you your arc
