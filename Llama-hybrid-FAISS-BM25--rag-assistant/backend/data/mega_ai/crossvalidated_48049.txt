Don't you do a logit transform to make the variable ranging from minus infinity to plus infinity? I am not sure if data having 0 and 1 should be a problem. Is that showing any error message? By the way, if you only have proportions your analysis will always come out wrong. You need to use weight=argument to glm with the number of cases. If nothing works, you can use a median split or a quartile split or whatever cut point you think appropriate to split out the DV into several categories and then run an Ordinal logistic regression instead. That may work. Try these things. I don't think personally that adding 0.001 to the zeros and taking 0.001 from the ones is a too bad idea, but it has some problems which will be discussed later. Just think, why don't you add and subtract 0.000000001 (or even more of the decimals)? That will better represent 0 and 1!! It may seem to you that it doesn't make much difference. But it actually does. Let's see the following: > #odds when 0 is replaced by 0.00000001 > 0.00000001/(1-0.00000001) [1] 1e-08 > log(0.00000001/(1-0.00000001)) [1] -18.42068 > #odds when 1 is replaced by (1-0.00000001): > (1-0.00000001)/(1-(1-0.00000001)) [1] 1e+08 > log((1-0.00000001)/(1-(1-0.00000001))) [1] 18.42068 > #odds when 0 is replaced by 0.001 > 0.001/(1-0.001) [1] 0.001001001 > log(0.001/(1-0.001)) [1] -6.906755 > #odds when 1 is replaced by (1-0.001): > (1-0.001)/(1-(1-0.001)) [1] 999 > log((1-0.001)/(1-(1-0.001))) [1] 6.906755 So, you see, you need to keep the odds as close as (0/1) and (1/0). You expect the log odds ranging from minus infinity to plus infinity. So, to add or subtract, you need to choose up to a really really long decimal place, so that the log odds becomes close to infinity (or very large)!! The extent you will consider large enough, solely depends on you.
