Multinomial Logistic Regreesion with Lasso penalty in R

I am applying regularized logistic regression (in R) to the handwritten digits data set. I have fitted a logistic multinomial model with lasso penalty to the training data. I am asked to obtain the coefficients for the best lasso fit for each class and plot the respective images that have a black point at a pixel if this pixel is used as predictor in this class, and a white point if this pixel is not used. I also have to interpret these images. Data: There are 257 columns (1 output column. and 256 columns for 256 pixels of a 16x16 matrix representing a digit). There are more than 7000 observations. A sample of the data looks like this: [![train\[1:5\] V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 1 6 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 2 5 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -0.813 3 4 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000][1]][1] I am using the following functions: lasso.mod But I only get coefficients for one class ( I think) this is the output I get: name coefficient 1 (Intercept) 1.8636242914 2 V2 -1.1965085609 3 V8 -0.0404422986 4 V9 -0.4736484517 5 V10 0.0146219236 . . . Can anyone please help me obtain the coefficients for the best lasso fit for each class and plot the respective images that have a black point at a pixel if this pixel is used as predictor in this class, and a white point if this pixel is not used? Thanks in advance!
