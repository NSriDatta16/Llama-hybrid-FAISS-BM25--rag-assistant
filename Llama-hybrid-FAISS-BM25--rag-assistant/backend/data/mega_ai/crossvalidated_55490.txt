What's the best way to choose data for Crossvalidation on linear regression settings (PCA, PLS)

We are extracting features from EEG, which is a time dependent signal. We have signals of 10,000 datapoints over 64 channels, and we extract 10 features per timestamp per channel, so at the end we have a feature data set of 64x10 features for each time step. We are applying PLS to regress against hand movements (X,Y,Z). We are using cross validation to verify the results, but some of our colleagues are pointing out that using interleaved sampling from the datasets feels like cheating. Their suggestion is to use 2/3rds of contiguous data for training and 1/3rd for testing. I would like to hear the overall opinion on this setting, my intuition tells me that since it is time dependent data, just dividing the datasets like that would yield bad results (which it does)
