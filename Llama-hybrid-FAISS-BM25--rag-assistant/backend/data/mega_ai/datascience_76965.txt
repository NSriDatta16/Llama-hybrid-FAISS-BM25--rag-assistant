Pairwise 3D object correlation between 2 objects

I have a dataset which contains 3D CT scans from different patients along with the segmenation masks of a certain organ. The 3D scans have been drawn each day for a period of 30 days for each patient. I want to conduct a series of experiments and measure the similarity of the organ for each patient over this period. There is no need to tackle this dataset as a whole, all I need is to find the pairwise correlation of the organ from the first day and on. Is there any technique to find the correlation between two 3D objects?
