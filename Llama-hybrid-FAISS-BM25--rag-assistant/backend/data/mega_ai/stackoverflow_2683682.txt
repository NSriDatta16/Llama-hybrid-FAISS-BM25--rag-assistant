New to Linux Kernel/Driver development

Recently, i began developing a driver of an embedded device running linux. Until now i have only read about linux internals. Having no prior experience in driver devlopment, i am finding it a tad difficult to land my first step. I have downloaded the kernel source-code (v2.6.32). I have read (skimped) Linux Device Drivers (3e) I read a few related posts here on StackOverflow. I understand that linux has a "monolithic" approach. I have built kernel (included existing driver in menuconfig etc.) I know the basics of kconfig and makefile files so that should not be a problem. Can someone describe the structure (i.e. the inter-links) of the various directories in the kernel-source code. In other words, given a source-code file, which other files would it refer to for related code (The "#include"-s provide a partial idea) Could someone please help me in getting a better idea? Any help will be greatly appreciated Thank You.
