Partial autocorrelation and Autocorrelation difference

I have been trying to understand better the PACF and ACF, but I'm literally struggling. Have been using a series of articles like: https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-autocorrelation-partial-autocorrelation/ And even looking at the method signature of statmodels for PACF and ACF I am still not able to get it. Can somebody be so kind to make a "for dummies" explanation with some example of what is happening when data a considered? Is it correct saying, among the other things, that ACF is the plot of the AutoRegressive (AR) modelling whereas PACF does the same but for the Moving Average (MA) Or is it the other way round? ACF is the plot of the Moving Average (MA) modelling whereas PACF does the same but for the AutoRegressive (AR).
