Note: the specific answer is NO. You can NOT get the app store country. (As of mid-2010.) For general readers, the following could be useful ... it is quite a nuisance to collect exactly these code three fragments together: // to ("usually") get the preferred language from those we supplied in bundle // [[[NSBundle mainBundle] preferredLocalizations] objectAtIndex:0] // to ("often") get the preferred language regardless // [ [NSBundle preferredLocalizationsFromArray:[NSLocale ISOCountryCodes]] objectAtIndex:0] // to ("fairly reliably") get the user's chosen language setting... // [ [NSLocale preferredLanguages] objectAtIndex:0] Cheers
