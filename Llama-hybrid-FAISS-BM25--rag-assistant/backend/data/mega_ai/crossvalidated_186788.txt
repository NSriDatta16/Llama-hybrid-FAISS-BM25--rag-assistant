Why are convolutions preferred to local receptive fields?

It is my intuition that unrestricted / unshared weights encourage the network to capture more invariances than in the case of convolutions, where the weights are shared. (These capture mostly translational invariances). See this and this . If sharing weights actually results in less invariant feature detectors, why are convolutional layers preferred? Is it just because they're faster?
