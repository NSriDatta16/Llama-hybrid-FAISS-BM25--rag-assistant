Formatting text from Mulitline text box in word with VBA

I'm putting together a template in Word, using a form for the user to fill in to then populate some of the document. The bit I'm currently stuck on is at the end of the document, where the cc's are listed. The form has a multiline text box into which the user puts in their cc's, one per line. I then want to add to the end of the document the contents of the text box, but in the right format. Specifically, it should look like: cc: First CC contact Second CC contact so on and so forth I attempted to do this using 2 bookmarks, so my code currently is: ' If 'CC' box has content, add it If doc_CC.TextLength > 0 Then .Bookmarks("CC").Range.Text = vbCr + "cc:" .Bookmarks("CCs").Range.Paragraphs.Indent .Bookmarks("CCs").Range.Text = doc_CC + vbCr End If However, when this is run, on the page it looks like: cc: first contact second contact and so on Realise that the 2 bookmark method is a bit messy but it seemed like a good idea at the time - obviously this is not the case! Have done some searching for a way to do it with Split but am not making much progress down this path - suspect I'm googling for the wrong thing. How do I do this so that the formatting is as desired? Any help is greatly appreciated.
