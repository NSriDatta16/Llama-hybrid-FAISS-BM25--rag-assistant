The right place to ask it would probably be the Oracle support forums but I'm not going to vote to close since you were so nice about it in the last paragraph. See here . This one is probably the most helpful. Basically, there'll be no support until at least Win7 goes GA. How long after that before Oracle pulls their stuff together and supports it is anybody's guess. One possibility to consider: I heard talk Microsoft was going to put a virtual machine manager into Win7 to try and convince all the XP bods to upgrade. That appears to still be the case as documented here and here on Microsoft's own site. If so, you could run Oracle 10g under the VM.
