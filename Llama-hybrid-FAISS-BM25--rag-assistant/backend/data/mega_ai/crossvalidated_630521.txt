Averaging linear regression model coefficients with different data sources

I am new to model averaging and its not clear on how to use the model average coefficients. I have data from three different data sources, (say A, B, and C) and the linear regression models for the three sets of data. $ {Y_A} = \alpha_{A} + \beta_{1A} X_{A} + \epsilon_{A}$ , $ {Y_B} = \alpha_{B} + \beta_{1B} X_{B} + \epsilon_{B}$ , $ {Y_C} = \alpha_{C} + \beta_{1C} X_{C} + \epsilon_{C}$ I understand that the linear regression coefficients can be averaged to get model predictions. Is it valid to use the average coefficients in the individual models for prediction? For example, $\alpha$ is average of ( $\alpha_{A}$ , $\alpha_{B}$ , and $\alpha_{C}$ ) and $\beta$ is average of $\beta_{1A}$ , $\beta_{1B}$ and $\beta_{1C}$ and the final predictions are made use averaged coefficients as the following. $ {Y_A} = \alpha + \beta X_{A} + \epsilon_{A}$ , $ {Y_B} = \alpha + \beta X_{B} + \epsilon_{B}$ , $ {Y_C} = \alpha + \beta X_{C} + \epsilon_{C}$ Can one use the averaged coefficients in the individual models? Thank you.
