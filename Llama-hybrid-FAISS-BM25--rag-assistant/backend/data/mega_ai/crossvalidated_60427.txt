Applying ARIMA in R

Small question as a follow up from this topic: Relationship between two time series: ARIMA I am trying to reproduce the above through R. In the first steps, IrishStat applies AR(1) on doubly differenced x and single differenced y. However, after applying this filter in R, we obtain the following: > ar1_12 ar2_12 ar1_12 Call: arima(x = df1$x, order = c(1, 2, 0)) Coefficients: ar1 -0.3761 s.e. 0.1306 sigma^2 estimated as 0.3199: log likelihood = -42.53, aic = 89.06 > ar2_12 Call: arima(x = df1$y, order = c(1, 1, 0)) Coefficients: ar1 -0.4815 s.e. 0.1213 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0328: log likelihood = 14.64, aic = -25.29 What can we conclude from this? Could you provide maybe some elaboration on the thought process regarding the cross-correlative structure of these two arima filters? Why is it that both autoregressive factors are -.383 in the example by IrishStat?
