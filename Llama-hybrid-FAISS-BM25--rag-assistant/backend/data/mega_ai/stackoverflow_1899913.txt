If page has .pdf files linked then a message in should be add just before end of the #mainontent div as a last paragraph for example this is default html? PDF, 316Kb PNG, 77Kb After detecting pdf it should be like this PDF, 316Kb PNG, 77Kb Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need to download Adobe Reader . or as another div after #maincontent div. Is it possible with jquery? Edit: Page can have one or more PDF i want to add message at bottom. and i need IE 6 compatibility too Edit 2 : I can't and don't want to use mouse over tooltip
