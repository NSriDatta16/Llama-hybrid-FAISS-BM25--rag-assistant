Training data for multi-category classification algorithm

I am putting together a multi-category classification algorithm. Since it's NLP, the training data is very simple with one column for labels and another column for text. However, because it's NLP, some training records can fit multiple categories. Should I iterate through & have multiple entries (same data, different labels) or should each piece of data only have 1 category assigned?
