Please see: What is the difference between Shrink and Compact in SQL Server CE? which quotes from the SQL Server Compact Team Blog : SqlCeEngine/ISSCEEngine: Shrink Vs Compact The difference between these two is much similar to Internal and External Memory Fragmentation. From SqlCeEngine.Shrink documentation : Reclaims wasted space in the database by moving empty and unallocated pages to the end of the file, and then truncating the file. You can configure a database to automatically shrink by setting the autoshrink threshold option in connection string. Shrink does not create a temporary database file. From SqlCeEngine.Compact documentation : Reclaims wasted space in the database by creating a new database file from the existing file. By creating a new database means, it reclaims the free space between rows. To be more clear, Shrink claims the pages which are entirely free or unallocated; where as, Compact claims the wasted space with in the page too. Hence Compact requires creating a new database file. Empty space with in the page could be as result of: 1) If there were 5 rows in a page and two of them are deleted 2) If there was a row in the middle of the page which on update required more space, has moved out of the page (Ex: nvarchar column update) Empty pages and unallocated pages could remain in database as a result of: 1) All rows in a page are deleted 2) Whole table is dropped
