The Jaccard index or score is often used for bounding boxes or semantic segmentation in machine learning, i.e. in computer vision problems. Your problem is a classification problem using tabular data, and therefore this metric is not really applicable for this type of problem. Accuracy (and maybe even more so precision and recall) are more valuable metrics to assess your model's accuracy.
