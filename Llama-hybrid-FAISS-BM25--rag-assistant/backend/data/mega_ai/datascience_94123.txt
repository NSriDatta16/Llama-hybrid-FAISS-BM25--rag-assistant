Zero Padding in Convolutional neural network

We use Convolutional neural network because it by design learns features that generalize over spatial location , so when using conv operation it reduce image size and that what we hope to have so we can have more simplicity in the following layers , but when doing zero padding the image return to its original size , so what is the benefit of doing this ? the same problem return back since image size will be still large . Also, CNN works well for classify images; so how it can be used in games to detect best next move, I mean how it decide the Q values of the actions from the image itself even though understanding image doesn't give any indication of the next move ?
