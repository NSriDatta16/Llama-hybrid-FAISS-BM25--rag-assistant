What are all the actions the Merlin Agent can do?

This is a google question, admittedly. But it appears all the docs have been removed and I can't find them anywhere. So I'm hoping someone can either show me some VBScript code to enumerate objects OR has stronger google-fu. The merlin agent is an abandoned Windows component kind of like Alice that aims to teach programming by letting kids tell stories. It was introduced to me in this stackoverflow answer by Bob Mc (and frankly deserves way more upvotes). In any event, here's an example, assuming you're on windows and it's installed to the C drive (I've found that merlin is on almost all computers): agentName = "Merlin" agentPath = "c:\windows\msagent\chars\" & agentName & ".acs" Set agent = CreateObject("Agent.Control.2") agent.Connected = TRUE agent.Characters.Load agentName, agentPath Set character = agent.Characters.Character(agentName) character.Show character.MoveTo 200, 400 character.Play "Surprised" Wscript.Sleep 10000 Now what I'm looking for is other top-level actions Merlin can take. I know of: Show MoveTo Hide Speak GestureAt Play Play takes an animation name. I'm also looking for all of those. I know of: 'character.Play "Read" 'character.Play "Write" 'character.Play "WriteContinued" 'character.Play "Congratulate" 'character.Play "Greet" 'character.Play "Decline" 'character.Play "Explain" 'character.Play "GestureLeft" 'character.Play "GestureRight" 'character.Play "Pleased" 'character.Play "Surprised" 'character.Play "GetAttention" Can you help me find the rest somehow?
