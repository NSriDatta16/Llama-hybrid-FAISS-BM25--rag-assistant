paypal dynamic return address

I have a single product, a file that is dynamically created and I need a paypal to return a customer after payment is done to the address of the file. Simple Buy Now button is elegant but if I put into a button's code, simple browser's Page - View Source can reveal the file address before the payment. Here is a sample of button code: I assume the right way would be to use PayPal api and to generate the file after the transaction has been sucessfull but since I am noob to paypal and was wondering can this be solved in an elegant way? Can I make a (asp.net c#) button that makes post method with this parameters to paypal, so that return url in not visible to the customer?
