The imap lib comes as standard with PHP - rolling your own code around this is trivial. However polling the email is a very inneficient way to solve the problem - a far better approach is to route the email (or a copy thereof) direct to your script - but you don't say what Operating system you are running on nor which MTA your are using. Assuming it all sits on a Unix box running sendmail or similar, most local delivery agents allow ~/.forward to reference a script. My personal preference is for procmail (which is efectively a programming language for delivery mail, making copies, auto-responses etc).
