Important distinction: are the outliers likely spurious or not? It's important to keep in mind what's likely driving the outliers. Depending on what you're trying to do and what generates the outliers, you might want to reduce the effect of outliers on your analysis or you might not. A big question is, "are the outliers spurious?" Possible drivers of outliers are: Measurement error (you probably don't want these observations to drive your results): In accounting, data is sometimes misrecorded. For example 10,200 might be incorrectly recorded as 102,000. In your case, it sounds like slow response times might be due to kids simply not paying attention? Extreme outcomes (these observations may be critical to your results!): In finance, bankruptcy of a company that issued highly rated bonds might be rare, an extreme outlier, but this isn't bad data! Car crashes, fatalities, etc... might be extreme outliers, but these outliers are likely the absolutely most important observations! In your case, I might imagine extreme slow response times might be due to kids with severe developmental disabilities? Some standard techniques to reduce the influence of outliers: Winsorizing the data: With winsorizing at the 5 percent level, you would replace observations below the 5th percentile and above the 95h percentile with values of the 5th percentile and 95th percentile respectively. The basic idea here is that the outliers are extreme observations, but they're probably not as extreme as the numbers suggest. Using a trimmed estimator : This is a more extreme approach, possibly appropriate if the outliers are highly likely to be spurious. When making some calculation, the most extreme observations are simply excluded. Use estimation techniques less sensitive to outliers. For example: Quantile regression (eg. calculate median) Minimize something like Huber loss instead of square error (ordinary linear regression minimizes the sum of squares and can be quite sensitive to outliers). Use a transformation of your data (h/t Mudwarrior) For example, the U.S. economy has numerous tiny companies and a number of huge companies. For many purposes, it's better to work with the logarithm of a company's market capitalization rather than the market capitalization itself.
