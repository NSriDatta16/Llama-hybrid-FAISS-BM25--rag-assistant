Short answer: These two books are really good reference books for what you are looking for: "Introduction to data mining" - Tan, Steinbach, Karpatne, Kumar "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" - Bishop Nevertheless you'll need a strong mathematical fundation to understand the advanced stuff. For testing and experimenting I would recommend using the scikit learn library for python and reading its documentation ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html ) Long answer: There are whole degree programms dedicated to the topics you're mentioning and there is no final or standard approach for selecting ML methods and/or algorithms. The books I put in the short answer give you the understanding of how different ML approaches work so that you can apply them and modify then acoording to your needs. From experience I can tell you that choosing the best ML alg. that fits your needs is very dependent of your data and your task. Sometimes (many times) you end up testing a bunch of different algs. and choosing the one that gives you the best results according to your metrics, the computational resources at your disposition and your knowledge.
