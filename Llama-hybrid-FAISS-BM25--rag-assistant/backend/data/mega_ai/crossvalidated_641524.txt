Does a Fixed Effect necessarily mean a Fixed-Slope model in a Mixed Effects Model for Repeated Measures?

I'm trying to understand what "fixed effects" means in the following paragraph. "The SF-36v2 PCS score change from baseline to month 9 was analyzed as prespecified, using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed-effect model for repeated measures, including fixed effects for randomization strata, treatment group, categorical time point, and the treatment group Ã— time point interaction, with the baseline value included as a covariate." Does the Fixed Effect in this case mean they are employing a Fixed Slope model? Would this also mean they are using a Random Intercept + Fixed Slope model (although it isn't explicitly stated) In general, whenever something is considered as a fixed-effect would it be analyzed with a fixed-slope model (in linear models)? Is fixed-effect and fixed-slope basically the same thing? Thank you
