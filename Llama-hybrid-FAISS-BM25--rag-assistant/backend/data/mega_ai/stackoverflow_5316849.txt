Cocoa Touch - animating the center property of an UIView

I have this UIView that contains two identical UIImageViews juxtaposed. I am looking to make this view translate from right to left and, when the view reaches the end, instantly reset its center to default to give the illusion of continuity. My problem is that when I set the default center in a non-animation block, the passage is animated and I see my view 'rewinding'. This is the code I am using: -(void)drunkenMove{ int newCenterX=40; BOOL animation=YES; CGPoint newCenter; if(starView.center.x } I am expecting to see my center reset then animated, but I also get an animation of the center being reset. Any idea why? I have encountered a similar problem with others UIView animations so I think I may have missed something. By the way, this function is called by a cycling thread. Thanks. EDIT My problem was somehow created by the method [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; From UIView class reference: Discussion Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. Instead, you should use the animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion: method to specify your animations and the animation options. I hope this can save some time to someone.
