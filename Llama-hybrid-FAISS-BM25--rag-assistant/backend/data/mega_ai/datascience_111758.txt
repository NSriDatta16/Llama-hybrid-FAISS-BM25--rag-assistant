At first sight, it should have the right effect. However, LSTM has limits and it cannot process any kind of timeseries with any size properly. For instance, if the inputs are too small (sequence length That's why, the different inputs shall be comparable to have a good prediction, and data scaling could be therefore necessary. I suggest you to study the LSTM paper to have a good understanding about its limits and how the data is processed. Otherwise, I would need more information to be more specific about potential solutions. Note: time series classification can also be done with dimensional reduction algorithms .
