Upcasting in java

In Java, suppose I have 3 classes, C extends from B which extends from A. class X { interface A {} interface B extends A {} interface C extends B {} void f(A a) {} void test() { C c = new C() B b = (B) c; f(b); } } If I do something like this as shown in test() above: C c = new C() B b = (B) c; f(b); f() accepts b as type C since C and B both extend from A . I wanted f() to receive b as type B and not type C . Is there anyway to force this upcasting?
