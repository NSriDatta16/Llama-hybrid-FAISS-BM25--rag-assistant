Poker winrate statistical test

In the game of poker, how do we test $H_o : \textrm{winrate} > 0$? Or how can we test $H_o : \textrm{winrate} = x$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$? Winrate might be measured as the population $ profit per hand. If we think of the average player's profit graph as something like a Wiener process then something that looks very good will often be within the variance interval at $t$ made by $Profit_t \sim N(0,t)$.
