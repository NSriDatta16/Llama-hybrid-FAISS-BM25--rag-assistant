Methods for modelling distributions?

As predictor X I have particle size distributions and I would like to run a model y ~ X . I.e. each trial has a response y of size N and a predictor X of size N*M. The easy way would be to get some quartiles from each distribution and run a model y ~ X[q10] + X[q50] +X[q90] . However, I would prefer to do something with the whole distribution and not with summaries. So I was wondering what modelling methods I could try, Functional Data Analyses ("easy" and hopefully useful model for this problem) A Bayesian model. But in this case I don't know how to fit the distributions as data in a model. To recap my question is, What methods can I use to model predictors which are distributions? In a Bayesian framework how can I feed distributions as data? Thanks
