It definitely scales. But productivity compared with webforms? Unless you are really bad at webforms, it's no brainer that webforms are light years faster in RAD terms. Yes, nice TDD for ASP.NET MVC, but you have to realize that you are testing a lot of stuff which are built-in with webforms such as gridview, and all those nice drag-drop custom controls. You save big time not have to test those built-in controls when you are doing webforms while in MVC you crank up your own and yes you better write tons of more code to test them. So the gain on testability is really an illusion. I will not jump into MVC until I see something similar to gridview type of RAD. It also helps if you know CodeSmith and you can automate all the tedious, repetitive code in MVC. TDD code once, then create a CodeSmith template, then you just generate your code.
