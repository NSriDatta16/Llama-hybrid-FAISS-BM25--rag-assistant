extract all urls from a string

I have a string of text that contains html, and I need to extract each url (most likely in img or a tags) to create a generic list of string objects. I only want the urls from inside html tags, not in the text. Is there an easy way to do this or will I have to resort to regular expressions? If I have to resort to regular expressions, would you mind helping me out with that as well? :) UPDATE: To answer Seph, the input will be standard html. This is some html text. my favourite website is google and my favourite help site is stackoverflow and i check my email at gmail . the url to my site is http://www.example.com. And I want http://www.google.com http://www.stackoverflow.com http://www.gmail.com http://www.example.com/someimage.jpg the end result should be All urls in any html tag, ignoring those are are "plain text" UPPERDATE Although he deleted his answer, I want to thank Jerry Bullard for bringing to my attention Regex Buddy ( http://www.regexbuddy ).
