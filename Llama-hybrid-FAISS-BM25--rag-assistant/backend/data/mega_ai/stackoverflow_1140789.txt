iPhone view not displaying

I am having difficulty geting a very simple view to display. This view has a custom view controller that is manages by a switching view controller. The XIB has one UIViewController component on it with its Image property set. The view controller is as follows: InstructionsViewController.h #import @interface InstructionsViewController : UIViewController { } @end InstructionsViewController.m #import "InstructionsViewController.h" @implementation InstructionsViewController - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation { // Return YES for supported orientations return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight); } - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning { [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]; // Releases the view if it doesn't have a superview // Release anything that's not essential, such as cached data } - (void)dealloc { [super dealloc]; } @end I have also set the class property for the XIB's File's Owner to InstructionsViewController, and Ctrl+Dragged File's Owner to the View icon and selected View from the popup menu. The code to display the view is: - (void) showInstructions { //Lazy load the instruction view. if (self.instructionsViewController == nil) { InstructionsViewController *viewController = [[InstructionsViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"InstructionsView" bundle:nil]; self.instructionsViewController = viewController; [viewController release]; } [self.view insertSubview:viewController.view atIndex:0]; } My view controller that animates different views when they are switched, has no problems loading and displaying three other views. It just doesn't like this one. I'm sure I've missed something simple, but for the life of me I can't get it to work for some reason. Does anyone have any pointers? Thanks, Steve
