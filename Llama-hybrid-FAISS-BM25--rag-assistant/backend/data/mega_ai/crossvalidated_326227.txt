It seems you are asking two questions here: How to deal with the situation where different samples have different numbers of features, i.e. when some features are either not applicable to some samples or are not available How to perform supervised classification on time-series data With regards to question 1, it depends. Each sample does need to have the same number of features. Some models, i.e. decision-tree based ones, can explicitly deal with missing/NA data. Others, like logistic regression, need ordinal features and cannot deal with categorical features. In this case, it may be worth introducing additional binary features (representing whether feature X is present/applicable), and choosing some appropriate value for feature X in case it is missing / not applicable. A good choice would depend on the specific problem. Question 2: you have a choice of manually engineering features, or trying a model that can attempt to deal with the temporal structure of your data automatically. Most models assume that each sample is independent of the others; ideally, you would apply some feature engineering to make your time series stationary and use your domain knowledge to decide what historical data is important for each sample and how it should be represented. Z-scores, moving averages, variances etc. could all be useful here. If you have a lot of data, you may attempt to use RNNs, but in my experience it is only worth it if you have a lot of data and you otherwise have no intuition about which features may be useful. Regardless of which model you choose to use, setting up appropriate validation and testing frameworks is absolutely crucial. With time series you need to be extra careful. E.g. you need to decide if using data from the future to train your model is appropriate, whether you need to throw some data around your training set away etc. Do not just blindly randomly sample data into validation/test sets, this will likely give you wildly biased estimates that will not be useful. I would also recommend researching each question independently, both have been addressed on this stackexchange before. Good luck!
