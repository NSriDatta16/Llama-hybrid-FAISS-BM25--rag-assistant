well ... some points first: Logistic Regression is for classification and Linear Regression is for regression tasks. They are conceptually different so be careful what you want to do. Categorical variables can be vectorized using encoding . If there are many categories you may apply a dimensionality reduction before feeding the data to the algorithm. The algorithm is chosen based on a model selection process so, in general, you do not know in advance which one is better.
