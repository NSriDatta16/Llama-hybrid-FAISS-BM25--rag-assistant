magento VS magento clone - cost of ownership

Its sexy, its frustrating, its expensive? based on assumption that the primary cart features could be emulated (cart and catalog rules, etc...) --- what else is there about Magento that makes it excusive? If it could in fact be emulated using another CMS and a skilled programmer, wouldn't it stand to reason that the long term cost of ownership would be far less with a clone? Lets face it, Magento extensions are all typically $49-$299. Same Magento extensions are sure to be paid upgrades. Or Store Owner will have to pay devs to customize Magento extensions + pay again for upgrades. Seems to me, almost every remedial feature that could be implemented, in Magento is paid and in "other" is free (or donation). So i guess the question is, what is it in Magento that could not be emulated if another CMS was used as framework?
