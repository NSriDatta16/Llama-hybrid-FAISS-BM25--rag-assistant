Excel is pretty limited in what it offers as an analysis package. Of the two graphs, I agree the #2 using double-logged response looks a better fit (the r^2 would easily verify). But the best choice of trendline depends on the question you are trying to answer. There is no mathematical reason to reject double-logging the outcome, only contextual reasons. One mathematical challenge of this double-logged approach is that you constrain the response to run through the origin at $X=0$ . Now, this is probably not appropriate. We could speak more intelligently on this if you followed the golden rule of statistics: label your axes. In my experience, these kinds of "taper" peak curves are best fit with non-linear least squares. I am not sure if Excel offers a way to do this, but R does. A functional model of the form: $$ E[Y|X] = \alpha + \frac{\beta X}{X + \delta}$$ Takes value $\alpha$ when $X=0$ and instantaneously rises at a rate of $\beta/\delta$ but tapers off achieves a peak value of $\alpha + \beta$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$ . This is a pragmatic way of fitting curves, and connection the estimates to interpretable values.
