Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction: geometric/topologic algorithms vs. autoencoders

As I understand there are three main approaches to nonlinear dimensionality reduction: Manifold learning (geometric/topologic algorithms like ISOMAP, LLE, LTSA) Autoencoders things that do not fit into first 2 categories (probability inspired t-SNE, Kernel PCA, etc) What are benefits and drawbacks of first 2 approaches? Can one think than autoencoders will completely outperform manifold learning like deep learning outshadowed most machine learning algorithms in terms of performance?
