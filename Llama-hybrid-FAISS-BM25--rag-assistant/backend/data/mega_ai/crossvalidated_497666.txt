Study on Human Behavior: what is a good value of RMSE when a linear regression is performed on a dataset that represents human behavior?

I am completely new to machine learning. I am working on my undergrad thesis that tries to predict how satisfied a person will be in a specific area by using linear regression. Since this study contains human behavior, ie different person's satisfaction level will be different in the same area, even if their demographics are the same, the dataset contains a lot of noise. The range of the dependent variable (Satisfaction) is 1-5. What can I consider as a good value of RMSE here? Currently the value is 1.08 but it changes if I divide my dataset based on some demographic, ie their jobs or gender, but the value is always more than 1
