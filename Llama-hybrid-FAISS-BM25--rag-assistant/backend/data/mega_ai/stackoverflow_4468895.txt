I'm not sure about, but when I used to do a script in javascript, I ever use jQuery because is this who organise the memory and the objects. I also have to say that in more of my cases (when I use jQuery to load more than 1000 points on a map) the Firefox had a good response. The problem was in Internet Explorer. I recommend to you, all as you can, use OOP in javascript. If it's posible, with jQuery (has a great community to help). Also, you have to see the IE hacks to improve the jQuery in this 'navigator'. You could check also this webpage: http://plugins.jquery.com/ . There, you can find a lot of pluguins for do the most important and common functionality with jQuery.
