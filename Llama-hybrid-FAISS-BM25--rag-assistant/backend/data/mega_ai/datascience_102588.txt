creating a logistic regression model with coefficients

I am trying to understand the details of the logistic regression models and now I was wondering how the model can be created if you have the coefficients and intercepts. So I created a logistic regression model in python and I extracted the coefficients and intercepts. Now I want to calculate those by hand, just to see how it works. Does it make sense to calculate it like a linear regression (y = a + bx1 + bx2 ) and then if the given value is less than your threshold, predict the output as 0, otherwise as 1? I have already done it but my concern is that some of the predicted probabilities (output) came out negative and a few were more than 1. Thank you
