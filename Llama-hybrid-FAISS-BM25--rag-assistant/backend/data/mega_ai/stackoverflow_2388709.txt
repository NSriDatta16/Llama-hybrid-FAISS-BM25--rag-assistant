Starting on ORMS - Nhibernate

I am starting to delve into the realm of ORMs, particularly NHibernate in developing .NET data-aware applications. I must say that the learning curve is pretty steep and that a lot of things should be noted. Apparently, it actually changes the way you do data-aware applications, manner of coding, development and just about everything. Anyway, I want to ask if you do set some parameters when deciding to USE or NOT TO USE ORMs in your applications? How do you decide then the approach that one needs to make it valuable to your organization? The organization which I work for now apparently has made a lot of SQL and Data Access thing running through back end and I must say that these class/methods/procedures have successfully performed their tasks of providing the data which is needed and when it is needed. I think it would be a tremendous effort just to map some of this into ORM and derive the same business value that the company has for the last few years. Nevertheless, I know that ORM paves the way for applications to talk with database servers, if properly implemented. I must admit that I am at a learning stage and that I would possibly need all the help, resources and the guidance to make this transition. I was also thinking of buying the book from Manning but I feel that with so much changes to NHibernate, the book may be a bit outdated. Perhaps waiting for the Packt book on NHibernate (release on May 2010??) would help me better get up and running. Kindly share your thoughts. By the way, if you could also point me in a small sample web app which uses NHibernate + Visual Web Developer 2008 Express and SQL Server, that would be highly appreciated. Thanks.
