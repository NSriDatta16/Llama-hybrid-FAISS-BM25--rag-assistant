How is Regret defined for combinatorial optimization problems?

I have a combinatorial optimization problem, where I'm trying to find the global minimum (many local minima exist) In principle, my agent can choose to be anywhere in the state space at any given step, but it doesn't know where the minimum is so it will have to take some educated guesses (hill-climb). So far as I understand Regret, it is mean to compute your ``deficit" against the best possible steps you could have taken in hindsight. However, it seems to me that in the combinatorial optimization case, the "best" course of action in hindsight is to immediately move to the global minimum, or at least remove all the steps that didn't make you closer to the global minimum. This seems to be quite different than how I understand Regret in multi-armed bandits. Is Regret ill-defined in this setting, or is my understanding lacking?
