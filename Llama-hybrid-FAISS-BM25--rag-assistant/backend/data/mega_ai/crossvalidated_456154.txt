inverse transform method

Using Inverse Transform Method to solve parts of the problem below: (a) Suppose $X \sim \text{Exponential}(λ = 0.2)$ . Use RN to generate 20 random realisations of $X$ $\{X_1, X_2, .., X_{20}\}$ and compute their average and standard deviation. (b) Suppose Y is a discrete random variable with the following probability distribution: $$P(Y = 1) = 0.1,\ P(Y = 2) = 0.5,\ P(Y = > 3) = 0.25,$$ $$P(Y = 4) = 0.1,\ \ P(Y = 5) = 0.05$$ Repeat part (a) for $Y$ using Excel’s rand() function instead of RN. I am not sure how to start this? Is the U(0.025, 0.975) or (0,1)?
