Liferay does integrate with LDAP, should you configure it so, so that your LDAP directory holds the users and their roles etc. You can likely add some other code to interface with another user database, but I'd start with the LDAP environment, as you don't say what kind of technology you're talking about. If it's homegrown, I'd consider either exporting to LDAP or taking the LDAP interface as blueprint for embedding your own solution.
