My answer would be perl. Does everything 'sh' 'bash' etc can do in a nicer more elegant manner. Also it is actually more portable. A given version perl is very consistant accross all platforms. There are no significant differences between the Linux, Solaris and AIX distributions whereas porting shell scripts between these platforms is a real pain. And it works on all windows paltforms! Provided you avoid backticks and "system()" your script has a good chance of running.
