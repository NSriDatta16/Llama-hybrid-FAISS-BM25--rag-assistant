I think the other thing to consider is the lifecycle of the application and data store. If the data store is useful to the business it is likley to be accessed by more then one application and/or have interfaces to other data stores. The closer to the data that referential integrity sits the less risk of an interface or something else making a bad update. And while the application you're working on now may now have interfaces what about 7 years down the track? (Apparently the average business application is retained for 7 years) When the business grows other tools will be used (e.g. either by implementation into the same business or by acquisition of another business)
