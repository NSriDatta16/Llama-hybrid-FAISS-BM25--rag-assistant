Local storage is something useful that isn't available on older browsers. see Shared Objects Shared objects are quite powerful: they offer real-time data sharing between objects that are persistent on the local location. You can think of local shared objects as "cookies." You can use local shared objects to maintain local persistence. This is the simplest way to use a shared object. For example, you can call SharedObject.getLocal to create a shared object, such as a calculator with memory, in the player. Because the shared object is locally persistent, Flash saves its data attributes on the user's machine when the movie ends. The next time the movie runs, the calculator contains the values it had when the movie ended. Alternatively, if you set the shared object's properties to null before the movie ends, the calculator opens without any prior values the next time the movie runs. To create a local shared object, use the following syntax: // Create a local shared object so = SharedObject.getLocal("foo"); Local disk space considerations Local shared objects are always persistent on the client, up to available memory and disk space.
