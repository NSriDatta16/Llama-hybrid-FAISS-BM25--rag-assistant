c#: how to read parts of a file? (DICOM)

I would like to read a DICOM file in C#. I don't want to do anything fancy, I just for now would like to know how to read in the elements, but first I would actually like to know how to read the header to see if is a valid DICOM file . It consists of Binary Data Elements. The first 128 bytes are unused (set to zero), followed by the string 'DICM'. This is followed by header information, which is organized into groups. A sample DICOM header First 128 bytes: unused DICOM format. Followed by the characters 'D','I','C','M' Followed by extra header information such as: 0002,0000, File Meta Elements Groups Len: 132 0002,0001, File Meta Info Version: 256 0002,0010, Transfer Syntax UID: 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1. 0008,0000, Identifying Group Length: 152 0008,0060, Modality: MR 0008,0070, Manufacturer: MRIcro In the above example, the header is organized into groups. The group 0002 hex is the file meta information group which contains 3 elements: one defines the group length, one stores the file version and the their stores the transfer syntax. Questions How to I read the header file and verify if it is a DICOM file by checking for the 'D','I','C','M' characters after the 128 byte preamble? How do I continue to parse the file reading the other parts of the data?
