Skin Detection Classifier

I have a small data set containing around 80 images for people, and the corresponding ground truth for skin regions. I want to train a classifier to be able to detect a skin, and use it later on my own generated data, but I'm not sure what is the right way to go. I believe it would be hard to train a CNN due to the small number of images. So can someone suggest a direction?
