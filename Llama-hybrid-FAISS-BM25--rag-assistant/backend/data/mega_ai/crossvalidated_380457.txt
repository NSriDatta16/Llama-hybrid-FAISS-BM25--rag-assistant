Expected value notation

I come across the notions $\mathrm{E}[wage]$ and $\mathrm{E}[wage_i]$ . I would like to clarify if they have different meanings. Take the first expression. $\mathrm{E}[wage]$ could represent the average of all elements in $wage$ in the population. Here, it is my guess that $wage$ is the vector of all theoretical $N$ observations. Otherwise I do not know what the first expression is trying to say. We consider $y_i$ as a random variable. It has a distribution. The mean of this distribution is $\mathrm{E}[wage_i]$ . Hence, $\mathrm{E}[wage_i]$ means that we take the average of all theoretical observations $wage_i$ can take. Could I then conclude that $\mathrm{E}[wage]$ and $\mathrm{E}[wage_i]$ refer to the same thing?
