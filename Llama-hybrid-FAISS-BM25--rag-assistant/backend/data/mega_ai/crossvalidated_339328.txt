PCA is a data reduction technique. It maximizes the variance in the original variable set accounted for by a relatively small number of components, which are weighted linear composites of the original variables. It does not maximize for predictive utility, but purely for data reduction. Therefore there is no particular reason to expect the component to be well related to the outcome. Whereas there are substantial red flags to incorporating the outcome into the modeling of its predictor. If you want to maximize for predictive utility of the components, I suggest looking into Partial Least Squares (PLS) modeling (sometimes called PLS-SEM). PLS derives the weights for the PLS variate (component) so as to maximize the variate's correlation with some criterion variable, which can be a single variable or another PLS variate (as one would do with canonical correlation).
