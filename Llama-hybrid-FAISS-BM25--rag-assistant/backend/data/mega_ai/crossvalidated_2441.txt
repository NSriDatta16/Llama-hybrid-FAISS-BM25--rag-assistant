An analytical approach may be tedious and I have not thought through the intricacies but here is an approach that you may want to consider. Since you are interested in the expected number of cells that are empty after 50 rings you need to define a markov chain over the "No of the fleas in a cell" rather than the position of a flea (See Glen_b's answer which models the position of a flea as a markov chain. As pointed out by Andy in the comments to that answer that approach may not get what you want.) Specifically, let: $n_{ij}(t)$ be the number of fleas in a cell in row $i$ and column $j$. Then the markov chain starts with the following state: $n_{ij}(0) =1$ for all $i$ and $j$. Since, fleas move to one of four adjacent cells, the state of a cell changes depending on how many fleas are in the target cell and how many fleas are there in the four adjacent cells and the probability that they will move to that cell. Using this observation, you can write the state transition probabilities for each cell as a function of the state of that cell and the state of the adjacent cells. If you wish I can expand the answer further but this along with a basic introduction to markov chains should get you started.
