I would suggest reading about http query methods, specifically about GET and POST. You can pass parameters with query and open directly company page. For example: http://google.com/search?q=GET+and+POST where (q=GET+and+POST) is a parameter. Once you have page you can parse it with your favorite library. (for example beautifulsoup ) EXAMPLE: Getting number of results from couple of google queries with python 3 and beautifulsoup: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import urllib.request # List with google queries I want to make desired_google_queries = ['Word' , 'lifdsst', 'yvou', 'should', 'load', 'from'] for query in desired_google_queries: # Constracting http query url = 'http://google.com/search?q=' + query # For avoid 403-error using User-Agent req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={'User-Agent' : "Magic Browser"}) response = urllib.request.urlopen( req ) html = response.read() # Parsing response soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser') # Extracting number of results resultStats = soup.find(id="resultStats").string print(resultStats)
