After some time passed, I realized that my assumption is true. I have to register a callback to each Connection in a tricky and unelegant way. I also opened a support request from oracle which confirmed this: void registerTimeToLiveConnectionTimeoutCallback(TimeToLiveConnectionTimeoutCallback cbk) throws java.sql.SQLException registers a time-to-live connection timeout callback with a connection. The callback object is registered with each pooled connection. It is an error to register more than 1 TimeToLiveConnectionTimeoutCallbacks on the same connection, or else you will get an exception. As mentioned in it, the callback object is registered with EACH pooled connection. Due to some other bugs and/or design flaws (of course, latter might be subjective) I decided to not UCP within my project.
