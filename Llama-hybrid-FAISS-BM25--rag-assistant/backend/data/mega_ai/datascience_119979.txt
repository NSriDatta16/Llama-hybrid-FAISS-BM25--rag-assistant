You are right for keypoint detection you output heatmaps. However I have come across two types of such heatmaps. Discrete: This is the type used by KeypointRCNN model in torchvision. If you use this type of target, you can use cross-entropy as loss function. However, the implementation in KeypointRCNN is for a single instance per image region. Continuos: You use a continuous heatmap as target where each keypoint-type(for example: left shoulder) has one channel. Typically to avoid the problem of many 0s you use guassian kernels to generate the target, where the centre of the 2d guassian kernel is at the keypoint location. In this scenario you use MSE loss function.
