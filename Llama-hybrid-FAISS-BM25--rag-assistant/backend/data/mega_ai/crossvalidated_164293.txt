Provided your predictors are constant during a match, it shouldn't matter. Suppose you are applying a generalized linear model of the form $\exp(\eta y - \psi(\eta))$ to some grouped responses, $y_{11},\ldots,y_{1n_1},\ldots,y_{N1},\ldots,y_{Nn_N}$. Here there are $N$ groups (250 matches in your case) with $n_i$ observations (about 70 in your case) in the $ith$ group, and $\eta()$ is (in your case) the logistic function. The likelihood is then $\Pi_{i=1}^N\Pi_{j=1}^{n_i} \exp(\eta_i y_{ij} - \psi(\eta_i))= \Pi_{i=1}^N \exp(\Sigma_{j=1}^{n_i}\eta_i y_{ij}-n_i\psi(\eta_i)) = \Pi_{i=1}^N \exp(n_i(\eta_i y_{i.}-\psi(\eta_i))).$ The last equation is just the likelihood of an exponential family with sufficient statistic $y_{i.}=\Sigma y_{ij}/n_i$ (the group match averages in your case). You can optimize the likelihood using this grouped statistic as well. So the likelihood equation is the same whether you use the group averages or any sequence of 0s, 1s that give the same group averages. In particular, the same coefficient vector $\beta$ under a regression model $\eta_i=x_i^T\beta$ maximizes the likelihood, if your predictors $x_i$ are fixed at the block (match) level.
