Ordinal logistic regression: sensitivity / specifity

I am trying to determine the sensitivity and specificity per category of an outcome with ordinal categories between 1 and 6 predicted by 5 predictors. Overall accuracy is around 45%, but I want to see which categories are predicted better than others. Is this making any sense? If yes, can someone give me a hint how to do this (e.g. R package)? Overall accuracy: predictCriterion [1] 0.5517241
