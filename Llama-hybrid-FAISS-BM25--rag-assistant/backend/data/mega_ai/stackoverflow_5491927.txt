nosetests coverage including Python packages

I'm using nosetests to run a few unit tests and show me our code coverage using something like: nosetests -w ./test --with-xunit --with-coverage --cover-tests This works well except for the fact that I'm seeing a bunch of Python packages in the output. Here's a sample: ctypes._endian 34 12 35% 15-20, 24-32, 50-60 ctypes.macholib 1 1 100% email 29 25 86% 56-57, 65-66 email.errors 15 14 93% 39 How do I exclude these packages?
