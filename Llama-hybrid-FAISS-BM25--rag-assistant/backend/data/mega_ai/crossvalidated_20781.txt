Maybe this makes sense in the Bayesian framework. Consider for instance the one-way random effect ANOVA model : $$(y_{ij} | \mu_i) \sim {\cal N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2_w), \quad \mu_i \sim {\cal N}(\mu, \sigma_b^2),$$ and a prior distribution on the overall mean $\mu$ and the variance components $\sigma^2_w$ and $\sigma^2_b$. Then each $\mu_i$ has a posterior distribution, and a $95\%$ dispersion interval of this distribution could play the role of a $95\%$ "confidence" interval.
