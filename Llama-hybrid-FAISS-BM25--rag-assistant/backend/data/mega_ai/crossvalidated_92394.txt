Checking residuals for normality in generalised linear models

This paper uses generalised linear models (both binomial and negative binomial error distributions) to analyse data. But then in the statistical analysis section of the methods, there is this statement: ...and second by modelling the presence data using Logistic Regression Models, and the foraging time data using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). A negative binomial distribution with a log link function was used to model the foraging time data (Welsh et al. 1996) and model adequacy was verified by examination of resi- duals (McCullagh & Nelder 1989). Shapiro–Wilk or Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to test for normality depending on sample size; data were log-transformed before analyses to adhere to normality. If they assume binomial and negative binomial error distributions, then surely they shouldn't be checking for normality of residuals?
