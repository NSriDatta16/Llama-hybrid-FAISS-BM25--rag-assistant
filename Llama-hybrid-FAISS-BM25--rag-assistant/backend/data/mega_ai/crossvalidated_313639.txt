Seeing as you haven't really given any code I too am not going to provide any as I feel your question is more for the information & techniques behind it. When creating models such as random forests it can be hard to actually visualise what is going on under the hood but a good starting point would be to compute a feature importance plot. You can achieve this by using the function varImp(rfModel) . Another good way of visualising the model is to create some partial dependence plots as seen below. The y axis is the models response and the x is the value (usually sampled from its minimum to its maximum). These plots are neat when trying to understand how different values impact your models outcome. I can't speak directly for random forests but I use this a lot when visualising interactions with neural networks. It's quite nice to be able to hold the other inputs at a constant value (which can be adjusted usually by creating a matrix). Being able to change these constant values allows you to create different profiles in your model. E.g. I wonder how age effects the models outcome for males who smoke. The above can easily be answered with such plots. Anyway, I hope this has helped out in some way but please feel free to comment if you feel it necessary. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/vignettes/PartialDependence.html In the case that partial dependence plots are a right fit for your use case, I think this package may be of use: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdp/pdp.pdf
