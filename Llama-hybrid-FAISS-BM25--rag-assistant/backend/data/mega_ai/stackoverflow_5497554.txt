File Association on OSX for Java Application Bundle w/o using JavaStub

I have an OSX App-Bundle for a Java Application that does not use the Java-Stub, but a Shellscript (registered via Info.plist). I also registered my file extension in the Info.plist: … CFBundleDocumentTypes CFBundleTypeName My File Type Name LSHandlerRank Owner CFBundleTypeExtensions ext1 ext2 CFBundleTypeRole Editor CFBundleTypeMIMETypes application/ext1 application/ext2 … This is what was needed to have the LaunchService recognize my files and the association to my program. As far as I understand the Apple Devel docs I now need to register the file open Handler in Java to have the files opened by dragging them onto the App-Icon like so (as of Java 6 update 3): Application.getApplication().setOpenFileHandler( new OpenFilesHandler() { @Override public void openFiles( OpenFilesEvent arg0 ) { Debug.debug( "Opening a bunch of files on osx." ); for( File file : arg0.getFiles() ) { Debug.debug( "Opening: " + file.getAbsolutePath() ); // Custom open action FileActions.openFile( file ); } } } ); My first problem is: This Handler never gets hit - there is no Debug message and the files won't open. The second problem may be related: I can double click the associated file and the App will open if not running. Since I'm using a custom shell script to start the app I thought I'd have to add some kind of parameter or so. First this is my startscript: #!/bin/bash BASEDIR=$(dirname "$0") cd "$BASEDIR/../Resources/Java/" java -Xdock:icon="../ico.icns" -Xmx256m -jar "core/myjar.jar" For testing purpose I added "$1" to my arguments list - $1 is the PSN from the system … How would I connect the Event of file opening to the PSN - or is there another way to do just that (using the custom shell script).
