You want to combine two data sets where the date or time is the important key that pairs data from one set to data in the other set. However, it doesn't seem like time is available in the CSAT dataset. Or at least not in the data-file that is found in your link. So you can not link the two datasets because they are completely unrelated. It would be like asking how to use the iris flower dataset to differentiate your analysis. However, if the CSAT dataset had a date then you could combine the data. But it is doubtful whether it would improve anything. Possibly when you have a lot of different airlines or a lot of different times then it might be worthwhile. But for a single airline and a short period it doesn't seem adding much information how the earnings fluctuate. If there is some effect of time than something like a random forest algorithm could figure this out as well. Adding the earnings would not make this work better unless you have several airlines and/or a large time period.
