Easy way to add custom prerequisite in clickonce publish (VS 2010)

I would like to add Infragistics dlls as custom prerequisite when publishing my project. I've read about that: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730839%28VS.80%29.aspx But this seems to be a bit complicated... I wonder if exists a bit simple way to archive that (eg by passing URL to setup.exe or such) ? EDIT This Might be also interesting: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/Add_Custom_Prerequisite.aspx?msg=2520811 will check and let you know...
