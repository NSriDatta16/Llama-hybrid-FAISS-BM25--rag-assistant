IE6 has known bugs/issues when it comes to Javascript and cross-domain policy. This is why (amongst other reasons) that IE6 is no longer being supported in terms of cross-browser compatibility by many large organizations (why encourage something that has such a vulnerability?) My guess, then, is that your var url = "myurl" is pointing to something on another domain or subdomain. But we need more details to be sure.
