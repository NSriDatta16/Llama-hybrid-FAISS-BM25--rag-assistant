Computing the fitted value for the first observation in a time series

Given coefficients from an arima model, how do you calculate the "fitted value" for the first observation of the series? For example, given the data (called xshort): and a call to R: mod it is simple to produce the fitted values. For example the second entry in the series is: mod$coef[1]*xshort[1]+((1-mod$coef[1])*mod$coef[2]) But, how is the first fitted value calculated, which from Arima should be 1038.3884776139 ?
