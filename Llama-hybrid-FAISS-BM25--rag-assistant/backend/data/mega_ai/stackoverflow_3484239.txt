If we assume that this values you retrive form database |sale_id | home_id | agent_id | customer_id | | 1 | 10 | 100 | 1000 | | 2 | 20 | 200 | 2000 | | 3 | 30 | 300 | 3000 | the xml a the end look like this 1010100100020003000 And after all You are tying to create a XML file from this. What You should read about: First about the ResultSet , i really doubt that those id are string not numbers. next the class StringBuilder , the way you concat strings is wrong because strings is inmutable. And for sure you should look about the Java API for XML
