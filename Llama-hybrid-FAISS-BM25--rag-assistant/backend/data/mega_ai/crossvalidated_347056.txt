A proportion does not contain information that can be directly plugged into the 'definition' of a standard deviation, but a commonly used approximate method for calculation of a confidence interval for binomial proportions includes a formula that can be used as an approximation of the standard deviation. See here: Variance of sample proportion decreases with n but of a count increases with n - why? Note, however, that the approximate confidence intervals often have pretty bad coverage. I have argued that different methods should be used. See here: Putting a confidence interval on the mean of a very rare event
