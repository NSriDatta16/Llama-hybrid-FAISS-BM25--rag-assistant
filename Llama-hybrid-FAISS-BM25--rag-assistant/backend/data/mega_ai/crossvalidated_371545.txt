There are ways of learning the structure of a Bayesian network from the data. So the answer to your question is positive. I’m reading Judea Pearl’s Book: Probabilistic Reasoning in intelligent systems; I haven’t reach the chapter where he explains the methods for what you are asking but I know there is a chapter about that. The chapter is: Ch. 8 - Learning Structure From Data Courseras’s course on probabilistic graphical models by Daphne Koller also has a lesson on that. She also has a book on the topic which is more recent than Judea’s and also includes a chapter that may be what you are asking for: Ch. 18 - Structure Learning in Bayesian Networks
