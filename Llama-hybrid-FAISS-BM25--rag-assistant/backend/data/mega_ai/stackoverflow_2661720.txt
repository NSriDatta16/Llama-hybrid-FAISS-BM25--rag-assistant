When it created Java, Sun established a convention that package names should be constructed starting with the reversed domain names of the company or individual creating the package. Because DNS guarantees that domain names are unique (i.e. given to only one organization or person), this avoids duplication. So Java packages by Microsoft have names starting with com.microsoft , those from Sun are com.sun and so on.
