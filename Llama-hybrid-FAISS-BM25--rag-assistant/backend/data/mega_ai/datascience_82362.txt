The base of any experiment or model for a machine learning problem is data. While not similar there are many models which channel faces into aging them and lowering them. This problem statement is quite similar where in one wants to know the effect a voice would have (or no effect) with the aging of a person. If you could collect audio files of peoples voices from now and before I guess you can reach a certain level of accuracy. You could start by collecting voices of singers who have been singing for a long time. While no one sings at 90 years of age professionally you can surely work from 18 - 60 years. You should also look up on GAN's as this will be the base of your model. You could also try to hard code a few aspects by studying the statistical variations of voices in terms of pitch, modulation etc.
