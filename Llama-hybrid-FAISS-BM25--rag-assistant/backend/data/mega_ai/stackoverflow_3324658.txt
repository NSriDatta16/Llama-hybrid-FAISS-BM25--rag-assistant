How to filter custom content type nodes using ajax in Drupal?

I'm in a situation where I think I need to create my own custom search module. What I'm trying to do is make a page with a list of all my nodes in the node type - let's call it 'Beer'. So I want to be able to filter through the beers in a fashion similar to the one you find on the Apple Trailers page ( http://trailers.apple.com/ ). I tried using Views 2 but ran it to a few problems: I can't make the filter links like in the top of the trailers page (exclusive, just HD etc.) The search function will only search one field (Exposed field "Beer title" but I also want it to search for manufacturer and other things. I'm aware of a couple of solutions: I could fix the last problem by using the Computed Field Module where I could combine the fields I want to search through. I just don't see this as a very elegant solution. I could make my own module and create my own database queries where I apply the relevant filters (I just don't know how). I could somehow use my already installed Solr module. So the first solution - the easiest I guess but also kind of bad with duplicate content in my database. The second solution - the best (maybe) - problem: I'm too dumb. The third solution - Solr seems pretty cool but would I be able to present my beer nodes with just the title and a picture? So I guess my question is. Which one of the three would you use? Or what other solutions could I potentially use (I'm confident there are things I haven't thought of :))?
