You are doing a cohort analysis which suggests that you are following a specific set of users, but you say the data represents "all visits by year/week." Can you describe the data more? If you're not limiting this to a specific set of users, then over time wouldn't you expect to see more one-time visitors? If you're not limiting this to a specific set of users, then you are not doing a cohort analysis. But I suspect that's not the issue. Also, if you're not already, it might be a good idea to constrain your analysis (or do a separate analysis) focusing on cohorts of first-time visitors to the site. This is a kind of survival analysis: you say that you would expect an increasing slope over time, but I think it makes sense to expect the slope to be generally decreasing for any site. An increasing slope would mean that you have more people coming back for week two than week one, but presumably your best performance for week two would be to retain everyone who visited in week one, and realistically you're going to lose a few people. Looking further down stream, an increasing slope means that, looking at a specific group of people, more people from that group visited the site 5 months later than the week after their first visit. That'd be a pretty unusual expectation for a website. The question is: at what value does the slope begin to plateau? This describes your consistent userbase. Regarding those two rows with high values in week one, I'd suggest the following possibilities: Those weeks your website presented especially interesting articles and brought a large percentage of users back the next week due to interest in your site. Those were actually "slow news" weeks that brought fewer one-time visitors to the site than normal, and those high percentages indicate that a disproportionate number of the visitors that week are users of the site who would have come back again the following week anyway. You had a slow week followed by a high traffic week due to some interesting content. Many users were brought back to your website not due to the week 0 content but due to the week 1 content, i.e. their week 1 visit was actually independent of their week 0 visit. If you shift the values for 201401 over 1 and treat week 1 as week 0, the values line up reasonably well with the other weeks. This does not hold for 201348. I originally thought option 2 was more likely, but if it were the case we'd anticipate that high percentage to trickle over into the following weeks, not just week one. So I'd check the traffic you got those weeks and see if maybe your site published any particularly popular content those weeks. It's going to take some domain knowledge to really interpret this data, and it's your website not mine. For your purposes, I don't think it would be unreasonable to take the mean down each column, giving the average retention N weeks out for each week. If you discount the first week as an outlier and then consider only out to a time period where you have at least 5 data points to consider (ignoring week 1), you'll observe a decay in retention out to week 8 where it hits about 2.7% percent. I don't think taking the linear slope for each week as you have done makes much sense since your data isn't linear. If you really want you can fit a non-linear regression to your data, but I'm not sure how useful such a model would be to you. Alternatively, you could keep tabs on the week 1, week 2 (... however far back you want to go) retention rates over time to try and determine the overall change in (new user?) retention for your site. It looks like the trend in these statistics is generally a decline, so maybe you should be concerned. If you wanted to plot a linear regression down each week (i.e. treating each column as a data series) I think that would make more sense than across rows. If you do this, you might want to start your regression at 201352 or 201402 since these weeks seem to be the start of your most consistent trend.
