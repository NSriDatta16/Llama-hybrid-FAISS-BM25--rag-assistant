Target data values are not evenly distributed

Data nature: I have features with 10 numeric type, and other 10 categorical, with a lot of values, at the end, using one-hot encoding I got a matrix of 600 columns. My problem is with accuracy which is 0.7, knowing that other peers got more that 0.9. Problem: Target data is binary, and is not evenly distributed at all. Trying blindly after pre-processing from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression and sklearn.svm scored using roc_auc_score : .7 and .75 . Back to basics, I run this train['cible'].value_counts() / train['cible'].count() and got 1 0.970791 0 0.029209 Name: cible, dtype: float64 Quite interesting I think, but how can I improve accuracy. Any hints ? Note: I will edit and add False Positive Rate and True Positive Rate as I lost output, after scaling, missing data imputation and retraining the model which takes couple of hours.
