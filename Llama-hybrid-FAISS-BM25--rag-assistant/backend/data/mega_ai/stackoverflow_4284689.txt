Re your comment clarifying that you're planning to use the iframe as the target for a form submission: I would use an empty document on the server that sends back a 204 no content . It avoids "mixed content" warnings in IE and HTTPS mode Unnecessary errors because a client doesn't understand the javascript: protocol and other exotic shenanigans. It's also valid HTML. So what if it generates an extra request? Set the caching headers right, and there will be only one request for each client.
