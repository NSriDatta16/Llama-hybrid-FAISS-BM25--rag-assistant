I think that you are reading a bit too much into an heuristic introduction to why the m-out-of-n bootstrap might make sense.* I don't see anything "counterintuitive" as I read the first quotation. What I see is a simple re-statement of something like what you know about the standard error of the mean, were you to estimate the mean by bootstrapping with $m \ne n$ . At a constant finite population variance, the standard error of the mean will be smaller based on a larger number of observations, and larger if based on a smaller number of observations. The classical central limit theorem at work here is based on an assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) observations, but there are extensions to some types of dependences that have similar implications for the relationship between sample size and variability of estimates. The second quote explicitly looks at what might be found with particular types of dependencies. That's an interesting and instructive contrast from the (implied) IID situation of the first quote. The second quote doesn't seem, however, to apply directly to your use case, which I understand to have IID $(X,Y)$ pairs as observations. Quoting from farther down in that section of the book: an m -out-of- n bootstrap with m n ... also works in independent cases ... when estimating the asymptotic behavior of the maximum of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of random variables. That seems to fit your use case. An important consideration is finding an appropriate value of m in that situation. If your colleagues followed, for example, Bickel and Sakov, " On The choice of m in the m out of n bootstrap and confidence bounds for extrema ," Statistica Sinica 18(2008), 967-985, I don't see that a reviewer should question your statistical rationale. *Should Michael Chernick come across this, perhaps he could weigh in on what he and his co-author meant. Quotes in the question and this answer can be found in: Michael R. Chernick and Robert A. LaBudde, " An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R ," Wiley, 2011.
