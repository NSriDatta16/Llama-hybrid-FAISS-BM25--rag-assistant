Ok after hours and hours of playing with this I have come up with one solution that works. Because I am using the standard WPF webbrowser I know I can also use the "Extended Event Attributes" that Microsoft introduced for Internet Explorer. The event I am using to disable dropping files onto the control is ondragover. Essentially I just cancel the event whenever it happens like so. This is not really ideal - but what is good about this technique is that it allows for a whole host of other properties to be set that are not available directly from managed code. For the scrollbar state, which is not exposed in managed code, can be set this way.
