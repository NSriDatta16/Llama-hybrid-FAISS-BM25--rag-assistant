Parsing URL string in Ruby

I have a pretty simple string I want to parse in ruby and trying to find the most elegant solution. The string is of format /xyz/mov/exdaf/daeed.mov?arg1=blabla&arg2=3bla3bla What I would like to have is : string1: /xyz/mov/exdaf/daeed.mov string2: arg1=blabla&arg2=3bla3bla so basically tokenise on ? but can't find a good example. Any help would be appreciated.
