Not quite an answer - but the best I've got - is to assume that your average FTP server is going to act like linux. In this case, it seems that the time is replaced by the year in 6 month delay. e.g. today - March 22nd 2011 - I've found some files on a linux server like this: drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 16 2010 blahdir -rw-r----- 1 user user 0 Sep 27 11:05 blahfile
