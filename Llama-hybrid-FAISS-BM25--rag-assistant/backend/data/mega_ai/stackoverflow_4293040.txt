Some thoughts There is no guarantee that an IP address corresponds to one person. Somtimes an entire village is seen from a single IP address. Also a usual internet connection has a dynamic IP address that can change any time. Conclusion: Diffrentiating users by IP addresses is useless. You may try to filter the multi-account players by checking for suspicious activities, but that may also not be of much help, since it would be hard to distinguish friends just playing together from real cheaters. All in all, this is a problem to which no effective solution exists. By the way, some games (for example EVE Online) encourage people having multiple accounts. Maybe you shouldn't worry about it either.
