Yucko. There are a few issues: Can't 'skin' the app - move to a totally new presentation like Flex, desktop forms, etc. You prevent graphic designers or UI experts from working in an environment that's productive for them. If you mix your HTML storage (some in templates, some in the db, some in app code), it's absolutely awful to track down UI issues. No IDE DOM/layout validation You can't preview or prototype without running the db.
