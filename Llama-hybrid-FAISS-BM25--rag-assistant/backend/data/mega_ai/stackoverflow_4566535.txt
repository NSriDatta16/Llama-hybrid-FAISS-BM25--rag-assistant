While there is no benefit over doing it Selsaek's way (above), one way to do it is with a bit mask (a set of constants which are powers of 2, and one storage variable). You OR the storage variable with the constant, and then when you AND the two together later, a nonzero result means the flag was tripped. No reason you can't use an array to store the flag and the text: $WARNING_MASK = array('name' => 1, 'email' => 2, 'phone' => 4); $warningflag = 0; to set a flag an error (you OR the storage variable with a constant): $warningflag = $warningflag | $WARNING_MASK['name']; to test for an error (you AND the storage value with the constant): if ($warningflag & $WARNING_MASK['name']) {}
