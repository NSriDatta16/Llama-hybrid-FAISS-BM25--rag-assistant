You can consider EC2 (the part of AWS you would be using for doing the actual computations) as nothing more than a way to rent computers programmatically or through a simple web interface. If you need a lot of machines and you intend to use them for a short period of time, then AWS is probably good for you. However, there's no magic bullet. You will still have to pick the right software to install on them, load the data either in EBS volumes or S3 and all the other boring details. Also be advised that EC2 instances and storage are relatively expensive. Be prepared to pay 5-10x more than you would pay if you actually owned the machine/disks and used it for say 3 years. Regarding your problem, I sincerely doubt that a modern computer is not able to process a 3 gigabyte xml file. In fact, I just indexed all of stack overflow's posts.xml in SOLR on my workstation and it all went swimmingly. Are you using a SAX-like parser? If not, that will help you more than all the cloud services combined.
