Getting SHOUTcast metadata on the Mac

I'm creating an application in Objective-C and I need to get the metadata from a SHOUTcast stream. I tried this: NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://202.4.100.2:8000/"]; NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:URL]; [request addValue:@"1" forHTTPHeaderField:@"icy-metadata"]; [request addValue:@"Winamp 5/3" forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"]; [request addValue:@"audio/mpeg" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"]; [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest:request delegate:self]; I would have to get the headers from this request in order to get the information, right? Unfortunately it keeps returning these headers: Date = "17 Apr 2010 21:57:14 -0200"; "Max-Age" = 0; What I'm doing wrong?
