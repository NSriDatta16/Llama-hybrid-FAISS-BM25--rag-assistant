I recommend looking at Exercise 3.15 of the freely-available textbook Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by MacKay. When spun on edge 250 times, a Belgian one-euro coin came up heads 140 times and tails 110. 'It looks very suspicious to me', said Barry Blight, a statistics lecturer at the London School of Economics. `If the coin were unbiased the chance of getting a result as extreme as that would be less than 7%'. But do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair? The example is worked out in detail on pp. 63-64 of the textbook. The conclusion is that the $p$-value is $0.07$, but the Bayesian approach gives varying levels of support for either hypothesis, depending on the prior. This ranges from a recommended answer of no evidence that the coin is biased (when a flat prior is used) to an answer of no more than $6:1$ against the null hypothesis of unbiasedness, in the case that an artificially extreme prior is used.
