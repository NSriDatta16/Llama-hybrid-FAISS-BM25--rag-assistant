Machine Learning for user modelling

I have a dataset where each row is a interaction of a user with a content. I have user's features to represent the user (each user is uniquely represented through user.id): user.id, user.nationality, user.company, user.role and content's feature: content.id, content.type, content.activity.. My goal is to use ML techniques to predict a content (given by a user.id). My main problem is that, for a new prediction, I have the features of the user, but I do not have the features of the new content.
