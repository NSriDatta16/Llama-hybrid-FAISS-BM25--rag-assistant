This will happen if the most important feature is highly correlated with some other features. It seems violate the tree based model features selection rules-it should immune to collinearity, but the colsample_bytree (colsample_bytree is a parameter in xgboost) is random select features, so it will select them both, but if you remove the redundant one, the result's changes is insignificant. colsample_bytree: subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. Default: 1
