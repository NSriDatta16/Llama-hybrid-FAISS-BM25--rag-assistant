Generic Java SAML 2.0 token consumer API

I've already implemented a Java Servlet Filter that consumes tokens from a PingFederate (PF) server using the PF supplied Java API. This makes my application able to serve the Service Provider application in a PF SSO setup. PingFederates API allows me to do simple things like this: Agent agent = new Agent("agent-config.txt"); MultiMap multiUserInfo = agent.readTokenToMultiMap(request); MultiMap will be a map of the attributes of the token, or null if no token was passed to the request parameters. All I have to do now is map the attributes to my applications User model. agent-config.txt is a file generated by PingFederate when configuring it. Different clients are now asking for similar SSO solutions to this, but using different SAML implementations. Do you know about a generic API that will do similar things but be able to consume tokens from more than one SAML implementation? Does anyone know if it's possible to use PFs API to consume tokens from other SAML implementations, such as ADFS, OpenSAML?
