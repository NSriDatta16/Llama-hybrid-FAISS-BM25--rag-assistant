In this case, rely instead on the rule of thumb for logistic regression: you need 10-20 cases with the least frequent outcome per predictor variable in your model. With only 5 such cases, you perhaps should not be modeling this way at all. In general, these tests will give the same result in the limit of a large number of cases, but there's no rule about how many is "large." My sense is that with a small number of cases the likelihood ratio (LR) test may be more reliable than the Wald test, which assumes a normal distribution of parameter value estimates. In your case, at least, the LR test has produced what seems to be the most reliable result.
