How about: lazy => 1, default => sub { confess "not set" }, You might want to throw in a predicate, too: predicate => 'has_optional_attr', so you can find out if it's set without dying. There's also MooseX::LazyRequire , which lets you say just: use MooseX::LazyRequire; has 'optional_attr' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'MyCoolType', lazy_required => 1, ); Under the hood, it uses the same trick I suggested, but it looks more elegant in your class.
