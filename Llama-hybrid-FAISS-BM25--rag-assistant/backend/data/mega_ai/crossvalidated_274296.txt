Removing "uninteresting" segments of data to make model fit better

The data: Daily percentage of time spent watching TV. Data from 25 people. The model: Regression on response variable using covariate effects and random effects. Question: 4 of the people present in the data do not watch TV at all during a regular week. There are only positive values during the weekends. Is it all right to omit these 4 people from the data, so that a model can be fitted on the data? Otherwise, there's too many zeroes for my model to handle. Could I delete them based on the argument "we want to study the people who regularly watch TV, and what their tendencies are. These 4 people do not regularly watch TV, and therefore we are not interested in their behavior"? Is there perhaps some other model I can fit on data prior to by main model which I can use to formally disregard these patients? For example, I was thinking of using logistic regression where I average the percentages of every patient from an entire week, and then encode it as either "0" or "1" if its lower or higher than some set limit. Then I perform logistic regression using the people as a factor, and then we disregard all people that has some low estimated probability (again, low in terms of a fixed limit)?
