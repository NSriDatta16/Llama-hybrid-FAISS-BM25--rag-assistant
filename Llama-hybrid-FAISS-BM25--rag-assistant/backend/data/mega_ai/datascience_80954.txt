Recommended Tutorial Videos or Books on Feature Engineering Using Python

I will appreciate it if you guys can recommend for me a good hands-on tutorial videos or books on feature engineering using Python. I do not want videos or books that teach only the theory behind feature engineering but one that will show me some codes and how to do it. Thanks.
