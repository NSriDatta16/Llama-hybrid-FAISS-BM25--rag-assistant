Fetch a timestamp before each transmission. Sleep for the 250-(now - then) milliseconds (clamped at zero, obviously). That seems to be what you're asking for. If, instead, you're worried about things like OS scheduling issues making times that are not 250ms on average, or more than a tiny bit off from 250ms exactly, then you have a harder problem on our hand and you will need to read up on hard real time techniques (and perhaps purchase some extra hardware).
