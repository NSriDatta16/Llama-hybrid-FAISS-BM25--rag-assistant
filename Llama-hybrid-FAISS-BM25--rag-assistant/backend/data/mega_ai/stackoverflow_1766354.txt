I think the idea was to create an event "chord", in this case a drag operation probably, which results in a command being called? This would be done pretty much the same way you'd do it in the codebehind, but with the code in a behavior. For example, create a DragBehavior that uses Rx to combine the MouseDown/MouseMove/MouseUp events with a command called to handle the new "event".
