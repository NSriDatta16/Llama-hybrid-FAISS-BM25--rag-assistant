Microsoft VPC IE image expiration

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&displaylang=en The IE6/7/8 XP SP3 images made available for testing from Microsoft are set to expire tomorrow(!) April 30. I'm a little concerned that Microsoft has not posted new images up yet since I use these fairly often as an easy way to test for IE6/7 compatibility issues that come up. Does anyone else here have experience with these VPC images over a longer time frame to know that they will actually post new images tomorrow so there's no lapse? Or does anyone know of a good way to get this to the attention of the right person at Microsoft and make sure an image refresh happens? Otherwise, does anyone have a good suggestion on how to test IE6/7 on the same machine that doesn't involve these free images?
