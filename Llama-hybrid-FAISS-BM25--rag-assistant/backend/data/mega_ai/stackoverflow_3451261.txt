Minimum required feature set for an IDE?

What are the minimum features required before a piece of software can legitimately be called an integrated development environment (IDE)? Or to ask this another way, what distinguishes an IDE from just a powerful text editor with programmer-centric features? I would think that any IDE would need to have, at least: Basic text editing features (e.g. cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, find, replace), "Smart" indention capabilities based on language-specific code constructs, Language-specific syntax highlighting, Intellisense-like code assistance/completion, Some code navigation features, whether that is a "class view"-style tree display, quick "navigate to" ability (a la Resharper and more recently, VS2010), or code outlining/collapsing, Ability to interface with command-line tools (e.g. compilers), including the ability to pipe output back into the IDE, The ability to set breakpoints, debug running code, and then display real-time information about the state of that running code, The concept of "projects", or groupings of files for organization/compilation purposes. Any changes/additions to this list? What about features like visual design surfaces and diagramming tools? Are those necessary for an app to be considered an IDE? Separate answers for each item probably make sense.
