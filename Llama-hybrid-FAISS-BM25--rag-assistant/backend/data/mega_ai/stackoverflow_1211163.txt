You don't need to pass any parameters to draggable(). Check that you're actually including a build of jQuery UI that includes draggable (draggable isn't part of jQuery proper). Otherwise, look for other bugs in your code that may be preventing the line where draggable is called from being executed. Regarding the code sample you added, if your intent is to select the element with an id as defined in the id variable (as opposed to the element with an id of "id", as you are currently selecting), you should be using: $(id).draggable();
