For some reason when you set a menu item's title with bindings, the menu item becomes enabled even if the target/action are nil . If you want to permanently disable the menu item you can workaround this by binding the menu item's enabled status to a constant NO : NSNumber *alwaysNo = [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]; [menuItem bind:@"enabled" toObject:alwaysNo withKeyPath:@"boolValue" options:nil]; Note that this isn't the most elegant workaround, but in my case it was still cleaner than not using bindings for the title.
