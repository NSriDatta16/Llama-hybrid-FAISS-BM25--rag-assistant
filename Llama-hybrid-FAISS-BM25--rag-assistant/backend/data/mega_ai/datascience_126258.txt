No, do not remove the seasonality anywhere. The only reason you would want to remove the seasonality before training the model is if you expect the seasonal effect to end in real life. Theoretically, if you believe that there might be some special event that would stop the trend, a model trained without the seasonal effect will be more accurate. However, if you believe that the seasonal effect will continue to exist, the models trained with the seasonal effect will be more accurate. Before jumping into using complicated models like a multivariate LSTM, I would suggest looking into ARIMA and SARIMA to get a sense of how seasonality affects time series predictions. You can play around and make a simple SARIMA univariate model to predict your PM2.5. Then you can remove the seasonality effect and run a ARIMA model. You will notice the difference between the models. This difference will occur with multivariate time series models.
