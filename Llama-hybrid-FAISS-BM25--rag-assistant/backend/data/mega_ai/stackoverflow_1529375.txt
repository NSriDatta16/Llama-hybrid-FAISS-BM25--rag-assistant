Where does that data come from: Nearby restaurant searches are often performed with the Google AJAX Search API using its Local Search mode. It doesn't work for performing vague searches like "tourism spot" or "historical landmark", it needs something more specific like "museum". It's fundamentally a business search (they initially bought data from Yellow Pages, so it's heavily biassed towards organisations that have a telephone) so it won't find natural features. It's also limited to about 8 replies per query. Apps that find apartments for rent tend to have their own database, and that database is built by reading things like Craigslist.
