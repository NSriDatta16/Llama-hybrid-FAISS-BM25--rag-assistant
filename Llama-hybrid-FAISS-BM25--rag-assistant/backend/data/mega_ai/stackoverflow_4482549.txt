Bottom line: If you need Test Manager, take a hard look at Ultimate not because it has more features ... the perverse pricing and promotion policies of Microsoft's various channels might mean that Ultimate is actually cheaper than a product with fewer features like Premium Get the CURRENT market price -- do not pay any attention to Microsoft list prices. . VS2010 Ultimate gives you Test Manager [and a lot of other benefits] ... you could add Visual Studio Test Professional 2010 with MSDN to Premium to just get Test Manager, but right now [as of early 12/19/2010] the best current market price for the full Ultimate version is significantly less than the Premium version through one of the merchants selling through Amazon. The CURRENT Amazon listings are as follows: Visual Studio 2010 Premium with MSDN List price $5469 Offered price $4,989.99 Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate with MSDN List price $11899 Offered price $2,789.00 Visual Studio Test Professional 2010 with MSDN List price $2169 Offered price $1,925.99 Realize these prices were already out-of-date when I hit the [SAVE] button. If you needed any proof, hopefully this example demonstrates that you cannot ever lazily assume that a better product with more features is going to cost more. It's not just Microsoft -- this is routine. The old adage "you get what pay for" does not work anywhere anymore -- you need to check market prices and haggle as you see fit.*
