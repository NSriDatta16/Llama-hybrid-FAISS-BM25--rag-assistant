This one answers your question and also has some solutions to your problems: As you might know Innodb storage engines uses Fuzzy Checkpointing technique as part of it recovery strategy. It is very nice approach which means database never needs to “stall” to perform total modified pages flush but instead flushing of dirty pages happens gradually in small chunks so database load is very even. http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/05/10/innodb-fuzzy-checkpointing-woes/
