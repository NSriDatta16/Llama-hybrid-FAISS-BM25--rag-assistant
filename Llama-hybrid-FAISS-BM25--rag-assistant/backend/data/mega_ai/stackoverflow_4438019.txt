While this might not be related to performance as speed, it is important in the jquery mobile context that you properly add scripts to pages. Plain old $(function(){}) will surprise you. It doesn't work in some cases. When a link is clicked jquery mobile fetches the page with ajax and adds its content to the currently open page ignoring everything you put in the . [This is true as of jqm 1.0a2] There are two ways of adding scripts that will work: putting all scripts in a single .js file and link them in the head of all pages of your app and work with events that jqm provides (pageshow and pagecreate ones). putting scripts at the bottom of the body and NOT require DOMready to fire. The second way might be better for performance in big applications, where there are a lot of scripts that the user might not use (not visiting certain pages). I would recommend the first way - it's cleaner and jqm seems to encourage it. A hybrid of both might be what's best - adding a pageshow event handler thet would trigger some default function from each loaded page. [edit] see Limitations here at the bottom of the page.
