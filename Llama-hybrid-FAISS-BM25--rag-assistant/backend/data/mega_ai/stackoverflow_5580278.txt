While this is probably outdated ( I also did ESQL ~15-20 years ago), it still may serve as a good example on how to also approach things - even if it is only for you to more enjoy ORM afterwards. Also from my understanding LINQ in .NET is somewhat similar from the idea of embedding SQL in the host language - and LINQ seems to be quite popular. Extracting from this to broader CS, embedded DSLs seem to be a current topic of research, so the example of ESQL as an early version my not be too far fetched from todays world.
