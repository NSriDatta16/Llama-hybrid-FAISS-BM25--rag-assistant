Magento soap request

I need some help. I want to create a product in magento via soap. In Version 2 of the wsdl creating a product works fine, but updating the same prodict does not work, I don't know why. I can send the request catalogProducInfo and I get the correct information. Then I send the exact same product id with the request catalogProductUpdate and the answer is 'product not exist'. So I want to try the wsdl Version 1, but I don't know how to use the webservice. I have to use xml and xsl-transformation, no java or php. Can anyone give me a complete xml-request for creating a product for the wsdl version 1? Thanks a lot. Greetings LStrike
