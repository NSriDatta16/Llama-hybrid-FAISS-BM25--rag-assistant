There are a couple of ways depending on what your output looks like and what your goal is. You could calculate Kendall's coefficient of concordance. It is a ranked measure so it does not depend upon the underlying distributions. See for example Amanda Gearhart, D. Terrance Booth, Kevin Sedivec & Christopher Schauer (2013) Use of Kendall's coefficient of concordance to assess agreement among observers of very high resolution imagery, Geocarto International, 28:6, 517-526 If this is categorical data, then you could use Cohen's Kappa instead. There is a decent discussion of continuous measures that include Bland-Altman diagrams for continuous measures and Cohen's kappa for categorical measures at Kwiecien, Robert, Annette Kopp-Schneider, and Maria Blettner. “Concordance Analysis: Part 16 of a Series on Evaluation of Scientific Publications.” Deutsches Ärzteblatt International 108.30 (2011): 515–521.
