As @marc_s said, I will just want to add something. There are two data types binary [ ( n ) ] Fixed-length binary data with a length of n bytes, where n is a value from 1 through 8,000. The storage size is n bytes. varbinary [ ( n | max) ] Variable-length binary data. n can be a value from 1 through 8,000. max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 (equals int.MaxValue i.e. 2,147,483,647) bytes. The storage size is the actual length of the data entered + 2 bytes. The data that is entered can be 0 bytes in length. if you are specifying max then your concern should be with varbinary instead of binary database.AddOutParameter(command, "vbCertificate", DbType.Binary, 8000); database.AddOutParameter(command, "vbCertificate", SqlDbType.VarBinary, int.MaxValue);
