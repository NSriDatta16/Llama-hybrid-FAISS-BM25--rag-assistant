Why do Settings.settings files dump all their values into the app.config?

Why do Settings.settings files dump all their values into the app.config? Its not that much of a big problem, however, my application is getting larger and I think grouping them into separate files would help me organise things better. I was thinking of just creating multiple settings files, which is fine, but app.config is blowing up mighty big. What's everyone's take on the app.config? Do you really care about it since logically everything is grouped in your solution or do you like to have some order after the deployment as well?
