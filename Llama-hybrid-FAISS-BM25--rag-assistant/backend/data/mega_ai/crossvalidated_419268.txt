Efficiently estimate double exponential parameters from time series

I have a time series of data points, and I know that they have a double-exponential probability density function: $P(t) = A_1 \exp(-t/\tau_1) + A_2 \exp(-t/\tau_2)$ where $\tau_1 . I would like to know an efficient and accurate way to estimate the probability distribution parameters ( $A_1, A_2, \tau_1, \tau_2)$ . By efficient, I mean requiring fewer data points to attain an accurate estimate. My current approach consists of binning the data and applying fitting the double exponential, as shown below. While this approach works, it requires a lot of data points for an accurate estimate. Are there any better methods to extract the probability distribution parameters? Sample dataset The sample data file is uploaded at http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=49278196312362946370 This is an example dataset of time-series data, which are labelled as tunnel times. My current solution is to bin the data, followed by fitting. I should emphasize that I am looking for a better approach. Note that in this image, $A_1$ and $A_2$ are not normalized
