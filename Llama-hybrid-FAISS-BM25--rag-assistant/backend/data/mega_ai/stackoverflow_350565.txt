You might want to look into using DTS (which can be run from the SQL Agent as a job). It will allow you pretty fine control over which stored procedures need to wait for others to finish and what can run in parallel. You can also run the DTS package as an EXE from your own scheduling software if needed. NOTE: You will need to create multiple copies of your connection objects to allow calls to run in parallel. Two calls using the same connection object will still block each other even if you don't explicitly put in a dependency.
