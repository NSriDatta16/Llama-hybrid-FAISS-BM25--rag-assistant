Most of the times when a FileSystemWatcher event fires, I ignore the files that are being passed by the object because this list may be incomplete. I simply crawl through the directory that the FileSystemWatcher object is monitoring and perform a manual scan to find the files that might not be in the FileSystemWatcher buffer. It's not really elegant, but it makes sure you won't miss a file.
