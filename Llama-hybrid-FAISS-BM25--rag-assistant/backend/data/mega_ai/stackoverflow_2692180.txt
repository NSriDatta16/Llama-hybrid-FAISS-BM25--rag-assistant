Xcode 3.2 iPhone dev - Can't download development application data anymore?

In the organizer of Xcode 3.1.x I used to be able to download the application data for an app in development (not installed thru itunes). In Xcode 3.2 I don't see that option anywhere. Am I missing something? **Edit - One user provided an answer saying "look for the disclosure triangle". The disclosure triangles are missing and there isn't anything else to click on that responds to action. It's like the feature has been removed entirely (although I'm sure it wasn't...maybe a bug in Xcode?)
