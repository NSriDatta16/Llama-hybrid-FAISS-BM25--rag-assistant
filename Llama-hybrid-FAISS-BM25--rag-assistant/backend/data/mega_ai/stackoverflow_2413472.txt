I'm using highlight-parentheses-mode from the script mquander mentioned. It doesn't provide much of a rainbow effect out of the box, but it is customisable: (setq hl-paren-colors '(;"#8f8f8f" ; this comes from Zenburn ; and I guess I'll try to make the far-outer parens look like this "orange1" "yellow1" "greenyellow" "green1" "springgreen1" "cyan1" "slateblue1" "magenta1" "purple")) I believe I've lifted the actual colours from Vimclojure. Note that Vimclojure highlights all parentheses in the file, whereas with highlight-parentheses-mode only the parens which actually contain the point will be highlighted (and only a limited number of levels). I happen to find this behaviour useful, but it is perhaps a bit lacking in the prettiness area in comparison with the Vimclojure way. I now notice I've never gotten 'round to fixing those outer paren colours actually... Maybe I will now that you've reminded me about it.
