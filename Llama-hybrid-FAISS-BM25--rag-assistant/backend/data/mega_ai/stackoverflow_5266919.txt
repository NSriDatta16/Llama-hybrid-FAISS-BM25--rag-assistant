Intuitively I would say use the iterator, since it may not require any lookups and just give you straight O(n) performance. note that your best case performance will be O(n) since you are touching every element of the set, and your average case performance will be O(n) times the big-O for your access method. Since Hash lookup has a high-probability of O(1) you will most likely be O(n) still, but with an iterator, since you are just calculating the next position, you are (I think) guaranteed O(1) access for the next element. This is why I would choose the iterator. Plus the constant time for next element calculation is probably better than the constant time for position lookup by hash.
