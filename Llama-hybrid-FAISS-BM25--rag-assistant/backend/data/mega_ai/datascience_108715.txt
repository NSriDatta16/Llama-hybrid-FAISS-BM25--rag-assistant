This is more of a programming question than a data science question and is therefore better suited for stackoverflow. The vectorizer is trying to convert the string values to lowercase using the .lower() method. However, you are passing in a numpy array, which does not have this method. Instead of passing in a numpy array, you can simply use a pandas dataframe (which does have the .lower() method, see the documentation ) by removing the .values attribute in dataset.iloc[:,:-1].values .
