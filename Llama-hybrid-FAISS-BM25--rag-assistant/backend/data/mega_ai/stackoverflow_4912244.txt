performance slow connect of resources - bottleneck?

I have been developing and tweaking things as much as I can and know about, but am not sure where to look with regards to the following. when going to : http://tools.pingdom.com/?url=http://www.better-holidays.com/&treeview=0&column=objectID&order=1&type=0&save=false i can see the way all the resources load on the site. However, the connect times of the local resources (as opposed to the external google/skyscanner/addthis js) seem to be quite bad. to make things as fast as possible, i am using the following: gzip(where neccessary/practical) cookieless domains for static content mysql query cache as well as php eaccelerator cache headers splitting resources over mare than one domain name and some more bits and pieces the average load on the server is around 0.3 and the execution of the page(s) tends to be essentially I am wondering where I should look to get these times down. Could this be a scripting thing ? or something on the server setup side ? I have also checked the dns records (which I believe are fine(?)) using google pagespeed i have done everything i could possibly sensibly do (92 score)...and I have no idea where to go from here. Any hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated (I am - of course - also happy to provide any other info if that helps) Current Memory Usage total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 2097152 363128 1734024 0 0 0 -/+ buffers/cache: 363128 1734024 Swap: 0 0 0 Total: 2097152 363128 1734024 System Information Linux vps.1000db.com 2.6.18-028stab068.9-PAE #1 SMP Tue Mar 30 17:29:50 MSD 2010 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux Processor Information Total processors: 4 Processor #1 Vendor GenuineIntel Name Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X3363 @ 2.83GHz Speed 708.373 MHz Cache 6144 KB Processor #2 Vendor GenuineIntel Name Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X3363 @ 2.83GHz Speed 708.373 MHz Cache 6144 KB Processor #3 Vendor GenuineIntel Name Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X3363 @ 2.83GHz Speed 708.373 MHz Cache 6144 KB Processor #4 Vendor GenuineIntel Name Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X3363 @ 2.83GHz Speed 708.373 MHz Cache 6144 KB
