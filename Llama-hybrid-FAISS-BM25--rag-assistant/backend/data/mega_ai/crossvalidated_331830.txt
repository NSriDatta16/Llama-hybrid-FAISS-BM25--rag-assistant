There are multiple early stopping strategies. I recommend reading the article Early stopping - but when? by Lutz Prechelt (1997), where many stopping policies are described and evaluated. The one you proposed is often used, even though higher number than three is used. What is often done in neural network training, however, is that you train for a fixed number of epochs (sufficient for the training error to converge) while recording validation error and saving weight snapshots every few epochs. At the end, you just select the snapshot with lowest validation error. Also, note that there are many threads on this site describing early stopping .
