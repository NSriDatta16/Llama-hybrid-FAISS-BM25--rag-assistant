I found the R package 'clusrank' which performs one or two-sample/s Wilcoxon tests for clustered data on vectors of data. Details on this can be found in the following papers. Bernard Rosner, Robert J. Glynn, Mei-Ling T. Lee (2006) Extension of the Rank Sum Test for Clustered Data: Two-Group Comparisons with Group. Biometrics, 62, 1251-1259. Somnath Datta, Glen A. Satten (2005) Rank-Sum Tests for Clustered Data. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 100, 908-915.
