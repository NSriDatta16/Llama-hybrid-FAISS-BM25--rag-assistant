Both Robert and Lucas hit the nail on the head with their answers. All the "extra stuff" for the account would live within the UserRepository class. This is currently the way the Turbine ND is implemented. However, nothing stops you from creating a new class called ConnectionStringProvider that can then be 'injected' in your UserRepository which will provide the connection string (whether it be hard coded or read from a config file. The code can be as follows: public class ConnectionStringProvider { public string ConnectionString { get{ // your impl here } } } public class UserRepository { public UserRepository(ConnectionStringProvider provider){ // set internal field here to use later // with db connection } } From here, you add a registration for ConnectionStringProvider within UserRepositoryRegistration class and Turbine will handle the rest for you.
