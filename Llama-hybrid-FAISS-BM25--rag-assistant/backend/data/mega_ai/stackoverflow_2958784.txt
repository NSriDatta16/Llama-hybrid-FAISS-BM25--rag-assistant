Weird jQuery UI Slider behavior using Page Up/Down

I'm using jQuery UI's slider to update a div containing a number. Dragging or using the left/right keys should only allow the user to choose a number between 1 and 5 (this works as intended). However, if the handle has focus and I use page up/down, I start to get rounded values that are well out of the range of 1-5. Anybody experience the same? Thoughts?
