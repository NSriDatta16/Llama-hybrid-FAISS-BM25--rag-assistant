Dirichlet distribution plot in R

I want to plot $15$ random draws of Dirichlet distribution with $\alpha = 1$ and dimension $n=10$ in R. require(MCMCpack) alpha I want an output similar to the following image. This image is from Prof. David Blei's Topic Modeling tutorial at KDD 2011. I think it has been done using ggplot2 but I don't know how to generate it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
