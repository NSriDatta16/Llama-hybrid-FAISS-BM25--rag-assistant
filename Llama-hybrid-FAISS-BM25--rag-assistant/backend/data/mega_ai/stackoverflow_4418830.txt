Look at the filter() function, and particularly the sides argument: filter package:stats R Documentation Linear Filtering on a Time Series Description: Applies linear filtering to a univariate time series or to each series separately of a multivariate time series. Usage: filter(x, filter, method = c("convolution", "recursive"), sides = 2, circular = FALSE, init) Arguments: [...] sides: for convolution filters only. If ‘sides=1’ the filter coefficients are for past values only; if ‘sides=2’ they are centred around lag 0. In this case the length of the filter should be odd, but if it is even, more of the filter is forward in time than backward.
