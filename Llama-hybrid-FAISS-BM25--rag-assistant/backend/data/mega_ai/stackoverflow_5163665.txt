See our PHP Front End . It is a full PHP parser, automatically building ASTs, and a matching prettyprinter that regenerates compilable PHP code complete with the original commments. (EDIT 12/2011: See this SO answer for more details on what it takes to prettyprint from ASTs, which are just an organized version of the tokens: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5834775/120163 ) The front end is built on top of our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit , enabling the analysis and transformation of PHP ASTs (and then via the prettyprinter code).
