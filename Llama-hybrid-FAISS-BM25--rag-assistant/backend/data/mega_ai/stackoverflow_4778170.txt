Mobile browser ignoring markup and script areas (Webkit, Android)

I'm working on web app (a C# MVC app) in which the view engine renders a different view page when it detects a mobile browser. In particular I'm targeting the Android web kit browser (on Froyo). Oddly the page does render correctly on the iPhone. The problem is that when I test locally on the emulator it renders fine, and if I use Chrome on the desktop it renders fine... however, when I test on an actual phone (Nexus 1 and MyTouch) the markup is ignored and all text nodes are rendered as text. This happens using the HTML5 DOCTYPE (even using the simplest markup). If I insert an xmlns attribute into the tag (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml") it will pay attention to the markup, but this come with it's own set of problems (most specifically it seems not to work with JQuery Moblie) and I'd much prefer to omit the namespace. Also, just as a shot in the dark I explicitly set the content type to text/html to see if that would help, but no luck. I'm sure you all figured it out when I said I was writing this in C#, but the web server is IIS. Even this simple markup doesn't work: html5 test for android h1 markup h2 markup this is a paragraph of text I'm a newb in the mobile web dev arena - so I'm hoping this is such a simple and brainless issue it's something that everyone but me knows (which is why I'm not having any luck finding any direction on the web). Thanks for any and all help!
