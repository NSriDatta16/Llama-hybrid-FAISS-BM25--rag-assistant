IMHO, confidence intervals are a better method of expressing results. This is especially true when comparing results to be included in meta analysis and for "not significant" answers. This avoids the all too common misrepresentation of not significant results as significantly insignificant. I don't know in which "camp" that puts me, frequentist or Bayesian, and frankly don't care. What I am saying is that it makes a rather important distinction just how wide a 95% confidence interval is, for example, when comparing whether the 115 mm Hg mean blood pressure of a test series is different from a (control) mean of 120 mm Hg, it makes a world of difference if the 95% confidence interval for the difference is $\pm$ 100 mm Hg or $\pm$ 10 mm Hg, because when $\pm$ 100 mm Hg we haven't excluded anything practical; a blood pressure of 20 mm Hg is only achievable several minutes after the heart has stopped, and a blood pressure of 220 mm Hg is also problematic. Only in the latter case, does our result, 110 to 130 mm Hg as a CI, exclude anything pragmatic. One might be taken aback to realize just how many published results from averaging three wildly different values do not seem to be different from some assumed value when the confidence in saying so admits the entire range of possible values, and a not significant $p$ -value does not tell that story, such that the discussion centering on interpretation of H0 seems non-contributory to me. What are your thoughts?
