Looking at the current development on the market, the only reason is a bad strategy. You may try to open the product on a dual-license base, but if there is no documentation, it is unlikely that developers from outside will jump on it (although maybe the IDE could help a little bit at that end). Stipulating the change could be based on a risk vs. opportunities assessment. From the scenario you describe, I think that a central factor to be considered seriously is Human Resources: What happens if people come and leave? How likely can growth be handled? Also seriously consider the knowledge part of the picture: as an organization you need to manage a better equilibrium between tacit and explicit knowledge. Maybe try to determine the barriers for change (individual and organizational) i.e.: ability (can, to be aware of), readiness for change (want, should), shared reality, system thinking analyze them and integrate results to support a more informed decision making process.
