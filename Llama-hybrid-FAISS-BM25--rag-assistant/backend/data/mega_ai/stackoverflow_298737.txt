Why would you have the subscribers on the same database server? Why do you need multiple publishers on one database? Perhaps you should explain the problem you are trying to solve. You only need one publisher per database. One distribution agent can distribute to many subscribers. The distribution agent is usually on a different server to the publisher; subcribers can be located on the same server as the distributor. The maximum number of subcribers is mainly limited by network bandwidth and the capability of the drives where the Transaction log file of the publisher resides.
