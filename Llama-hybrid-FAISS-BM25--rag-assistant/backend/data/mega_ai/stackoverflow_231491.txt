how-to initialize 'const std::vector ' like a c array

Is there an elegant way to create and initialize a const std::vector like const T a[] = { ... } to a fixed (and small) number of values? I need to call a function frequently which expects a vector , but these values will never change in my case. In principle I thought of something like namespace { const std::vector v(??); } since v won't be used outside of this compilation unit.
