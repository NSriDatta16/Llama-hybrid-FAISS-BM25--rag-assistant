Could we explain the disadvantage of imbalanced data mathematically?

Simple setup: observed response is binary (yes/no, 0/1, positive/negative). use logistic regression to model the probability of the response being, say, 1: $P(Y=1|X)$ . the MLE of the model coefficients enable us to predict the probability by $\frac{1}{1+exp(-X\hat{\beta})}$ . By checking ROC and AUC, we find the most appropriate threshold of $p_{0}$ such that $\hat{y}=1$ if $\hat{p}>p_{0}$ , otherwise $\hat{y}=0$ . In this process, could we mathematically show that $P(Y=1|X)$ is underestimated if we have 10000 0's and 100 1's? How is this bias quantified in formula?
