Flex "Magnifying Glass" / Masking

I'm making a magnifying glass app and need some help. I currently have the following code: But am unsure how to have the zoomed "out" image over top of the zoomed "in" image. The current draggable mask will show the zoomed in image through the zoomed out image. Any tips?
