What kind of statistical test do I use when controlling for order effects?

I have two conditions indoor and outdoor and I show one half of the participants first a picture of meat and then a picture of vegan food and the other half first a picture of vegan food and then a picture of meat. The dependent variable I measure is what they want to pay for it (willingness to pay). My question is what kind of statistical test I use for this design.
