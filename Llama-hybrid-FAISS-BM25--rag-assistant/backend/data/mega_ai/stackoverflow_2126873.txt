How to separate object from background in an image?

I have a segmentated image, looks like this: // I am not allowed to post pictures since I am a new member, so only the link: // Turns out I cannot post two hyperlinks either, so I am only going to post the link of the map file. Edit: I believe now I can post images: alt text http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/917/test0seg.jpg I also have a map file that clearly shows the segments: alt text http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6904/test0map.jpg Now, what I need to do is to create a binary image file that consists of just the deer in the center painted white, rest of the image painted black. What methods do you suggest for merging segments? I have something like this in mind: Calculate color averages for each segment. Compare them and merge the most similar segments. If I do that, I end up with 3 segments: Floor (white part), wall (black and light grey part combined) and the object (grey part). At this points what can be done to correctly obtain the object? Note that object does not have to be in the center, it may even be partly off-screen. (I also thought about calculating the area each segment takes and labeling the smallest area as the object; but there may be times when objects cover most of the image, so it may not produce correct results.) I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.
