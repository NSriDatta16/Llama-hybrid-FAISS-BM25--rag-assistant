How do I add UIBarButtonItems to a UIViewController.toolbarItems property using Interface Builder?

I'm trying to use Interface Builder to add UIBarButtonItems to the toolbarItems property of the UIViewController. I have a .xib file and the File's Owner is typed as a subclass of UITableView controller ("ServerTableViewController"). I've dragged a bunch of UIBarButton items into the .xib file thinking that they will show up as part of the toolbarItems property of the ServerTableViewController that represents the File's Owner. Here's what I don't understand. Let's say I have an .xib file that has a ServerTableViewController in it which is not the File's Owner... I can drag UIBarButton items beneath it and they show up in its toolbar automatically! Why can I not do the same thing when ServerTableViewController is the File's Owner? That seems to be the only difference.
