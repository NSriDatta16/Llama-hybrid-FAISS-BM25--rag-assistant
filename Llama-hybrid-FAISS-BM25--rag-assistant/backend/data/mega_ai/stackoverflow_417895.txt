J2ME and (open source) applet signing for Mobile Devices (esp. phones) - what can I do?

I've just discovered J2ME and I love the possibilities that it presents. I'm currently working on a simple application and I'd like to maybe release it as an open-source project sometime in the future. As part of my research into J2ME and mobile devices, I looked into applet signing. It seems that people who want to create applets for free are caught between and rock and an awful shite-place. Applet signing is extremely expensive and extremely convoluted - and the expense can't be justified when coding for free. There are a huge number of J2ME compatible devices out there - I think it would be a shame to have to ignore them, and just wait patiently for the next wave (e.g. Android). I was wondering if other people have any ideas about ways to approach this problem? UPDATE: I found this blog article which summarises the problem for those interested... http://javablog.co.uk/2007/08/09/how-midlet-signing-is-killing-j2me/ I thought about setting up a non-profit umbrella organisation for open-source J2ME developers who want a VeriSign certificate (as a certificate can sign code an unlimited amount of times). I would aim to raise the $500 and then enable group members to share the purchased certificate. Had a quick chat to a VeriSign rep and they thought the idea could work (as long as the organisation was registered as a legal entity). However, since handset manufacturers now seem to be moving to support only UTI root certificates (which you can only get through the 'Java verified' programme) - this might not be as useful as I thought it could be... if anyone has any ideas would be great to hear them.
