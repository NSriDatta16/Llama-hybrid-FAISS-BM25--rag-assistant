There are several alternatives. First, using a zero-width look-ahead assertion allows you to make the rest of the regex simpler: /^[-+]?(?=\.?\d)\d*(?:\.\d*)?$/ If you want to avoid the look-ahead, then I'd try to discourage the regex from back-tracking: /^[-+]?(?:\.\d+|\d+(?:\.\d*)?)$/ /^[-+]?(\.\d+|\d+(\.\d*)?)$/ # if you don't mind capturing parens Note that you said "base 10" so you might actually want to disallow extra leading zeros since "014" might be meant to be octal: /^[-+]?(?:\.\d+|(?:0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.\d*)?)$/ /^[-+]?(\.\d+|(0|[1-9]\d*)(\.\d*)?)$/ Finally, you might want to replace \d with [0-9] since some regexes don't support \d or because some regexes allow \d to match Unicode "digits" other than 0..9 such as "ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT"s. /^[-+]?(?:\.[0-9]+|(?:0|[1-9][0-9]*)(?:\.[0-9]*)?)$/ /^[-+]?(\.[0-9]+|(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]*)?)$/
