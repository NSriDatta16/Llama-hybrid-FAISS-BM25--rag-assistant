Not sure why it has not been mentioned before but have you looked at the FILESTREAM data type that is available in SQL Server 2008 and above? It combines the benefits of file system storage with the benefits of DB storage. Here is a link to a MS white paper http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/c/d/acd8e043-d69b-4f09-bc9e-4168b65aaa71/SQL2008UnstructuredData.doc Another very strong point with filestream from my point of view is that is does not eat into the size limit of the express editions of SQL Server which can be very handy
