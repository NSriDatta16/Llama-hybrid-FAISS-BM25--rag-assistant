MVC with one controller different view folder

UPDATE - Reworded question I am going to use JQuery Mobile for the mobile side of a new MVC applciation that I am building. Since JQuery Mobile will manage the different devices on the client side I need only one mobile view for each page that I create. This will simplify the number of views required and basically boil it down to mobile and desktop views, for now. I would like to have one controller call 2 different views, with the caveat being the views are in different folders (mobile and desktop). For example, the Index method on the controller would call a build view path method return View(BuildViewPath("Index")); It works if my folders are like this but I hate to have to keep creating device subfolders for each controller view Views Login Desktop Index.aspx Mobile Index.aspx For my login controller I would like the views would be structured as follows: Views Desktop Login Index.aspx Mobile Login Index.aspx I tried returning "~/Views/Desktop/Login/Index" but that did not work.I understand about the naming convention {controler}{view} so I can see why this isn't right. Is this possible or is it not a good idea? If not, what is the best practice for organizing a project for 2 different view paths. Remember, I am looking for one controller. Thanks, Paul
