I would set it in the Load event of the grid or the page like so: var hyperlinkColumn = this.GridView1.Columns[0] as HyperLinkColumn; hyperlinkColumn.DataNavigateUrlFormatString = "~/SystemAdminFolder/{0}"; This structure presumes that the Url should be different per row based on the DataNavigateUrlField . If it should be the same url for all rows, then you can just set the NavigateUrl property at Load. Obviously, you would set a different folder based on the user's role. ADDITION Given what you have mentioned in your problem in comments, what I suggest is storing the Role-Folder relationship somewhere. You have a number of choices: Simply store magically named keys in appSettings (Role_SystemAdministrators, Role_OrganizationAdministrators, etc.) with the name of the folder to which they should be directed. The advantage of this approach is that it is simple. The disadvantage is that the data must entered properly, there is nothing to stop someone from accidentally mapping a role to two folders and when a role is added it must be updated in one more place. Create a custom ConfigSection to store the relationship. The advantage is that you can ensure that each role is only listed once. The disadvantage is that it is extra code you have to write and when a role is added you still have to add something in another place. Read the location tags out of the config file. The advantage is that you can avoid having to write a value in more than one place. The disadvantage is that doing this will be a chore. You'd have to find the first tag associated with the given folder on which the current user was given permission. Read the values out of the database. The advantage is that you can easily write a management screen to update the values. The disadvantage is when a role is added you need to add something to a completely different location of the application. You would still set folder permissions as you are doing now. However, once you have this relationship stored, you can redirect the person to the appropriate folder without having write custom forking code.
