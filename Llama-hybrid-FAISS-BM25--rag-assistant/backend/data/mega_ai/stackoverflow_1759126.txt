Some pseudocode for the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) method can be found in this paper by John C. Platt: Fast Training of Support Vector Machines using Sequential Minimal Optimization . There is also a Java implementation of the SMO algorithm, which is developed for research and educational purpose ( SVM-JAVA ). Other commonly used methods to solve the QP optimization problem include: constrained conjugate gradients interior point methods active set methods But be aware that some math knowledge is needed to understand this things (Lagrange multipliers, Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, etc.).
