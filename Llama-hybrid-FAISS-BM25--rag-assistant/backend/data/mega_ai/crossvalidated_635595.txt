Out-of-sample R square is NEGATIVE

The "Out-of-sample $R^2$ " is defined as: $$ R^2_{OOS} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{t=\tau}^T\left(Y_t - \hat{Y}_{t\vert t-1}\right)^2}{\sum_{t=\tau}^T\left(Y_t - \hat{\mu}_{t\vert t-1}\right)^2} $$ Where $\hat{Y}_{t\vert t-1}$ is the model-ased forecast of the observation at time $t$ using data up to $t-1$ , and $\hat{\mu}_{t\vert t-1}$ is the sample mean using data up tp $t-1$ (that is, it is the simple mean only forecast). Finally, $\tau$ is the starting point of the forecasting exercise. Here, $t = \tau$ is $06-1996$ and $t-1$ is $05-1996$ . I have two questions: 1). How do I calculate the $\hat{\mu}_{t\vert t-1}$ term here? I've taken an expanding average of the sample data. This is consistent with $\hat{Y}_{t\vert t-1}$ , which is a rolling forecast for each year with a training set of $t-1$ observations. Is this okay? 2). My in-sample $R^2$ is $0.02$ and out of sample $R^2$ is $-0.03$ . What do I do? The predictability of the 6 regressors I've been given is really low, but is this okay? Should I use squared regressors to improve the $R^2_{OOS}$ value? A negative $R^2_{OOS}$ is scaring me.
