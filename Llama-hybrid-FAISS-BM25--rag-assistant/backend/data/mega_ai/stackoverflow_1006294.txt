.NET library to access PE header

In order to automate some tasks I'm looking for a library which can let me read and manipulate (add/rename/remove sections,...) a PE header from a .NET application. If possible, I'd rather use something that can be redistributed without source code and I'm open to commercial solutions as long as they're royalty-free and don't require licx embedding. 64bit is not required but would be appreciated. 100% managed solutions are preferred. Edit: I'd just like to clarify that I'm not interested in ways to read/edit the .NET metadata of the files but the PE header itself.
