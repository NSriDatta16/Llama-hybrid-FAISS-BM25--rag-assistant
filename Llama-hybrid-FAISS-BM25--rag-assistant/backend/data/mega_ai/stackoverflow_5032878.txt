The page is still cached. You need to add the following response header: cache-control : no-cache which doesn't actually prevent caching. The cache-control response header's no-cache directive means that the browser MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. If you really want to prevent caching, specify the no-store directive. That tells the browser that it MUST NOT store any part of either this response or the request that elicited it. This directive applies to both non-shared and shared caches. "MUST NOT store" in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage, and MUST make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it. See the HTTP 1.1 specs for details on cache-control and its directives.
