The beta-binomial disribution is a discrete distribution on 0, 1, ..., n . It arises as a mixture distribution, where the probability of success in a binomial distribution ( p ) is itself drawn from a beta distribution. Because of this it is sometimes used as a model for heterogeneous mixtures of binomials or more generally for situations where the variance of a discrete distribution on 0, 1, ..., n has a larger variance than the binomial. It also commonly occurs in Bayesian applications. Reference: Wikipedia - Beta-binomial distribution
