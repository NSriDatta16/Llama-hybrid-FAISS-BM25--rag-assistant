Managing URL Redirects when you Modify Pretty URLs - Best Practices

What are the standards for managing URL redirects if you base your URL's off properties of the data that might change a few times, like the "title"? I have a website with lots of images and I want to make the urls look like this: http://www.mySite.com/images/132123/my-cool-image-title Now say a bunch of people bookmark the image, and a week later I change it to: http://www.mySite.com/images/132123/renamed-image-title So now there has to be a redirect for the people that bookmarked the old one... Now lets say that happens on average 3 times per image. That means I'd have lots and lots of redirects to map. I'd have a database of redirects it seems. What is best practice in this case, assuming I want to use pretty urls and not base it on some universally unique id, and that I'd like to reap as many benefits of SEO as possible?
