jQuery doesn't work in .html() return

I'm totally newbie on JQuery, I checked docs.jquery, searched on google, asked to friends, and still couldn't find the solution :( I've a DIV with id=EMail. It includes a paragraph ( Please enter email... ) and a form ( ). When visitor enters his/her email address to form input, and presses "Send" button, JQuery reads the input (email address) and send it to "addEMail.php". While doing this, shows only " Please wait, blah blah " and disable form (not disable, remove). On addEMail.php, it returns two things; if the email address is valid, " Thank you ". if it's not valid, " Please enter valid email address ... ". Returned html are shown in . My problem is, if the email address is not valid, JQuery is not working on returned element. When button is clicked browser goes to addEMail.php. To fix, I tried both GET and POST methods, added DataType: "html", checked both localhost, and normal host etc. Thanks JS in index.php; $(document).ready(function(){ $('.button').click( saveEMail ); }); function saveEMail() { var userEMail = $('form').serialize(); $('#eMail').html(' Please wait while saving your email: '.userEMail); $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: 'http://localhost/addEMail.php', dataType: 'html', data: userEMail, success: function(result) { $('#eMail').html(result); } }); return false; } Form element in index.php; Please blah blah blah addEMail.php; Please enter a valid email address "); echo(" "); // exactly same form as above } else { echo(" thank you blah blah "); } ?>
