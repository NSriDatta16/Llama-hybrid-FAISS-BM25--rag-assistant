I run an ASP.NET 2.0 application on IIS 6.0 and added .axd to the HcScriptFileExtensions list without it causing any obvious problems over the last few months. However, ScriptManager does not by default compress ScriptResource.axd when the user agent indicates IE6, but with this setup the IE6 user would still get a compressed version. You may not want this behavior.
