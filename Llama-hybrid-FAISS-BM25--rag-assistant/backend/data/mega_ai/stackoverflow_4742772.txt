Ordering@Ordering and Ranking Permutations

As pointed out by nazdrovje (see here ) Ordering@Ordering may be used to obtain the rank of each element in a list. Even when the list contains repeated elements the result is an n -permutation (taken as an ordered list of integers 1 to n without repetition), where the lowest ranked element is assigned 1, the second lowest 2, etc. As pointed out by Andrzej Kozlowski , the following holds (see also here ): (Sort@mylist)[[Ordering@Ordering@mylist]]==mylist I'd like to produce a ranking permutation where the highest ranked element is assigned 1, the second highest 2, etc. such that the following holds: (Reverse@Sort@mylist)[[newPermutation]]==mylist This seems simple, but I have only been able to come up with quite an awkward solution. At the moment I do the following: newPermutation= Ordering@Ordering[Ordering@Ordering@mylist,All,Greater] Is there a more elegant,or more intuitive, way? There surely must be? An example: mylist= {\[Pi],"abc",40,1, 300, 3.2,1}; Ordering@Ordering@mylist Ordering@Ordering[Ordering@Ordering@mylist,All,Greater] Output (note the reciprocal relationship between the permutations) {7,6,4,1,5,3,2} {1,2,4,7,3,5,6} (Both the following evaluate to True) Sort@mylist)[[Ordering@Ordering@mylist]]== mylist Reverse@Sort@mylist)[[ Ordering@Ordering[Ordering@Ordering@mylist,All,Greater]]]== mylist
