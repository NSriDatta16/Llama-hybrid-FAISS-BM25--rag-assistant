Silverlight DragDrop.DoDragDrop()

I am really struggling to get a simple drag and drop sample working in Silverlight 4. Here's what I have: XAML Code-Behind public partial class MainPage : UserControl { public MainPage() { InitializeComponent(); } private void r1_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { DragDrop.DoDragDrop((Rectangle)sender, "test data", DragDropEffects.All, DragDropKeyStates.LeftMouseButton); } private void r2_Drop(object sender, System.Windows.DragEventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show("Drop: " + e.Data.ToString()); } } The DragDrop.DragDropCompleted event does fire, however the sender parameter is always null and the event args do not really help me finding more about the event. I have also tried to use a custom control implementing IAcceptDrop with no luck. Also, when I start the drag operation, I have no visual feedback that something is happening (no change in the cursor or anything). Is there something wrong? All the samples I have found use the DragDropTargets. Is my only resort to implement a DragDropTarget for the particular type of controls I want to use?
