Any framework for real-time correlation/analysis of event-stream (aka CEP) in Erlang?

Would like to analyze a stream of events, sharing certain characteristics (s.a. a common source), and within a given time-window, ultimately to correlate those multiple events and draw some inference from same, and finally launch some action. My limited knowledge of Complex-Event-Processing (CEP) tells me that, it is the ideal candidate for such things. However in my research so far I found people compare that with Rule-Engines, and Bayesian Classifier, and sometimes using a combination of those. Wanted to know if there are -- some best-practices (ideally supported by performance data, and description of nature/type of events) to be followed, especially so in Erlang ? does Erlang have a CEP framework of it's own ? any Bayesian Classifier library available in Erlang ? Esper from Java world seems to be quite close to what I'd like to do, but I'd prefer to keep my environment Erlang-only (or Erlang and C/C++ only) if possible. Pointers, advice, guidance -- all welcome. thanks, IC
