Is there an exhaustive dataset of just grayscale images or a CNN model ( preferably a caffe or tensorflow model ) Pre-trained on grayscale Images?

I have a very limited dataset of around 12k grayscale images and wanted to know if there is a CNN model that I can use for fine tuning or an grayscale image dataset that can be used for pre-training. I dont want to use models trained on ImageNet as I dont want to convert my grayscale images to color images.
