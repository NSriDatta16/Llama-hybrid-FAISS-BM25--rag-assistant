Normally the OS will try to read ahead and you should get near hard disk limit speeds if you are not CPU bound. The cause can be: Large file is fragmented (you might defragment the volume and check if things work better) OS does not use read ahead (as a solution: under Windows you can use CreateFile with a flag that you will be scanning the file) You do not use efficient buffering (eg if you read from an OS file handle only a few bytes at a time things will be slow. (you might try to read larger chunks at once) The moment that you are CPU bound, should you start looking at more efficient parsing of the data.
