There are no variables called str1 and str2 , so I'll assume you meant ptr1 and ptr2 . You never assign anything to these variables, so there's no reason for them to change from their original values. I think this is what you intended: char *strs[] = { "string1", "string2", NULL }; char *ptr1 = NULL, *ptr2 = NULL, **tmp; short iter = 0; tmp = &ptr1; while (iter It's a fairly bizarre piece of code, however. What are you actually trying to achieve? There may be a more elegant solution.
