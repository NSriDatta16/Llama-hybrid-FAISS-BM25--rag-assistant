Personal tool for authoring & organizing user stories?

My company uses Jira for storing requirements, which are written in the form of User Stories ("As a ... I want ... So that...") with details in the subtasks ("Given ... when ... then...") . I write requirements, usually an iteration ahead of the developers. I tend to draft my requirements in a word processor before putting them in Jira. I like the flexibility as I'm working out the best way to organize the information, jumping around from one story to another, using search & replace as I figure out the clearest wording, etc. While a word processor outline is helpful for much of this, it's not so good at tracking issue links: dependencies & related requirements. So, can anybody recommend a good tool for writing stories & tasks which allows me to diagram relationships as I write? I've been thinking in terms of something which handles concept mapping (though not mind mapping, which is generally limited to 1 central concept). This is just for my personal authoring; I don't need a project management system. Thanks in advance. Update: After posting this, I started wondering about TiddlyWiki. That's not quite the right tool, given its linking methods, but seems the right direction... Does that vein spark any ideas?
