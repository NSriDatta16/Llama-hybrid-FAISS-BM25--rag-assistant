I recommend checking out Ian Dees' Scripted GUI Testing With Ruby . This example of sending keystrokes to a Windows program comes from the book's 2nd chapter. The supporting script is available here . # START:typing "this is some text".upcase.each_byte do |b| # keybd_event.call b, 0, KEYEVENTF_KEYDOWN, 0 sleep 0.05 keybd_event.call b, 0, KEYEVENTF_KEYUP, 0 sleep 0.05 end # END:typing I highly-recommend this book for anyone doing platform-specific, or cross-platform GUI automation and testing.
