Logistic Regression or Cox regression?

I have a dataset for gym memberships over 5 years. I'm trying to predict what is causing people to cancel their policies. Variables I have include age, gender, income, locations... all demographical. These variables stay the same between each year, but I also have a variable called membership fee change... which is a percentage change in their membership fee, which changes each year. If a member renews all 5 years, they'll appear in the dataset 5 times with the dummy indicator taking a value of 1. If they cancel in year 2, they'll appear twice... year 1's record will have a 1 for the dummy variable but year 2's will be 0. What kind of regression would be most suitable to predict cancellations?
