Neural network weighting

Recently I've studied the backpropagation network and have done some manual exercise. After that, I came up with a question( maybe doesn't make sense): is there any thing important in following two different replacement methods: 1. Incremental Training: weights are immediately updated once all the delta Wij's are known and before presenting the next training vector. 2. Batch Training: delta Wij's are computed and stored for each exemplar training vector. However, the delta Wij's are not immediately used to update the weights. Weight updating is done at the end of a training epoch. I've googled for a while but haven't found any results.
