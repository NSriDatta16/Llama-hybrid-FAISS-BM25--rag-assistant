Measuring rurality

An inhabitant of Vermont boasted on his web site that that is the most rural of all the fifty states. But Alaska, with fewer than a million people in an area bigger than France, has a far lower population density. If you spread the people out uniformly over the land, they're farther apart in Alaska than in Vermont. But they're not spread out uniformly. If distances between neighbors is averaged over people rather than over land, the average Alaskan might be much closer to his neighbors than the average Vermonter. So how should one measure rurality?
