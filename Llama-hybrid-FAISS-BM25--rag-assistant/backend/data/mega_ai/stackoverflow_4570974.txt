Creating your own mouse events takes a little work - ideally you should either create or use some kind of mini-library. I'm thinking of creating something like this in the near future. Anyway, I created a drag and drop demo on jsFiddle showing how to drag images - you can view it here . You can create draggable images like this: var myImage = new DragImage(sourcePath, x, y); Let me know if you have any questions about this. Hope it helps. EDIT There was a bug when dragging multiple images. Here is a new version . Another thing you might want to check out is easeljs it sort of in the style of AS3... mouseEvents dragging etc...
