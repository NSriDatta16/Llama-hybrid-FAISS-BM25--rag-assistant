Non-linear logistic regression, one predictor with non-linear effect?

I'm a medical student and for a research project, I'm trying to predict the success of a medical procedure. An independent variable of interest is the amount of prior experience the doctor has performing the procedure. This effect is probably non-linear. In other words, you learn more the first time you try something then the 100th time. I would like to quantify this effect, but regular logistic models assume a linear effect of a continuous variable (as far as my textbooks explain). Is there a method that allows for non-linear logistic regression?
