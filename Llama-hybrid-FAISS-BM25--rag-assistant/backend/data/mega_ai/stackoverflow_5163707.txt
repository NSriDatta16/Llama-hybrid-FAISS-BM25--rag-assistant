You're reading past the end of the array. You declare packed[7] then access elements 0 to 7 (8 elements) in your write loop. Typically, you would use write to write a series of bytes, not just one. In your case that means replacing int writeLoop; for (writeLoop=0; writeLoop with write(openWriteFile, packed, 8); and changing your declaration to unsigned char packed[8]; //compression storage Or maybe it should be a 7 byte write? In which case replace the 8s with 7s.
