You may have the packaging type and/or version id not matching. I got the same error as you but played around with the packaging type and got it to work. Try the following. The following is fragment of the parent pom.xml. The packaging type is "pom". I don't have any code for the parent app, only a common pom.xml for sharing: ... com.mycompany.app parent ${app.version} pom Child's pom.xml. It is a webapp so packaging type is "war": com.mycompany.app parent ${app.version} ../parent/pom.xml war
