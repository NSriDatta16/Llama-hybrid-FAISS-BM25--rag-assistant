As a rough generalization, any time you sample a fraction of the people in a population, you're going to get a different answer than if you sample the same number again (but possibly different people). So if you want to find out how many people in Australia are >= 30 years old, and if the true fraction (God told us) just happened to be precisely 0.4, and if we ask 100 people, the average number we can expect to say they are >= 30 is 100 x 0.4 = 40, and the standard deviation of that number is +/- sqrt(100 * 0.4 * 0.6) = sqrt(24) ~ 4.9 or 4.9% (Binomial distribution). Since that square root is in there, when the sample size goes up by 100 times, the standard deviation goes down by 10 times. So in general, to reduce the uncertainty of a measurement like this by a factor of 10, you need to sample 100 times as many people. So if you ask 100 x 100 = 10000 people, the standard deviation would go up to 49 or, as a percent, down to 0.49%.
