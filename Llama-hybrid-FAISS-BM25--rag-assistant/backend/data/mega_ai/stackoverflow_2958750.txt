Magento quantity field doesn't work

i simply can't find a solution to my problem! The quantity field worked as it should. After a few months of programming on the whole shop, i wanted to test the quantity field and recognized that it doesn't function. I only can add one product to the cart although i typed “3” in the quantity field. I didn’t change anything in product/view.phtml and addtocart.phtml. Don't know where i have to search for this error. Maybe someone can give me a tip... greets max
