policy gradient loss

I am confused with the process for calculating loss. My code is below: logits = policy.predictions(states) negative_likelihoods = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=**actions**, logits=logits) weighted_negative_likelihoods = tf.multiply(negative_likelihoods, q_values) loss = tf.reduce_mean(weighted_negative_likelihoods) gradients = loss.gradients(loss, variables) logits is the output of policy network without softmax. My question is : What does actions mean ? Is it the action that agent has executed at t step or it should execute at t step ? Thanks
