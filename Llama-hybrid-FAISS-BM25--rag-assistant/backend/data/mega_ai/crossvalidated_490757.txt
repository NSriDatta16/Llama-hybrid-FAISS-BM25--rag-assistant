ARIMA takes a long time to fit for time series with "long" seasonal cycles. It is good for quarterly data (4 periods to a cycle) or monthly data (12 periods to a cycle) - but as you found, it struggles with daily data and yearly seasonality (365.25 periods to a cycle). An STL forecast is already a very good approach, and I would consider it a useful benchmark. It is a common finding in time series forecasting that very simple benchmarks are often surprisingly hard to improve on. One potential approach would be to use harmonics as predictors, with periods equal to the length of a year (and half a year, and a third, ...). Feed these into the xreg parameter of auto.arima() to run a regression with ARIMA errors . That is not a bad fit but it is not precise enough for my purpose. Sometimes our requirements on forecast accuracy are simply too high and cannot be met. If my purpose is to win big at roulette, then a hit probability of 1/37 is also not precise enough - but there is nothing I can do about it. You may find How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? amusing reading. At some point, it is more useful to invest resources in mitigation of unavoidable forecast errors, rather than in pursuing higher accuracy.
