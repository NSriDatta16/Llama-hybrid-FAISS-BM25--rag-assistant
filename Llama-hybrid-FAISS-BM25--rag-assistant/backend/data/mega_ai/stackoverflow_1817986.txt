Just an amusing side note: this feels like php yet is Ruby (from earlier today), but the first answer feels like elegant Ruby. In PHP I ended up writing stupid long code like the linked post to do little things. In part because lambdas are basically nonexistent. So I would have to say that Ruby's lambda support together with map/reduce is what makes it elegant to me.
