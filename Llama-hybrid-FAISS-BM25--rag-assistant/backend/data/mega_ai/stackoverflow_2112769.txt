Nope. Do you wasteful in terms of having to write the loop, or performance wise? I'd expect heaping a layer of abstraction over the array would hinder performance. If you need to search your arrays in something other than linear time (ie., one at a time), you'll need to organize them so that you can so a binary search over them (or any number of other algorithms).
