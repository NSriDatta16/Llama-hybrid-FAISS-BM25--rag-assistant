Storage-wise you are probably going to be fine. SQL Server will handle it. What worries me is the load your server is going to take. If you are receiving transactions constantly, you would have some ~400 transactions per second today. Increase this by a factor of 20 and you are looking at ~8,000 transactions per second. That's not a small number considering you are doing reporting on the same data... Btw, do I understand you correctly in that you are discarding the sensor data when you have processed it? So your total data set will be a "rolling" 1 billion rows? Or do you just append the data?
