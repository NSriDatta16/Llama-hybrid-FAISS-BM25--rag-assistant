How can I hide a database column in the entity model?

I'm using the Entity Framework 4 and have a question: I have a password column in my database that I want to manage using custom SQL. So I don't want the model to know anything about it. I've tried deleting the property in the Mapping Details window, but then I got a compilation error: Error 3023: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 1660:Column User.Password in table User must be mapped: It has no default value and is not nullable. So, I made the column nullable in the database and updated the model. Now I get this error: Error 3004: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 1660:No mapping specified for properties User.Password, User.Salt in Set Users. An Entity with Key (PK) will not round-trip when: Entity is type [UserDirectoryModel.User] Any ideas please? Thanks, Nick
