To begin with, I think we have to distinguish between logistic regression and (generalized) logistic function . Though the latter may be viewed as a separate case of a the former taking the time as the only explanatory variable. It is then straightforward to see that fitted process will go by $S$ shaped path that goes to its upper (or, probably, lower) limit when $t \rightarrow \infty$. Therefore moving along the $S$ curve is the influence of over covariates (not time) that are changing up and down with time (in consumption structures these are income, tastes, prices, etc.). So there could be jumps or whatever, because nobody restricts the linear regression to go only up or only down to the $S$ curve's bounds. Since you are working with structures $0$ and $1$ are natural limits. You can never be sure that any other bounds won't be hit higher or lower in the future, when your conclusions are based only on historical data analysis, and arguing that the process never did so is not an appropriate reasoning. Therefore your fears are not justified, logistic regression (but not fitting the logistic curve! that comes as a solution of deterministic differential equation!) will work just fine here. Pay attention to the fact that there could be several categories that some up to 1, so you need multinomial logit model to fit the structure in this case. Among the alternatives there could be any model that could be applied to discrete choice . Commonly used candidates are probit and logit models. Even if you think that there is no decision in my model actually all structures in the world are the result of decision processes solved either by humans, nature or the aliens ^_^.
