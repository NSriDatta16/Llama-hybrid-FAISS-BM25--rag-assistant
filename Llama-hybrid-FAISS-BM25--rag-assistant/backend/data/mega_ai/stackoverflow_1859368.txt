Frameworks such as JSF and Struts offer nicer abstractions for dealing with requests. When I do work with the raw Servlet APIs I use a little utility library to deal with this, and also parsing ints and dates etc. getStringParam( request, "originalUrl" ) {} which would throw an exception if the param is not found, or more often I use a varient that provides a default value if the param is missing: getStringParam (request, "origanlUrl", "http://someusefulDefault") {} getIntParam(request, "howManyRivers", 93);
