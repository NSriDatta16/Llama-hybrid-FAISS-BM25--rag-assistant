I was hoping there would be a textbook answer to this but it sounds like it will largely vary with different database types. Most of the responses indicated that I should run a test so that is exactly what I did. My application primarily targets the Derby, MS SQL and Oracle databases. Since derby can be run embedded and is easy to set up, I tested the performance on that first. The results were surprising. I tested the worst case scenario against a fairly large table. I ran the test 1000 times and averaged the results. Query 1: SELECT * FROM TableName Query 2 (With values of a="%" and b="%"): SELECT * FROM TableName WHERE a LIKE ? AND b LIKE ? Query 1 average time: 178ms Query 2 average time: 181ms So performance on derby is almost the same between the two queries.
