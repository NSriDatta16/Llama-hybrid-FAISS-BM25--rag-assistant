You should use a toolkit - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing_toolkits . There are several in C or C++ and these will have tools for Proper names. The names will be identified by lookup, by context and by other NLP heuristics. This may need to be combined with a lookup service if you have a special requirement. An example: John fed his dog A good NLP toolkit will know the name John and also parse "his" as a personal possessive pronoun , so identifying John as not only a noun, but a proper noun. Suggest you try out some of the tools - I think several of them will have online demos. If you also need to identify the people behind the names (e.g. author disambiguation) this is a hard task - many people are working on it.
