With namespaces just being strings (limited to [0‑9A‑Za‑z._‑]{0,100} ) you could just use "_" or somewhere as your separator for your sub namespaces, so you'd have namespaces like "%organisation_%user" But your argument So I don't have to search through all the documents doesn't seem like a strong enough reason to go down this route. Your code will become more complex (and as a result more likly to leak data) if you are constantly having to switch between namespaces to get at data that is organisation wide vs user wide. Performance will not be improved any more than if you were filtering your list of documents by a user-id field.
