How do I prevent selection scrolling in the body

I have divs that are placed off-screen. I have disabled scrollbars like so: body { overflow: hidden; } Currently, when I highlight text and drag the mouse outside the window, the body still scrolls. How can I prevent this behaviour? (Setting offscreen elements to display: none is not an option.) Thanks! Travis
