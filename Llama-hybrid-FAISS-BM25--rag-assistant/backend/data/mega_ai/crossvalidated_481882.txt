LRT comparing a random effects model and nested logistic regression model

I have a logistic regression model of the structure y ~ x1 + x2 , and a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with random intercept and random slope, of the structure y ~ x1 + x2 + (1 + x2 | id) . My goal is to determine whether a mixed model is necessary. Are these two models considered "nested", and can they be compared with a likelihood-ratio test (LRT)? How would I determine the degrees of freedom of this test? If they can be compared with a LRT, how does one mathematically state the null hypothesis? Say $G = cov(b_i)$ , where $b_i$ is the $2 \times 1$ random effect vector for the GLMM model. Would the appropriate null hypothesis be $H_0: G = 0$ ? If the above setup for the hypothesis is correct, how would the distribution of the resulting test statistic be identified. I am aware that testing $H_0: g_{22}=0$ requires the distribution of the test statistic, under the null, to be a 50:50 mixture of $\chi^2_1$ and $\chi^2_2$ because the null hypothesis is on the boundary of the parameter space. But in my case, I want to test whether the entire matrix $G$ , which is $2 \times 2$ , is zero.
