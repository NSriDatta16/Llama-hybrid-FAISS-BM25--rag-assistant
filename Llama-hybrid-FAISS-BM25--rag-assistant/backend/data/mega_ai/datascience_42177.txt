Doubt to use accuracy or macro f1 measure in an unbalanced classification task

I have a multi-class classification task where the organizers said that the final results will be using the Accuracy measure. The provided data is unbalanced, and I don't have an idea about the test set (is it balanced or not), but I think it will be balanced since they use accuracy. Anyway .. My question : Is it a good idea to tune my system using F1-macro rather than Accuracy? since the training data is unbalanced. or it's better to use the Accuracy?
