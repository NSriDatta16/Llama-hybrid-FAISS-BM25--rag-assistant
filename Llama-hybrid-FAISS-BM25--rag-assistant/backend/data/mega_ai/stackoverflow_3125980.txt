Firefox addon to view/edit/create localStorage data?

Is there an addon that allows you to view, edit, localStorage information? If there is and it works as an extension of Firebug I will be extremely happy. Something like Google Chrome's local storage similar to Firecookie but for the localStorage Is there something like it?
