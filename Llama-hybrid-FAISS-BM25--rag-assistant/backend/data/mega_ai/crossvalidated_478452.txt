One idea would be to perform the simulation since you do the Bayesian. The posterior for $\theta$ is of closed-form and hence you can easily simulate from $p(\theta|x)$ . Then you just apply your function $\phi^m = f(\theta^m) = \theta^m(1 - \theta^m), m = 1,\ldots, N$ where $N$ - number of simulated points from the posterior. Finally you just find $\hat{\phi} = \frac{\sum_{m=1}^N \phi^m}{N}$ . Let me clarify a little bit more. The posterior density for $p(\theta|x)$ has the following form \begin{align} p(\theta|x) \sim \mathcal{B}(\alpha + \sum x_i, \beta + n - \sum x_i), \end{align} where $\pi(\theta) \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1) = \mathcal{B}(1,1)$ , hence $\alpha = \beta = 1$ and $\mathcal{B}(.,.)$ means a beta distribution. Please refer to wiki for the clarifications https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior . Now you can simulate from this density. See the attached code. # Set a seed set.seed(3) # Number of observations N ```
