Useful design patterns when dealing with spring 3 controllers

Recently I was overlooking my controllers and they are bit of mess. I'd like to organize they way I set returning views Do more elegant mesageSource massaging back to the users and account for i18n Security checking, what user can access an what they can't Consistent way of calling the service layer And somehow bring consistency to the debugging lines. Do better job with error handling and serving it to the user. I'm already on mission to do security logging with AOP :) I'm just looking for patterns I could implement to help me to do all of the above. Or just some general advice in case no patterns apply, or advice on something I didn't mention but is common practice.
