Okay, I figured out a workaround. My goal was to find a solution that allowed me to use a Windows Setup project (since I don't have money for InstallShield, etc.) Basically, I use my output .MSI as an embedded resource in another project. This other project runs, does the checks I need it to do, and then runs the embedded resource with msiexec. This may sound a little bit silly, but the result seems elegant enough and it appears to be robust.
