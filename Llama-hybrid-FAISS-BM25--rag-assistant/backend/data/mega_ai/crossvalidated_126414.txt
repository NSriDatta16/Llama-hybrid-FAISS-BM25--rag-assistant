Dealing with missing values where the question was not asked

I have a question about missing values. We used 3 versions of a questionnaire were the possible answers were numeric (0-10) with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. We had 4 pain questions worst, least, average and pain now and only the first version of the questionnaire asked all 4 pain questions. I scored the data as 999 for truly missing values and 888 for missing values when the question was not asked. I want to create a 'total pain score'. I summing the scores of average and pain now. I divided the result by 2 if there are two valid values (e.g. 0 and 4 =2). If one sore was 888 treated this like a dummy variable and did not delete the paired value and did not divide by 2 (e.g. 888 and 2 =2). Does this sound like the appropriate way to deal with my missing values? -If I use pair wise deletion I lose 70% of my data.
