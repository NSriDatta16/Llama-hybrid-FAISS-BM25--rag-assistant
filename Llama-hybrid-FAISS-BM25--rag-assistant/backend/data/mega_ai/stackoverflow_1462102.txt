I have been using the with statement as a simple form of scoped import. Let's say you have a markup builder of some sort. Rather than writing: markupbuilder.div( markupbuilder.p('Hi! I am a paragraph!', markupbuilder.span('I am a span inside a paragraph') ) ) You could instead write: with(markupbuilder){ div( p('Hi! I am a paragraph!', span('I am a span inside a paragraph') ) ) } For this use case, I am not doing any assignment, so I don't have the ambiguity problem associated with that.
