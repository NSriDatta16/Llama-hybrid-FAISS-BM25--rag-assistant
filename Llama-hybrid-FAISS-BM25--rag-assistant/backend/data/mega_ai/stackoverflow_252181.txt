I've seen some issues where the code coverage analyzer has trouble with closing braces on try/catch blocks. When I see these sorts of things, I just don't worry about it -- as long as I can see that the actual code gets covered. [EDIT] I'd second the TestDriven.NET recommendation. I like it for the right-click test menus that let me easily run individual tests and I also use NCover rather than the built-in coverage -- mostly because it opens in another window and doesn't color the text in my main editor.
