What you are asking for is not natively supported. During a drag&drop operation, only the originator of the drag knows the operation is in progress, and only windows actually being dragged over get notifed that the operation may occur on them. The only option I can think of right now is to implement a global mouse hook via SetWindowsHookEx() in a DLL and have it keep track of when the user holds down the left button and moves the mouse outside of the source window. But there is no way to get information about what is being dragged.
