Can these issues cause any problems while applying the MA? Yes, if you want to communicate the changing variance, the moving average usually will cause that feature to be lost. Just think about what the moving average of $\frac{1}{t} \sin(t)$ would look like if the window for averaging is larger than $2π$. Or consider the moving average of noise with a changing variance. The non-equidistant sampling is also a problem as naïvely applying the moving average to it will cause the effective averaging window to be larger where the sampling is coarser. I suggest to take a look at kernel smoothing .
