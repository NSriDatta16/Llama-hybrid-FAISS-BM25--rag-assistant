Grouped splitting is essential especially if you are using very flexible machine learning algorithms like a random forest. How much it makes sense compared to selecting just one observation per group depends very much on the aim of your analysis. From a technical perspective, this can e.g. be solved like this. If your dataset df has a column ID , one option is to use my splitTools package and write something like ids $train, ] valid valid, ] test 60% of the IDs will be sampled into train , 20% into valid and 20% into test .
