Fit a VAR model with R

I have a bivariate time series z_t where z_1t is the change in monthly US treasury bills (maturity 3 months) and z_2t the inflation rate, in percentage, of the U.S. monthly consumer price index (CPI). CPI used is the consumer price index for all urban consumers: all items (CPIAUCSL). The original data are downloaded from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis. The CPI rate is 100 times the first difference of the log CPI index. I want to fit the specified VAR model and simplify the fit by a command R ( refVar from package MTS or restrict from package vars ) with threshold 1.65. I found this exercise ( pdf ) on R. Tsay's website at the University of Chicago. The data are here . What I did until now is the following: y restrict and VAR don't give me the right results or the same coefficients of the Var model in the answers in the pdf.
