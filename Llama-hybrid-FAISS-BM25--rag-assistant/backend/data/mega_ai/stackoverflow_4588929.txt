PHP Dom document html is faster or preg_match_all function is faster?

I got a doubt in mind that which one is faster in processing? dom document or preg_match_all with curl function is faster in html page parsing?? and will dom document function leave a trace on other server like curl function do? For example in curl function we use a user agent to define who is accessing but in dom document there is nothing.
