If you have read Burnham & Anderson's monograph , you know just why they discourage AIC(c)-based model selection: because they subscribe to the theory of tapering effect sizes . In a nutshell, they posit that everything has an effect - it's just that most effects are pretty small (sort of a "long tail"). Thus, an AIC(c)-selected model may be more parsimonious, but it will be systematically too small (the bias-variance trade-off). Therefore they recommend averaging models. This is also the reason why statistical significance and p values are not en vogue in the Burnham & Anderson worldview. Tapering effect sizes are another way of saying that the true coefficients are almost always nonzero, just perhaps very small. Thus, the null hypothesis is already false a priori . P values pose a question that we already know the answer to. Thus, if you follow B&A's philosophy far enough that you do AICc-based model averaging, it seems a bit incongruous to also discuss p values and/or "marginal significance". Now, one possibility would be to simply discuss "averaged coefficients" and their CIs, without even discussing whether CIs contain zero. Conversely, if you are in a field that deifies p values (like psychology), it may make more sense to disregard these implications of B&A in the interest of talking in a way your readers will understand, rather than follow strict AICc purity. (Anyway, my impression is that AICc and B&A have more of a following among non-statisticians, especially ecologists. So the nuances we are discussing here may already be far away from your readership's main interests.)
