To see the coverage of AOP in terms of applicability I really recommend you to read the book Aspect-Oriented-Software-Development-Use-Cases . This book elaborates use cases of functional and non-functional requirements using AOP. After that you will see that aspects can be used to more requirements than logging, tracing, security, etc.
