A rigorous survey of multiple algorithms similar to the Delgado paper you linked is not available as far as I know, but there have been efforts to gather results for families of algorithms. Here are some sources I find useful (disclaimer: I publish in the area, so it's likely I'm biased in my selection): A survey on Ensemble Learning for Data Stream Classification (Survey) Online Learning and Online Convex Optimization (Technical Report) Online Machine Learning in Big Data Streams (Survey) Machine Learning for Data Streams (Book) Algorithms for Learning Regression Trees and Ensembles on Evolving Data Streams (PhD Thesis) Learning under Concept Drift: an Overview (Survey) Optimal and Adaptive Online Learning (PhD Thesis) Adaptive Learning and Mining for Data Streams and Frequent Patterns (PhD Thesis) Some sofware packages: MOA and SAMOA scikit-multiflow Jubatus LIB(S)OL StreamDM I can add more info and sources if needed. As others have said the field could use a comprehensive survey.
