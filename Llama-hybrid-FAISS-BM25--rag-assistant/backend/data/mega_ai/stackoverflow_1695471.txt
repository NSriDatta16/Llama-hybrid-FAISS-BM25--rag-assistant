Problem with Sortables in Scriptaculous

I'm having a problem with getting my divs to become sortable using Scriptaculous's Drag and Drop Library. Date and Time Calculator Sortable.create("leftcol", {tag:$$('div'), treeTag:$$('pre')}); When I try to debug with Safari's Web Inspector, I get the following error: TypeError: Result of expression 'tagName.toUpperCase' [undefined] is not a function. dragdrop.js:932 Is the problem in the dragdrop.js file or is it in my code, and if it's in my code, how can I fix it? Thanks.
