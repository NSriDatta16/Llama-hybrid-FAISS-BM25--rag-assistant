You can use partitioning to divide the data between either different file groups or different servers. You can then choose how you backup each partition by applying different backup schedules to the filegroups/servers. But on the whole, storage is very cheap these days. Unless you really know this is going to cost, I would just backup everything. The more complex the backup system, the more prone to failure, and the cost of saving a few gig will not equal the cost of losing all the data!
