Each object implements one or more COM interfaces. A COM interface is a fixed description of what an object can do - in terms of C++ that's a class without member variables and with pure virtual member functions only. A COM class is an implementation of one or more interfaces - in terms of C++ it's a class (usually with member variables) with actually implemented member functions. When you say that a COM class "has" some COM interfaces it means that it implements them and can retrieve a pointer to each of those interfaces - that's very similar to an upcast in terms of C++, but is done with IUnknown::QueryInterface() function of the actual COM class.
