Short answer: No Longer answer (but possibly not the as correct): 1st: a training run only moves the weights of the neurons towards a position where they affect the output to be as in the testdata. After some/many iterations the output should be close to the expected output. Iff the neurol network is up to the task, which brings me to 2nd: Not every neuronal network works for every problem. For a single neuron it is pretty easy to come up with a simple function that can not get approximated by a single neuron. Though not as easy to see, the same limit applies for every neural network. In such cases your results will very likely look like random numbers. Edit after comment: In many cases this can be fixed by adding neurons to the network. 3rd: actually the first point is a strength of a neural network, because it allows the network to handle outliers nicely. 4th: I blame 3 for my lacking understanding of music. It just doesn't fit my brain ;-)
