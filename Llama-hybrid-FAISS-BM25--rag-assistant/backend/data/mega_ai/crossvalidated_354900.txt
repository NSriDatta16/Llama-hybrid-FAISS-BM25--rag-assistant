If your predictor variable is stochastic then you can employ Transfer Function Identification in order to form and encode a lead , contemporaneous or lag effect of one or more a predictor series. This is largely correct except for suggestions regarding model identification. Also see https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75 and @forecaster's excellent comments here Transfer function in forecasting models - interpretation and a lengthy discussion here steps to time series analysis on my data If your predictor variable is not stochastic then all I can suggest is a trial and error approach incorporating different dummies (0/1) .
