I disagree with the other answer . SMC is a term that encompasses algorithms that are not particle filters. The latter estimate sequences of state distributions assuming known parameters of a state space model. However, there exist SMC samplers that estimate posterior distributions of models that aren't even time series models. Within many papers that deal exclusively with particle filtering, though, it is quite common to refer to particle filtering algorithms (such as SIR/SISR) as SMC algorithms. In my opinion, it sounds cooler, but it leads to this sort of confusion. It is easy to dig up a source on particle filtering that uses the terms interchangeably. SIR/SISR both refer to the same thing, which is a particle filtering algorithm. Edit: allow me to quote from the same reference mentioned above:
