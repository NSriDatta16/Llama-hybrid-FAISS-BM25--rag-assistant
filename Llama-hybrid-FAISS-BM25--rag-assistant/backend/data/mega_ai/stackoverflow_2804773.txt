The best way to find which OIDs have the numbers you want is to use a tool like snmpwalk . However, I think the defaults should be something like this: CPU: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.3.1.2.Index Storage Types: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.2.Index Storage Size: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.5.Index Storage Usage: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.6.Index It is also helpful to read the RFC's for SNMP, RFC1157 , RFC2571 , RFC2790
