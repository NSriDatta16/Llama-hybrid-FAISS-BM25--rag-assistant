sIFR: dynamically inserting umlaut causes trouble

let me state cleary at the beginning that I know about the embedding issue in flash. So, to the point. If sIFR replaces an umlaut (ä,ö,ü) which is hard coded in the HTML file everythings works fine. But when I want to insert it dynamically it is not displayed. I played around with charset options to specifiy the javascript file i'm referencing but it doesnt change a thing. Here's JavaScript and sIFR code: sIFR.replacements["#image-counter span"][0].replaceText("ö"); I tried as well to replace "ö" by "&ouml;" and "&#246" but this doesnt work around it either. Any ideas?
