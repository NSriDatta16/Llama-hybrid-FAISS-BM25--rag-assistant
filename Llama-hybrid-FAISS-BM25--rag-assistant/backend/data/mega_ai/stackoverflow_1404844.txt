I tried three different ways and only one can return two to five finger taps. The winning mechanism is NSSet *touch = [event allTouches]; - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; // the next line will not ever return a multiple tap if ([touches count] > 1) NSLog(@"multi-touches %d", [touches count]); // the next line will return up to 5 (verified) simultaneous taps (maybe more) NSSet *touch2 = [event allTouches]; if ([touch2 count] > 1) NSLog(@"multi-touches2 %d", [touch2 count]); // the next line only returns 1 tap NSSet *touch3 = [event touchesForView:self]; if ([touch3 count] > 1) NSLog(@"multi-touches2 %d", [touch3 count]); }
