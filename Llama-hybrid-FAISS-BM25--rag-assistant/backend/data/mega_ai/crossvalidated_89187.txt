Autoencoder is a model using Neural Networks to extract features. However it is a unsupervised learning algorithm, we cannot sure what feature could be found. It is possible for it to find a line to be an valuable feature if the line is obvious and clear, or appear in many pictures. I have no experience in filters, but I think what @NGY mentioned are more important.
