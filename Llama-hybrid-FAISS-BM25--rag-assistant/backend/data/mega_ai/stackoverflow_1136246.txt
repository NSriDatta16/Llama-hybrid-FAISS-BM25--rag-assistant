I would write an SSIS package to do this. You could use the import/export wizard to generate the beginings of a package and adapt it to meet your exact needs. To do this in SQL 2005, Right click on your database in object explorer in SQL Management Studio, go Tasks > Import Data, follow the wizard and at the end select to save the package. I imagine it's a similar process in SQL 2008, but I don't have it to hand. After you have saved your package it's possible to schedule it using the SQL Server aAgent, when setting up the job, choose "SQL Server Integraton Services Package" as the type and select your packege.
