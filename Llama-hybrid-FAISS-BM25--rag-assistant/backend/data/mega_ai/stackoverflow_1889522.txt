How do I organize this data into structures in MATLAB?

Say for n=5 , the following code gives me a plot for n randomly generated nodes. These nodes are not structures (just plotted points), but I want to assign every node a message just as I did for sink and source and keep track of the nodes identity and location. For example, if node 4 has (x,y) coordinates (.3452 , .5463) , I want to assign node 4 a msg and temp_value as well. How can I do this? Code: n = input('No. of Nodes:'); sink = [0 0]; source = [1 1]; node = rand(n,2) x = node(:,1); y = node(:,2); x1 = sink(:,1); y1 = sink(:,1); x2 = source(:,1); y2 = source(:,1); plot(x,y,'o') hold on plot(x1,y1,'r*') hold on plot(x2,y2,'r*') hold on sink = struct; sink.msg = 'temp'; sink.temp_value = '30' source = struct; source.msg = 'temp'; source.temp_value = '30'
