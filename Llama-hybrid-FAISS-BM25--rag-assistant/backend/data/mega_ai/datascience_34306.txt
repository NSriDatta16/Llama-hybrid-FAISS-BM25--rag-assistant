Metric to combine average with number of accurance

I was analysing a dataset which has got two main columns which I can name like: category:String amount: Int So I wanted to know the average of amount for each of the category. So I did something like: df.groupBy("category").agg(avg("amount") as average) The problem is for categories I don't have many observations, sometimes just one or two. But for other categories I have around 5000. So I would like to know if there is any metrics where I can reflect that the average may be more or less accurate depending on the amount of observations used for the average.
