When creating arrays, the memory allocator will attempt to reserve the total amount of memory required at the point you assign it. In this case it will 8 bytes for each element. The OOM in this case is pretty straightforward, there is not enough memory to allocate such large arrays. In a standad 32bit Windows configuration you are limited to a maximum of 2GB of memory address space per process for user code and data, although in practice it often much less than this due to memory fragmentation for example. In the case of fragmentation the OOM is better interpreted as "cannot find a large enough contiguous memory section" when dealing with large arrays.
