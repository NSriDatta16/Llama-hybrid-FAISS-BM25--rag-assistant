Modeling "Pay as Much as You Want" with a Bayesian Model

I have data of sales of a certain product which is sold "Pay as Much as You Want". The daily data is in the form of number of sales per day and the total revenue per day: Day Sales Revenue 1 10 70.5 2 12 82.1 3 8 55.1 4 15 110.7 5 6 54.6 6 9 61.2 . . . . . . I am after building a model of the average sale price of the product. I want to use a Bayesian model. I thought about a model built with Gamma Likelihood with Gamma Prior. I thought doing so as I saw that Gamma Distribution is used to model the size of insurance claims. Reading the Conjugate Prior page made me lost on how properly to do so. So my questions are: Is the Gamma Likelihood with Gamma Prior a reasonable model? If not, is there a better model at all? Any better model limited to a conjugate prior form? The Wikipedia - Conjugate prior page lists 3 different variations of the likelihood an prior. I am struggling on which one to choose an how to connect $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ to the average price. I thought maybe $ \beta $ to represent the number of sales and $ \alpha $ the total revenue, will it make sense?
