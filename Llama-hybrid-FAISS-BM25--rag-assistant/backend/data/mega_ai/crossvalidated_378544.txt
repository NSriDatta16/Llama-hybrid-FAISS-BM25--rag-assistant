To segment or not to segment, this is the question?

I am starting a project, in which I plan to run a neural-network regression using images. These are simple images of particles in a field with low contrast. The shape of the particles changes in response to a given chemical. I plan to trach the system to predict the concentration of the chemical, using my image data (a few hundreds of images, with >20 particles/image on average). I'd like to get your expert opinion, whether i should segment the images before feeding them into the model (keras/tensorflow), or just give it the raw images? Due to the low contrast, the segmentation isn't perfect (it segments correctly ~85% of the particles, snd the rest get missed or interconnected), so segmentation will create a bias. On the other hand, in many images, most of the image is background and not particles, which may make harder to find the right features. So, what do you think?
