Imbalance dataset in regression problem

I know that there are several ways, such as sampling methods, to deal with the imbalance in classification. However, I am dealing with the imbalance problem in regression settings. Basically, I want to build a regression F(X) to predict y (say y range from 0 to 1). However, the problem is most of the values of y are around 0.4-0.6 . Hence, the predicted output (I used xgboost ) almost lies around 0.5 --> it completely fail to predict extreme values such as 0.1 or 0.9. What are some potential tricks that can be used to deal with the problem? I tried over-sampling, i.e. add more instances of y 0.8 to the model but it does not work.
