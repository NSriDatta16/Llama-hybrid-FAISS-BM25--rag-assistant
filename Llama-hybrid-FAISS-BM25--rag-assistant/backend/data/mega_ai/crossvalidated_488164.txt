We can explore the Dirichlet family of distributions to check if it contains some distribution satisfying your conditions. So, we have: $$P\sim\text{Dir}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$$ It is reasonable to impose $\mathbb E(P)=(0.50, 0.30, 0.20)$ , which implies gives us: $$(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)=(0.5x,0.3x,0.2x)$$ For some positive number $x$ . Now it only remains to find $x$ . I have written the following R code to find what value of $x$ makes the central interval for $P_1$ have a length of $0.10$ : for (x in seq(1, 500, 0.001)){ alpha = c(0.5,0.3,0.2) interval This gives us $x\approx270$ . If we write a similar code to assert the interval for $P_2$ has length $0.10$ , we get a slightly different value of $x$ : for (x in seq(1, 500, 0.001)){ alpha = c(0.5,0.3,0.2) interval This gives us $x\approx226$ . OK, so since the values of $x$ are different, the Dirichlet distribution does not allow your conditions to work exactly. But can we tweak it to make your conditions work with a good approximation? Let's try using $x=\frac{270+226}{2}=248$ and see what happens: > x stats::qbeta(p = c(0.05, 0.95), shape1 = x*a[1], shape2 = x*(a[2]+a[3])) [1] 0,4478658 0,5521342 > stats::qbeta(p = c(0.05, 0.95), shape1 = x*a[2], shape2 = x*(a[1]+a[3])) [1] 0,2531545 0,3486831 > stats::qbeta(p = c(0.05, 0.95), shape1 = x*a[3], shape2 = x*(a[1]+a[2])) [1] 0,1597154 0,2430401 OK, so $x=248$ gives us the distribution $\text{Dir}(124,74.4,49.6)$ , which gives us $90\%$ intervals $(44.7\%-55.2\%)$ for $P_1$ , $(25.3\%,34.9\%)$ for $P_2$ and $(16.0\%,24.3\%)$ for $P_3$ . TL;DR The Dirichlet distribution is a good choice for the problem at hand The adequate set of parameters is something close to $\alpha=(124,74.4,49.6)$ The probability of drawing a green ball is $\mathbb E[P_3]=0.20$ (this part follows from the other probabilities being $50\%$ and $20\%$ , in average) and a $90\%$ interval around it is $16.0\%,24.3\%$ (AFAIK this part depends on using the Dirichlet distribution)
