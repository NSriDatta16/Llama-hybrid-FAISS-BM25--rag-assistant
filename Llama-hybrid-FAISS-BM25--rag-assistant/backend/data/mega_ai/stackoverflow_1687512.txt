RBAR vs. Set based programming for SQL

Having read this link on RBAR and this , my understanding of RBAR amounts to this: Anything that have loops and cursors Anything that's not set based I know this sounds kinda wholly which is why I am asking if anyone has a more elegant explanation as to what set-based programming is (within SQL context).
