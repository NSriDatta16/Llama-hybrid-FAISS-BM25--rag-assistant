A word of advice: Read iTunes Connect Guide carefully about this point! You can remove an app from sales or you can delete it... But pay attention! If you decide to remove an app from sales, you'll be able to put it back on sales but if you choose to delete it you won't be able to restore it because you can't reuse your SKU, Bundle ID or App Name. To remove your app from sales: Go to your App Summary Page. Click on Price and availability button. Deselect all the stores Availability regions and then save changes or select " Remove from sale ". To delete your app: Go to your App Summary Page. Click on Delete Application button. Note: You can't delete an app if it is ready for sale. First you need to remove your app from sales and then you can delete it.
