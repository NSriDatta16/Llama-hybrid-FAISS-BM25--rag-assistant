This fact is called the data processing inequality. If the variables $X$, $O_1$ and $O_2$ form a Markov chain ($X \rightarrow O_1\rightarrow O_2$), then $Var [X|O_1] \leq Var[X|O_2] $, with equality iff $E[X|O_1] = E[X|O_2] $. You can prove it by using the Markov property and the fact that conditioning decreases variance (which is itself the consequence of the law of total variance). See Theorem 11 in "Functional Properties of Minimum Mean-Square Error and Mutual Information", Y. Wu, S. Verd√∫, IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, March 2012 http://www.princeton.edu/~verdu/reprints/WuVerIT2012f.pdf
