If you don't mind using a gem, curb will do this for you. It's all about using the follow_location parameter: gem 'curb' require 'curb' # http://www.stackoverflow.com/ redirects to http://stackoverflow.com/ result = Curl::Easy.http_get("http://www.stackoverflow.com/") do |curl| curl.follow_location = true end puts result.body_str This is not the only library with this feature, though. As a note, many times you will get an invalid location in the header and it will have to be interpreted by the user agent to render it into something useful. A header like Location: / will need to be re-written before it can be fetched. Other times you will get a header like Location: uri=... and you'll have to pull out the location from there. It's really best to leave it to your library than re-write that yourself.
