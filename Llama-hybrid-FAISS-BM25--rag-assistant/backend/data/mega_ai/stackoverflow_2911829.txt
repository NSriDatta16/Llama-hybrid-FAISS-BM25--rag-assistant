One good advice: always surround all logical blocks of code with curly braces: if (expression) { //some code } if (expression) { //one line of code } else { //another line } while (conditionIsTrue) { //just 1 line here but surrounded with curly braces } It'll help you avoid numerous not-obvious mistakes in all C-style languages. How those mistakes can ever appear if you understand that only one line should be in block and you omit braces consciously to make code more readable? Very simple! Just imagine the code: if (a > b) result = a; For the first look it's more elegant then if (a > b) { result = a; } or even if (a > b) { result = a; } But now let's suppose you want to add some debug info to your code: if (a > b) System.out.println ("a > b, we're inside if-block"); result = a; //This line is ALWAYS executed As you can see it's really easy to make a mistake. So just don't omit braces and things will be done much easier.
