Your understanding of the results is not correct. You can just write down the formula for the logistic regression model $$\log\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}=\beta_0+\beta_1x$$ Here $\beta_0$ is your intercept $x$ is the continuous_variable, $\beta_1$ is the coefficient of the continuous variable. $\hat{p}$ is the probability of outcome "1" happens. According to your results, the formula becomes $$\log\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}=-3.144947+0.048831x$$ So when $x=0$, $$\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}=e^{-3.144947}\Rightarrow\hat{p}=0.04129084$$ Which means when $x=0$, the probablity of "outcome" happens is 0.041. Next, you can compare when $x_2=x_0+1$ with $x_1=x_0$ which mean one unit increase of the continuous variable. When $x_1=x_0$ $$\log\frac{\hat{p_1}}{1-\hat{p_1}}=-3.144947+0.048831*x_0 \tag{1}$$ Then when $x_2=x_0+1$ (i.e one unite increase) $$\log\frac{\hat{p_2}}{1-\hat{p_2}}=-3.144947+0.048831*(x_0+1) \tag{2}$$ Next we calculate $(2)-(1)$ we get $$\log\frac{\hat{p_2}}{1-\hat{p_2}}-\log\frac{\hat{p_1}}{1-\hat{p_1}}=0.048831$$ Note we call $\frac{p}{1-p}$ as Odds, We denote $\frac{\hat{p_2}}{1-\hat{p_2}}=O_2$ i.e Odds when $x_2=x_0+1$, and similarly, $\frac{\hat{p_1}}{1-\hat{p_1}}=O_1$ Therefore, $$\log O_2-\log O_1=0.048831$$ $$\log\frac{O_2}{O_1}=0.048831$$ $$OR(\text{odds ratio})=\frac{O_2}{O_1}=e^{0.048831}=1.05003$$ Which mean with one unit of increase of your continous_variable, the Odds of "outcome" happens increase by about 5%(1.05003)
