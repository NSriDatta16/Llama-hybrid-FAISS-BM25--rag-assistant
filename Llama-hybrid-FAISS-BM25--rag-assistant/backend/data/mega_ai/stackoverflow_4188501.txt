RRS will survive the total loss of one data centre, as well using multiple drives, etc. Regular S3 storage will survive the loss of two. The 99.999999999% durability figure is a bit pointless - they're quoting something less than the the probability of a K/T event sized comet hitting Earth, and if that happened we wouldn't be worrying about our S3 data. The probability of a political or economic event taking down Amazon is a much higher than the risk of three AWS regions being simultaneously destroyed, so I reject that notion that data in S3 "doesn't need to be backed up" although it is good to know that the system has been designed to survive most eventualities. The risk of having a system you have connected to your AWS account compromised, and losing data that way, is higher again, so always keep offline backups .
