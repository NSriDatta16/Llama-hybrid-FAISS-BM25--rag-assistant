For your domain-model object to be used on the client side (ie: to be translated in javascript), you need to provide the sources to GWT during compile time. You also need to tell GWT in a module which package name you need to compile. See how to organize projects in GWT . About the GWT service interfaces, I'd suggest you to integrate GWT with Spring. There is a nice tutorial about how integrating GWT with Spring . The RPC calls of GWT could be then be routed to your existing services. Hope it helps.
