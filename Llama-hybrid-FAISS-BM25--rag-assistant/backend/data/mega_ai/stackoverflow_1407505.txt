Grails GSP doesn't generate intended HTML under Geronimo

When running my Grails 1.1-M2 app as a WAR under Geronimo 2.1.4 (jetty6, javaee5), the HTML generated from the GSPs do not include my dynamic content. Specifically, this GSP snippet: ...produces this HTML when running under Geronimo: Type ...however when running as 'grails run-app' or 'grails run-war', this, correct HTML is produced: Type EP LP SINGLE AlbumType.groovy is defined in src/groovy as: public enum AlbumType { EP, LP, SINGLE } I've turned on all logging within Grails and don't see any error or exceptions. This issue is confusing as I only see it while running my Grails WAR under Geronimo. Granted, I haven't tried any other app servers though it is curious that everything works fine with 'grails run-app' and 'grails run-war'. Any ideas as to the problem?
