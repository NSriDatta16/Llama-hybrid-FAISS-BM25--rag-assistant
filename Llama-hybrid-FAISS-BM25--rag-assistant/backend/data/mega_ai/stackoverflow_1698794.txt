Drag and drop a html table into another application

I'm having a problem dragging an html table from my C# winforms application into an external application (Outlook email message) and getting it to render as a table instead of a plain text version of that table. I know that when you copy/paste in the clipboard you have to put the table in CF_HTML format but that doesn't seem to help with dragging the table. Does anyone know what I am missing?
