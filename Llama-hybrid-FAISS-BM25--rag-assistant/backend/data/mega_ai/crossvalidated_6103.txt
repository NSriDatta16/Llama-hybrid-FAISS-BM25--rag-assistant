Statistics is concerned with probabilistic models, specifically inference on these models using data. Machine Learning is concerned with predicting a particular outcome given some data. Almost any reasonable machine learning method can be formulated as a formal probabilistic model, so in this sense machine learning is very much the same as statistics, but it differs in that it generally doesn't care about parameter estimates (just prediction) and it focuses on computational efficiency and large datasets. Data Mining is (as I understand it) applied machine learning. It focuses more on the practical aspects of deploying machine learning algorithms on large datasets. It is very much similar to machine learning. Artificial Intelligence is anything that is concerned with (some arbitrary definition of) intelligence in computers. So, it includes a lot of things. In general, probabilistic models (and thus statistics) have proven to be the most effective way to formally structure knowledge and understanding in a machine, to such an extent that all three of the others (AI, ML and DM) are today mostly subfields of statistics. Not the first discipline to become a shadow arm of statistics... (Economics, psychology, bioinformatics, etc.)
