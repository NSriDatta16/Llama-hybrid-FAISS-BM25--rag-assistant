Predicting Which Users will Login at a particular time

I have a challenging use case at work. We have logs of which user login at which times. So, consider 7 days a week, 24 hours. We have to map these 7x24 slots to different users. I am trying to figure out how to apply Machine learning here. Users are in thousands, so not sure if classification will work. If t is a variable, then it has 7*24 potential values, at any hour there can be multiple users logging in. I can't figure out in which category this problem belongs to. Any tutorials, algorithms or frameworks are welcome. Thanks.
