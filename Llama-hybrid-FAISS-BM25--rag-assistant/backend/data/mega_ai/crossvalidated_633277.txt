In Bayesian, in my view, the MCMC is a procedure to draw samples from your priors (your assumptions) and follow your hierarchical model (also your assumptions), you can estimate the posterior distribution (the goal). After performing diagnostics to your posterior, then you could verify whether all your assumptions make sense.
