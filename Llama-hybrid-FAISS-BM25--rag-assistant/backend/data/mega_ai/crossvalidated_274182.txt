You should run the model on all the imputed datasets separately and then pool the resulting regression estimates. See the article you provided MICE: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations in R (especially chapter 5 and point 5.3) by Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011. Then you can use the pooled model on the training data to test the model. The problem with averaging imputed data is that you will omit some variability in the data. The problem with a second proposition is that you will artificially inflate the sample size. This will render error estimates of your predictions based on the model useless. EXT: regression model used on the imputed data should be a nested model of a regression model used to impute data. This and pooling methods provided implies that MICE method was designed with regression analysis methods in mind. But there is no reason not to use other methods on imputed data. The problem is how to generalize the models obtained on many imputed datasets. This step depends on the method used. In a case of tree based models you can simply append all the imputed data into one big data frame (as you proposed). The resulting tree model will in essence be the average pooled tree model.
