odd writing style you have. anyway. it is the destroy. the events are not delegated. i.e. your selector is the first div but that's a physical element that gets a UID and a functional cllback against that. by doing .destroy() you are removing this div from the dom and even if you reinsert it after, because you don't use event delegation, the event will no longer work (events are part of element storage so destroy removes them too). check out http://jsfiddle.net/dimitar/3j3Ws/1/ -> proves it can work fine (i added mootools more for easy .show() and .hide() but you can just use .setStyle("display", "none") . alternatively, look at doing an event for document.id("option") as click:relay(div.down) and mod the x html to have class='down' - then the code you have at the moment will keep.
