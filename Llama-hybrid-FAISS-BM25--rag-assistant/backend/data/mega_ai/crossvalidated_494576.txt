Ok, so from what I understand you have some prior information on some biological phenomenon and want to incorporate that prior information into a statistical model. That definitely sounds Bayesian. I wouldn't recommend rolling your own estimator for this. Libraries like PyMC3 in python and tools like Stan (accessible through a variety of languages) have done a lot of this for you and are tested well. You can learn more about how these tools work by visiting their websites and reading their docs. What you should probably focus on is how to do bayesian statistics , which really can't be taught through a stackexhange post. If you have difficulty following along with the math in your linked post, you are going to have a tough time with Bayes.
