You may use bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for the prediction error. Further help can be found in some Stanford online course slides , but I haven't done this. Besides that, it should be no problem to compare the estimated performance obtained with cross-validation (mean and standard deviation) with a reference point (e.g., AUC = 0.5) or with the results of another benchmark model such as logistic regression or nearest-neighbor classifier using a simple statistical test using a given level of confidence. A similar question is discussed here .
