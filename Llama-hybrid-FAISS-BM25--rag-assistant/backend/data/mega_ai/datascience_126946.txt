What do these terms mean in the context of Roberta?

When I read articles about Roberta, I often read the terms "transfer learning" and "fine-tuning". Additionally, they also mention "feature extraction". What are the differences between these terms ? If I want to train the pre-trained Roberta on my dataset but only use it to calculate contextual embeddings for each caption in the dataset by taking the last hidden state of the model, what is this process called ?
