What are some viable alternatives to BizTalk Server?

In evaluating different systems integration strategies, I've come across some words of encouragement, but also some words of frustration over BizTalk Server. What are some pros and cons to using BizTalk Server (both from a developer standpoint and a business user), and should companies also consider open source alternatives? What viable alternatives are out there? EDIT: Jitterbit seems like an interesting choice. Open Source and seems to be nicely engineered. Anyone on here have any experience working with it?
