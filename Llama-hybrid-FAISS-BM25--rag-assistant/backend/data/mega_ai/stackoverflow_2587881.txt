You seem to be using display: table-cell to have the text appear in a column next to the floated image instead of wrapping around it. You should be using overflow to achieve that effect : .spotlight1 p { color: #333333; font-size: 12px; overflow: hidden; } You'll have to get rid of the width on those paragraphs too, though, which they're now getting from the #contentleft p . But you can use the same trick for the leftmost two columns altogether if you put the #inner2right2 div right before the #inner2left div. You can then use overflow on that left column to make them stay next to each other. That way you can get rid of the width you're setting on the #contentleft p too. This will work in IE7 too. I think it'll work in IE6 as well if you give those same blocks " layout ". The easiest way to do that is by adding zoom: 1 .
