PCA without finite second moment

It is a well known fact that ( Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues ) PCA can be understood as a transformation of axes given by the data when the data $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ are generated by $L^2$ random variables. Such an explanation collapse when the data generating mechanism does not have finite second moment. So in that case, what kind of drawbacks and potential morbidity does PCA have? And how can we understand PCA in that kind of situation?
