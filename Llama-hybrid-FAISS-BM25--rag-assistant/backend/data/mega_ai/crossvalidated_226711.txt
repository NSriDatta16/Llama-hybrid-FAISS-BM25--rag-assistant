A Cox proportional hazards model does not provide an intercept like the glmm models in the page to which you linked. It is a semi-parametric model, a substantially "different sort of model" from those. The reference for a Cox model is effectively the empirical hazard function over time, at the covariate values for the baseline class. Conceptually, you could think of that entire empirical hazard function as the "intercept." The coefficient for a predictor variable documents how that predictor affects the overall slope of the log of the hazard function, assuming proportional effects on hazards. Significance tests are properly performed on the coefficients ($\hat\beta$) and their standard errors, but in clinical use at least practical attention is more often on $exp(\hat\beta)$, which represent the hazard ratios relative to the baseline class. You might find the documentation in the survival package or other introductory explanations to be more helpful for these basic concepts than what is provided in the coxme package.
