Lets assume we're only talking about ethernet and IPv4 Look at your interface MTU, which has already subtracted the size of the ethernet headers for the OS I can remember (linux and FreeBSD) Subtract 20 bytes for a normal IP header (no IP options) Subtract 20 bytes for a normal TCP header Or Subtract 8 bytes for a UDP header That is how much data you can pack into one IPv4 packet. So, if your TCP data is n bytes long, your total ethernet payload is (n + 20 + 20) ; your ethernet payload for UDP is (n + 20 + 8) . EDIT FOR QUESTIONS RE: MTU Your interface MTU is the largest ethernet payload that your drivers will let you encapsulate onto the wire. I subtract because we're assuming we start from the MTU and work up the encapsulation chain (i.e. eth -> ip -> tcp|udp ); you cant send TCP or UDP without an IP header, so that must be accounted for as well.. RE: Calculating application overhead Theoretical calculations about the overhead your application will generate are fine, but I suggest lab testing if you want meaningful numbers. Usage factors like average data transfer per client session , client hit rate per minute and concurrent clients can make a difference in some (unusual) cases.
