Well, I can only speak of my opinions and experiences, and I'm just a developer who has worked quite a bit with testers and QA engineers. Anyway, my 2c: The most basic difference manual is done by hand, and automatic is done by computer :) As a consequence, the manual test process can be orders of magnitude slower than an fully automated one. On the other hand, automated tests can only detect issues they were meant to detect, and cannot detect fundamentally new behaviour of a system. That basically means that automated tests are ideal for regression testing, when it is well known what should be done, how, and what the outputs should be. As to the skill sets, manual tests can be basically made by anyone in the right mindset, while automated tests must be made by someone with at least some developer experience. There are frameworks that enable easy recording of a automated web tests, for example, but, it's often necessary to tweak the recorded scenarios to better suit the needs of the testing. Of course, the necessary basic skills for testing must also be present in anyone wanting a work in QA, like patience, attention to detail, great organizational abilities, great communication abilities, etc... And last, I don't thinks manual testing is underrated, if anything, I think automated testing is underused in most corporate environments I've seen. But, yes, some people (mostly managers, to be honest) do interpret my previous paragraph as "anyone can do manual tests".
