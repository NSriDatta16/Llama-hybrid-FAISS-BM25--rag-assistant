Php parse links/emails

I am wondering if there is a simple snippet which converts links of any kind: http://www.cnn.com to http://www.cnn.com cnn.com to cnn.com www.cnn.com to www.cnn.com abc@def.com to to mailto:abc@def.com I do not want to use any PHP5 specific library. Thank you for your time. UPDATE I have updated the above text to what i want to convert it to. Please note that the href tag and the text are different for case 2 and 3. UPDATE2 Hows does gmail chat do it? Theirs is pretty smart and works only for real domains names. e.g. a.ly works but a.cb does not work.
