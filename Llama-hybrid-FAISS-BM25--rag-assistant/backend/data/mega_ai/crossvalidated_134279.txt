Comparing two correlated dependent variables

I have two dependent variables that I want to predict. One is a normally-distributed continuous variable, and the other is a binary categorical variable (0 or 1). They're moderately correlated so that the binary variable is 1 for higher values of the continuous variable. The theoretical question I'm interested in is whether the binary variable is just a coarser-grained version of the continuous variable (i.e. they can be predicted by the same model), or whether they're best predicted by two different models. I have a large number of IVs that should predict both variables. My first thought was just to fit a linear and a logistic regression for the continuous and binary variables, respectively, and see whether the same set of IVs predicts both of the DVs, or whether they're a different set. That seems ad-hoc to me and I was interested in knowing if there's a better approach I can take.
