"a valid provisioning file for this executable was not found" in XCode

I'm trying to submit my second app to the App Store. I've followed all the instructions to the best of my knowledge, but I keep getting this error when I try to build and run: "a valid provisioning file for this executable was not found" I'm letting XCode auto select the profile automatically. The one I'd like to select is greyed out. But the dropdown selection in the Build tab of the Target window says "profile doesn't match application identifier" The other thing I don't get about this is that the selection dropdown shows "com.mycompany.myapp" and then "ABCDEDFG.com.mycompany.myapp" (both of those made up) so that I see they don't match. I have the unique identifier profile installed in the Organizer and in plist file. I'm totally confused. I have followed the instructions in my book a few times and just can't get it.
