At first guess i would say that you've referenced both Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.v7.1.dll and Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v8.1.dll . CHeck your project's references. Also if Infragistics offer an upgrade your project type functionality when you install a new version, make sure it hasn't left stray references or using statements, or incorrect variable declarations that reference older versions of the componentry.
