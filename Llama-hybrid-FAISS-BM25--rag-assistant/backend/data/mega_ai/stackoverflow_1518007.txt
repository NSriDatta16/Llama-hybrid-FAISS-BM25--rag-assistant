You may be thinking of localStorage and sessionStorage, which are part of the W3C Web Storage API. IE8 and Fx 3.5 support the above properties. Check the vendor documentation ( developer.mozilla.org for Firefox ). Firefox doesn't support the real DB yet ( tracking bug ) and it's not clear that the current proposal (just make sqlite available to web pages) is the right one or the one that will be implemented in all browsers (see e.g. this post from Vlad Vukićević, a Mozilla developer)
