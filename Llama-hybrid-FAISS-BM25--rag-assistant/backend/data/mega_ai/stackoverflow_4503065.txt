This is going to depend on the type of flash memory used internal and the classification of the external SD card. For example if a user has Class 6 SD card the read speed is going to be around 6 MB/second but with only a class 2 (which most devices ship with) is 2 MB/sec. You shouldn't make any assumptions about the speed of either the internal of external read/write speeds because they will vary per device and per storage quota (how full they are). Design as generically as possible and make use of StrictMode to ensure proper thread usage.
