Concerning your more specific question (i.e. how many degrees of freedom): the question is how many replicates do you have. Look at the early pages of chapter 19 of the R book for examples and guidelines for such accounting. We could do the accounting here but i don't understand the design of your experiment (probably due to difference in vocabulary, it could be easier if you explained it in formal (i.e. math) script with care to define the indices). You might also want to Check the following paper Hurlbert, S.H. (1984) Pseudoreplication and the design of ecological field experiments. Ecological Monographs, 54, 187â€“211.
