What is the situation with Android support for OMA DRM?

I have searched for references on this issue but all of my attempts have been unsucessful so far. I would like to know to what extent does Android supports the OMA DRM specification? Does anyone knows of a reference that states what can be expected from different versions of Android? It seems that this specification is actually less supported with newer versions of Android (Eclair, Froyo) than it is with older version (Cupcake). For example, in my tests with download descriptors, the devices using Cupcake could download correctly while the devices using Froyo and Eclair showed the DD as xml. In similar fashion, can we expect the support of the OMA DRM spec. to be the same for all devices running a given version of Android or does it vary with each device? (In different words: is the version of Android tailored for each device by the manufacturer)
