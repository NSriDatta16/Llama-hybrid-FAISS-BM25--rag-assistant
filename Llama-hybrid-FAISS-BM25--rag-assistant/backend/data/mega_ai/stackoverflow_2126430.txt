I tried a number of different values for $ua->agent(""); but nothing nothings seems to work. Well, would you like to tell us what those things you tried were? What I normally do is type javascript:prompt('your agent string is',navigator.userAgent) into my regular browser's URL bar, hit enter, and cut and paste what it tells me. Surely using wireshark and monitoring actual packets is overkill? The website you're trying to get to has no way of knowing you're using Perl. Just tell it whatever it expects to hear.
