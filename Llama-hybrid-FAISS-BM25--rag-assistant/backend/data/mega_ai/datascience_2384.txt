Text-Classification-Problem, what is the right approach?

I'm planing to write a classification program that is able to classify unknown text in around 10 different categories and if none of them fits it would be nice to know that. It is also possible that more then one category is right. My predefined categories are: c1 = "politics" c2 = "biology" c3 = "food" ... I'm thinking about the right approach in how to represent my training-data or what kind of classification is the right one. The first challenge is about finding the right features. If I only have text (250 words each) what method would you recommend to find the right features? My first approach is to remove all stop-words and use the POS-Tagger ( Stanford NLP POS-Tagger ) to find nouns, adjective etc. I count them an use all frequently appeared words as features. e.g. politics, I've around 2.000 text-entities. With the mentioned POS-Tagger I found: law: 841 capitalism: 412 president: 397 democracy: 1007 executive: 112 ... Would it be right to use only that as features? The trainings-set would then look like: Training set for politics: feature law numeric feature capitalism numeric feature president numeric feature democracy numeric feature executive numeric class politics,all_others sample data: politics,5,7,1,9,3 politics,14,4,6,7,9 politics,9,9,9,4,2,1 politics,5,8,0,7,6 ... all_others,0,2,4,1,0 all_others,0,0,1,1,1 all_others,7,4,0,0,0 ... Would this be a right approach for binary-classification? Or how would I define my sets? Or is multi-class classification the right approach? Then it would look like: Training set for politics: feature law numeric feature capitalism numeric feature president numeric feature democracy numeric feature executive numeric feature genetics numeric feature muscle numeric feature blood numeric feature burger numeric feature salad numeric feature cooking numeric class politics,biology,food sample data: politics,5,7,1,9,3,0,0,2,1,0,1 politics,14,4,6,7,9,0,0,0,0,0,1 politics,9,9,9,4,2,1,1,1,1,0,3 politics,5,8,0,7,6,2,2,0,1,0,1 ... biology,0,2,4,1,0,4,19,5,0,2,2 biology,0,0,1,1,1,12,9,9,2,1,1 biology,7,4,0,0,0,10,10,3,0,0,7 ... What would you say?
