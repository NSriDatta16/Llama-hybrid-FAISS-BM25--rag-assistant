Unless you are able to come up with a structure on your own you will never truly be able to understand the concepts behind the application you are trying to create. I recommend taking a day or two just to plan out your project. Worry about design last. I would love to help but like others here, we have our own projects to handle :P Best of luck!! Edit: Ill take a second to explain how I do this. I code primarily in PHP/MySQL. Step 1: Think of all the things you would like your web site to accomplish. Step 2: Think of the information that may need to be stored. Plan out your databases according to this. List the fields, and then move on to the next step. e.g. Job Listings Database , User Database etc. Step 3: Think of the pages you will need. e.g Employee Login , Employer Login , Submit Resume etc. and think about how the databases will send their information to these pages. Refine your databases in this step, make sure you have the correct fields to accomplish the desired tasks. Step 4: Think of the file structure you will use. Many people follow a traditional MVC Format. I am working on my own right now, it makes things much easier and far more organized. Learn more about MVC Step 5: Sign up for SO! The best thing you can have is a place to go and gather ideas from people. Sometimes you may get a mental block! Again, best of luck! Chris
