Trace to Opera Dragonfly

I am using Opera on a Windows PC and developing for a device. I can telnet into the device and manually run the browser which gives me the browser output. Is it possible to trace messages into both Dragonfly and the Opera console? I can see a window.alert() message show up in the console, but I would also like to trace messages for simpler debugging and status tracking both within Dragonfly on PC and Opera on the device.
