Servlets, JSP, Java?

I'm quite confused about some terms, I know Java for writting some "usual executable" programs. But I found that you can do servlets with java, and then heard of JSP. I'm not sure about the diference of servlets and JSP.. I dont get the idea, I think it's like PHP or something like that. Do you have any organized reference (or mind to explain the transition of "usual" Java to this technologies) about this? Thanks.
