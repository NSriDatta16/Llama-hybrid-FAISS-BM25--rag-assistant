I have a solution that (probably) isn't listed (as I haven't read through all of the ones here just yet...) You can track unique users through their browser's User Agent String. Essentially, by checking which information is available 'unique' you'd be able to get enough information to distinguish between different people (even on the same IP address). Check out this article written by the EFF As well as this site (also by the EFF) that will 'test' your uniques just based on your User Agent from the browser. For even better uniqueness, you'd be able to do a comparison between the bits of information from the uniqueness AND the ip address to really get the possibilities down to the offenders/bots. also checkout this pdf from EFF
