Transferring files via USB is not officially supported on the iPhone platform and Apple probably won't approve your App if you'd use it: http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/02/apple-stanza-usb/ For now, you should send the files as emails and hope for some kind of file storage support in the next version of iPhone OS.
