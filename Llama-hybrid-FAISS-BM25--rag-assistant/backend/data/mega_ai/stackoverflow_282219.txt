I haven't actually tried this, but I think it should work: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Mozilla/4.0\ \(compatible;\ MSIE\ [1-6]\. RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} ^(.+)(\.png)$ RewriteCond %18%2 -f RewriteRule ^(.+)\.png$ $18.png [L,QSA] The first line turns mod_rewrite on (and can be omitted if you've already done that). The second does the IE 8.png exists. The fifth line actually does the redirect.
