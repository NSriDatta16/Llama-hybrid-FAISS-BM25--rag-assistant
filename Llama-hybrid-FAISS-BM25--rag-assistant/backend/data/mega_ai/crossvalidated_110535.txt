Texts on Various Topics in Statistics (GLMs, MCMC, Decision Trees, etc.)

I am currently looking for texts (or preferably a specific text) which have a good balance between theory and application and are as comprehensive as possible and are at an introductory level , covering these topics: Markov Chains, MCMC, GLMs and extended linear models, Decision Trees, Spatial Statistics, Visualization & Fit, Neural Nets, Ensemble Methods From my research, it seems that these are topics covered in a master's level statistics program, but I've only had an undergraduate background and don't know what are the standard texts for such topics. Edit: Needless to say, I would like more detailed answers/feedback on this topic. Edit2: The answers below are nice, but I would like answers which address all topics if possible. As mentioned in the bounty description, this list of topics will be covered in a future actuarial exam. No source material has been announced for this exam yet.
