Standardization does not affect the correlation between variables. They remain exactly the same. The correlation captures the synchronization of the direction of the variables. There is nothing in standardization that does change the direction of the variables. If you want to eliminate multicollinearity between your variables, I suggest using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As you know PCA is very effective in eliminating the multicollinearity problem. On the other hand PCA renders the combined variables (principal components P1, P2, etc...) rather opaque. A PCA model is always a lot more challenging to explain than a more traditional multivariate one.
