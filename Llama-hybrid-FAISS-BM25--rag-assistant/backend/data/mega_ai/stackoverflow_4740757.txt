WPF ComboBox that shows nothing selected when disabled (IsEnabled == false)

I'm thinking out different ways to have a WPF ComboBox show blank as if nothing is selected when IsEnabled is set to false. Like always I'm trying to do this without having to redefine the whole control template for the ComboBox which is always a struggle I have with WPF. If anybody has any solutions more elegant than redefining the whole ComboBox control template please let me know. The reason for what I'm trying to do is I have a CheckBox that represents an "All" option and when checked it disables the ComboBox which is used to pick only a single individual item. If my CheckBox is checked it is sometimes confusing to the users to see a value remaining in the ComboBox since that value has no meaning in that state of the UI. Another requirement is that the solution cannot modify the SelectedValue , SelectedIndex , or SelectedItem values of the ComboBox since I would like to retain the previuosly selected item in the case that the users unchecks the "All" CheckBox . Solution based on HCL's answer:
