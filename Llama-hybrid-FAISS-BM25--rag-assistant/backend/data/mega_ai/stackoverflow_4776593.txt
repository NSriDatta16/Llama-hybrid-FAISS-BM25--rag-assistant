How to class-dump iPad apps?

I am trying to run class-dump an iPad app to explore its architecture. I extracted the .ipa file using The Unarchiver and from inside the Payload folder, I ran class-dump on the .app file. However, I get this error: /* * Generated by class-dump 3.3.3 (64 bit). * * class-dump is Copyright (C) 1997-1998, 2000-2001, 2004-2010 by Steve Nygard. */ #pragma mark - /* * File: /Users/jason/Desktop/foo/Foo.app/Foo * UUID: 1234567890 * Arch: arm v7 (armv7) * * Objective-C Garbage Collection: Unsupported * This file is encrypted: * cryptid: 0x00000001, cryptoff: 0x00001000, cryptsize: 0x00073000 */ Any ideas? Thanks.
