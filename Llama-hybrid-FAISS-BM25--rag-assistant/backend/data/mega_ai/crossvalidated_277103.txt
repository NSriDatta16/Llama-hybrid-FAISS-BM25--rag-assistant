Autoregression vs Sliding Window method

I'm a beginner at machine learning and have a question regarding time series. I have a data set dependent over time, with a single feature and I am trying to predict the future value of this. This far I have used what I think is a sliding window. I model my data as: W Value 1 10 2 40 3 60 4 80 5 110 gives W-2 W-1 W 10 40 60 40 60 80 60 80 110 From what I understand, this is the Sliding window with a lag of 2. Now I use this data and apply Linear Regression or LinearSVR, with W as my y-label and W-2, W-1 as my z-label. The question I ask is whether this is regarded as an Autoregressive model or am I missing something? My reasoning behind this is that linear regression says: $$ Y= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon $$ and applying my features gives: $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1} + \beta_2 x_{2} + \epsilon$$ (where $Y(t)=w(t)$ and $x_i(t)=w(t-i), i=1,2$, while an autoregressive model of order $n$ is formulated: $$ w_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 w_{t-1} + ... + \beta_{n} x_{w-n} + \epsilon $$ in this case, for an AR(2): $$ w_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{t-1} + \beta_2 x_{t-2} + \epsilon$$ Is this assumption correct or is there something wrong with my reasoning? TL;DR Is an autoregression the same as this sliding window linear regression?
