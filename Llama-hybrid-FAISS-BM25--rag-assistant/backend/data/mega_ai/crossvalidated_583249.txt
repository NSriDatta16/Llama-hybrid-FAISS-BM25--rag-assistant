If I understand correctly you have a time series where every row represents a week. I am also assuming from your question that you don't have data on effort spent on every item (like hours spent selling an item per week). I would approach the problem with a sort of latent variable model with the following assumptions: We have a latent variable - effort. The amount of effort per week is constant ( number of available working hours). The amount of sales of a product is dependent on the effort spent on the product. There is some randomness that causes random variance in the sales of the product. We let effort be represented by variable $e$ , weeks by $i$ and the product sales by $X_j$ where $j$ is the item index. so $X_{ij}$ is the sales of item $X_j$ by effort put in week $i$ , $e_ij$ . So the number of sales of product $X_j$ in week $i$ is: $X_{ij} = a_j*e_{ij} + Error$ Where $a_j$ is a learned parameter relating the amount of effort to sales. and the sum of the effort each week is 1 for simplicity ( assumption 2): $e_i = \sum_{j=0}^ne_{ij} = 1 $ We now have a system of equations with n variables $a_j$ and $(n-1)*m$ variables $e_{ij}$ where $n$ is the number of total variables and $m$ is the number of weeks of data you have. and $n*m$ equations. We can solve the system of equations if $m \geqslant n $ . We can then easily find for each product the value if $e_j=1$ , it's simply $a_j$ . The problem here is that we need to decompose the effort spent on each item which requires a lot of data. The second problem is that we need to relate the sale to the week the work was done at. If you can't do it accurately I would start with a simple rule. a common rule used in such cases is "sales at week $i$ are from work done in week $i$ " or "work done in week i results in sales in week $i+1$ ". This introduces errors of course. But I'd consult the sales teams to come up with a rule that covers most cases.
