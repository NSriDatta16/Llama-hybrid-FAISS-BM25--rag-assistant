I have a graduate degree in econometrics specializing in times eries and survival analyis. I'll try to give you short undergrad advice instad of a proof. You should never use OLS for time-series data (the only exception is SOMETIMES it is appropriate to use this technique for panel data). OLS results will be garbage - it will result in a spurious regression in which the results look good, but are void of econometric interpretation. MLE should be used instead. The short answer to why is that the covariance between your dependent variable and your error term will never be zero, one of the foundational assumptions of OLS. Instead of fitting a linear line, we have to fit a process to the data (AR(p), MA(q), ARMA(p,q), ARIMA(p,d,q), ARIMAX(p,q,x), VAR(p), etc.) Differencing your data to make it stationary will not allow you to use OLS. Stationary data still follows a process, and your model specification should allow for this. If the error term of a two time series are stationary, then it is appropriate to use cointegration techniques, but this isn't something you should try to do on your own. If you have access to a statistial package, research how to perform a Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity to determine if your data is stationary. If not, difference the data, and (assuming stationarity after first or second differencing), fit the appropriate process using MLE to your series. Forwarning: from the description you provided of your data, it sounds like it would best be modelled using vector autoregression with a transfer function (VARMAX(p,q,x)). This is also known as a recursive VAR. This is appropriate if you're trying to determine if (assumed to be stationary) multiple time series are predicting another time series. These are very accurate when modelled correctly, but they are not parsimonous (you need a large number of degrees of freedom, and you're already using a estimation prodecure that is only asymptotically unbiased, so hopefully you have plenty of observations), and it isn't something I would recommmend an undergrad trying to do. Hope that helps, Keegan
