Create an implementation of System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection . According to the MSDN reference it " provides both O(1) indexed retrieval and keyed retrieval that approaches O(1)." However, it still has the limitations that Dictionary' and HashTable` have with duplicate keys not being allowed. If you need duplicate key values, or you need to be able to use different items as keys at different times, then Reed Copsey gives a very good solution.
