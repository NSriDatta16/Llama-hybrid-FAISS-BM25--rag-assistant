In feature selection do we remove the original columns used in feature engineering?

Say I have a continuous Age column and I then create a new feature as an ordinal Age Groups column like so: Children (00-14) Youth (15-24) Adults (25-64) Seniors (65 and over) When using the new Age Groups column in a correlation matrix during feature selection do I remove the original Age column prior to running the matrix? I've already noticed that if I keep both columns high +/- correlations between the two columns can occur. Since I'm just looking at the graph can I simply ignore any correlations with the Age column and just look at how Age Groups relates with the target class and all the other inputs? Would the existence of both those inputs in the same matrix create potential multicollinearity issues between other inputs or can I simply ignore any relations to Age because it's only a graph? I just have to make sure Age is removed prior to modeling?
