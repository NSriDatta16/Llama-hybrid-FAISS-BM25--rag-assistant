As the name suggests, an "artificial neural network" is a neural network that is artificial - i.e. not a biological one. The addition of the word "artificial" is there to emphasize the non-biological nature of the neural network. In the literature, the two terms "artificial neural network" and "neural network" are used basically interchangeably because it should be apparent from context what the author is talking about. If you find papers about "neural networks" and they are talking about computing then obviously they are referring to "artificial neural networks". If you find papers about "neural networks" and they are talking about biological brains/nervous systems then they are talking about biological neural networks. I am not certain how common it is to talk about "neural networks" in the biological sense.
