The easiest solution is to simply tell Xcode to compile everything as Objective C++. Set your project or target settings for Compile Sources As to Objective C++ and recompile. Then you can use C++ or Objective C everywhere, for example: void CPPObject::Function( ObjectiveCObject* context, NSView* view ) { [context renderbufferStorage:GL_RENDERBUFFER fromDrawable:(CAEAGLLayer*)view.layer] } This has the same affect as renaming all your source files from .cpp or .m to .mm. There are two minor downsides to this: clang cannot analyse C++ source code; some relatively weird C code does not compile under C++.
