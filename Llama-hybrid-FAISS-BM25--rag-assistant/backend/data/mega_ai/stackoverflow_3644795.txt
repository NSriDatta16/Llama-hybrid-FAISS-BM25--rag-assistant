Neural Network, python

I am trying to write a simple neural network that can come up with weights to for, say, the y=x function. Here's my code: http://codepad.org/rPdZ7fOz As you can see, the error level never really goes down much. I tried changing the momentum and learning rate but it did not help much. Is my number of input, hidden and output correct for what I want to do? If not, what should it be? If so, what else could be wrong?
