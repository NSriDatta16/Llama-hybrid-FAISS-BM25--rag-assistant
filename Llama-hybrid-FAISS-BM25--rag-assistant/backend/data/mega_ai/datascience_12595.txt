Recommendations and Missing Data in Deep Learning

In this research paper, it is discussed how to combine deep learning with wide (shallow) learning to achieve both generalisation and the ability to learn correlation/association rules. The input vector of such network is an n-dimensional vector of features $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3,\dots, x_n)$. While training, the following objective function is maximised: $$ P(Y=1|\mathbf{x}) $$ Within the context of recommender systems (which is one of the main applications of this paper) how does one cope with the problem of missing data (unseen products)?
