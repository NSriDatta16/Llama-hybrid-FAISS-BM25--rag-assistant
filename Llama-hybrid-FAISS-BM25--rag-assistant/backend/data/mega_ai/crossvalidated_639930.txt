I ended up generating many random predictors and seeing what their importance score was looking like. I got at the end a range of importance levels stemming from random variables, that I saw like this: conservative selection of variables: take the highest importance level achieved by a random variable and set it as a threshold for the selection non-conservative selection of variables: take the lowest importance Average: in the middle I ended up taking the most conservative approach to reduce the size of my dataset from 2000 predictors to about 200, but the range did not differ that much from the non-conservative approach, which would have led to about 300 predictors.
