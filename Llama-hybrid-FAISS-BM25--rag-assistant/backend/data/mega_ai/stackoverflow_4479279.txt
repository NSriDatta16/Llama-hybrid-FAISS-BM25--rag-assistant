My question is how do I get the link information AND the comment when a dd tag is present? Use : //DT/a | //DT[a]/following-sibling::*[1][self::DD] This selects all a elements that have a DT parent and all DD elements that are the immediate following sibling element of a DT element that has an a child. Note : The use of the // is strongly discouraged because it usually leads to inefficiencies and anomalies in its use for the developers. Whenever the structure of the XML document is known, avoid using the // abbreviation .
