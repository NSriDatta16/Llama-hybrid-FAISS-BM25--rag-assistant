List of #pragma warning disable codes and what they mean

The syntax for disabling warnings is as follows: #pragma warning disable 414, 3021 Or, expressed more generally: #pragma warning disable [CSV list of numeric codes] Is there a list of these numeric codes and the description of the warning that they're suppressing? Much to my chagrin, I can't seem to locate it via Google.
