In my mind they are equally intuitive. What matters, whether using nonparametric smoothers, fractional polynomials, or splines, is that the quality of fit per degree of freedom spent is good on the average. Note that fractional polynomials have a few disadvantages: $X$ must be $>0$ and if you shift $X$ by adding a constant the form of the fractional polynomial needed for a good fit can change substantially.
