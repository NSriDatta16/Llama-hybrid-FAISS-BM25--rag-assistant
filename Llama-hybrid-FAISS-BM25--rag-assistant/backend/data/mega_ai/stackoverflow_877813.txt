is display: block - typically it forms a box area around your content and you'll get something like a linebreak after it (although it's not a linebreak, exactly, because 'div' and 'line' are not concepts that go together). is display: inline, which means that its content is flowed (i.e. wrapped) in a paragraph, like a bold or italic highlighting. It doesn't even always take a box shape: imagine This is a paragraph and this is a highlighted section. which needs two boxes to describe the spanned inline element (set borders on to see how it looks). You probably want to use block elements for menus, because the box sizing makes it simpler to even the height (and optionally the width) of the menu elements - inline elements can leave you with variable heights and widths - simplifying the situation greatly. With block elements, use float: left to make them line up next to each other horizontally. But there are so many complications and opinions on this that you'd be better off researching the situation more thoroughly - I recommend http://www.alistapart.com/ for starters, which has several worked menu examples.
