Finding an MLE fit when a model predicts two kinds of data, each with a different distribution / data model

My problem is as follows: I am fitting some multi-parameter models which predict two different kinds of data. I can find a best (MLE) fit to the first kind of data. I'm currently expressing both the model predictions and the data as a multinomial distribution. In this case I get an exact probability that a particular model/parameter combination generates the data. I can also find a best (MLE) fit to the second kind of data. This is a bit more ropey, as the errors are correlated (it's a time series), but I think I have a reasonable approximation using a multivariate normal distribution and taking an educated guess at an appropriate covariance matrix. Here, the likelihood that a particular model/parameter combination generates the data is taken from the multivariate normal distribution, so this is not an exact probability. My problem is how to find a combined best fit to both kinds of data at once. Can I just combine the (log) likelihoods to effectively scalarize what seems like a multi-objective optimization problem? This feels slightly dodgy, given the exact vs. arbitrarily scaled nature of the two objective functions, but it also feels like that scaling should just fall out as a constant when I take logs, leaving all data weighted appropriately. However, my maths is too awful to be trusted. Apologies if this is an unusually dumb question, but can anyone advise?
