GAN losses balance, but quality of generated image still bad

I build a GAN to train on the fashion mnist dataset. To facilitate the training, I have added gaussian noise with mean 0 and stddev 0.15 on the images. My generator is a 2 layer MLP with sigmoid activation, discriminator is a logistic regression I trained this for 100k rounds and the loss started to stablize at around 20000. So I thought this is good, since the loss of the generator and discriminator are not too far apart. But looking at the generated images, it's another story I wonder why? Similar situation has happened before when I built a variational autoencoder.
