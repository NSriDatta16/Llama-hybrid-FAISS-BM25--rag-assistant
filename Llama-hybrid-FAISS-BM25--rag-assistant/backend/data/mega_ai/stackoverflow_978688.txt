using pragma or any programmatic way of excluding a cpp/header file from a project in Visual Studio

I know there are other questions regarding that, and I also know that I can right click on the files that I want excluded, and select Exclude from Project . However. I'm wondering if there are any easy ways of achieving the same purpose programmatically. For example, in a VS project, to link with an external library, I can either add the library name in the project's settings under Linker options, or use "pragma comment(lib, library name in char*)". I'm wondering if this can be achieved similar to how I have described my example.
