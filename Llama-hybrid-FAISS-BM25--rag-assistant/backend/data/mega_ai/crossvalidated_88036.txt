Mixed-effect logistic regression in R - questions

I am new to R, and don't see these questions answered anywhere in documentation (though I could be wrong). I am using the following nomenclature to run my mixed-effects logistic regression, based on instructions from another site: output RE is a factor with several levels. This works. But I'm wondering why it's necessary to use the (1 | RE) syntax instead of just DV~IV1+IV2 | RE . I am running two mixed effects logistic regressions. On one of them I can view the random effects intercepts using ranef() . But I get all 0s when I run ranef on the output of the other one. Both regressions/data are ostensibly the same. What do all 0s for the random effects intercepts mean?
