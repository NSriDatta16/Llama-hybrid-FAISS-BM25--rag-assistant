Xie and Chen have a paper on Cauchy PCA ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6506 ) which is explicitly intended for use with information that has undefined or infinite variance. One of the nice things about this paper is that they introduce the approach by discussing four patterns to data -- sparse small noise, sparse large noise, dense small noise and dense large noise -- and the assumptions appropriate for each: Gaussian PCA for small noise, Laplace PCA for sparse noise, probabilistic PCA for dense noise and Cauchy PCA as a robust solution for all noise patterns. This typology makes a lot of sense to me. In addition and upon request, the authors will provide some simple Matlab code for implementation.
