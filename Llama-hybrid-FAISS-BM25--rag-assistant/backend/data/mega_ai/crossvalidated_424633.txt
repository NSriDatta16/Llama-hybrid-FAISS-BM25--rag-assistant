Overall significance of a categorical variables in logistic regression

I have seen two approaches in binary logistic regression with categorical independent variables (IV) with more than two levels. In one approach, a reference category for the IV is defined and the rest of the categories are tested regarding this reference category,thus obtaining p-values for each category compared to the reference category (which is what I typically do). However, I have seen logistic regressions outputs showing an overall significance (or global significance) for categorical IVs outputs (only one p-value). I don't understand the second approach. I have read similar threads, but I have specific questions that they do not resolve: What additional information does the second approach really provide? If there is an overall significance, would not be there differences between some of the categories? Does the second approach assume that the IV is continuous (providing an estimate by unit of change in X)? Could it happen that there were differences between the categories of an IV, but the overall test was not significant? Perhaps they are basic questions, but I would appreciate your help.
