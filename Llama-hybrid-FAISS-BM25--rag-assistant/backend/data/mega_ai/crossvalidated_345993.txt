Why cointegrate a variable if we make it stationary?

So I have a data set, it containss 4 variables (GDP, consumer price index, interest, house price index) and around 88 sample. Quarterly data from years 1995-2007. Two of them look like this https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXyiP.jpg and I difference mortgage and HOX, mortgage to the first to I(1) and HOX needed to be at I(2) so they have a unit root (and therefore also are stationary time series, correct me if I'm wrong). My question is: why do I need to do Johanses cointegration test? I found this online: https://i.stack.imgur.com/IF7Qr.jpg and https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pko4f.jpg .. :/ When I ran Johanses cointegration test, and I got this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8S4Uu.jpg The lags are chosen using the AIC criteria (It picked 5 as the best) What is going on? Do I really need the cointegration test? since I've already make them stationary/they have now unit root I don't get this at all. What can I do - if this is wrong? ps. I'm using EViews.
