Build graph-oriented visual editor on jquery

We need to build the javascript-based visual editor (on jQuery) which should edit some graph-represented model. Entities should be represented as nodes and will have properties. Nodes (or/and their properties) should be linked to other nodes. Nodes should be draggable. Are there any tutorials and jQuery plugins which can ease the development? Thanks. UPD: Probably draggable nodes can be implemented with the help of jQueryUI. The main problem is to implement links. UPD2: Seems like jsgraphics solves the problem somehow. But it does in a very inventive way and has nothing related to jQuery.
