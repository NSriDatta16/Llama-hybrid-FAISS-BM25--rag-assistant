Counting builds

I have a dozen of build plans managed by a unique build agent. What I want to do, is to get the total number of triggered/scheduled builds on those plans (without counting them manually from the interface). So, question is, is there a kind of counter on the server? UPDATE #1: I'm using the v2.2.1. UPDATE #2: On the server interface (Administration -> System -> System Information), there are some statistics including how many builds the server performed. But, this number is reinitialized when the server goes down.
