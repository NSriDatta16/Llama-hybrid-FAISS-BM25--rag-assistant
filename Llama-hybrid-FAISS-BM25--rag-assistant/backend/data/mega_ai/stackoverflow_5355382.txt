UI Button with Image Smaller than Touchable Area

I've not much response so am adding some more info. My buttons are not rectangular, nor organised in a grid so I need a way of creating what looks like a button (and shows that it has been pressed visually, as per a standard UIButton) but where the touchable area is different to the image area. I am using a transparent PNG and that element works fine. I've added the buttons in Interface Builder and am wondering if that is the problem. However, if I change imageEdgeInsets, it distorts the image display, which is obviously not what I want. Bizarrely, if I increase the dimemsions of the button, it doesn't change the image, but if I decrease them it does. I have tried different combinations of mode (scale to fill etc), but to no avail. I am aware that there is an image and background image property, but in IB there is only one. Essentially, I don't understand how the geometry works and the Apple documentation doesn't seem to help. Surely, I can't be the only person to try to do this. Any help would be warmly welcomed. Many thanks, Chris.
