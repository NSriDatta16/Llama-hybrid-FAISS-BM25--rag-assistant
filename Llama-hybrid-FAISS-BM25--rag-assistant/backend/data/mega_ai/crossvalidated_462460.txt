Averaging the linear regression coefficients

Isn't it always better to make a number of linear regression models on different samples (sampled out using random sampling) of data set and then taking average of the regression coefficients for all variables? The reason I am asking this question is that I have read somewhere that the regression coefficient of a variable is distributed normally with mean equal to the population parameter.Although , I am not very clear about this concept , so please correct me if I am wrong. Also , if I am correct , is it necessary to make same type of model (having same features) each time I take a new sample to train with (so that the regression coefficients are distributed normally).
