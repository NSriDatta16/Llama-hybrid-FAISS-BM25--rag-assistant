Two helpful things :he 'path' :he tabfind So you would do :set path=../,/usr/include/,/home/buildagent/SDKROOT/mysdk/inc :tabfind error_codes.h to open error_codes.h from somewhere exotic without having to specify it. Note how vim globbing is very very flexible, so you might not need mucht :argadd ./**/*.[h,H] | tab sall will open all header files under the current directory, regardless of how many levels deep. Be careful running this command on a large tree or with symlinks outside the tree
