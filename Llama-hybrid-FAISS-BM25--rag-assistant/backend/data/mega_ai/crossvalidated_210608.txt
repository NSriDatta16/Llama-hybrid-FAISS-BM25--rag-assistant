Relationship between Gaussian process and Regression by supervised learning model like SVR

Recently, I often see studies about Gaussian Process, and started to learn it. I'm familiar with regression models using machine learning such as Support Vector Regression. SVR learns a training data $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_i$ and predict $y_t$ from $x_t$. Could you show the relationship between Gaussian Process and regression model by supervised learning such as SVR?
