The Astels book is a solid introduction, Beck's book is good on the underlying concepts, Lasse Koskela has a newish one (Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers) . Osherove's book , as he says, is about Unit Testing, rather than TDD. I'm not sure that the Pragmatics' TDD book has aged as well as their original book. Most everything is Java or C#, but you should be able to figure it out yourself.
