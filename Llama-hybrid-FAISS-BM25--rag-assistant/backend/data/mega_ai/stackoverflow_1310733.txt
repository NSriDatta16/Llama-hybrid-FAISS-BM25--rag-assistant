Generic way to ask which browser they're using?

I would like a text input with the question "what browser are you using" above it. Then when a form is submitted, I'd like to compare their answer to their User-Agent HTTP header. I am stumped on how to reliably make this work. I could ask them to spell it out instead of using acronyms like IE or FF, but Internet Explorer uses "MSIE" as its' identifier doesn't it? Another thought I had was to keep a pool of User-Agent strings, then present them with a select element that has theirs inserted randomly among 4 or so other random strings and asking them to select theirs. I fear non-tech-savy users would bungle this enough times for it to be a problem though. I suppose I could use some logic to make sure there's only one of each browser type among the options, but I'm leery about even that.
