Is there any Javascript framework that supports an interface like the Viewing pane in Yahoo!Mail Inbox with a preview panel below?

Apologies if this is a too basic question but I couldn't find any satisfactory answer in Google. I'm not sure if there is any open-sourced framework that provide the interface like Yahoo!Mail Inbox? To be more specific, I'd need a pane that shows a listing of items on top (and the items are sortable, draggable...), and when a user click on an item, the content will be displayed in the "Preview pane" below. (screenshot attached). Thanks a lot for any hints or pointers on where to start.! screenshot
