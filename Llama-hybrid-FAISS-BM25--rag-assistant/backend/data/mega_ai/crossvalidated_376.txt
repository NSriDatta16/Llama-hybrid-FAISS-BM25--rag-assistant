There's no reason you couldn't try to minimize norms other than x^2, there have been entire books written on quantile regression, for instance, which is more or less minimizing |x| if you're working with the median. It's just generally harder to do and, depending on the error model, may not give good estimators (depending on whether that means low-variance or unbiased or low MSE estimators in the context). As for why we prefer integer moments over real-number-valued moments, the main reason is likely that while integer powers of real numbers always result in real numbers, non-integer powers of negative real numbers create complex numbers, thus requiring the use of an absolute value. In other words, while the 3rd moment of a real-valued random variable is real, the 3.2nd moment is not necessarily real, and so causes interpretation problems. Other than that... Analytical expressions for the integer moments of random variables are typically much easier to find than real-valued moments, be it by generating functions or some other method. Methods to minimize them are thus easier to write. The use of integer moments leads to expressions that are more tractable than real-valued moments. I can't think of a compelling reason that (for instance) the 1.95th moment of the absolute value of X would provide better fitting properties than (for instance) the 2nd moment of X, although that could be interesting to investigate Specific to the L2 norm (or squared error), it can be written via dot products, which can lead to vast improvements in speed of computation. It's also the only Lp space that's a Hilbert space, which is a nice feature to have.
