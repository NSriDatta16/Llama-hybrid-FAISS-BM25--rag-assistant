You may ask yourself, what is the goal of building this model. Are you trying to get a better prediction performance? Or you want a linear model that statistically significant. These two goals are not necessarily aligned. From machine learning perspective, you always want to know you are overfitting or under-fitting. If you already under fitting, regularization will make it worse.
