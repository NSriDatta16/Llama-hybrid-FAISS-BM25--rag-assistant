Loading Notation3 into a Database

How do you parse and load the triples represented by a Notation3 file into a database? I'm somewhat familiar with Jena and Sesame , but these seemed geared to process RDF or Turtle, not full Notation3. I've found relatively few robust tools for dealing with N3. The few I've found are listed here , and only consist of rough Python scripts that can only do basic command line actions and seem to have no standard packaging, distribution or maintenance. The default Python library appears to be notation3.py but I couldn't find a single homepage for it, and found dozens of differing versions scattered around the Internet. For example, say I have the following N3 representing a botanical classification: { [] :genus "Abies" ; :species "alba" ; :name [:value "Silver Fir" ; :usage "common" ; :language "English" ] ; :name [:value "European Silver Fir" ; :usage "common" ; :language "English" ] ; :name [:value "abeto blanco" ; :usage "common" ; :language "Spanish" ] ; :name [:value "abeto plateado" ; :usage "common" ; :language "Spanish" ] ; :name [:value "Edeltanne" ; :usage "common" ; :language "German" ] ; :name [:value "Silbertanne" ; :usage "common" ; :language "German" ] ; :name [:value "Wei&#xDF;tanne" ; :usage "common" ; :language "German" ] ; :stem!:type :erect ; :stem!:height [ :value!:start 30.0 ; :value!:end 50.0 ; :value!:units "m" ] ; :bark!:color :grey ; :bark!:ridges :irregular ; :foliage!:seasonality :evergreen ; :foliage!:type :needle ; :foliage!:arrangement :alternate ; :foliage!:length [ :value!:start 1.0 ; :value!:end 3.0 ; :value!:units "cm" ] ; :foliage!:width [ :value!:start 0.2 ; :value!:end 0.3 ; :value!:units "cm" ] ; :foliage!:color :green ; :foliage!:spiney :FALSE ; :flower [ :gender :male ; :inflorescence :catkin ; :sense :straight ; :color :brown ] ; :flower [ :gender :male ; :inflorescence :catkin ; :sense :straight ; :color :yellow ] ; :flower [ :gender :female ; :inflorescence :catkin ; :sense :straight ; :color :pink ] ; :fruit [ :kind :cone ; :color :brown ; ] ; } :is-a :botanical-classification ; :source [ :uri ; :name "John Doe" ; :data-collection-date "2005-01-01" ; ] ; :transcribed-by "Al Nonymous" ; :transcription-date "2010-09-01" . I want to be able to load this (and potentially thousands of similar records) into a database so I can run arbitrary queries like, "Who transcribed records containing common Spanish names in the year 2010?" or "What's the average flower color associated with the genus X?" Is this currently practical to do with current semantic web tools and N3?
