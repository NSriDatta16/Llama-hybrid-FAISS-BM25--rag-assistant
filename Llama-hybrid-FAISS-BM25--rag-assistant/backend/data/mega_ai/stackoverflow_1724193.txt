No While you can certainly use jQuery without knowing JavaScript, there's absolutely no way to become an "expert" at jQuery without knowing JavaScript. You'll be fine without a JavaScript background if you just need basic animations, event handlers, and DOM traversal. But being an "expert" at jQuery presumably requires more than that, in which case you'll need to learn JavaScript in order to write clean, elegant, and maintainable jQuery code.
