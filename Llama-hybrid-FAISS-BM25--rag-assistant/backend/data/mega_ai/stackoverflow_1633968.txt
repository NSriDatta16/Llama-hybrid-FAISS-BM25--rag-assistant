That MDF file is a SQL Server database. All SQL Server versions (except CE) use the same file format, so the MDF can be opened by any other SQL Server using sp_attach_db or SSMS, see How to: Attach a Database (SQL Server Management Studio). . Once attached to your SQL Server, SSMS can script out the entire database, see How to: Generate a Script (SQL Server Management Studio) . Also this can be done programatically, using the SMO Scripter object. The SSMS script will contain all the table, index, procedure and every other objects in the database. There is also an Import and Export Wizard in SSMS and you can use this to export your tables content (any data) into a CSV file and then import this CSV file into your hosted database, but that import/export wizard is fairly complex (it uses SSIS). Another alternative for the data export is to use bcp utility, see Bulk Import and Bulk Export Operations . Tehcnically you can doo all these operations using the SQL Server Express instance in your VS environment, using command line tools like sqlcmd and bcp, and perhaps writing your own SMO Scripter application to export the database schema. However, it requires a certain level of experience. It will be tonnes easier to have access to a fully fledged Managent Studio to preare all the data to be imported at your hosting site. Don't forget to check with your provider if they allow to restore or attach your own database, then you may get away easy with just a file copy to the provider. Note that your MDF file will only be possible to attach it to a SQL Server of at least the same version as the one you have created with. You're VS environment contains a SQL Server, probably named SQLEXPRESS, and you must check exactly what version it is. Servers of an earlier build than your VS SQL instance version will refuse to attach your MDF file, since its a format they do no recognize. Follow the steps in KB 321185 to determine what SQL Server version your VS environment has. Update I wasn't aware VS has an export wizard. Just follow the steps Gary mentions in the link he provides.
