you could cast the result if you want less precision: SQL> SELECT TO_DSINTERVAL('10 10:00:00') t_interval FROM dual; T_INTERVAL ----------------------------------------------------------- +000000010 10:00:00.000000000 SQL> SELECT CAST(TO_DSINTERVAL('10 10:00:00') 2 AS INTERVAL DAY(2) TO SECOND(3)) t_interval 3 FROM dual; T_INTERVAL ----------------------------------------------------------- +10 10:00:00.000 Edit following OP comment: From The Oracle Documentation (11gr1) : Interval datatypes do not have format models. Therefore, to adjust their presentation, you must combine character functions such as EXTRACT and concatenate the components. It seems you will have to manually use EXTRACT to achieve the desired output: SQL> SELECT to_char(extract(DAY FROM t_interval), 'fmS99999') || ' ' || 2 to_char(extract(HOUR FROM t_interval), 'fm00') || ':' || 3 to_char(extract(MINUTE FROM t_interval), 'fm00') || ':' || 4 to_char(extract(SECOND FROM t_interval), 'fm00.000') 5 FROM (SELECT TO_DSINTERVAL('10 01:02:55.895') t_interval FROM dual) 6 ; TO_CHAR(EXTRACT(DAYFROMT_INTER ------------------------------ +10 01:02:55.895 This is not very elegant but it seems it is the only way to deal with microseconds precision.
