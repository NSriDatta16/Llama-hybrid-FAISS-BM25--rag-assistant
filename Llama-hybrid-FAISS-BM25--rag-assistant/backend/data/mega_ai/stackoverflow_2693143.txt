Software Metrics in Agile Methodologies

Agile methodologies are rather prevalent these days, but I cannot seem to find much documentation on what metrics are most useful and why. I have found many more things saying that some traditional metrics like LOC and code coverage of tests are not appropriate, leaving two main questions: Why are those two (and other) metrics inappropriate? What metrics are best for Agile and why? Even with an Agile process, wouldn't you want to know how much code coverage you have with your unit tests? Or is it simply that this metric (and others) just are not as useful as other metrics like cyclomatic complexity and velocity?
