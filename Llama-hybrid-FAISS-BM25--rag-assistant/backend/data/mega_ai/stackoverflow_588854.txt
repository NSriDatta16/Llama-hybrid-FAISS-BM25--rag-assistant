What kind of content? XML? Then yes, if properly tagged at the top. Generic text files? I don't know of any a-priori way to know what encoding is used, although it might be possible, sometimes, with clever code. "Tagged" UTF-8 text files, by which I mean UTF-8 text files with a Byte-Order mark ? (For UTF-8, the three byte sequence "ï»¿") Probably. The Byte Order Mark characters will not commonly appear as the first three characters in a ISO-8859-1 encoded file. (Which bobince pointed out in a comment to this post, so I'm correcting my post.) For your purposes, tools exist that can probably solve most of your question. Logan Capaldo pointed out one in his answer . But after all, if it were always possible to figure out, unambiguously, what character encoding was used in a file, then the iconv utility wouldn't need you to provide the "from" encoding. :)
