Efficient feature selection in regression analysis

It's a Deja Vu problem but I want to discuss in a computationally efficient perspective. Assuming I am running a ordinary linear regression, I have hundreds of factors features to choose from. I want to be able to choose what factors features to include, if I actually include one, how would it change the $t$-statistic, $R^2$, etc. I would like to do this in an "interactive manner", i.e. I hand-pick a new one, see the updated results, etc, then de-select another old one, etc. I want to do all of these without rerunning the regression on every data point. I imagine I should pre-dump some data such as covariance etc and compute based on such data. But I couldn't come up with an elegant solution. Can someone point me to a direction?
