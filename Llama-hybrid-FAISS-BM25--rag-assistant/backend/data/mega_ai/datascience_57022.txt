I do not think this is possible with the main (as I can tell) xgboost library, because this essentially sounds like a regression on rates/proportions situation (a dependent variable bounded in [0,1]). An easy way to have implemented this would have been to allow the Beta distribution (see how it is bounded) as an objective function in xgboost , but it is not an option at this point.
