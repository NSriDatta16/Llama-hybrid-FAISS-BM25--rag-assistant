To disable warnings on a per-file basis, using Xcode 3 and llvm-gcc-4.2 you can use: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wwarning-flag" Where warning name is some gcc warning flag. This overrides any warning flags on the command line. It doesn't work with all warnings though. Add -fdiagnostics-show-option to your CFLAGS and you can see which flag you can use to disable that warning.
