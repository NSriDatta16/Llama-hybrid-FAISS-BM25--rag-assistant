Principal components analysis

I was working on an exercise that asks me to get a k-dimensional approximation of a data vector using PCA (containing 4096 dimensions - the faces data set). I did this in R, but the last section asks for a "short mathematical expression for how you construct the approximation where you need to account appropriately for the mean and standard deviation terms". I am familiar how to derive the PC's of the covariance matrix using eigen decomposition but I don't get the "accounting for the mean and sd" part. Can someone help?
