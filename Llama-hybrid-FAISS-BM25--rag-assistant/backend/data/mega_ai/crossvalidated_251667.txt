Have a look at ARIMA models to see if you can decompose each time series into seasonality (fluctuates over summer vs. winter) and trend components (year over year changes). As these measures should be independent of the sampling frequency (15 mins versus 30 mins), you can then compare the measures for A and B to determine if there is a relation between A and B. Just to confirm that the sampling period doesn't afect the analysis I would also average successive pairs of A into 30 minute samples and then perform ARIMA on equal-sized time series. You do in fact have two seasonalities, in that sunlight varies both across the day and across the year. Another approach would be to calculate the average per day for both A and B and perform an ARIMA decomposition on the daily time series, which of course should be directly comparable. For performing ARIMA the auto.arima() function in Rob Hyndman's R package forecast is very powerful: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/7 If you really want to compare both the daily and yearly seasonality, check out Hyndman's TBATS() function which supports multiple seasonality decomposition: http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-weekly-data/
