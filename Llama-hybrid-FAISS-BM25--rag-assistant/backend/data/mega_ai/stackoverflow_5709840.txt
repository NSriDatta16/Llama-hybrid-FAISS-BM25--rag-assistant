Non-Photorealistic Computer Graphics : Modeling, Rendering, and Animation (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics) by Thomas Strothotte. This book looks like a goldmine. It covers things like stippling, drawing incorrect lines, drawing artistic lines, simulating painting with wet paint, simulating pencils, strokes and textures, etc. Microsoft and Adobe have a visible presence in this field of work, and of course employ people who are prominently involved in the NPR field, and you will see their names (or that of their employers') often appear as participants and sponsors of events like the upcoming NPAR 2011 (Sponsored by adobe). Microsoft has the impressive Project Gustav ( video ) - a software application dedicated exclusively to very realistically simulating traditional artistic tools such as paint, chalk, pencil, etc. Detail Preserving Paint Modeling of 3D Brushes .
