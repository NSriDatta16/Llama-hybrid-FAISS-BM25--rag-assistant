How can I access user-installed keys and certificates from my Android app?

I've been struggling to consume user installed identity CA certs from a p12 file on an SD card. The certs and keys are installed using the Secure Credential Storage (Location & Security > Install from SD card). I haven't found any documentation stating the location if the keys and certificates once imported. I tried to create an instance of a TrustManagerFactory with no luck, it just contained all the pre-installed SSL certificates. Creating an KeyStore with the default parameters doesn't seem to work either. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!
