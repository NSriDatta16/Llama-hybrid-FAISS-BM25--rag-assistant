Problem with the redirection: Twitter API Oauth

I'm testing the twitter API (with OAuth) and I have a little problem, I wonder if anyone knows how to fix it, the situation is that at the time I do this (in my redirect.php): $ Url = $ connection-> getAuthorizeURL ($ token); header ("Location: $ url"); The request go to twitter, and it's authenticated, but I this return my application back to the home page, and I want to do it in the page I'm doing the OAuth. Does anyone know the solution? In short, when users log in, I want the application return it to the same page, not the beginning. Ah! When I do the log out, all is correct... because I do this (in my clearsessions.php): session_start(); session_destroy(); $redireccion = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']; header("Location: $redireccion"); My problem is in the "log in" :-) Thanks! Ehm... You can try it here: http://www.joanballestermoragues.com/oauth/test.php As you can see, the login in twitter redirect to http://www.joanballestermoragues.com/oauth/ and I want to redirect to: http://www.joanballestermoragues.com/oauth/test.php PS: Ah, any can say... "make an index.php and that's all", but no, because this is for another application, it's only a test and I need to do it in another pages than "index" :-) Thanks again
