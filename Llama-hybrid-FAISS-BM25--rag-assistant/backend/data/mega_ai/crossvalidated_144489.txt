No errors exist. We are modeling the mean! The mean is just a true number. This doesn't make sense to me. Think the response variable as a latent variable. If you assume the error term is normally distributed, then the model becomes a probit model. If you assume the distribution of the error term is logistic, then the model is logistic regression.
