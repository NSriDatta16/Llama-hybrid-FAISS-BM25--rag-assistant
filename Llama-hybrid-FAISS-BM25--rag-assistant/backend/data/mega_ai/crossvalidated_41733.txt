More good reads: The Flaw of Averages by Sam L. Savage Fooled By Randomness by Nassim Taleb Both are somewhat cautionary books about being careful towards how to interpret probability and statistics in our everyday lives. For example, in financial markets, one might misuse an everyday gaussian distribution as a risk measure with disastrous consequences, and thus we might want to use more empirical based models (such as monte carlo simulations) in practice. Taleb is very popular in financial circles, and often cautions us to be more careful about behavioral biases and over-reliance on modelling
