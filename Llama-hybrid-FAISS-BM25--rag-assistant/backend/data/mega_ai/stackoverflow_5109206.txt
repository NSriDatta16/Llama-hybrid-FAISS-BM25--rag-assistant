You can create an index organized table and only store specific columns with the key. Note that you don't list the columns to include, you only list the last one and it includes all the columns up to that. (Which seems odd, usually column order doesn't matter in SQL.) Personally, I think index organized tables are weird and have too many limitations, redcayuga's idea is probably better. create table t1 ( a number, b number, c number, d number, e number, f number, g number, primary key (a, b, c) ) organization index including e overflow;
