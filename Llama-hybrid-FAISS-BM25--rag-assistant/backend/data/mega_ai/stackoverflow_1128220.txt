I think the easiest way to reorganize your repository is to use the "repository browser" of TortoiseSVN. There you can move and rename folders just like in windows explorer. So if you have /Project /Component1 / you can: rename Component1 to trunk create a new folder Component1 move trunk into Component1 add branches and tags folder do the same for the other components
