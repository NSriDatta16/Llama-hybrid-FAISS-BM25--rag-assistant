Are there any arithmetic operation projections in NHibernate?

I would like to get this SQL from NHibernate: SELECT SUM(color_pages) * SUM(total_pages) FROM connector_log_entry GROUP BY department_name But I can't find any arithmetic operation (*) projections anywhere. This is the code that I have so far: Session.QueryOver () .SelectList(list => list .SelectGroup(m => m.DepartmentName) .WithAlias(() => dto.Department) .Select(Projections.Sum (m => m.TotalPages)) //.Select(Projections.Sum (m => m.ColorPages)) .WithAlias(() => dto.TotalColorPercentage)) .TransformUsing(Transformers.AliasToBean ());
