As long as the HTML file embedding the JavaScript files is on the same domain as the PHP/Python/whatever scripts called by the JavaScript you do not have cross-domain request. The only case where the actual location of the embedded file matters is CSS using relative URLs e.g. for images (those are relative to the CSS location, not the document location). But the Same-Origin-Policy doesn't apply to that anyway. So: You don't have to do anything different.
