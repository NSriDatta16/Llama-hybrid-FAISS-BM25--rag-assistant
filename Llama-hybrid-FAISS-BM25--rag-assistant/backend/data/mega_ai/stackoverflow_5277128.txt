If you wish, you can add to the above solutions a little thing ( #pragma warning ) before your #pragma message : #pragma warning() #pragma message(" SOME USER WARNING - FILE LINE etc... ") This little add-in generates real warning, and does not look bad in the window of VC. For example: 1>e:\proj\file.h(19) : warning C4615: #pragma warning : unknown user warning type 1> SOME USER WARNING - FILE LINE etc... 1>proj - 0 error(s), 1 warning(s) Usually I use this method to warnings were not too quiet, as in the case code without the #pragma warning() . For example, the form of warnings too quiet (for me of course). 1> SOME USER WARNING - FILE LINE etc.. 1>proj - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) However, only a small cosmetics.
