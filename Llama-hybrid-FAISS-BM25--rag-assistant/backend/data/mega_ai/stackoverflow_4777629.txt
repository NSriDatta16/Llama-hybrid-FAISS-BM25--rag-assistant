(Rails 3) Is it possible to hardcode ids in a named route?

As far as I know, the following is the encouraged way to create a simple named route in Rails 3: match 'sign-in' => 'sessions#create', :as => :sign_in Is there a clean way to hardcode an id (or any parameter) in a named route? For a silly example: match 'first-user' => 'users#show', :as => :first_user, :id => 1
