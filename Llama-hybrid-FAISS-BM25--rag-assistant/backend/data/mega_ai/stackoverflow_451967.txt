What do the numbers reported by the Windows TraceRt Mean

I need to create a trace route as part of a .NET appliation to support trouble shooting. I have figured out how to use the .NET Ping class to do the tracing. What I do not understand is what the numbers reported by the command line utility are. This is somewhat censored results of a "tracert yahoo.com" from the Windows command line: Tracing route to yahoo.com [206.190.60.37] over a maximum of 30 hops: 1 The first column is the index and the next three columns are times in milliseconds. I have searched the web for an explanation and have come up dry. I thought that they might be min, average, and max numbers but line 2 would seem to counter that idea. Jon Stonecash
