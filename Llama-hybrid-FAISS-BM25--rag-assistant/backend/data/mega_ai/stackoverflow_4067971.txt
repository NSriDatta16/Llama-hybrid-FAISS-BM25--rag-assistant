Relay/Send through NAT in Python

I'm looking for a solution to exchange data (protocols build on TCP) between NAT separated endpoints - more or less directly. I can setup a relay service for example - which is what I have in mind. However I want to route traffic without losing too much performance. or I can build a VPN with a central VPN server Are there optimised libraries in Python to allow me forwarding and building a relay server - for example. Or is there something more elegant that doesn't even require a node in the middle? :)
