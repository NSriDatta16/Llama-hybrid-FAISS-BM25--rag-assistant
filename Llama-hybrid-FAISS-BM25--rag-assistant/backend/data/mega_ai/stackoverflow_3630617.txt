How should I organize a project with three distinct views and no tab/tool/navbars?

I've spent too much time walking down dead ends on this project, so it's time to query the hive mind: I am making a simple iPad game consisting of three locations which the user navigates between when an area of the screen is touched. These locations are represented by fullscreen images and there are a lot of different animations and stuff going on which makes it logical to divide each location into its own UIViewController. The question is this: Which components should I use for handling the navigation between the locations/controllers? UITabbarController : After finally managing to hide it away without a white bar at the bottom, I could not get selectedIndex to work in order to swap between view controllers. UINavigationController : Does not permit more than one view controller inside, and I have three which I want to use. Is it possible to hide it away and still use it? I could of course cram all my logic into a single UIViewController , but this seems plain wrong. Any advice or solutions for a newbie struggling towards journeymanhood would be greatly appreciated indeed!
