What are the steps and correct order of the operations in Machine Learning? [from Getting data to optimising models]

I've followed lots of tutorials on Machine Learning but in each of these, they go for a different strategy so it's quite confusing for me. I want to Know that what are the operations involved and what are the correct ordering of these. AS of now, I think the process and the ordering are -> Get Data Delete Duplicates Find Missing Values and Outliers Create New Features Deal with missing values and Outliers Build a base model Find the best features to select Try and find different Models Select the BEST model Hypertuning of the Model Please Do Provide if something is missing and correct the sequence.
