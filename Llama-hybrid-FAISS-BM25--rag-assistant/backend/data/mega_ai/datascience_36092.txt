What is the correct way to compute lift in lift charts

How is "lift" computed? i was reading about "Gain and lift charts" in data science. I picked the following example from https://www.listendata.com/2014/08/excel-template-gain-and-lift-charts.html I am clear on how the gain values are computed. Not clear about lift values are computed? (last column in table)
