I suppose if repetition was irrelevant, you could do a t-test on your $3\times 5=15$ data points. But I imagine repetition is something that you want to explicitly model. Thus, one option would be to do a $3 \times 2$ factorial ANOVA where repetition is between subjects and has three levels and group is also between subjects and has two levels. The main effect of group would test whether marginal means significantly differ between treatment and control averaging across repetitions.
