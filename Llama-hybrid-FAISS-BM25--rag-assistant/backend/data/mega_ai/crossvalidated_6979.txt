Hypothesis testing is a useful way to frame a lot of questions: is the effect of a treatment zero or nonzero? The ability between statements such as these and a statistical model or procedure (including the construction of an interval estimator) is important for practitioners I think. It also bears mentioning that a confidence interval (in the traditional sense) isn't inherently any less "sin-prone" than hypothesis testing - how many intro stats students know the real definition of a confidence interval? Perhaps the problem isn't hypothesis testing or interval estimation as it is the classical versions of the same; the Bayesian formulation avoids these quite nicely.
