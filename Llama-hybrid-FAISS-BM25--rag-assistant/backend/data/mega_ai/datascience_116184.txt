Upsampling as you mention, is usually for data augmentation, and it can help address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset. However if you upsample too much, especially with already noisy data, the learning objective might get too difficult for the model and this will impact negatively fitting the model to the training set. Instead, you can use masking or padding, which are techniques that do not deteriorate the original image. Still, your main concern is to clean the noisy data, so I think training a denoising autoencoder, for example, might help improve the quality of the bad quality data.
