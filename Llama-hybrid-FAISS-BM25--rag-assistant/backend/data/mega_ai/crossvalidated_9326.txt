There are different kind of MDS (e.g., see this brief review ). Here are two pointers: the smacof R package, developed by Jan de Leeuw and Patrick Mair has a nice vignette, Multidimensional Scaling Using Majorization: SMACOF in R (or see, the Journal of Statistical Software (2009) 31(3)) -- R code is available, of course. there are some handouts on Multidimensional Scaling , by Forrest Young, where several algorithms are discussed (including INDSCAL (Individual Difference Scaling, or weighted MDS) and ALSCAL, with Fortran source code by the same author) -- this two keywords should help you to find other source code (mostly Fortran, C, or Lisp). You can also look for "Manifold learning" which should give you a lot of techniques for dimension reduction (Isomap, PCA, MDS, etc.); the term was coined by the Machine Learning community, among others, and they probably have a different view on MDS compared to psychometricians.
