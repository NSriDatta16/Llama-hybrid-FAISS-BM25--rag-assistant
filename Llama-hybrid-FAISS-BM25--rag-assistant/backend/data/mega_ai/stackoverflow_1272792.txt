Image bit depth values

REPHRASED QUESTION: I am coming up with a list of possible image bit depth values that could be used as a predefined reference list in my application. I could think of 8,16,24 and 32 bit depths. The image formats considered are BMP, JPEG, PNG and GIF. I understand the bit depth decides the quality and thereby the storage requirements for the image. The application is used to store user uploaded images(non-medical, non-DICOM). Are there more bit depths other than the ones mentioned above that i should be including in my list? Are there any stats on the usage of the images with bit depths? Appreciate your response!
