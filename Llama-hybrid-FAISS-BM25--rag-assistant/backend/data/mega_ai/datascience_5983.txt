Random Forest, Type - Regression, Calculation of Importance Example

I am trying to use a Random Forest Model (Regression Type) as a substitute of logistic regression model. I am using R - randomForest Package. I want to understand the meaning of Importance of Variables (%IncMSE and IncNodePurity) by example. Suppose I have a population of 100 employees out of which 30 left the company. Suppose in a particular decision tree, population is split by an attribute (say location) into two nodes. One node contains 50 employees out of which 10 left the company and other contains 50 employees from which 20 left the company. Can someone demonstrate me a calculation of %IncMSE and IncNodePurity. (if Required for averages etc., please consider another decision tree) This may look like a repeated question but I could not find a worked out example.
