How to deploy a deep learning model in Flask (Python)?

I am still an amateur with respect to deploying deep learning models as a flask app. I want to deploy a VQA model based on MMF (Pythia) in a flask app. Github repository for reference. Can someone explain in brief as to how to go about it? Thanks in advance.
