Linear regression works fine in both the situations you mention, at least in the sense that you will learn the best linear unbiased model for predicting Y when given a value of X. Note that standard linear regression does not estimate the joint distribution p(X,Y), it only estimates the conditional distribution p(Y|X). There is no model for p(X) in standard linear regression, which would be required to produce the joint distribution p(X,Y). This means that linear regression cannot predict which future values of X you are likely to see, it can only predict the value of Y for a given X (in machine learning terminology, we hence say that linear regression is a discriminative model rather than a generative model).
