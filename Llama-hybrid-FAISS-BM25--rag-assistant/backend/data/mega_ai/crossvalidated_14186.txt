You can compute the correlation coefficient BUT a problem arises when you try and determine the statistical significance of the computed cc . A favorite reference of mine http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/dbs202/cat/stats/corr.html illustrates that the data being analyzed need to bivariate normal. One of your series is clearly not. Note also that the data must not be autocorrelated because that would violate bivariate normality. This last point is not relevant to you but should be of interest to other readers who endeavor to interpret simple cross-correlations when dealing with time series or spatial data. Hope this helps ! This upon reflection seems more like a comment but in summary neither of your proposals seem adequate. I would think that a non-parametric test might be in order.
