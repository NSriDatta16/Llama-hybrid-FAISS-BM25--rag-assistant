Delphi, frames vs forms. What for multi-document interface?

yesterday I've started discussion on "MDI vs tabbed interface". I've asked whether should I continue developing my app as MDI-based, or should I embed the child forms into tab sheets. Someone pointed that I should use TFrames instead... My question is: why? What are pros of using TFrames when embedding the form over TFrame? So far I don't know any, switching would only require me to rewrite some parts of code... (I'm not going to use embedding at design time anyway!) Thanks in advance
