Burn that book. Not only is void main not conformant to any C++ standard (modern or old), but declaring a parameter-less function with (void) instead of () is a C idiom that is discouraged in C++. From this sample, I shudder to think what other horrors that book might contain. The issue with the console window closing is completely unrelated to the contents of your program. Windows has a behavior where if you launch a console program directly, it will automatically close the console window when the program ends. To avoid this, open a console window yourself, and run your program from within it. The console window will stay open as long as you want it to. (And please refrain from using the unfortunately popular practice of adding an extra dummy input or a "pause" call at the end of your program to keep the window open. You should not be adding code to your program to compensate for a particular way that you happen to be launching it; just launch it the right way and leave your poor code alone.)
