Distribution of Fourier transform of Gaussian time series

Consider a zero mean $p$ dimensional discrete time real valued Gaussian stationary time series $x(k),k=0,1,2,...x(k),k=0,1,2,...$. Consider the Fourier transform of $x(k)$ from $N$ samples: $X(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}x(k)e^{−i\omega k}$. Clearly, $X(ω)$ has a complex normal distribution. Under what conditions would $X(ω)$ be a circularly symmetric complex normal random variable? Consider $\omega \in \{2\pi n/N\}_{n = \{0,1,...,N-1\}}$. Possibly useful result: $X$ is a circularly symmetric complex normal if and only if $E(XX^{T})=0$.
