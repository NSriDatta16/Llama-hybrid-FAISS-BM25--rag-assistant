Should I pad zero or mean value in a convolution neural network? What about reflective padding?

In convolution layers, sometimes you need to pad some (usually 1 or 2 pixel) 0s at the edges of the original image before applying your convolution kernel (filter). However, 0 has different meanings. In the case of 0 - 255 gray scale images, 0 means black. In the case of normalized images ( minus mean then divided by std), 0 is the mean value. Should I always pad 0, or should I sometimes pad mean value ? If in some cases I should pad mean value, what are those cases? Edit: And when should I use reflective padding? Further more, is reflective padding always better than zero padding?
