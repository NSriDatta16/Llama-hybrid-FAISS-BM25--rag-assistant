Symfony's sfGuard uses two tables: one for authentication data, other for user details. That looks rather sensible - as this separates two different sets of data from each other, and the user auth table is narrow, thus it fits better into memory (and various caches) and doesn't need to operate with the (wider) user details whenever authentication is needed. As for security, I don't really see a difference in one table vs. two tables, except maybe in backup storage requirements. As always, measure and compare how this stacks up in your specific situation.
