How to define person's gender from the fullname?

Given person's name, e.g. 'Adjutor Ferguson'. How to define is it a male or female? One solution came to my mind: I have found Person NLP training dataset here mbejda.github.io. And via a machine learning software like Apache Mahout, train it and provide real data. But I am not sure about the accuracy of the results. May be another approach exist? (e.g. scikit-learn.org)
