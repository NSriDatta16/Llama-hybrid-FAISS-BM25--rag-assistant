Advice in career path

I'm currently in Argentina without any type of degree and knowledge in the field of data, maths, programming. My career goal is to get a starting job from here (Argentina) and eventually with some experience, get a data scientist job in Canada. After years and years of gaining a lot of experience in the field of data. I would love to start my own business (there). All that sounds great but right now I have a big. As I said before I don't have any degree or knowledge in anything. What is the best career path (considering my current situation and career goal)? Should I start by pursuing a data science degree or maybe you recommend me to focus in bootcamps/courses/projects/portfolio related to data science?
