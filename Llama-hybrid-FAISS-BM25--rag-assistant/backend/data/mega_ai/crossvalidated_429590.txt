If you want ME = .02, so that the width of the 95% CI is 0.04, then n = 117. If you want ME = .02(7.27) = 0.1454, so that the width of the 95% CI is 0.2908, then the formula gives n = 3. However, your distribution of runtimes has too heavy a right tail to be normal, so you can't expect averages of only 3 observations to be nearly normal. The 1.96 in the formula is based on normal averages. So "95% CIs" based on $n=3$ may not truly have 95% coverage.
