I am not going to write the code for you; but you should take a look at the notify method (see here ) to be used. One approach could be: once a thread has finished it will wait() for the other thread(s) to notify (or notifyAll() ). Another, more elegant solution, would consist of using a synchronized block on a shared object; the syncrhonized(obj) statement would be at the end of the run() method. Into that statement you could put a printline or any other code you would deem useful to determine who won the race.
