Practical power analysis on linear model

Power analysis for linear model test asks for an analytical expression of the power of a linear model. The answer claims that Note that this depends on the correlation between $X$ and $T$ , $r_{TX}$ . In practice, when running the power analysis of an experiment, prior to the experiment, you don't really know this (the treatment has not been assigned yet, you don't have data labelled on treatment and control). At most, you have historical data with the covariate X, the outcome Y and a way to randomize the treatment. How do we calculate $r_{TX}$ in practice? Do we simulate a specific randomization and calculate power with that randomization? Do we simulate many and average the power? Is there a standard way of doing this? Also, how do we estimate $\sigma$ and $\sigma_T$ in practice?
