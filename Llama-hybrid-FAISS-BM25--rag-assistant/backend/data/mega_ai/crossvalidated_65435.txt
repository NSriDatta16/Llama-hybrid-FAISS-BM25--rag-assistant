Instead of averaging over your coefficients to develop a single regression formula, you should pass the input data to all of your models separately and take the average result (i.e. treating your 28 models as an ensemble classifier). The chapter you referenced describes how to weight the output of each of your models, so models that you evaluated with higher scores get more weight but are still treated as an ensemble. This is extremely similar to a technique called Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA): the difference is that instead of estimating the likelihood of each model via Akaike Score, the likelihood of each model is calculated as a posterior probability. You may find the BMA literature interesting. Still, once you have your model, you should be able to evaluate it the same way you would evaluate any other model.
