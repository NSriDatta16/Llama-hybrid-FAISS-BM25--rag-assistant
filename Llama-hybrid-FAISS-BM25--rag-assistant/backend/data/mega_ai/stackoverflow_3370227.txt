Rotate view using CGAfffineTransformRotate

I have a circular image which I am trying to rotate, so that the yellow and black striped circle stays under the user's finger and rotates in both directions. I have this so far: - (void)handleJogShuttle:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)recognizer { UIView *shuttle = [recognizer view]; if ([recognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || [recognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { [recognizer view].transform = CGAffineTransformRotate([[recognizer view] transform],M_PI / 20.0f); [recognizer setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:[shuttle superview]]; } } Also, currently, the slightest movement can cause the view to rotate in a full circle, which is obviously not desired.
