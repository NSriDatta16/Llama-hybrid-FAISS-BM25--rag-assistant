I've found quite a good pragmatic solution to this problem - make the UITabBarController's view larger than it needs to be, so that the actual UITabBar is clipped by the screen. Assuming that the tab bar view normally fills its superview, this sort of thing should work: CGRect frame = self.tabBarController.view.superview.frame; if (isHidden) { CGFloat offset = self.tabBarController.tabBar.frame.size.height; frame.size.height += offset; } self.tabBarController.view.frame = frame; The tab bar is still showing, but it's off the bottom of the screen, so appears to have been hidden. It might have performance implications if it causes extra clipping, but so far, it seems to work.
