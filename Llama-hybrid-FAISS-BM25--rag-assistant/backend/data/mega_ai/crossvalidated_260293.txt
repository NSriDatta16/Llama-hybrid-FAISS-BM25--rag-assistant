Analysis of whole sample based of individual posteriors

I have a sample of N objects for which I have a model that fits some parameters (say param1 , param2 ). I have modeled them using MCMC, so I have an estimate of the posteriors of param1 and param2 for each individual object. I would like to use these results to study the whole sample, in particular, the overall distribution of param1 , param2 , and a possible correlation between them. However, I am having a hard time understanding how I should do it: 1) On the one hand, I can think of the set of param1 and param2 values as data points (and use confidence intervals as their uncertainties). I could, for example, create a histogram of the obtained param1 values, and say something like "60% of these have param1 param1 estimate (in a process similar to a kernel density estimate). 2) On the other hand, posteriors require probabilities to be be multiplied, not summed, so in some sense it also sounds like I could multiply all the individual posteriors for param1 to obtain the overall posterior. However, I am confused here, since I have individual MCMC runs. If multiplication is the correct way, I guess I would bin the parameter space and multiply all the individual distributions. Is this the correct approach? Note that these objects are independent and there is no universal value for these param1 and param2 , i.e., I do not expect them to converge to one single value when comparing all these objects. 3) Finally, I have exactly the same doubt for the comparison of param1 vs param2 . If I simply plot param1 vs param2 based on the obtained values, there is a clear correlation. However, I was also considering building the 2D distribution from the individual MCMC runs, and I am again unsure about what the proper way would be. What would be the correct approach in this case, and why? Edit: I think the confusion may arise in defining what I am doing as "computing the posterior param1 and param2 for the whole sample", which may not be the case. As an example, if only one object has a posterior value of 0 at a given point, that doesn't mean that the whole sample has a 0 probability there (pretty much the opposite, all but one objects have some probability at that point!).
