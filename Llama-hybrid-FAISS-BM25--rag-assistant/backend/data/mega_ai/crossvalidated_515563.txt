Conditional mean If you are sure your time series has an ARMA structure in its conditional mean and you can estimate it with decent precision, then ignoring it (and going directly for GARCH) does not make sense. But perhaps the ARMA signal is so weak relative to the noise that estimating it as zero (i.e. no ARMA) is more precise than estimating it as some specific instance of ARMA, say, ARMA(1,1)? If so, one could justify approximating the conditional mean with a constant rather than with ARMA. Conditional variance If you do not find autocorrelation in squared residuals from your conditional mean model, then indeed there is no point in fitting a GARCH model for the conditional variance. You could however think whether you have any other variables on which you could condition the variance. Perhaps they would offer a basis for a conditional variance model?
