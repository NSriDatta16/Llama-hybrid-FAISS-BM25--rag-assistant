Average internet delay

Just wondering, what is the average packet transmission delay between two hosts over the internet (ignoring packet loss and retransmission). Now, hang a second before you write that it's too genenral and depends on too many factors (Location of the two hosts, network workload at a specific time, just to name a few), i'm aware of that. Yet, that's why i'm asking what might be the AVERAGE delay. There must be some record for that. Maybe it's appropriate to ask for seperate countrywide/continentwide/intercontinental average values, too. Whatever makes sense.
