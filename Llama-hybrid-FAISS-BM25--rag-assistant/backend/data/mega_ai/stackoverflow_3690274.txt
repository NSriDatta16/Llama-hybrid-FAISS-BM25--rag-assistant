I am using Xcode 3.2.4 with SDK 3.2, 4.0.1 and 4.1. The following steps worked for me: 1. Launch simulator 2. Drag an image from Finder to the simulator which will always launch Safari to show the image 3. CLICK and HOLD that click for a couple of seconds, then you will see a popup with a "Save Image" button
