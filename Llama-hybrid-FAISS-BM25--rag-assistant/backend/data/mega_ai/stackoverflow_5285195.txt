Magento 1.5.0.1 - Where does the Google Sitemap get created?

I am using Mangento 1.5.0.1 and have configured the admin section to export Google XML Sitemaps daily. Mangento uses cron to execute this however the cron job runs but never outputs a sitemap nor does it email me an error. I was thinking maybe I need to manually create the folders / files and then maybe they would then be populated by the cron job. So my question is, where in the file system does Magento create these files? Thanks Paul
