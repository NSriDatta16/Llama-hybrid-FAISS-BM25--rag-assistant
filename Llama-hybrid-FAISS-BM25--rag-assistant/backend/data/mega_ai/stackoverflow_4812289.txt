Enumerate classes in package

Possible Duplicate: Can you find all classes in a package using reflection? Hi there. How would I at runtime enumerate all the classes in a package for on the fly code storage and execution? For example, I make a 'main' package with the main program class in it. At startup of the program it would look for a package named 'bucketofstuff' enumerate the names of all those classes?
