Session and Cache are definitely volatile storage mediums. I'm unsure if there is a priority that effects one another, but there are more factors than just memory pressure that you need to account for. For example, Session will be wiped simply by modifying the web.config (which recycles the app pool). This is of course assuming that you are using the default Session storage provider -- you can change to out of process, or SQL Session storage if that may help in your specific scenario.
