I like going through the tutorials on IDRE. Here are the R ones, they have them for SAS as well: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/mlogit.htm http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/probit.htm Here is what the multinomial article says about diagnostics: Diagnostics and model fit: Unlike logistic regression where there are many statistics for performing model diagnostics, it is not as straightforward to do diagnostics with multinomial logistic regression models. For the purpose of detecting outliers or influential data points, one can run separate logit models and use the diagnostics tools on each model. From the logistic article: Diagnostics: The diagnostics for logistic regression are different from those for OLS regression. For a discussion of model diagnostics for logistic regression, see Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000, Chapter 5). Note that diagnostics done for logistic regression are similar to those done for probit regression.
