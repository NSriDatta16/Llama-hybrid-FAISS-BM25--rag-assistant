I know that Rails does not necessarily = MVC per se, but I think a lot of what makes Rails productive is that it enforces (well, strongly encourages) MVC development, so you might find something similar if you look for Python MVC, such as this previous post here on Stack: What's a good lightweight Python MVC framework? There are lots of Python MVC frameworks out there, but I keep hearing a lot about Django ( http://www.djangoproject.com/ ) so that should definitely be on your list of things to check out IMO.
