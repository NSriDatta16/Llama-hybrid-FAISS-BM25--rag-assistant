First and foremost, its easy to write. It's simple... writing to a file is one of the least likely things to go wrong. Because of the simplicity, it is fast. This applies both to disk writes and to the CPU time for performing the operations. A lot of this is also a legacy. While database servers and machines with 100s of gigabytes of storage if not terabytes and gigs of RAM are abundant, if not the norm, most seasoned servers hail from a time where memory was system resources were fully utilized by much lower loads. But mostly it's just easy.

KISS. Log analysis tools shouldn't be part of log writing.
