In response to the comments, here is the general answer on how to adjust the probabilities returned out of any predictive model that has been built on a stratified / oversampled data set. Since you artificially increased the density of one class, you need to adjust the predicted probability that the observation belongs to that class in the real world space. Do note that this only works if the probability returned is indeed a probability of class membership and is well calibrated in the oversampled space . If for example, you are returning confidence values from an SVM, then this rescaling does not work and you need to first calibrate the scores (e.g. Platt). If you have a model calculating probability of class membership where those predicted probabilities are close to the actual (on the oversampled data) probabilities (I normally decile the data and compare actual and predicted at each decile) then you can adjust as follows (I forget the source for this but comes from Bayes Theorem and is used by SAS EM for example). Original fraction is the proportion of "1s" in the full data, Oversampled fraction is the proportion of "1s" in the oversampled training set and scoring result is the probability from the model.
