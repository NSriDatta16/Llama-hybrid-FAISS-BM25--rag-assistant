Two possibilities: A) Make your values numeric and powers of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,etc) and store a single value in the cookie as a bitmap. (Or in the server-side code, map the distinct values to powers of 2.) B) Store the values in the cookie as a delimited list. Updated: 6:40PM Seeing that you have the possibility of a large number of selections, neither of my original solutions is going to work. To deal with that large an amount of data, I think you're going to need to create a "session id" of some sort, save the actual settings in a database or other persistent storage, and store the session id in the cookie. (You'll of course want to make the cookie only persist for the duration of the browser session and delete the stored settings after you can be reasonably certain the browser session has ended -- perhaps a week or so.)
