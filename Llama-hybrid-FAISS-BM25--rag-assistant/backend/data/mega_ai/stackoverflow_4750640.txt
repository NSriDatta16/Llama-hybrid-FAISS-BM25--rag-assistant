Question regarding publishing Android application into Android market

I'll be publishing an Android application to the market for the first time . I have already posted all these questions on the Android Market help website but no one answered , hence posting the question here though I know this is a developer forum , since I dont know of anyother option of getting answers to this question. I have the following queries: 1> I want to publish the application in my organisation's name , so do I need to visit the http://market.android.com/publish & create a mail Id in my company's name ? 2> Do I need to provide an authorisation letter in my organisation's name , if I am publishing the application in my organisation's name ? 3> Is there any separate licence for a developer publishing an Android application & an organisation publishing an application? 4> Is there any renewal policy of the licence? 5> I want to use the application from an enterprise perpective , so want to know is there any rule for the same. I went through the developer site of android , but didn't find any information about publishing an Android application in Android market in the name of the organisation. Everything mentioned there seems for an individual developer perspective. Kindly provide me your inputs. Sorry if I posted it at wrong place. Warm Regards, CB
