Defining a stochastic process Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space. Let $S$ be another measurable space (such as the space of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ ). Speaking somewhat imprecisely: A random variable is a measurable function from $\Omega$ to $S$ . A stochastic process is a family of random variables indexed by time $t$ . For any time $t \in \mathcal{T}$ , $X_t$ is a random variable For any outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ , $X(\omega)$ is a realization of the stochastic process, a possible path taken by $X$ over time. Defining a time series While a stochastic process has a crystal clear, mathematical definition. A time series is a less precise notion, and people use time series to refer to two related but different objects: As WHuber describes, a stochastic process indexed by integers or some regular, incremental unit of time that can in a sense by mapped to integers (eg. monthly data). A variable observed over time (often at regular intervals). This could be the realization of a stochastic process. Sometimes this is referred to as time series data. Example: two flips of a tack Let $\Omega = \{ \omega_{HH}, \omega_{HT}, \omega_{TH}, \omega_{TT}\}$ . Let $X_1, X_2$ be the result of flip 1 and 2 respectively. $$ X_1(\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rr} 1: & \omega \in \{ \omega_{HH}, \omega_{HT}\} \\ 0: & \omega \in \{\omega_{TH}, \omega_{TT} \}\end{array} \right. $$ $$ X_2(\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rr} 1: & \omega \in \{ \omega_{HH}, \omega_{TH}\} \\ 0: & \omega \in \{\omega_{HT}, \omega_{TT} \}\end{array} \right. $$ So clearly $\{X_1, X_2\}$ is a stochastic process. People may also call it a time series since the indexing is by integers. People may also call the realization of $X$ , eg. $X(\omega_{HH}) = (H, H)$ , a time series or time series data.
