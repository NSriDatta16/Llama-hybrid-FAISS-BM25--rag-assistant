GWT: Change padding of tree rows?

A GWT tree looks roughly like this: ... ... My question is: how should I change the padding of the individual tree rows? I suppose I could do something along the lines of setting CSS rules for .gwt-Tree > div but that seems hacky. Is there a more elegant way? Resolution: Apparently there is NOT a more elegant way. Here is what we did, FWIW: .gwt-Tree > div:first-child { width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; } .gwt-Tree > div { padding: 0px 5px !important; } .gwt-Tree > div[hidefocus=true] { width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; }
