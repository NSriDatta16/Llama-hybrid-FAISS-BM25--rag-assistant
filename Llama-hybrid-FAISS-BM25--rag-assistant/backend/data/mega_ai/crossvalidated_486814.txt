Each sequence of 1000 tosses of a fair coin will have its own peculiarities. There are some easily derived statements about what you can expect most of the time. Some involve counting the number of Heads. Let $X$ be the number of heads in $n = 1000$ independent tosses of a fair coin. Then $\mu=E(X) = 500,\, \sigma^2=Var(X) = 250,\,$ $\sigma = SD(X) = \sqrt{250} = 15.8114.$ So you would expect [exact computation in R] $$P(\mu-2\sigma \le X\le \mu+2\sigma) \approx 0.95 \approx P(458 \le X \le 532) = 0.9765.$$ diff(pbinom(c(457,532), 1000, .5)) [1] 0.9765306 However, you could get $X = 500$ exactly, which is the most common outcome and yet have 250 Heads followed by 250 Tails, which would be very 'unusual' because there are only two runs. (A run is a sequence of repeated outcomes.) On average, one would expect about 501 runs in a sequence of 1000 tosses. The fewest possible runs is 2 and the greatest is 1000 (alternating H and T throughout). Thus you can get a very 'ordinary' value of $X$ and a (tiny or huge) number of runs that makes you wonder whether coin tosses are truly independent. In order to say whether your 20 consecutive coin tosses are "different from ideal," you would have to state your criterion for ideal. Do you mean an almost average number of heads, an almost average number of runs, or something else? You have raised an important question. People who seek algorithms for generating pseudo-random numbers by computer, have long lists of criteria for "satisfactory" behavior. The idea is to generate numbers by computer that cannot be distinguished from "random" for practical purposes.
