All 3 languages have their place. As with any programming task you must pick the language best suited for the task. Python has list comprehensions, php is much better when embedding and generating html. Ruby is a great language too. One of the things I have found myself using in ruby a few times is the 'a'...'zzzzz' to generate all possible strings of size 1 - 5. They all have their advantages and are all better than the others at particular tasks.
