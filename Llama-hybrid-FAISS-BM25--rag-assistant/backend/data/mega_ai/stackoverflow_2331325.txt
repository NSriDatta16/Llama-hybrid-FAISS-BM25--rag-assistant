I'm sure there's a standard but it's an English language usage one, not a programming one. If you decide to implement that standard, one method of handling this is to have two fields in the database, the official, displayed name and the one used for sorting. This can handle a variety of unforeseen cases with a minimum of user input (assuming your UI copies the displayed name into the sort name on entry) at the expense of disk storage.
