It's a little complicated to use CURL to redirect, but it's possible, and not terribly hard. It's even easier if you know specifically what URL to redirect to, or if you can build that redirect url. Here is an example curl call: /usr/bin/curl -D "/tmp/0001" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)" -H "Cookie: key=value; key2=value2;" -H "Content-length: 89" -d "this=is&the=post&data=true" http://url.com/application.php Let's walk through the command: the -D will store any return headers into the file "/tmp/0001". From here you can parse out any redirects that you need to find. Just run something like grep Location /tmp/0001 to get the line with the location redirect header. That is if the app itself redirects. This is also where you parse out any cookies. the -H is the header that you are sending to the server. You can post a Cookie: header if the page requires cookies. You may also need to generate the content length based on the data you post. the -d is the data that you are posting to the application This is for an actual "POST". Once you do your initial post and get that working, you simply call /usr/bin/curl again with the second url. Simply build the headers the way it should look for that second page, along with any cookies it sends you, and it should post as if it were a browser. The results of the curl command will be the actual page, that you can log to some database for verification purposes. I hope this helps.
