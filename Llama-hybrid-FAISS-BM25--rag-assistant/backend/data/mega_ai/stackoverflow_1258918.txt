infragistics ultragrid pasting from excel

I'm using infragistics net advantage for .net framework. I have a really weird error with their ultragrid. I will try to explain it: On my ultragrid I have 5 columns. I am trying to paste 11 rows and 5 columns from Excel. If I leave entries in cells empty of the LAST column and the row BELOW row 6 (i.e rows 7-11) I get the following error: Error performing Paste operation. Further information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Continue with the remainig cells? It throws this error 5 more times (number of the remainig rows). Then it thows another error: Error performing Paste operation. Further information: Invalid selection. The selection must berectangular However it actually perform the pasting itself. The funny thing is, if I enter something into ANY of those cells it works. Moreover, this error is thrown ONLY if i'm pasting more than 6 rows :)) I have no idea what's going on. So any help would be appreciated Thanks, Marat
