If you only have binary inputs this will only give you one point on the ROC curve. Usually you need something like a probability estimate. Many algorithms (random forests) that aren't meant to produce probability estimates have been modified to provide some estimate. Another alternative method is to use cost sensitive learning to produce k models which will give k points on the ROC curve. By changing your cost of FN/FP for each model you will produce different number of FP/FN.
