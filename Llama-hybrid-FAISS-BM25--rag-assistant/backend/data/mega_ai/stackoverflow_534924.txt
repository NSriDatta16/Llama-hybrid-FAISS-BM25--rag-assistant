Back in DELPHI 7 I also had all files in one folder. It has easy for small projects, but very hard for med to big one. So I began to create a folder structure for all DELPHI projects small or big. Over the year I am trying to improve, this folder structure, and every new project I make a small improvement so that it is simpler, logical, and more organized. This day I am trying to make some parts of it sharable to several project. Its work in progress.
