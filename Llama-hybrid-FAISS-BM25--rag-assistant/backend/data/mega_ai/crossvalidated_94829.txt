Not one that will be of much use, unless the circumstances are very specific (known bounds on the values might help a bit). To see why no formula will be much use in general: Let's imagine there's some formula that could be used. Consider some set of values ($x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{10},$ with average $\bar x$). I tell you $\bar x$, you have to figure out the range for $x$. Now consider $y_i=2x_i-\bar x$, which has the same average, but is twice as spread . Now consider $z_i=100x_i -99\bar x$. 100 times as spread, same average. So if I give you $\bar x$, do you have the values in $x$, $y$, or $z$? The bounds for $z$ will be useless for $x$ and vice-versa. (How can any any formula tell whether $\bar x$ is the mean of the first, second or third set of values?) Is it really the case that you only have access to the average? Or is there anything else you either know or can get?
