ListView moving items

I have another problem with ListView :( Now I need to move items in group (up, down, to the beginning, to the end), but ListView is displaying moved items always at the end. Here is sample code for moving item to the beginning: if (1 == listView1.SelectedItems.Count) { ListViewItem item = listView1.SelectedItems[0]; ListViewGroup gp = item.Group; int index; index = item.Index; if (index I tried google to find some solution, and I found someone else ( http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winforms/thread/838f90cd-33d8-4c81-9ed9-85220b511afe ) who had same problem like me, but his solution is not working :( I considered using ObjectListView but I have modified ListView witch now supports drag & drop with WinAmp effect, onScroll events, scrolling synchronization etc.. and I don't want to lose this stuff :(
