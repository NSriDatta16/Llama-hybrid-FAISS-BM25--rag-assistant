Micro Average vs Macro average Performance in a Multiclass classification setting

I am trying out a multiclass classification setting with 3 classes. The class distribution is skewed with most of the data falling in 1 of the 3 classes. (class labels being 1,2,3, with 67.28% of the data falling in class label 1, 11.99% data in class 2, and remaining in class 3) I am training a multiclass classifier on this dataset and I am getting the following performance: Precision Recall F1-Score Micro Average 0.731 0.731 0.731 Macro Average 0.679 0.529 0.565 I am not sure why all Micro average performances are equal and also Macro average performances are low compared to Micro average.
