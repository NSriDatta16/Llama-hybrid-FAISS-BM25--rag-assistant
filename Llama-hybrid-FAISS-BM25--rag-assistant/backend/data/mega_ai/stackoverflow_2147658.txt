I managed to drag it to the right box. Strangely, you need to drag it to the TOP of the screen first, then to the right. I added borders to "item_1" and "group2" to see what was actually happening. The height of groups2 is only as high as the title since that DIV has no specified height, so there isn't much area for you to drop into. I gave a height of 300px to group2 and can now drop there without issue.
