De-aggregate data: statistically correct approaches?

Reading some research studies and there are interesting aggregated results. I want to plug it into a neural network (or similar) in order to categorise individual entries into alignment with what the aggregates say. Given a single metric—say: age range within $20$ – $30$—an aggregated average; a sample size $n$; could I just just generate a random distribution within that range and spread them across $n$ rows, ensuring the average stays the same? - And will this work for multiple metrics?
