CNN model contains several images that are null

I'm using a deep CNN with the ReLU activation function. When visualizing the layers (each with 32 filters), several of the filtered images are zeros. I am trying to reason why this may be happening? What would cause the entire image to be zero? I can understand having a sparse image (given the ReLU), but what would cause all zeros? I hope this is clear and has sufficient detail to answer appropriately.
