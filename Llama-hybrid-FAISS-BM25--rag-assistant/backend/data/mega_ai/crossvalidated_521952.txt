When using longitudinal variables on different time scales in a regression, is it valid backwards fill the dependent variable?

I'm working on a longitudinal project that is assessing an outcome variable through a monthly questionnaire and using daily activity as a predictor. The questionnaire asks about symptoms in the past two weeks. My questions is how can I best utilize the data so that we keep as much daily activity as possible while not creating bias on the outcome variable. So far I see three solutions. 1) average the activity data monthly and associate it with the monthly questionnaire data. 2) "roll back"/"backwards fill" the questionnaire data to the prior two weeks which will fill in prior days without data on that variable and maintain the daily measurement scale. Then we would only use the activity data associated with the days in those two weeks, kind of like pairwise deletion. 3) do the same as solution 2 but average the daily activity over the two weeks prior to the questionnaire data; activity that is not within that two week window would not be used. Other solutions may come in forms of regression models or methods. What are the statistical drawbacks of those solutions and how might they bias regression models that predict future symptoms? I'd greatly appreciate some insights, recommendations, and potential pitfalls of methods which will be the most robust for prediction of an outcome using variables on different time scales. Thank you!
