I think there is no simple and elegant way how to achieve that. My solution is this: SELECT MyTable.* FROM MyTable JOIN (SELECT row_id, COUNT(*) AS count FROM ( SELECT row_id from MyTable WHERE words like '%one%' UNION SELECT row_id from MyTable WHERE words like '%two%' ) GROUP BY row_id ) AS count_result ON MyTable.row_id=count_result.row_id ORDER BY count_result.count DESC
