Using NetBeans IDE 6.7 with J3D's Canvas3D Container

I keep telling myself that this should be simple, and yet I'm completely lost. Let me start by saying that I'm new to NetBeans IDE, and that I am using it out of necessity. I don't really know much about it yet. I have successfully designed my main window for my application. The right side of the application is essentially a large window into a three-dimensional space that visualizes certain transforms on data sets. I have searched through the palette and the palette manager and even tried to add the Canvas3D component to the palette manually from a JAR, but I still can't get it. I would really like to be able to drag and drop this component into my application, and intuitively, it seems possible. I'm on Mac OS X; the output from my About NetBeans tells more. Product Version: NetBeans IDE 6.7 (Build 200906241340) Java: 1.5.0 _ 19; Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM 1.5.0 _ 19-137 System: Mac OS X version 10.5.7 running on i386; MacRoman; en_US (nb) Userdir: /Users/dremelofdeath/.netbeans/6.7 Thanks in advance for helping me out -- I really appreciate it.
