How to setup MySQL table to follow a variable over time?

Say I have several registered users in my website. Users are saved on a single table 'users' that assigns a unique id for each one of them. I want to allow my users to track their expenses, miles driven, temperature, etc. I can't be sure each user will always enter a value for all trackable variables when they login -- so an example of what could happen would be: 'example data' user date amount miles temp etc 1 3/1/2010 $10.00 5 54 2 3/1/2010 $20.00 15 1 3/12/2010 5 55 1 3/15/2010 $10.00 25 51 3 3/20/2010 45 3 4/12/2010 $20.00 10 54 What is the best way to set up my tables for this situation? Should I create a table exclusive to each user when they register? (could end up with thousands of user-exclusive tables) 'user-1 table' date amount miles temp etc 3/1/2010 $10.00 5 54 3/12/2010 5 55 3/15/2010 $10.00 25 51 'user-3 table' date amount miles temp etc 3/20/2010 45 4/12/2010 $20.00 10 54 and so on... Should I create a single table that is essentially the same as the example data above? (could end up with a gigantic table that needs to be combed to find rows with requested user id's). 'user data table' user date amount miles temp etc 1 3/1/2010 $10.00 5 54 2 3/1/2010 $20.00 15 1 3/12/2010 5 55 1 3/15/2010 $10.00 25 51 3 3/20/2010 45 3 4/12/2010 $20.00 10 54 Any suggestions?
