From memory I've had this problem in the past as well. A couple of things to try: Replace the "T" in your RSS feed with a space (and obviously change the date format string as well). Your RSS feed has padded digits, where as your format string does not. Give this a try "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.Z". According to this link, that "z" should be capilized. http://www.stepcase.com/blog/2008/12/02/format-string-for-the-iphone-nsdateformatter/ Strip off the timezone info from the RSS feed and parse this manually. I seem to remember this causing problems for me.
