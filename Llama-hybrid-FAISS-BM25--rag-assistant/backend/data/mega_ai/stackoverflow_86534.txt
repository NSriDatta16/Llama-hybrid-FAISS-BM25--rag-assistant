Reading changes in a file in real-time using .NET

I have a .csv file that is frequently updated (about 20 to 30 times per minute). I want to insert the newly added lines to a database as soon as they are written to the file. The FileSystemWatcher class listens to the file system change notifications and can raise an event whenever there is a change in a specified file. The problem is that the FileSystemWatcher cannot determine exactly which lines were added or removed (as far as I know). One way to read those lines is to save and compare the line count between changes and read the difference between the last and second last change. However, I am looking for a cleaner (perhaps more elegant) solution.
