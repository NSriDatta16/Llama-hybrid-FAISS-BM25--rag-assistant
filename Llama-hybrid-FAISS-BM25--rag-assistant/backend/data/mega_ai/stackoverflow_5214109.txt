I read your question this morning and couldn't see what the problem was, but now I've seen your edit I think I know what it is. This is what a typical request looks like in Firefox (using LiveHTTPHeaders ): GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: stackoverflow.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.14) Gecko/20110301 Fedora/3.6.14-1.fc14 Firefox/3.6.14 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-gb,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Note the line Accept: . I suspect your server is sending text/html to curl because it's not explicitly declaring that it can support application/xhtml+xml . Since Firefox (and presumably other browsers that are not IE) do declare support for it, the server sends with that content type. Note that this is normally a completely reasonable thing for a web server to do, so not really a configuration error, but I would suggest the solution is to configure Jetty to always send as text/html no matter what the Accept: header on the request says.
