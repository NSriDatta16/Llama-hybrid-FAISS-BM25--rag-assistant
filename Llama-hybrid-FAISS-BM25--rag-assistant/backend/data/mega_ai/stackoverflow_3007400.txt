Debugging a performance issue on ListBoxDragDropTarget (Silverlight Toolkit)?

I have a complex project using SilverLight Toolkit's ListBoxDragDropTarget for drag-drop operations and it is maxing CPU. I tried to reproduce the issue in a small sample project, but then it works fine. The problem persists when I remove our custom styles and all other controls from the page, but the page is hosted in another page's ScrollView. "EnableRedrawRegions" shows that the screen gets redrawn on every frame. My question is this: How can I track down the cause of this constant redrawing?
