Forecast and STL are sensitive to last few data points

I'm working on a time series containing hourly data for 8 days. Using the R forecast package, I'm trying to predict future data with stl . If I use only 7 days data, things work fine, but when I add the last day, the predicted values drop strongly. My questions: Visually the 8 days data still show a clear periodic trend, why forecast gives that result? Looking at the data, I see that the value of the last hour of the day drops to 0 sooner than in previous days. But why forecast are so sensitive with that? Any advice for this situation? Any search keyword or reference that I should know for further reading? Thank you. xnn
