If you look at ?clusplot , you are referred to ?clusplot.default , where, under "Details", you find: ‘clusplot’ uses function calls ‘princomp(, cor = (ncol(x) > 2))’ or ‘cmdscale(, add=TRUE)’, respectively, depending on ‘diss’ being false or true. These functions are data reduction techniques to represent the data in a bivariate plot. diss is by default FALSE , so your coordinates indeed come from a PCA.
