The www-subdomain is just a convention amongst websites to indicate this address points to a World Wide Web server. For example, google.com is the top domainname of the Google company. www.google.com indicates this is the domain name for the World Wide Web, ftp.google.com indicates this is probably an ftp-server. But as it is just a convention, and the average user uses the internet mainly for www, most servers configure their http://domain.com to be aliases to http://www.domain.com . Why the favicon on your site only shows up for the www-version and not for the topdomain, depends on your html and your server configuration. Can you post some code or link to your site?
