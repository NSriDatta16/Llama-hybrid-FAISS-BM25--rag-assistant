How are the decision boundaries different when using Logistic Regression vs. LDA?

I am wondering if there is a concise way to answer how decision boundaries are different for a logistic regression model vs one created using Linear Discriminant Analysis. I understand that it depends on the data to a certain degree, but are there solid cases where the two differ no matter what data? Thanks.
