Lets make this concrete: Say you measured income on men and women, and women earn on average less than men. You can take all observations together and compute the average income, and it will tell you what the overall average income is. You can use regression analysis and include gender as an explanatory variable, now you measure the average incomes of men and women separately. Both can be meaningful, but they answer different questions.
