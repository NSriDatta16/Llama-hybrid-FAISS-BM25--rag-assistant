Is Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio (NNDR) test good for assessing point pattern?

Regularity of point pattern is routinely checked in ArcGIS with the Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio test providing significance estimations: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/average-nearest-neighbor.htm I was surprised not seeing any implementation of this test with R , even in the comprehensive set of statistics provided by spatstat package. Is this analysis unreliable for some reason?
