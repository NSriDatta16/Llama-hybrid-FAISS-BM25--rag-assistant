Inheritance is pretty enticing especially coming from procedural-land and it often looks deceptively elegant. I mean all I need to do is add this one bit of functionality to some other class, right?

This makes your system rigid and fragile. The more tragic flaw however is the new subclass brings with it all the baggage and opinion of the inheritance chain. The article, Inheritance is Evil: The Epic Fail of the DataAnnotationsModelBinder , walks through an example of this in C#.
