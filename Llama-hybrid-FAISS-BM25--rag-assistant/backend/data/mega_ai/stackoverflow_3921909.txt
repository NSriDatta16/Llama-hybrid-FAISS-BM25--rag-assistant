This is a filesystem-based store for OpenID associations and nonces. This store should be safe for use in concurrent systems on both windows and unix (excluding NFS filesystems). There are a couple race conditions in the system, but those failure cases have been set up in such a way that the worst-case behavior is someone having to try to log in a second time. Most of the methods of this class are implementation details. People wishing to just use this store need only pay attention to the constructor. http://openidenabled.com/files/php-openid/docs/2.1.1/OpenID/Auth_OpenID_FileStore.html
