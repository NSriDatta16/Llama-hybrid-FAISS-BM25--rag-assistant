Coins problem-how to apply bayes

We choose arbitrarily one of the 12 apparent similar coins. However the coins, in reality, belong to two groups, the 9 are "fair" while the other ones have the probability to appear heads equal to $\frac{6}{9}$ . We are making a throw and after having seen the result, we are given the following choices: To claim that we took a "fair" coin To claim that we took one of the "unfair" coins Not to announce any estimation for the coin. If we make a wrong estimation we will need to pay (to someone who knows the type of the coin) 11 euros, and at the case of a right estimation 0 euro. If we do not answer we will need to pay 4,5 euros. I want to describe the procedure above with the decision theory and give the decision function of Bayes. I have thought the following: The probability of error is defined as: $$P(errox \mid x)=P(\omega_1 \mid x) \text{ if we decide } \omega_2 \text{ and } P(\omega_2 \mid x) \text{ if we decide } \omega_1$$ The Bayes rule is optimum, that is, it minimizes the average probability error. So we need to find the probability of errors. If we claim that we took a "fair" coin, the probability that we had an "unfair cooin" is $\frac{3}{12}$ . If we claim that we took an "unfair" coin, the probability that we had a "fair coin" is $\frac{9}{12}$ . If we do not announce an estimation, how to we proceed? Is the rest right? So the Bayes function will be distinguished by cases? **EDIT:**Does it hold that the probability of error is $\frac{1}{3}$ , since when we estimate that the coin was fair, then $P(\text{"the coin was fair"} \mid \text{"estimation"})=\frac{1}{9}$ and $P(\text{"the coin was not fair"} \mid \text{"estimation"})=\frac{1}{3}$ ?
