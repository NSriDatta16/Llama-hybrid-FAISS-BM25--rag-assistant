Why Does the $\propto$ Symbol Replace the $=$ Symbol When Using Bayes' Rule to Convert Posterior Density to Unnormalised Posterior Density?

My textbook says the following: In order to make probability statements about $\theta$ given $y$ , we must begin with a model providing a joint probability distribution for $\theta$ and $y$ . The joint probability mass or density function can be written as a product of two densities that are often referred to as the prior distribution $p(\theta)$ and the sampling distribution (or data distribution ) $p(y|\theta)$ , respectively: $$p(\theta, y) = p(\theta)p(y|\theta)$$ Simply conditioning on the known value of the data $y$ , using the basic property of conditional probability known as Bayes' rule, yields the posterior density: $$p(\theta|y) = \dfrac{p(\theta, y)}{p(y)} = \dfrac{p(\theta)p(y|\theta)}{p(y)}, \tag{1.1}$$ where $p(y) = \sum_\theta p(\theta)p(y|\theta)$ , and the sum is over all possible values of $\theta$ (or $p(y) = \int p(\theta) p(y | \theta) \ d\theta$ in the case of continuous $\theta$ ). An equivalent form of (1.1) omits the factor $p(y)$ , which does not depend on $\theta$ and, with fixed $y$ , can thus be considered a constant, yielding the unnormalised posterior density , which is the right side of (1.2): $$p(\theta|y) \propto p(\theta)p(y|\theta)$$ Page 7, Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition, by Gelman et al. If we have $$p(\theta|y) = \dfrac{p(\theta, y)}{p(y)} = \dfrac{p(\theta)p(y|\theta)}{p(y)} \tag{1.1},$$ then we can multiply through by $p(y)$ to get $$p(\theta, y) = p(\theta)p(y|\theta).$$ So I'm wondering why we change the equals sign to a proportional ( $\propto$ ) sign? Mathematically, why are we doing this? As I demonstrated above, there doesn't seem to be anything that algebraically indicates that that we must do this? I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to clarify this.
