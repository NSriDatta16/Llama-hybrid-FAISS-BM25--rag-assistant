Trigger Teamcity-Build on VCS checkin only when queue is empty

I have a TeamCity (5.1.2) server with currently one agent. During the day, it is idle, unless somebody manually triggers a build. I would like to trigger builds on VCS-Changes to have recent builds available. However, this should not clog the build server at times when people are scheduling manual builds/tests etc, since this has priority. Is there a way to add a build condition that looks at the queue length? I could not find such a variable in the docs: http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD5/Predefined+Properties#PredefinedProperties-ServerBuildProperties Is there something undocumented, or another reasonable heuristic for this scenario?
