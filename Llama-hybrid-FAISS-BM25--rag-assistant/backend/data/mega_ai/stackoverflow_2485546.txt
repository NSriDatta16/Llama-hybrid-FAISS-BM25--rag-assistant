It depends on the nature of the applications, just how big and important they are, as well as the programming culture at your workplace, and the resources available to you. If the applications are valuable enough to you that they are worth the trouble, and you have the necessary resources, then do the update. Don't let the problem persist. If they are not valuable enough to be worth a full-scale update effort, or appropriate resources are not at hand, perhaps work on updating one at a time if possible. Just some suggestions, but again this greatly depends on you and your organization.
