If you wanna redirect the ongoing connection as soon as your proxy program is up, the short answer is hard, really hard and impossible. As far as I've known, once the connection between 2 ends is established, no way you can change it (unless you have access to the router and modify its NAT on the fly, like a load balancer...). If you just want to read & not to modify the traffic data, use WinPcap or any packet sniffer. Either of these solutions are quite expensive to implement in term of money and technical work :) Because you didn't give us what you actual wanna do, I assume that you don't need that "much" complexity. Here a solution just in case you meet the following prerequisites: The client connects to the service via a domain name, not an absolute IP and vice versa. This is important because we are going to change the DNS in the host file to "fake" the end-point servers to our proxy server address. You have access rights (administrator) to the client machine & the service machine to make any change. Then what you should do next is to: Change the IP of the hostname of your service server on your client machine to the IP of the proxy server. This just changes the result of the OS DNS resolver. Do the reversing way for the service server. Drop & re-establish connections between 2 client machine & service server. Now, each connection is properly "proxied" via your proxy server. Ha, quite intricate but it works I think... Hoping someone has better solutions for this situation and I'm looking forward to hearing that.
