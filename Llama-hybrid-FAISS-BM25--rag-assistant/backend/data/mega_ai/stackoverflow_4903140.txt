How to disable the drag in FullCalendar but keep the ability to click on a time slot and have the "placeholder" appointment still render

How do I disable the draggable feature in the below FullCalendar example? While I do not want the "draggable" functionality, I still want the ability to click on a time slot and have the place holder appointment still render as normal. http://arshaw.com/js/fullcalendar/demos/selectable.html
