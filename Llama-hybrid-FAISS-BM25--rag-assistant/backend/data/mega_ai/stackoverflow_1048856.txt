how can I make my jface ITableTabelProvider image scale correctly

How does SWT work out how to scale Images in a Table ? I am using an ITableLabelProvider to provide images for an SWT Table. I have recently widened the table columns from 140 to 170 and I have widened the Image object passed from ITableLabelProvider. SWT now scales this 170-pixel image down to 140 pixels and displays 30 pixels of empty text on the right hand side. I have taken out all the references to the old width that I am aware of. Other cells contain text only, and these are behaving perfectly correctly. The TableItem, Column and Image widths are definitely all 170. I am running swt3.3 and jface 3.4.2 on Windows XP. I have a workaround which listens to the SWT.PaintItem events on the Table, and then drawing the image directly into the Paint Event's Graphics context. This seems to do the trick, but its really bugging me that I don't understand how to make the more elegant solution work.
