I'd like to rewrite first Adam's fragment as // Make temp a static array of 256 chars char temp[256]; strncpy(temp, sizeof(temp), path); temp[sizeof(temp)-1] = '\0'; That way you: 1. don't have magic numbers laced through the code, and 2. you guarantee that your string is null terminated. The second point is at the loss of the last char of your source string if it is >=256 characters long.
