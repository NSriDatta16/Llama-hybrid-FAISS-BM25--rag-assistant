Not sure what you mean "work with it." If the JSON response from Facebook is what you posted, you should be able to do this: foreach ($friends['data'] as $friend) { echo "ID: {$friend['id']}" . PHP_EOL; echo "ID: {$friend['name']}" . PHP_EOL; echo PHP_EOL; } This would produce: ID: 554089741 Name: Tal Rozner ID: 559274789 Name: Daniel Kagan ID: 100001553261234 Name: ron cohen The $friends var would already be an array due to your use of json_decode() . In this case array_keys() isn't needed, and would only produce array (0, 1, 2) .
