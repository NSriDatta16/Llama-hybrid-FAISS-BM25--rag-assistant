Embedding resources (images, sound bits, etc) into a Java project then use those resources

I have searched for a method of embedding a resource in a java project (using Eclipse v3.6.0) then using that embedded resource within a control (e.g., JLabel ). I have seen methods of referencing resources from the file system. Once the project has been developed I would like to publish the application as an executable. It should be noted these executables will be deployed/launched to Windows, *NIX, and Linux platforms. I know this can be done in the Visual Studio world, but I'm very unfamiliar how to do this in Java/Eclipse IDE. As a side question, how do I get Eclipse to create the project as a executable so it can be launched? Any help is greatly appreciated. Mark UPDATE 1: Based upon BalusC's response , I wanted to share the code I have to resolve my problem. My classes are under the package of " Viking.Test " and then I placed the image file under the package " Viking.Test.Resources ". This is all done within Eclipse to import the image into the project. I imported the image by right-clicking on the Project -> Import -> General/File System for the import source. Selected the folder which contained the image to import Selected " Project/src/Viking/Test/Resources " for the 'Into folder' parameter Didn't change any of the options and clicked "Finished" In the source file I added the following code to insert the image into a JLabel ( LblLogo ) try { ClassLoader classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(); InputStream input = classLoader.getResourceAsStream( "Viking/Test/Resources/MyImage.jpg"); Image logo = ImageIO.read(input); LblLogo = new JLabel( new ImageIcon( logo ) ); LblLogo.setBounds(20, 11, 210, 93); getContentPane().add(LblLogo); } catch ( IOException e ) { }
