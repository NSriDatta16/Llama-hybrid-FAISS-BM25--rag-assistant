include typedef inside a class header

This is my header: #ifndef TIMING_H #define TIMING_H #define MAX_MESSAGES 1000 typedef Message* MessageP; //inside the class? class Timing { public: Timing(); private: struct Message { Agent *_agent; double _val; }; MessageP* _msgArr; int _waitingMsgs; }; My question is: do I have to place the typedef inside the class block right above MessageP* _msgArr or is it OK to place it near all the #define? It doesn't output compilation errors so I'm not sure about it.
