As Nosredna said, it's probably because people confuse them with frames, and there are actually a lot of valid arguments against frames. Some of them aren't applicable to iframes, but then again some of them are. The most striking such issue is probably that of deep linking: It's true that iframes suffer from this to a lesser extent than frames, but if you allow your users to navigate between different pages in the iframe, it will be a problem. There's also a couple of usability problems that you'll have to watch out for. The most common examble is that of double scrollbars, which I personally find incredibly annoying. I tend to avoid iframes, mostly because I find it to be an unelegant solution. I've found that when I actually sit down and think about it, there's almost always a better solution. Despite that I also believe that there is a place for them. It's the goto of the web world: Just because it has a history of being misused, it has become consensus that it shouldn't ever be used. That really isn't the case here, but I do believe that you should think twice before using iframes.
