R help - prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading

I am relatively new to R programming and I am using a dataset on Alzheimers disease and trying to predict Normal/Abnormal outcomes using several predictor variables and a logistic regression that divides outcomes to Normal/Abnormal (I grouped Alzheimers, mild cognitive impairment, impairment into the Abnormal category). When I run the logistic regression, I get: Warning messages: 1: In predict.lm(object, newdata, se.fit, scale = 1, type = if (type == : prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading How do you deal with this? Also, my confusion matrix is showing that the model is just predicting almost everything as well, leading to way too many false positives. Any insights on how I've done and what I could do to improve would be greatly appreciated. A link to my code: https://github.com/asimonia/NACC.git All you need to do is change to the correct file path in the argument in the read.csv function. Here are my results: Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4612 -0.3743 -0.2637 -0.1828 3.5832 Coefficients: (2 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std.
