It is not a database problem, but I think it is a problem with Date.parse method in Ruby. Infact when you call Job.new it is not saved to database only a new object of the model is created. I beleive Rails call Date.parse method to convert the string into date object and it gives a error for dd/mm/yyyy format in my machine Date.parse("17/04/2011") => ArgumentError: invalid date from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb:956:in `new_by_frags' from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb:1000:in `parse' from (irb):3 I think Rails escape this error and gives nil for such values job = Job.new(:job_date => "17/04/2011") job.job_date => nil job = Job.new(:job_date => "04/17/2011") job.job_date => Sun, 17 Apr 2011 I guess your production environment's results are same like my machine and your development machine's Ruby, Date.parse may be working for the other format. If you need to handle only one format(Either dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy ), you can use Date.strptime to calculate the date before giving to database job_date = Date.strptime("17/04/2011", "%d/%m/%Y") # or "%m/%d/%Y" job = Job.new(:job_date => job_date) This will work both in your production and development environment for one format.
