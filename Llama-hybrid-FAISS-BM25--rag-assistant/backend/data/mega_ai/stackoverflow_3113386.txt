How to set line spacing/height in a JLabel in Java Swing?

I have the following JLabel code: JLabel someJLabel = new JLabel(" first line second line "); someJLabel.setFont(new Font("Arial", Font.PLAIN, 16)); What I'd like to do is be able to control the line height/spacing between the two lines. PS: I've also looked at using paragraphs instead of breaklines, but it's the same thing. And I don't know if you can do that within an html tag without using css (you can't use css within html code in a JLabel in Java Swing).
