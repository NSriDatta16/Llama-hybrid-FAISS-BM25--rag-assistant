Problem with calling a run file from c# Application

I am using a C# Application to call a Batch file which compiles and run a java program. (This is a scraper project which grabs content from websites.) The batch file consists of following command: java -classpath core.jar;mysql.jar;realtouch.jar; com.parser.MainClass C:/wamp/www/C21_real2/properties http://www.realestate.com.au/realestate/agent/century+21+harbourside+neutral+bay/tzrjnd This batch file is working fine,when i go to the folder and double click on the batch file. But when i am calling this run file through my application using System.Diagnostics.Process , it says: Could not find the main class com.parser.MainClass. Program will exit now. And command window will exit within seconds. I am calling the program from C# as follows: Process batch = new Process(); string pathtoRunFile="E:\\newFiles\\run.bat"; batch.StartInfo.FileName = PathtoRunFile; batch.StartInfo.Arguments = ""; batch.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = true; batch.Start(); batch.WaitForExit(); Please someone help me ASAP. I am really confused why this is not working when i am calling it from my application. I am not much of a Java developer. So is this a problem with my main Java program? If so how to solve this? What I need is to run the batch file from my C# application. The structure of the newfiles folder is as follows: (contains only files) core.jar mysql.jar realtouch.jar run.bat
