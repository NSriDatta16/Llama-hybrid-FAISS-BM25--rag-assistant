If you want a realistic simulation you need to find a distribution that describes the real process good enough (a model). When a real player makes a move he will on average (e.g.) throw X yards, with a standard deviation of Y . This does however not mean that the distribution of throws is a normal distribution. You should plot the (histogrammed) throw distribution and plot your fit (a Normal distribution with mean X and Ïƒ= Y ) and determine if it fits good enough. If not find a distribution that describes the real data better. Once you have that down you need to generate random numbers from the distribution you determined. EDIT If you data is complete enough you could maybe avoid having to create a complete model. You would create a frequency distribution of your data (a histogram) and then do rejection sampling directly from it.
