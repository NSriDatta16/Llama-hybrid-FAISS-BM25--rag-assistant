There are several ways you can link file data into an executable. A platform like Windows allows you to link data into an executable as a "resource" and provides APIs to access those resources (this is how icons and other objects are bound into a Windows executable). This is probably the best way to do it if your platform supports it - support for it is built right into the IDEs. At a lower level, you might be able to use the linker to directly link a file into an executable as an addressable object: Embedding binary blobs using gcc mingw And finally, if you're dealing with a more primitive system like some embedded platforms, you can run your file through something that converts it into source for C array of bytes: Embed image in code, without using resource section or external images
