Averaging lower level variables to get estimate for higher level grouping variable is generally a bad idea - it gives biased results. We call this atomistic fallacy and it is connected to Stein's paradox . For this kind of, hierarchical, data multilevel (or mixed) model is method you should consider. In linear mixed model you estimate both effects for individual-level observations and group level effects, so no information is lost and both levels are included in the model. In LMM you could also include time as a variable in a model. See more: Snijders, T.A.B. and Bosker, R.J. (2012). Multilevel Analysis: An Introduction to Basic and Advanced Multilevel Modeling .
