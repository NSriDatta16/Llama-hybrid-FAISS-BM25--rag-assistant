Criteria for choosing the most appropriate logistic regression model

I've fitted 16 logistic regression models to my data and I'm not sure as to which model to choose as my final model. I looked at a couple of things to help me choose my final model. 1) significance of the predictor variables 2) AIC and BIC 3) area under the ROC curve 4) cross validation error. A model with low AIC or BIC value may have a smaller area under the ROC curve than another model with a higher AIC or BIC. And the model with largest area under the ROC curve may have a higher cross-validation error than a model with a smaller area under the ROC curve. I was able to narrow the 16 possible models down to 4-5 models but I can't make the final decision based on the criteria I used (1-4) since they seem to conflict with one another. How can I go about choosing the best logistic regression model for my data?
