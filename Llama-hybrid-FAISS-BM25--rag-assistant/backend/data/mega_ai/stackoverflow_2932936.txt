Get "As low as" price for bundle product in Magento

I'm trying to display a list of bundled products using my custom template. I'm not able to display the dynamic price of the bundle product. Previously for simple products I used: $product->getPrice(); which worked, but it just displays $0.00 for bundle items. looking at ../catalog/products/list.phtml I tried $this->$getPriceHtml($product, true); after extending my block to Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_Abstract I got simple products working again, but bundle products still show $0.00 Is there another way to display the as low as price for dynamic bundle prices? I cleared cache and reindexed and all that good stuff. The price shows up correctly under the default category list, just not under my custom page. Update I haven't been able to figure out an alternative. When I did a dump of the product collection, for the bundle product fields containing prices are as follows: ["price_type"] => string(1) "0" ["price_view"] => string(1) "0" ["_price_index"] => bool(true) ["_price_index_min_price"] => string(8) "475.0000" ["_price_index_max_price"] => string(8) "475.0000" ["tax_percent"] => float(9) ["final_price"] => int(0) For simple products I only get: ["price"] => string(8) "248.0000" ["final_price"] => string(8) "248.0000" so I suppose I could write my own function to grab the price depending on product type, but I'm guessing there's a better way...
