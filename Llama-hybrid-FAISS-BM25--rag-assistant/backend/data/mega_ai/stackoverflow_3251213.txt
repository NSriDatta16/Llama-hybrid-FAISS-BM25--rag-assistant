Business objects built up directly from a database query

...What is it called? More elaborate: For my application I created a nice business model to work with as in-memory objects. It's storage and view agnostic. Now, for the storage layer, there's a database: I'll construct SQL queries (the fewer the better) that selects/joins etc. all data I need from the relevant tables. A kind of "middle layer" takes the query(s) result and constructs business objects with all relations. Questions: What do you call this approach? What are the best practices? This takes place in a .NET C# project but that's not relevant to this design question. (I found question 441532 to be very similar but I'm interested in more design input) Note: I do not take the ORM approach that relies on tools that do this automatically because the application requires only selected data from a relatively large database.
