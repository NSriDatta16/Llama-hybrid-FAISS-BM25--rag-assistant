Since you are trying to generate slightly different output from the same DocBook XML source, you might want to look into the "profiling" (conditional markup) support in DocBook XSL stylesheets. See Chapter 26 in DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide by Bob Stayton: Profiling is the term used in DocBook to describe conditional text. Conditional text means you can create a single XML document with some elements marked as conditional. When you process such a document, you can specify which conditions apply for that version of output, and the stylesheet will include or exclude the marked text to satisfy the conditions. This feature is useful when you need to produce more than one version of a document, and the versions differ in minor ways. For example, to use different images for, say, Windows and Mac versions of the same document, you might have a DocBook XML fragment like this: The Foo dialog Then, you would use the profiling-enabled versions of the DocBook XSL stylesheets with the profile.os parameter set to windows or mac .
