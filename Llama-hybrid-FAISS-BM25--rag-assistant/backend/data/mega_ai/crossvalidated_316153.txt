Bayesian model selection - variance of parameters and sharpness of boundary

I am reading A note on the evidence and Bayesian Occamâ€™s razor paper on model selection. In page 3 it is mentioned that a prior $\mathcal{N}(0, 10^2)$ is used for each parameter $w_i$ of each model. The author goes on to mention that such a large variance makes our models put most of their mass on settings with sharp linear boundaries. Can someone explain why is that? How is the variance of our parameter's prior correlated to the form of our model's boundary?
