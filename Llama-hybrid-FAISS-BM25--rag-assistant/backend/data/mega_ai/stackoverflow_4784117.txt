Magento How to debug blank white screen

I have an error in my Magento backend that results in a blank screen (WSOD). I have set errors to on in admin but there is nothing being created in var/logs/. (I have checked permissions for that directory and all is correct). I have also ini_set('display_errors', 1) in index.php and Magento is set to developer mode. I have also enabled apache and php error logs. No errors are being logged though?! Anyone have a clue as to why errors aren't being shown? As I'm confused! Thanks
