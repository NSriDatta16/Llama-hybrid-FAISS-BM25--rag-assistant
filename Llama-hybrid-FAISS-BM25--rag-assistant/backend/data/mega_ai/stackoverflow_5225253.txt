I experienced the Unable to instantiate default tuplizer [org.hibernate.tuple.entity.PojoEntityTuplizer] because I had a momentary lapse of donkeyness when renaming a field on a POJO that I had previously mapped. I changed the Java attribute name with my trusty IDE refactor hotkey, which does not also change the getter & setter method names. I changed the getter (because it caught my attention with its @Column annotation that I also needed to address because the table column name was changing). I neglected, however, to change the setter, and that was the cause of the error.
