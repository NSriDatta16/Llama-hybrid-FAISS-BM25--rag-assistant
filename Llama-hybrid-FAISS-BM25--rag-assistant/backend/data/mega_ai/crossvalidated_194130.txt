Cross-correlation of two autocorrelated signals (removing autocorrelation with ARIMA)

I want to get the cross-correlation of two time series x and y in R. I have calculated an ARIMA model, and I can get the mod1$residuals from signal x . These residuals almost have no autocorrelation, so that's great. xts I now did the same procedure on signal y . My question is: is this correct? Or should I somehow deduct the mod1 (based on x ) from y to de-trend it? ccf(mod1$residuals, mod2$residuals) Secondly, I am confused about the order of operations. Should I prewhiten the data before calculating the model? I found this code: prewhiten(x, y, x.model = ar.res,ylab="CCF", ...) Should I estimate the mod1 first and then supply it to the function prewhiten ? And are x and y the two time series? Many thanks!
