Getting the lowest possible sum from numbers' difference

I have to find the lowest possible sum from numbers' difference. Let's say I have 4 numbers. 1515, 1520, 1500 and 1535. The lowest sum of difference is 30, because 1535 - 1520 = 15 && 1515 - 1500 = 15 and 15 + 15 = 30. If I would do like this: 1520 - 1515 = 5 && 1535 - 1500 = 35 it would be 40 in sum. Hope you got it, if not, ask me. Any ideas how to program this? I just found this online, tried to translate from my language to English. It sounds interesting. I can't do bruteforce, because it would take ages to compile. I don't need code, just ideas how to program or little fragment of code. Thanks. Edit: I didn't post everything... One more edition: I have let's say 8 possible numbers. But I have to take only 6 of them to make the smallest sum. For instance, numbers 1731, 1572, 2041, 1561, 1682, 1572, 1609, 1731 , the smallest sum will be 48, but here I have to take only 6 numbers from 8.
