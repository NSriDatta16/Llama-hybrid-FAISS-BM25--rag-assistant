First group the elements by ResultCount so that you only get one result for each distinct value of ResultCount . Then for each group select the element in that group with the highest priority. Try this query: IEnumerable distinctResultsAgents = from d in distinctUrlsAgents group d by d.ResultCount into g select g.OrderByDescending(x => x.Priority).First(); If you use morelinq there is a function called MaxBy that you could use instead of the last line, but note that it only works for LINQ To Objects.
