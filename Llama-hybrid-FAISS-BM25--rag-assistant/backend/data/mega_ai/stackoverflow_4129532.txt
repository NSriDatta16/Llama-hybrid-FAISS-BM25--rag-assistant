Is the BlackBerry code signing service down at the moment?

My BlackBerry code signing has started to fail with an “Error connecting to web signer from proxy”. Searching the web seems to indicate this is a problem with the BlackBerry code signing service. Is anybody else hitting this at the moment? Wireshark indicates I am getting a response from www.rim.net with the error message in. Request: POST /Websigner/servlet/Runtime HTTP/1.1 Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache User-Agent: Java/1.6.0_21 Host: www.rim.net Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, / ; q=.2 Connection: keep-alive Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 268 CSC File according to the specs for the Signature Tool.
