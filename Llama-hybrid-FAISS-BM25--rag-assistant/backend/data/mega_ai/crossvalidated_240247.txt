First your title is not accurate, we are not transforming model , but data . For the topic, you can search basis expansion as key word. In the example shown, search kernel PCA is another option. Note, wikipeida on kernel PCA has very similar figure. Some related resources in CV (with different basis, most polynomial basis) Best basis set for polynomial expansion What's wrong to fit periodic data with polynomials? How do I go about increasing model complexity? Why are there large coefficents for higher-order polynomial
