Gantt Chart online

I need to insert a horizontal bar chart in a web page. The thing I have to do is very similar to a Gantt Chart. I'd like to use a javascript library for the purpose. I tried jsgantt, but actually it is not very beautiful. I could evaluate also a server generation of the graph. In case my server side language is Python. It will be part of an internal project with no internet access, so Google Charts isn't an option.
