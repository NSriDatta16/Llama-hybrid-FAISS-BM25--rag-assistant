Interpreting ccf() plot in R

I was hoping you could help me interpret the following cross-correlation plot of U.S. and China short-term interest rate time series(1997-2015). I am a beginner to statistics, so I apologize if I am making simple mistakes. Would it be correct to say that since a lag of 4-5 months will yield a correlation of just shy of -0.3, which is past the dotted line (is that the 5% chance of randomness demarcation?), I can say that this lag will give us a statically significant correlation? I doubt this is true (4-5 month lag seems very arbitrary), but I'm not sure what the correct interpretation would be. Thanks!
