global variable from django to javascript

I would like some variables from my settings.py to be available in every javascript running across my project. What is the most elegant way of achieving this? Right now I can think of two: write a context processor and declare those globals in a base template. All templates must extend the base template. declare those globals in a dynamically generated .js file (by some view) and load this file using tag in a base template. All templates must extend the base template. Can I do it without a base template?
