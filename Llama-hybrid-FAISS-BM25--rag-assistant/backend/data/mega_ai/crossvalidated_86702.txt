Since for covariance stationary processes the covariance does not depend on t but on h for $\text{Cov}[y_t,y_{t+h}]$, it is possible to detect serial pattern in a time series. Consider quarterly measured GNP. Here, one can usually detect an increasing GNP in summer and an decreasing GNP in winter. Hence, there is dependence depending on the season of the year.
