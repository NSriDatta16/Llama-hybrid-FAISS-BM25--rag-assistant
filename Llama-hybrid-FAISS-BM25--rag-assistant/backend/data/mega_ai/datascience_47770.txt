No. I don't think so. And I don't think that is what "multivariate" means. I rather think all of Weka's APIs and classifiers assume that there is exactly one attribute which gets assigned the "class" attribute label (that's the column to be predicted/classified). Although there is a MultiClassClassifier meta-classifier, this is designed to improve algorithms that can only handle binary class-attribute prediction problems (e.g. Weka's Glass.arff dataset with Logistic regression)
