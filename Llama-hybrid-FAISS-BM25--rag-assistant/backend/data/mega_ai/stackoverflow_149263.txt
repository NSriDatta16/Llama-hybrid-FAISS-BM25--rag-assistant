I'm actually a fan of the CS3 ones mainly because it is so easy to just double click on those bad boys and edit right in the Flash IDE using the drawing tools. Very helpful for those times where you have to rapidly push a skinned video player to production... On the open source side there's also Thimbault Imbert's Liquid Components ( http://www.bytearray.org/?p=137 ) demo here ( http://www.bytearray.org/?p=109 )... It's pretty darn awesome and does runtime skinning which was a major time saver in a project I was working on. Pretty easy to get started with too...
