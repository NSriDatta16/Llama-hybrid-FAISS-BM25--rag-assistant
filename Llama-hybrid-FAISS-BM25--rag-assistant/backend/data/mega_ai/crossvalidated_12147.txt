Code the outcome as -1 and 1, and run glmselect, and apply a cutoff of zero to the prediction. For a reference to this trick see Hastie Tibshirani Friedman-Elements of statistical learning 2nd ed -2009 page 661 "Lasso regression can be applied to a two-class classifcation problem by coding the outcome +-1, and applying a cutoff (usually 0) to the predictions." It's a quick and dirty trick. Lasso penalty can be applied to logistic regression, but it's not implemented in sas. In that case you have to try the R packages.
