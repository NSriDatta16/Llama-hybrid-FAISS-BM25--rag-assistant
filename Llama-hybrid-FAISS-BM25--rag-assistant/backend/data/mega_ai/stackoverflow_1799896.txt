Does there exist a digital image steganography algorithm which would be resistant to image manipulation?

I'm wondering - is there a steganography solution for digital images which is resistant to image manipulations? With "manipulations" I mean the most standard operations - recompressing JPEGs (or even changing file formats entirely), cropping and scaling. The application of this method would naturally be for image copyright protection. I fully understand that the more image is manipulated the less are the chances that the steganographic watermark is intact, but at least some degree of resistance would be nice.
