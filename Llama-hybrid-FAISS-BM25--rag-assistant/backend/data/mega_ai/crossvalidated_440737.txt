You do not indicate if you have multiple human subjects in your study who are supposed to mention these preposition phrases. If you do, your model would need to reflect this by also including a random effect for subject. With your model as it currently is formulated, the odds ratio of 1.26 refers just to a "typical" verb (i.e., one for which the random intercept and the random slope of bin_figure_anim are equal to 0). The odds ratios corresponding to other verbs will vary around 1.25, with the extent of variation governed by the variance of the random slopes of bin_figure_anim. In your case, it probably would be informative to describe the extent of this variation. So the first takeaway would be to not overreact when seeing the odds ratio for the "typical" verb - the odds ratios for other verbs could be higher/smaller than it. Focusing on the "typical" verb, you can construct a confidence interval for the true odds ratio associated with it. Some people would choose a higher confidence level (e.g., 99%) to offset the fact that the sample size is quite large. (For the same reason, they would use a significance level alpha = 0.01 for their tests of significance.). The confint() function will help you get this interval on the log odds scale - you can exponentiate its endpoints to get the interval on the odds ratio scale. Let's say this interval comes out to be (1.11, 1.35) on the odds ratio scale. While your best guess from the data is that the true odds ratio for the "typical" verb is 1.26, in actuality this true ratio can be as low as 1.11 and as high as 1.35. This type of statement will more aptly describe the uncertainty involved in estimating the true odds ratio for the "typical" verb. It will also help you focus on describing the "effect size", as recommended in @RobertLong's excellent answer. The size of the sample should play in your favour in terms of helping you produce a better value for your best guess as to what the true odds ratio is for the "typical" verb. When constructing a confidence interval for this true value, you can guard against the large sample size by choosing a higher confidence level (e.g., 99%). Similarly, you can choose a smaller significance level for your significance tests involving this true value (e.g., alpha = 0.05). P.S. It's helpful to define your variables and their values more explicitly when posting here. For example, what does bin_figure_anim mean? Is it a binary variable? When does it take the value 0 and when does it take the value 1? Describing your study design (briefly) is also recommended - this way, people can tell whether your proposed model adequately reflects your study design or not.
