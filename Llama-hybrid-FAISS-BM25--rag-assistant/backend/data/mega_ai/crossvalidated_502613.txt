Bayesian least absolute deviations

Ordinary Least Squares have a bayesian equivalent. For instance, fitting the linear model $$ y \sim a + bx + \epsilon $$ using OLS is equivalent to defining the following Bayesian linear model: $$ y \sim N(a + bx, \sigma) $$ $$ a \sim N(0, 1) $$ $$ b \sim N(0, 1) $$ $$ \sigma \sim exp(1) $$ (this is more or less equivalent, as the Bayesian model adds regularization via the prior, and it is actually equivalent to fitting a ridge regression). Is there an equivalent Bayesian model to the least absolute deviation fit? Please note that ordinary least squares implies solving: $$\min_{a, b} |y - a - bx|^2 $$ while least absolute deviations solve: $$\min_{a, b} |y - a - bx| $$
