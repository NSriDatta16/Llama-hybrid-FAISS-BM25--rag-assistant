SIFT and Neural Network Matlab

My project is to recognize ancient coins. I have used David Lowe's SIFT algorithm to extract features of images. [siftImage, descriptors, locs] = sift(filteredImg); Now I want to give these features to a neural network for training images. 1) What value should I feed to Neural network as input? (descriptors vector or locs) 2) How can I use it for neural network? Can someone please help me? Thanks a lot in advance.
