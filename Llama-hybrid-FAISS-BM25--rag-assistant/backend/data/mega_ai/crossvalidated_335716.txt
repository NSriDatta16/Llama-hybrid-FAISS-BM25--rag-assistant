What role does stochastic independence have for Bayesians

I recently read a chapter about Subjectivist notions of Probability in Gillies (2012) and I stumbled upon the concept of exchangeability as the Bayesian version of independence (or something similar at least). No I understand that stochastic independence prohibits me from learning from experience when I repeat an experiment, as if my belief of the result on the n-th trial is independent of the previous results my posterior beliefs will not change. My question is now whether stochastic indepedence does play a role in Bayesian statistics or whether it is not an important concept at all.
