Gradient Exchange

I read a paper on Deep Neural Networks Compression (link: https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkhQHMW0W ) and came across a term "gradient exchange", I tried making sense out of it but couldn't exactly understand what it intuitively refers to. What does the term gradient exchange mean?
