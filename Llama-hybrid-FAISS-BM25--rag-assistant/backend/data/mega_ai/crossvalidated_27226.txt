I think I have figured it out for the one sample case after updating my knowledge with Doing Bayesian Data Analysis and the rjags code contained within. The model specification I've used below gives me a slope of ~ 1 and intercept of ~ 0 when the BIC Bayes factor approximation is regressed against the Bayes factor from the rjags model. model { # Likelihood: for( i in 1 : N ) { y[i] ~ dnorm( mu , tau ) # tau is precision, not SD } # Prior: tau ~ dnorm( yprec , (yprec^2)/2 ) mu ~ dnorm( amu , atau ) #Hyperprior atau And the input data: y = rnorm( n=200 , mean=1 , sd=1 ) yprec = 1/var(y) ymean = mean(y) And for linear regression: model { for( i in 1 : Ndata ) { y[i] ~ dnorm( mu[i] , tau ) mu[i] Regression input data: x Framework for these models is from Kruschke
