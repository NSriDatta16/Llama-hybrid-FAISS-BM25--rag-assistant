What options for mobile support are there for a large GWT web application?

For a large system comprised of rich web pages (not full apps) and web apps (real RIA) built on GWT, what's the best strategy for supporting mobile? Must support: iPhone, Android, Blackberry. Nice to have: iPad / tablets, Windows 7 Mobile, older feature phones. Background: Google Web Toolkit (GWT) does not natively support mobile web browsers other than newer iPhone/Android (webkit). GWT was adopted by our company for its cross browser support, our developers' familiarity with Java server-side development, our lack of in-house JavaScript/HTML/CSS mastery, and the relative immaturity of JQuery at the time (early 2007). Now, in March 2011, JQuery is mature and widely adopted, JQuery Mobile 1.0 is near, and the JQuery plugin ecosystem is thriving. A few possible answers to this question: Leverage our web app's GWT codebase with one or more of: GWT Mobile, gwt-mobile-webkit, PhoneGap w/ GWT. (I'd question the maturity of each of these.) Create separate mobile pages/apps from scratch using JQuery Mobile and plugins. (This is unappealing as it looks like a "full rewrite".) Create native mobile apps. (This is costly due to lack of native mobile dev expertise and the numerous mobile platforms required.) Thanks for any enlightened comments!
