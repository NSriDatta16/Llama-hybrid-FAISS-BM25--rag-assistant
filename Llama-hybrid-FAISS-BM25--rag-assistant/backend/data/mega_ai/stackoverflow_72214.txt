Well I don't agree with your comment on replication. You can start a replication by creating a database from scratch, and you can control either the updates will be done by updating the available client database or simply recreating the database. Automated replication will ease your work by automatically managing keys and relations. I think the easiest thing to do is to start a snapshot replication through MSSQL Server Studio, get the T-SQL corresponding scripts (ie the corresponding T-SQL instructions for both publication and subscriptions), and record these scripts as part of a job in the Jobs list of the SQL Agent or as a replication job in the replications folder.
