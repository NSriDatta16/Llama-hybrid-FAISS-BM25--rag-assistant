Jquery Help : Draggable to Sortable and then back to draggable again

I have a pool of items in the drag list which is connected to a sortable using connectToSortable option. Now I want to remove some items from this sort list and move them back to the drag list. Sort of like an undo. Suppose the user moves some 5 items to sort list and decides he/she wants only 4 items, and decides to just drag the unwanted item from the sortlist TO the drag list. How do I accomplish this WITHOUT adding a "remove" link in the sort list. Thanks a lot.
