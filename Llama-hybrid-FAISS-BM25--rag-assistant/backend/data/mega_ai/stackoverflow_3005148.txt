1 - diff languages have their pros and cons. There are families of languages (functional, dynamic, static, etc.) which are better for specific problem domains. You'd need to learn one in each family to know when to choose which one. e.g. to write a simple script, I'd pick Ruby over C# 2 - Compiling it to CIL: Portability may not be a big deal.. but to be precise Mono has an implementation of the CLR on Linux. So there. Also CIL helps you to mix-and-match across languages that run on the CLR. e.g. IronRuby can access standard framework libraries written in C#. It also enables the CLR to leverage the actual hardware (e.g. turn on optimizations, use specific instructions) on which the program is run. The CLR on 2 machines would produce the best native code from the same IL for the respective machine.
