My understanding may be incorrect, but isn't the first step is just fitting a regression between time series using OLS - and it shows you if time series are really cointegrated (if residuals from this regression are stationary). But then cointegration is kind of a long-term relation between time-series and your residuals although stationary may still have some short-term autocorrelation structure that you may exploit to fit a better model and get better predictions and this "long-term + short term" model is VECM. So if you need only long-term relation, you may stop at the first step and use just cointegration relation.
