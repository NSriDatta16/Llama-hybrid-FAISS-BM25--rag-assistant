TLDR: Glen_b is correct. What is known is the sample standard deviation 's' and sample mean 'x bar'. The population standard deviation sigma and population mean Mu are unknown. That is the basic difference between mathematics and statistics. In math we are calculating known and exact quantities. In statistics, we estimate things we call parameters (e.g. mean and standard deviation) of an inaccessible population that are of course unknown , based on an accessible sample. This is because for most problems in science, social science, economics, and especially behavioral and health sciences, population parameters are generally unknown and the data we need to find them are impractical to obtain. (Think the average weight of all men in a given country or average size of all stars in the universe or how often the average person uses profanity)? It is not practical to get the data we need to calculate that. What is practical is to take fairly selected representative sample to estimate a range for where the population's parameters we are estimating probably falls and how likely that parameter is outside that range. We consider a few things to do this: The sample mean sample standard deviation (a measure of how in consistent the data is). Low standard deviation means we may be able to put the parameter in a narrower range and / or have higher confidence the parameter is in that range. sample size (More samples may mean we can have a narrower range and / or higher confidence the parameter is in that range.) overall distribution of the data Most ways to extrapolate a range and confidence for a population parameter that are taught in an introductory stats class will presume that the data are normally distributed, and if the data are not, it won't give you a correct range and confidence. This means that examples equally above and below the mean are equally common, and most examples are close to the mean while examples far from the mean are unusual in the data you have. For example, you may get incorrect extrapolations if you have a data set of the weights of citizens of a country where obesity is common. The data will be skewed to the right on on that bell curve. This means, in other words, examples above the mean will be more common than those below.
