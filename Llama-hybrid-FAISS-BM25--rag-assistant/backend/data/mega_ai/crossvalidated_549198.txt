You could try logistic regression, assuming your sample size is sufficiently large for that (you did not tell us). One advantage of that is that you wil get an estimated probability for a consumer return, as a function of the covariates used. Covariates could be both describing properties of buyers, and properties of products. After question got edited with more details: You do have many features, some categorical with many distinct values. So, I would try regularized logistic regression, maybe group lasso, see Why use group lasso instead of lasso? . variable shoe description might need special treatment, since it is a natural language description. Maybe try some kind of embedding? See this list of posts with answers . date, as you proposed, but to see for changes with time you could also represent it via splines.
