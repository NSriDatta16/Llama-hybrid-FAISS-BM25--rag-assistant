To fit a curve to model direct mail marketing responses. How to obtain the % of responses that are likely to occur each day

I'm trying to model the responses from a direct mail marketing campaign so that I can use it to forecast for future campaigns. I started, in the code below, with the average number of responses by day of a historical campaign (contained in the vector: "responses"). I was then able to fit a 63-day (8-wk) smooth curve to model the data. But I now need a way to use this curve to help me with forecasting. For example, if I think I'll get x number of total responses from a campaign, I need to know when those responses are most likely to happen. In other words, I need the daily "factors" (i.e. the percentage of the total responses that is most likely to respond on each day). p.s. if anyone has a better way of approaching this I'd love to hear! #vector of direct mail marketing responses over 63 days responses
