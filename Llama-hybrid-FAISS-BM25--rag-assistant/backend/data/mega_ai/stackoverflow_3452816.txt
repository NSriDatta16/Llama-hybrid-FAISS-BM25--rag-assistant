Does IE8 out-of-the-box have support for 'localStorage'

I am trying to use the HTML5 feature localStorage . According to this blog it can be done using IE8, however when I try to use it I get a javascript error 'localStorage is null or not an object' So my question: can localStorage be used by IE8 out-of-the-box? Here is my code: IE8 - DOM Storage function Save() { localStorage.setItem('key','value'); } Save
