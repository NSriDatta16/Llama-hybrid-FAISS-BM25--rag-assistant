VBA ODBC Update

This is the code I'm using to update an SQL database: Public Sub main() Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection Set rst = New ADODB.Recordset cnn.Open "ConnectionName" rst.ActiveConnection = cnn rst.CursorLocation = adUseServer rst.Source = "Update Table ..." rst.Open Set rst = Nothing Set cnn = Nothing End Sub What I want to know is if and how I should deal with the rst object after opening it. Do I close it? When I try doing rst.Close, I get the error: "Operation is not allowed when the object is closed". The code works fine without rst.Close, I'm wondering if there are any dangers to not closing the object.
