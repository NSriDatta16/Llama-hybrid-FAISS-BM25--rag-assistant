MCMC for Bayesian Inference (Gibbs Sampling) Varying Observed Data

At every step $k$, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference with Gibbs sampling draws a parameter of the model to fit, $\beta_i^{(k)}$, from the conditional $Pr\left(\beta_i^{(k)}|\beta_1^{(k)},...,\beta_{i-1}^{(k)},\beta_{i+1}^{(k-1)},...,\beta_N^{(k-1)},X\right)$, where $X$ is the observed data. Do you know of some paper exploring this algorithm (or similia) where the data $X$ also vary along the chain? I do not mean at every step, just sometimes along the chain; imagine e.g. some financial transactions which happen almost continuously, and whose model always has to adapt. Thanks!
