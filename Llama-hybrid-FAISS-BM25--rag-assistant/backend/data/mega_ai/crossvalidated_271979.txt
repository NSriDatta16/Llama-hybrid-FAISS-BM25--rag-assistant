Does applying PCA result in loss of information?

I have huge dataset, each independedntly varying and has different units. Also, I want to cluster similar variables. This is the end result. In order to do this, the first step I intend to follow is PCA(Principle Component Analysis). But few informed me that 'Since dataset is of different units and Size. It would make no sense to do PCA.' My argument is that I would normalize the dataset and then apply PCA. But still they replied stating that it will lose information. My question here: Lets consider simple dataset by dividing with their MAX values X Y Z 999 2 70 1000 1 0 990 0.4 2 If I normalize this (by dividing by corresponding MAX) X Y Z .999 1 1.0 1.0 0.5 0 .99 0.2 .0285 Now, I apply PCA Further, I revert the X,Y,Z by multiplying with their MAX values.So that values are preserved Please let me know if my approach is correct. Also, How can I prevent this loss of information inspite of applying PCA
