The first principal component is a linear combination of all your features. The fact that it explains almost all the variability just means that most of the coefficients of the variables in the first principal component are significant. Now the classification trees you generate are a bit of a different animal too. They do binary splits on continuous variables that best separate the categories you want to classify. That is not exactly the same as finding orthogonal linear combinations of continuous variables that give the direction of greatest variance. In fact we have recently discussed a paper on CV where PCA was used for cluster analysis and the author(s) found that there are situations wher best separation is found not in the 1st few principal components but rather in the last ones.
