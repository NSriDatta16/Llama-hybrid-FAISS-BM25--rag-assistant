Is there a performance hit when running obfuscated code?

All, I am proposing the addition of code obfuscation to the standard build process at my organization. One of the questions being asked is whether there is a performance hit to running obfuscated code vs. running unobfuscated code. What is your experience? Have you seen a reduction in performance at runtime because you obfuscated your Java or C# code? Thanks, VI
