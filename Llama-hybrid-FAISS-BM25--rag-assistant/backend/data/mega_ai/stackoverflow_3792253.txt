jQuery UI draggable does not work in Firefox with "error draggable() is not a function"

It is really weird that the draggable works in all browsers but Firefox. I tried in IE6.0, Opera, Safari, all are ok. But Firefox prompted below error: $("#draggable").draggable is not a function. Here is my code: jQuery UI Draggable - Default functionality #draggable { width: 150px; height: 150px; padding: 0.5em;} $(function() { $( "#draggable" ).draggable(); }); Drag me around
