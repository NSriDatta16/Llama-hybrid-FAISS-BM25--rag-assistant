How do I Make a Web Crawling Application User-Friendly

I'm creating a web crawling application that I want the 'average' user to be able to use. I'm concerned that a web crawling application is probably just too complex for most users though because users need to: Understand URL structure (domain, path, etc...). Understand crawling 'depth'. Understand file extensions and be able to setup 'filters' to narrow their crawling to achieve better performance (or they'll be frustrated with the program). Understand where URLs are found in pages (image srcs, links, plain text URLs, etc...). What can I do to help users get quickly acquainted with my program? Or even better, what can I do so the program is intuitive enough that users just 'get it'? I know this seems pretty broad, but if you can confine your answers to web crawlers that should help. I've read up on general usability, ui design, etc... but I'm struggling with the domain I'm working in. Thanks.
