auto.arima prediction

I have this time series of call volume of a contact center. It is composed of 15565 points where every 48 points represents one day. I used 12960 points as training set for the auto.arima model. According to the testing below maximum number of non-seasonal differences allowed ndiffs(TS, alpha=0.05, test=c("kpss","adf", "pp"), max.d=2) 1 0 maximum number of seasonal differences allowed nsdiffs(TS, m=frequency(TS), test=c("ocsb","ch"), max.D=2) 1 0 there is no need for seasonal or non-seasonal differencing although the auto.arima do the differencing automatically if required. However, the accuracy of the 5 day ahead forecast is poor as shown below. Can anyone tell me what I'm missing here.
