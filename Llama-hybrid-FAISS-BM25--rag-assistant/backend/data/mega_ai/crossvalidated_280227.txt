How to correct for multiple comparisons in time series data?

I have two time series (length N) and I did a t-test to look at the difference between the two time series time point by time point. So I get N p-values from this. Obviously I need to correct for multiple comparisons but I'm wondering what's the best way to do it. I think most people use FDR, but I wonder if that's too strict too, because (please correct me if I'm mistaken) it assumes independence among time points, which is probably not true in time series data. I'm thinking maybe some form of bootstrapping may help?
