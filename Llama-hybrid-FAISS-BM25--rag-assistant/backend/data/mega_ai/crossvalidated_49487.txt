Species scaling methods in PCoA or CAP using vegan::capscale?

I want to study relations between sites categories and species abundances through PCoA or CAP using vegan::capscale. For doing so, I overlay species scores on my ordination. However, I am getting confused with the different scaling options and their interpretation. From what I understood: With scaling=1, arrow shows the direction from the origin for which sites have larger abundances for this species. With scaling=2, we want to analyze the correlations among species. Species that have a small angle between their arrows are expected to be strongly positively correlated. With scaling=-2, const = sqrt(nrow(dune)-1), we get correlations between species and axes. This comes from Jari Oksanen . I did compare the 3 different options (see codes below), differences seem to be only a matter of arrow length. Hence, by considering that the most important are the relative length of arrows (relative to each other), am I allowed to use scaling=-2 (species axes correlations) for both analyzing site-species associations and species-species correlations? One more questions, is there a well admitted threshold in the value of species-axes correlations, below which we consider that species are not correlated (I mean species don't differ in abundance across the sites, excluding the cases of non linear relationships). If yes, do this threshold change depending on the scaling method used and on either the ordination is constrained or not. Morover, if I want to overlay a vector for a quantitative environnemental variable, may I use also scaling=-2, from which correlation threshold? library(vegan) library(ggplot2) library(grid) data(dune) data(dune.env) dune=sqrt(dune) mcap=capscale(dune~1,dist="bray") #PCoA #sites scores dims=c(1,2) site=scores(mcap,display="wa",choices=dims) site.env=cbind(site,dune.env) #spider for management levels dev.new();plot(mcap);coord_spider=with(dune.env,ordispider(mcap,Management,col="blue",label=F,choices=dims));dev.off() coord_spider=as.data.frame(cbind(coord_spider[,],site.env)) names(coord_spider)[1:4]=c("MDS1","MDS2","MDS1end","MDS2end") #species scores #scaling1 cor.min=0.6 #below this threshold, arrows will be not plotted because correlation is considered too much week cor_sp=as.data.frame(scores(mcap, dis="sp", scaling=1,choices=dims)) cor_sp$cor=with(cor_sp,sqrt(MDS1^2+MDS2^2)) cor_sp$sup=FALSE;cor_sp$sup[cor_sp$cor>=cor.min] =cor.min] =cor.min]
