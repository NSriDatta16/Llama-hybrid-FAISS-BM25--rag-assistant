How can I change the namespace on every node in a DOM?

How can I, given a w3c DOM (Java's default implementation, specifically) change the namespace of every element/attribute/node in that DOM? Efficiently, preferably. The DOM doesn't seem to have a setNamespaceURI method on it, which is inconvenient. I've tried XSL approaches, but they've failed to work in the JAXP transformers (although they work all right in Saxon9B, which I can't use for various other reasons). Basically, I need a pure core java solution that will allow me to take one document and change its namespace.
