Your first step should be to examine your data thoroughly before attempting to classify. Try doing some exploratory analysis: calculate some standard features (based on edge, texture and colour as you say), then examine if those features can distinguish between your two classes ( normal or lesion ). Matlab's Bioinformatics toolbox provides decent SVM functions ( svmtrain and svmclassify ), to start, try classifying your features using default hyperparameters (C=1, sigma=1). Once you have gotten to grips with that, you can investigate using feature selection methods and nested cross validation to improve your performance estimates.
