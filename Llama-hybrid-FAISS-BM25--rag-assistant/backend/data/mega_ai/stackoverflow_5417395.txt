CompanyName in all new Xcode files not working

Since upgrading to Xcode 4 my company name is not appearing in any new files I create instead this appears: Copyright 2011 MyCompanyName . All rights reserved. I have gone into Terminal and run the command and restarted Xcode but nothing happens: defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomerTemplateMacroDefinitions'{"ORGANIZATIONNAME" = "MyCompany";}' defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomerTemplateMacroDefinitions'{'ORGANIZATIONNAME' = "MyCompany";}'
