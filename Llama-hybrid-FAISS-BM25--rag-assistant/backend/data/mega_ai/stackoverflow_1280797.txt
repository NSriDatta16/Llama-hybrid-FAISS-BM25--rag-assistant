An elegant solution would be to create a subclass of the builtin double MATLAB class and overload the subsref method: classdef myDouble You could then use this class as follows: >> a = myDouble(1:10); >> a(1:3) ans = myDouble double data: 1 2 3 Methods, Superclasses >> a('asdsa') ans = NaN >> a({1, 'asdf'}) ans = NaN Since the subclass inherits from the double class, you still get all the functionality of the double class and the added functionality of your custom myDouble class. Check out the MATLAB help on: constructing subclasses the subsref method
