Since this one was effectively answered in the comments this answer just brings it together for the benefit of future readers. Any intellectual credit goes to @abousetta and @wolfgang not to me. The method outlined is known as Bucher's method after the first author of this paper in J Clin Epid entitled "The results of direct and indirect comparisons in meta--analysis of randomized controlled trials". It is also discussed in the Cochrane handbook. The indirect effect is obtained by subtraction of the log risks for the comparison of the two conditions with a common comparator. The method of network meta-analysis would be appropriate and might have advantages since techniques exist for exploring inconsistency and software for network meta-analysis usually provides interesting graphical display options.
