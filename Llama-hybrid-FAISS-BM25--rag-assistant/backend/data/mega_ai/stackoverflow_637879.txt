In addition, it's worth remembering that the X server is just another program that gets run under linux. There's nothing special about it, it just happens to know how to grab onto the graphics card and take over the monitor using video drivers. You can (theoretically) run linux very happily without ever running an X server - although of course, you would be limited to the command line programs. That's how linux organises itself - kernel at the base, then a set of programs that provide functionality to higher level programs, which themselves provide functionality to higher level programs, all building up into a complete stack of software oriented to whatever the job of the machine is (say, general desktop, software development, web server, etc). Beyond the kernel and it's modules, nothing is 'special'.
