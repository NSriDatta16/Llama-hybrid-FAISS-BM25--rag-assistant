Perl File::Find Undocumented Globals

$File::Find is a powerful way for traversing a directory tree. I came across the need to determine (inside the wanted function) the top directory from which the recursive search started. This perldoc mentions $File::Find::topdir which appears to contains exactly what I needed. So, the particular script I was writing now works. However, I was curious is there more documentation on this and the other globals mentioned in the same paragraph: $File::Find::topdir $File::Find::topdev $File::Find::topino $File::Find::topmode $File::Find::topnlink $File::Find::fullname $File::Find::prune Or alternatively, could you guys comment on any of these globals if you have used it in your own script-writing ventures.
