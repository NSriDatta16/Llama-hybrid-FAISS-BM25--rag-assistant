I would definitely disagree with that assessment. The only Pro feature that I can think of that might affect reliability is a different caching provider (which we've had more problems with than the standard caching provider). I believe it's the suggested provider for a web farm scenario, but in most typical scenarios it won't be a big issue. The community edition is the same community edition that's been used in real sites for years, there's been no crippling to it since the introduction of the Pro version. The Pro version is just a number of custom extensions on top of the community edition, most of which are quite optional for everyday use a website. The Edition Comparison on DotNetNuke.com shows the following inequalities: Advanced Content Approval Workflows Content approvals ensure any of your users impacted by a content change can approve updates before they go live. Workflow approvals can be configured in a top down hierarchy at the site, page, and module level. A business rules engine enables workflows with an unlimited number of states and reviewers Granular Permissions Page, module and folder level extended permissions provide granular security rights which allow you to precisely define which content contributors can edit which modules on each page. Advanced Site Search The search engine includes rich query syntax with support for Boolean searches, phrase searches, relevance searches, wild cards, fuzzy searches, and groupings. Includes a true web spider that is capable of indexing any site which removes the requirement to implement the ISearchable interface within modules. Configuration Manager A host user can manage the various configuration files that control run-time operation. Upload a Configuration Merge script which can be used to automate many of the more repetitive and complex configuration operations. Content Staging Content contributors and software engineers make all changes to your web site on a physically separate staging server. You push the staging site to production when all changes have been reviewed, tested and approved. My Editable Pages Links to all of the pages and modules in the site which a user has permission to Edit are displayed, allowing efficient page editing Document Management A complete document management solution which allows your organization to store, control and view documents online Module Caching A database caching provider for module content which stores module content in a centralized database for faster page loading without requiring web server processing. Page Caching Allows your site to save an entire page of rendered content to one of three different caching locations: memory, database or disk. Improves page delivery speed for site visitors. Distributed Caching Provider More efficient resource usage in large web farms File Integrity Checking Checks files in the installation and reports any inconsistencies which may impact website reliability Health Monitoring Pings your web site periodically to identify failures and will notify you of any problems. Also ensures the site stays in web server memory for faster visitor accessibility Security Center A host-level feature which dynamically loads a list of known security vulnerabilities affecting your version of DotNetNuke and provides you with navigational guidance to acquire the latest upgrade Comprehensive Product Documentation Includes more than 2,800 pages divided into User and Superuser Manuals Online Knowledge Base Provides guidance for DotNetNuke administrative tasks and answers to common technical questions Impersonate User A host-level feature that allows you to impersonate another user who is a member of your web site. Search for a user by name and then click an icon to assume their identity to view the site using the userâ€™s permissions while keeping their password confidential. Outside of the three caching items, I don't see anything in there that's more than icing on the cake. Also, having used many of those features, they aren't quite as impressive as they all sound, and the DNN community core isn't completely devoid of any similar features. Module caching, in particular, is available in the community edition, there's just another provider. Also, page caching is possible in the community edition, it just doesn't come with any page caching providers built-in.
