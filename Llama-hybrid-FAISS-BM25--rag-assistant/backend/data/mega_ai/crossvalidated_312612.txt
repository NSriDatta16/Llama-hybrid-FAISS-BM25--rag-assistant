Association rules between many continuous variables

I have a large dataset and I'm trying to mining association rules between the variables. My problem is that I have 160 variables among which I have to look for the association rules and also I have more than 1800 item-sets. Furthermore my variables are continuous variables. To mining association rules, I usually used the apriori algorithm, but as is well known, this algorithm requires the use of categorical variables. Does anyone have any suggestions on what kind of algorithm I can use in this case? A restricted example of my dataset is the following: ID_Order Model ordered quantity A.1 typeX 20 A.1 typeZ 10 A.1 typeY 5 B.2 typeX 16 B.2 typeW 12 C.3 typeZ 1 D.4 typeX 8 D.4 typeG 4 ... My goal would be to establish association rules and correlation between different products, maybe with a neural network algorithm in R Does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this problem? Thanks in advance
