Right Way to Extrapolate Data

I have a time-series data containing 27 values (of no. of Vehicles) from 1990 to 2016. I wanted to predict - based on the underlying trend - the values upto 2050 (which is a long shot I agree). Upon doing some research, I found that it can be done by methods like HoltWinters or TBATS which, even though, did not go with my own plan of using some Machine Learning algorithm. I am using R for all my work. Now, after using HoltWinters() and then forecast() methods, I did get an extrapolated curve uptil 2050 but it is a simple exponential curve from 2017 to 2050 which I think I could have obtained through meager calculations. My question is twofold: 1) What would be the best approach to obtain a meaningful extrapolation? 2) Does my current approach be modified to give me a more meaningful extrapolation? By meaningful I want to express that a curve with the details more closer to actuality. PS: The data that I am working with is the following:- Cars Bikes Buses Trucks 1 682600 1250700 84000 105200 2 732000 1381100 89100 107200 3 819400 1497000 95000 111400 4 868200 1573400 98700 114400 5 902700 1679300 107400 118400 6 923600 1754700 113500 119200 7 966700 1842500 114400 123700 8 1068100 1995400 119400 131300 9 1086000 2068700 125900 132900 10 1162900 2175500 150100 145100 11 1182300 2260800 154400 148600 12 1198918 2283381 161507 155793 13 1279362 2341051 155555 169274 14 1289854 2379260 165846 177478 15 1298353 2609442 166136 179727 16 1318488 2649910 168713 182516 17 1372191 2757842 175589 189950 18 1440801 2895734 184368 199447 19 1549854 3039815 187367 202574 20 1657860 3215583 195163 210944 21 1726347 4305121 198790 216119 22 1881560 5781953 202476 225075 23 2094289 7500182 215374 240888 24 2281083 9064547 220347 247197 25 2400690 10341326 223624 251339 26 2531592 12177352 228180 257483 27 2582149 12600402 228790 260422 Right now, I am working with a single column at a time (i.e. Cars) at a time for creating models and predicting. Thanks a lot.
