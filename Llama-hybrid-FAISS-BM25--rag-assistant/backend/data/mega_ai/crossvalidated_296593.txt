Some notes in addition to @JustMe: First, there is a lot of arrogance on both sides of Econometrics and Machine Learning. Discussing which of the two may be a sub-discipline of which is futile. In fact they are both strongly overlapping sub-disciplines of the field of statistics (which is best described as applied mathematics). Both have their own foci and preferences, e.g. Econometrics focus on estimation and testing hypotheses, often in smaller samples, while ML focuses on best functional approximation, often in huge samples. The first focuses on parametric methods making distributional assumptions, the second more often (but by far not exclusively) on non-parametric distribution-free methods. And so on. Second, if the goal is prediction there is no inherent need to understand causality, as long as random samples from the same population are available. However, understanding causality is of central interest if we want to understand a system (i.e. theory development/testing) or change it (i.e. acting on theory by an intervention). This type of research goal is much more common in econometrics (and other fields like biostatistics) than it is in machine learning. However, there are machine learning researchers interested in causality as well. The primary difference between fields here are, once again, that econometricians have hypotheses about interventions and try to estimate their effects (e.g. from observational data or experimental data using techniques from causal inference theory such as weighting, matching or selection models) whereas machine learning would rather try to learn causal relationships from the data (e.g. using search algorithms in directed acyclical causal graphs) and the focus is less strongly put on a single intervention.
