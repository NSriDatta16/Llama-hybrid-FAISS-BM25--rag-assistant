If your IDataObject supports the IAsyncOperation interface, then the IDropTarget will have the option of allowing IDropTarget::Drop() exit quickly and then perform the actual transfer asynchronously. However, the IDropTarget is not required to support IAsyncOperation. This behavior is described in MSDN's documentation . Also, DoDragDrop() will not exit until the user releases the mouse to initiate the drop either way, so your thread that calls DoDragDrop() will still be blocked while the user is dragging the mouse around.
