Dynamically assigning an image source in an item renderer does not work in Flex/AS3

I have a custom item renderer that displays images: And a function getProfilePic: public function getProfilePic(data:Object):String{ if(String( data.image_path.text() ) == ""){ return "../assets/no_profile_pic.png"; }else{ return data.image_path; } } The issue is that when I assign the "no profile pic" image, it does not show up. I get that funny looking "image cannot be found" icon in place. If I place an image in ../assets on my server, the image shows up. Embedding is more ideal. So the question is...how do I embed an image in this case?
