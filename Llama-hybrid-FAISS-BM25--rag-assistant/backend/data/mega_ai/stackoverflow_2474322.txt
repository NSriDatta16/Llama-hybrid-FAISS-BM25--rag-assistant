You probably want to use one of the STL container classes to hold your struct (or better yet, refactor your struct into a class to hide the data members and make get/set accessors) std::vector std::list ... Which one you pick depends entirely on what operations you anticipate doing on them. A vector is fine for basic storage, and random access. If you want to perform any sorting or searching functions, you probably want a list, or potentially even a map or multimap. Here's a good starting point for more information on STL: http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/class-libraries.html
