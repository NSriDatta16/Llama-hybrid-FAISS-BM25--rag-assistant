To answer one of your questions, the Dalvik VM indeed does use a tracing garbage collector, using a Mark and Sweep approach. According to The Dalvik Virtual Machine Architecture : The current strategy in the Dalvik garbage collector is to keep mark bits, or the bits that indicate that a particular object is “reachable” and therefore should not be garbage collected, separate from other heap memory. From Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and on, Dalvik was replaced with the Android Runtime (ART) . Google has the following to say about the changes in the garbage collector from Dalvik to ART ( source ) : Improved garbage collection Garbage collection (GC) can impair an app's performance, resulting in choppy display, poor UI responsiveness, and other problems. ART improves garbage collection in several ways: One GC pause instead of two Parallelized processing during the remaining GC pause Collector with lower total GC time for the special case of cleaning up recently-allocated, short-lived objects Improved garbage collection ergonomics, making concurrent garbage collections more timely, which makes GC_FOR_ALLOC events extremely rare in typical use cases Compacting GC to reduce background memory usage and fragmentation See also: The source code of the Dalvik garbage collector The source code of the ART garbage collector
