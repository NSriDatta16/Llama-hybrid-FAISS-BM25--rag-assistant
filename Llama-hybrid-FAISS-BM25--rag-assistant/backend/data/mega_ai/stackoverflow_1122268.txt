How to construct a static global variable in C++

I'm having some trouble compiling/linking a set of classes, several of them dealing with a common global variable. Basically, I declare and define a extern variable foo in class A and access/update it in classes B and C. The relevant code looks like this: A.h extern string foo; // declare it B.cpp include A.h string foo; // define it main () { ... foo = "abc"; } C.cpp include A.h cout My current error is "storage class specified for foo". But, I'm wondering if this is the correct approach. Should I be using a static variable? Any help much appreciated, as I've been on this for at least an hour by now.
