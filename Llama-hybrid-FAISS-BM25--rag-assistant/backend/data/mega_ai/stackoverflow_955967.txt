How to ensure the right DateTime is used?

I have a Silverlight client that talks to some ASP.NET web services, which then modify a database. The client has data that can be modified and sent via the web services to the database. This data is organised by date. Obviously, the client can reside in a different timezone to the ASP.NET server, so, how do I ensure that the DateTime information is in the correct timezone for the database? Will the timezone information of the DateTime survive between the client and the server such that converting to UTC will correctly result in a UTC time, or does the UTC conversion need to occur at the client?
