I believe you could just do: $('#article :not(:has(*))').jhighlight({find : 'class'}); Since it grabs all leaf nodes in the article it would require valid xhtml, that is, it would only match link in the following example: This is some paragraph content with a link DOM traversal / selector application could slow things down a bit so it might be good to do: article_nodes = article_nodes || $('#article :not(:has(*))'); article_nodes.jhighlight({find : 'class'});
