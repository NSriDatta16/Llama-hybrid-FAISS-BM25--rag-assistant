Why is RPC over HTTP a secutity problem?

I am currently reading on Web Services. There is a SOAP tutorial at http://www.w3schools.com/soap/soap_intro.asp . The following paragraph is from that page: "Today's applications communicate using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) between objects like DCOM and CORBA, but HTTP was not designed for this. RPC represents a compatibility and security problem; firewalls and proxy servers will normally block this kind of traffic." I don't understand this. Can someone explain it to me, please. Escpecially I want to know, why RPC is a security problem (at lease over HTTP). Knowing why exactly it is a compatibility problem would be nice, too.
