m is the width in bits of a memory address in your system, e.g. 32 for x86, 64 for x86-64. Block size on x86, for example, is 4K, so b=12. Block size more or less refers to the smallest chunk of data you can read from durable storage -- you read it into memory, work on that copy, then write it back at some later time. I believe tag bits are the upper t bits that are used to look up data cached locally very close to the CPU (not even in RAM). I'm not sure about the set lines part, although I can make plausible guesses that wouldn't be especially reliable.
