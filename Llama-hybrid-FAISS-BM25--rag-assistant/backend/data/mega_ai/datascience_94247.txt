reprocessing steps for images before training classification models

I have a data set of images for classification task . I read some articles about image reprocessing (before training CNN models) which summarize in those steps: scale image values ( img / 255.0 ) remove noise (using Gaussian blur ) morphology I'm not sure when to use each step and what is the right order of those steps: Do we need to remove noise before scaling images ? (or it dosn't matter) ? I didn't found many articals about morphology step: 2.1 When will we use morphology ? (Is it always right to use this reprocessing step ? 2.2 What is the right order ? use morphology after scaling and removing noise ?
