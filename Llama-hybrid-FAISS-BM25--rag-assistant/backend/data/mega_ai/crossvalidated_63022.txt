I totally agree with the sentiment of the previous commentators. I would like to add that all ARIMA model can also be represented as a pure AR model. These weights are referred to as the Pi weights as compared to the pure MA form (Psi weights) . In this way you can view (interpret) an ARIMA model as an optimized weighted average of the past values. In other words rather than assume a pre-specified length and values for a weighted average , an ARIMA model delivers both the length ($n$) of the weights and the actual weights ($c_1,c_2,...,c_n$). $$Y(t) =c_1 Y(tâˆ’1) + c_2 Y(t-2) + c_3 Y(t-3)+ ... + c_n Y(t-n) + a(t)$$ In this way an ARIMA model can be explained as the answer to the question How many historical values should I use to compute a weighted sum of the past? Precisely what are those values?
