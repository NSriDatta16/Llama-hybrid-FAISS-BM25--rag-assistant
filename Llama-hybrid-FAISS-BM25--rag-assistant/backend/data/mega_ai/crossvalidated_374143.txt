Do you standardize the data before PCA whitening?

I have a data set ranged in different scales as well as some variables are sparse, for example, n V1 V2 V3 V4 0 0 1 34123 51523453 1 16 0 63124 34351234 2 0 0 63431 2343423 3 100 2 64351 34243 4 0 2 75283 35253523 5 0 1 2234 23423523 6 0 0 134523 315345 … … … … … Because of the sparsity , I think I need to reduce the data dimension. Because of the different range , I would need to normalize the data. To achieve these two goals, my original plan is to perform PCA whitening . In the new decorrelated space, I would choose some eigenvectors associated with the first 2-3 largest eigenvalues as my principal vectors and reduce the dimension by projecting onto these vectors. I think PCA whitening already normalizes the data in zero-mean and unit-variance manner. I have two questions: Is it necessary to perform the normalization (e.g., subtract mean and divide by standard deviation independently) before performing the whitening? What other normalization techniques are worth to try? Thanks in advance!!
