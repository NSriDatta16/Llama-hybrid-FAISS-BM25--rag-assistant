is it possible to use SQL Server EXPRESS edition so that we can use stored procedure? Yes. You can simplify installation and deployment by using Click Once. If needed, you can limit the amount of memory used by SQL Express through issuing appropriate configuration commands. Since your clients use laptops, you might consider providing an option to stop and start SQL Express from within your app, rather than having it auto-start as a service. P.S. If you're using SPs, you may not need LINQ. ADO.NET can result in much higher-performance code, particularly if you can leverage features like command batching, async queries, multiple result sets, etc, that aren't possible with LINQ.
