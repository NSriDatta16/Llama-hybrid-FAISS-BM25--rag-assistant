We look at the average complexity of the project and work out an hourly rate, then we estimate how long it will take and charge accordingly - so the client doesn't know about the hourly rate only a fixed amount. This works well for both ends, the client doesn't have to worry about us going over budget if a problem comes up and if we do it quicker than our estimate we still get paid the fixed rate. Regarding the hourly rate, it really depends on the project - for your example it would depend if we had to build a bespoke CMS or they already had one in mind.
