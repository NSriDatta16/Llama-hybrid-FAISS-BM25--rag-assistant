Finding pmf of random variable with minimum function

Let $X\sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ and $Y = \min(X,3)$ . Find the pmf for $Y$ . I start out by writing $P(Y=k)=P(\min(X,3)=k)$ . If $X\leq 3$ , then $Y=X$ and so $Y$ will follow the pmf $f(x)$ for $X$ . I am a bit confused about the $X>3$ case. If $X>3$ , then $Y = 3$ . Therefore, $P(Y=k)=0 \hspace{2mm} \forall k \neq 3$ . However, I am not really sure how to tie this into the formulation for the pmf. Would it simply be something like: $$P(Y=k)=\begin{cases}P(X=k) && X\leq 3 \\ 1 && k=3 \text{ and }X>3 \\ 0 && \text{o.w.} \end{cases}$$ Though this looks to me more like $f(y|x)$ , in which case I need $f(x,y)$ which I am not sure if I can find it with the given information. Furthermore, I am not really sure how to capture the " $k=3$ and $X>3$ " part as this seems rather inelegant to include into a pmf.
