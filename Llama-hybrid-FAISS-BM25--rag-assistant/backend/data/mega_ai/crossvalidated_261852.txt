Why is the log derivative estimator considered of large variance?

It's mentioned in the paper Variational Bayesian Inference with Stochastic Search that, the variance of the following approximation may be very large, but I didn't quite understand why this is so. It seems to be a well-known problem, similar results are also mentioned in other papers, for example Neural Variational Inference and Learning in Belief Networks . Update: found a video about this https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning/lecture/24u8X/log-derivative-trick
