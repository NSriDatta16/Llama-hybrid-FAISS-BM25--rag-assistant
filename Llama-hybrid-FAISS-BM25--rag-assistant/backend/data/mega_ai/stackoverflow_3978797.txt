Hide columns in a DataGridView

Let's say I have a table like so: Friend ------ Id int not null FriendName nvarchar(50) not null Phone nvarchar(50) null If I bind my DataGridView control in a Windows Forms application to an ObjectQuery / ObjectSet / IList returned from an ObjectContext like so: MyFriendsGridView.DataSource = _context.Friends.ToList(); All the columns that are in the Friend table appear in the grid. Suppose I want the Id column not to show up in the grid, how do I do that? Do I simply hide the column in the grid's properties by setting the column's visibility to false? Is there a more elegant solution?
