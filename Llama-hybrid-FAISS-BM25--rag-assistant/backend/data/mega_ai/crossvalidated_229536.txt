1) There is nothing wrong with negative AIC values. AIC values are arbitrary; even an AIC of 0 isn't directly interpretable. 2) There is nothing wrong with large differences in AIC values between models. Indeed, this is often what you are looking for with AIC to begin with. Without more details of what exactly your models are it is difficult to be more specific. If you are really concerned about wildly shifting AIC values between models, you may want to take a look at the assumptions of your models themselves. Maybe you have variables with very different ranges and should consider standardization, maybe you have misspecified the functional relationship between outcome and predictors, etc. 3) Why can't you compute the Akaike weight? The weight is just the value exp(-0.5*$\Delta$AIC) averaged across all pairwise model comparisons (where $\Delta$AIC is just the difference between two AIC values). EDIT: In light of your comment on the OP, you say the weight is going to infinity. My answer above actually contains an error, the weight is not that value averaged across all pairwise model comparisons. The weight is the average of those values where $\Delta$AIC is the difference between each model and the SMALLEST AIC in the group of models of interest. So, if: $w_i(AIC) = \frac{exp\{-0.5*\Delta_i\text{AIC}\}}{\sum_k^K{exp\{-0.5*\Delta_k\text{AIC}\}}}$ Then: > AIC delta denominator weights weights [1] 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 The weights aren't being driven towards infinity, but towards 0. Even so, this doesn't seem to be a huge issue (any more so than having large pairwise AIC differences, anyway). Weights are just a way of comparing relative likelihoods between models; if the differences in likelihood (and thus AIC) between models are large, the weights will trend towards 0 and 1. In any case, the weights just give you the same interpretation as choosing the smallest AIC. Honestly, weights would only seem to be useful to begin with in the case where the differences between AIC values for all the models are relatively small, anyway.
