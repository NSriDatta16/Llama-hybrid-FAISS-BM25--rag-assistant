Redirect after login (Spring security on GAE)

I am having some troubles making my login redirect to the same place always. I have done something like this And public class AuthenticationSuccessHandlerImpl implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler { public void onAuthenticationSuccess(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException { if (authentication != null && authentication.isAuthenticated()) { response.sendRedirect(OrganizationListServlet.URL); } } } It never gets into this method above. How do I make it do that? Edit: I was following this guide http://blog.springsource.com/2010/08/02/spring-security-in-google-app-engine/
