Swing: Creating a draggable component...?

I searched the web for examples of draggable Swing components, but I found either incomplete or non-working examples. What I need is a Swing component that can be dragged by the mouse inside an other component. While being dragged, it should already change its position, not just 'jump' to its destination. I would appreciate examples which work without non-standard APIs. Thank you.
