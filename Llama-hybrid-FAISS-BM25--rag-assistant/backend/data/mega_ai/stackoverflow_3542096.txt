A fast approach is to use the following according to ie that you want to focus (check the comments), inside your css files (where margin-top, set whatever css attribute you like): margin-top: 10px\9; /*It will apply to all ie from 8 and below */ *margin-top: 10px; /*It will apply to ie 7 and below */ _margin-top: 10px; /*It will apply to ie 6 and below*/ A better approach would be to check user agent or a conditional if, in order to avoid the loading of unnecessary CSS in other browsers.
