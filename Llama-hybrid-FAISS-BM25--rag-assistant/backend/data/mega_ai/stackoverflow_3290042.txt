You'll probably find that different USB-Serial converters produce different results. We've found that the FTDI ones work well for talking with embedded devices. Some converters seem to buffer the data for a long time and/or fragment it. I've never seen a problem with a motherboard connection - not sure what is going on there! Can you change the interrupt point for the motherboard serial port?
