I think option 1 is more flexible. With option 1, you'd be able to add or remove Persons or Organizations from a Party by adding or removing records from the many-to-many tables, whereas with option 2, if you start out with a simple single Person or single Organization setup, it is a little more clunky to modify it into a ComplexParty. I guess I prefer to keep corner cases out of the data model, and try to just use a flexible model that can handle the corner cases in the same way as the more complex cases. I don't think it's too bad to represent the single entity cases as a Party, even though the party is unnecessary in that case.
