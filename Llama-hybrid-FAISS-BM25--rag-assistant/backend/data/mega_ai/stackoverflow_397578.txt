What is the purpose of this? Is it to enable you to identify JPGs that have been taken from your site? Response in comments: "Yes, I want to protect my pictures by using some robust and invisible watermark. Semi-visible site logo is not an option... " The problem is precisely the one described in discussion of Steganography above, to do with the robustness of the image. Any watermark like the one you describe can be used to identify a direct copy of the whole image, but with a jpg it seems to me that if it is even opened and saved again in an editor there is a chance of a change in compression affecting the watermark. Also if someone was to steal your image and do something more extensive with it- tinker with the colour balance, crop it a little and so on it seems unlikely that any invisible watermarking would be robust enough to survive and stay recogniseable. Unfortunately I don't have a solution here, but the problem itself is far from trivial. It may be worth looking for other approaches to it, that you can perhaps use in parallel with watermarking ( custom metadata perhaps? preventing images being easily saved? ) to make it harder for your images to be stolen or to make them less valuable if they are...
