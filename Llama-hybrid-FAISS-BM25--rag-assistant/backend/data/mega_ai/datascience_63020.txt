Is it possible that you are having problems with specifying the "input_shape" parameter in the first layer properly? Number of channels only take part there so that's probably the issue. Check this notebook for a 1 dimensional CNN example for univariate data. Edit: Ok, it is actually a mixed NN with first layer a CNN. But still it should help with the input layer. Let me know if that helps. There must be a CNN somewhere in that folder.
