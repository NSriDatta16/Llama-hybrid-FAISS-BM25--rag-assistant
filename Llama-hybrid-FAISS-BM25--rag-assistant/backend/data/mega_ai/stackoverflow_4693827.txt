How do I use IIS 6 Web Deploy to deploy to a non-default virtual path?

I'm using IIS6, Web Deploy Agent Service, and MSBuild's MSDeploy hooks to deploy. It deploys right now with this set of arguments to MSBuild: /p:DeployOnBuild=True /p:DeployTarget=MsDeployPublish /p:MSDeployServiceURL=example.com /p:DeployIISAppPath=example.com/DeploySiteName /p:CreatePackageOnPublish=True /p:MsDeployPublishMethod=RemoteAgent /p:AllowUntrustedCertificated=True /p:UserName=login /p:Password=pw With that, it will deploy to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\example.com80 , where the Website files are located. Unfortunately, I need it to deploy to D:\Webs , mostly for space reasons. I'm trying to figure out what switch, if any, will allow me to deploy to an alternate physical path and map the virtual directory. I tried reverse-engineering C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0\Web\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets like another SO post suggested, but I failed... I tried using combinations of these parameters and they had no visible effect: /p:DeployIisAppPhysicalPath=D:\Webs /p:RemoteSitePhysicalPath=D:\Webs Any suggestions?
