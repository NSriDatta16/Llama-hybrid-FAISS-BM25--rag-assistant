The role of "data cleansing" is to identify when "our laws (model) do not work". Adjusting for Outliers or abnormal data points serve to allow us to get "robust estimates" of the parameters in the current model that we are entertaining. These "outliers" if untreated permit an unwanted distortion in the model parameters as estimation is "driven to explain these data points" that are "not behaving according to our hypothesized model". In other words there is a lot of payback in terms of explained Sum of Squares by focusing on the "baddies". The empirically identified points that require cleansing should be carefully scrutinized in order to potentially develop/suggest cause factors which are not in the current model. The identified Level Shift in STATE1 for the data you presented in the question below is an example of "knowledge waiting to be discovered". How to assess effect of intervention in one state versus another using annual case fatality rate? To do science is to search for repeated patterns. To detect anomalies is to identify values that do not follow repeated patterns. How else would you know that a point violated that model? In fact, the process of growing, understanding, finding, and examining outliers must be iterative. This isn't a new thought. Sir Frances Bacon, writing in Novum Organum about 400 years ago said: “Errors of Nature, Sports and Monsters correct the understanding in regard to ordinary things, and reveal general forms. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations; and, on the other hand, whoever knows herdeviations will more accurately describe her ways.” We change our rules by observing when the current rules fail. If indeed the identified outliers are all pulses and have similar effects (size) then we suggest the following ( quoted from another poster ) "One "quick and dirty" way to do this in a regression setting is to include an indicator for the epidemic years/periods as a regressor variable. This will give you an average estimate of the effect of epidemics (and implicitly assumes the affect is the same for each epidemic). However, this approach only works for describing the effect, because in forecasting, your regression variable is unknown (you don't know which periods in the future will be epidemic ones)." This if course requires that the individual anomalies(pulse years) have similar effects. If they differ then a portmanteau variable described above would be incorrect.
