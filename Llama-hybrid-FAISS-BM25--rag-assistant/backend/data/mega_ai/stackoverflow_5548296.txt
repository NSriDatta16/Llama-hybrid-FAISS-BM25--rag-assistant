The pieces you need are: (A) determine user's position (B) search a point of interest (POI) database for nearby shopping malls (C) plot results on a map display Sounds like you're set on (A). For (B), I recommend looking at the POI offerings from SimpleGeo or CloudMade . (Note that if you're going for non-U.S. coverage, you may need to find different POI providers.) And for (C) you can use Google Maps for Android or CloudMade's SDK .
