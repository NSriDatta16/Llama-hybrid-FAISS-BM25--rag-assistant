Is it possible to find an internal event in a Classification between two classes?

I am very new to the machine learning area. So my question might be trivial I have two classes $U, V$ of binary vectors. In the training phase, I use $u_1,\ldots, u_{1000}$ from $U$ class and $v_1, \ldots, v_{1000}$ from $V$ . In the testing phase, I have to determine whether a vector is coming from $U$ or $V$ ? How can we do that with good accuracy? Also, can we find internal event by which ML makes the clasification?
