I would expect that a course named "Introduction to Visual Studio C# 2008" would probably not cover Ajax technologies, so you might want to look for some additional resources on that topic. (It might not even cover ASP.NET in significant depth, so I'd advise checking the syllabus, and if the ASP.NET coverage is weak then prepare for some additional learning on that topic as well.) Re the Source Safe plug-in: you will need this if you want to work on the code base (so you can check in and out of the existing VSS repository). You will not need it just to browse the code.
