JWS JNLP no Desktop Icon on Mac

I seem to be having a problem getting the icon for a Java Web Start program to appear on the Mac desktop, or under "Applications". The icon's and menu's are created and work properly under windows XP and Vista, is there something different that must be done for Macs? On the Mac there aren't output any errors, it prompts me with the question if I would like to create the shortcuts, I click yes, and then it continues launching the program but never seems to produce them.
