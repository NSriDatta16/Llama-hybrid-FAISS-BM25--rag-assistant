If you want to compute a causal effect you need to control for confounders . The problem is, that you really need to find all confounders, otherwise your results are not reliable, and in the worst case nasty things like Simpson's paradox could happen. Now, you mentioned covariates like age, race, and sex, for which you only have data averaged over exposed and nonexposed. That means you cannot control for them. And while I don't know the details of your scenario, I think that those covariates could easily be confounders. In general, if you knew all the confounders and had always the data separated for exposed and nonexposed, you could use propensity score matching or regression or a mixture of both using MatchIt . Exposure can be understood as some type of treatment and incidences are valid outcomes.
