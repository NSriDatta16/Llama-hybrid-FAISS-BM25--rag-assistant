Do I need MSDTC for NServiceBus / NHibernate?

I am writing an NServiceBus solution and trying to use DBSubcriptionStorage. This uses NHibernate for data access and I get the following exception: The partner transaction manager has disabled its support for remote/network transactions I could enable MSDTC but my question is: where is this requirement coming from and can I remove it? I am not familiar with NHibernate and I don't know if it requires MSDTC or if NServiceBus does. There is only one flat table in the NServiceBus subscription database and I can hardly see the use of MSDTC in this scenario. Can I remove the MSDTC requirement? Will I have to write my own subscription persistence layer for that purpose? Thanks
