R: Regression between Two related Dependent Variables (not paired)

I have two dependent variables that are measured during an experiment, they both change in time (independent variable). The measurements for both variables do not always coincide in time (so they are not really paired). I know that there is a relationship between the two measured dependent variables, and ultimately, I want to use this relationship to predict the value of one dependent variables based on the other dependent variable . In essence, I want to: Perform a regression between Two related but not paired Dependent Variables The following example is an illustration that sets up the data so that it can be explained (hopefully) using R and pertinent packages: I am cooking dough in an oven at very low temperature. I have instrumentation to measure humidity (a probe), and crunchiness (my jaws). Because of the nature of the experiment, I wasn't able always measure both variables at the same time. The extended literature in the subject tells me that both variables change logarithmic growth/decay as the dough cooks. Because I only have only one jaw (measuring crunchiness), but have unlimited use of the humidity probe (measuring humidity), I want to use the relationship between both variables to predict crunchiness based on humidity (R script is highly appreciated). Here's a plot of the data: Here's the data (so it can be used to solve my predicament), and the code to plot it. df I still have this question (about 4 years after) . The answers are very compelling AND innovative, but I cannot believe there isn't a method out there to solve this predicament. More recently I have tried looking into methods in time series, as that is a case where you may have independent measurements over time that are not aligned to each other and you may want to understand the relationship between both and the confidence between that relationship.
