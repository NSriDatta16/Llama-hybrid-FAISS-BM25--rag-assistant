Understanding the parameters needed for a distribution in Bayes networks?

Since I have a discriminative mindset hardly can I intuit the so-called parameters needed to specify a distribution in a generative Bayesian Network. I'd like to borrow an example from this blog . If we have two features X: "buy" and Y: 'win' to decide if an email is a spam. In the scenario of a discriminative model : It only needs three parameters: two for the two features( $X$ and $Y$ ) and one as a bias: $P(Z=1|F)=\frac{1}{1+exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2 Y)}$ and $P(Z=0|F)=\frac{exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2 Y)}{1+exp(\beta_0 +\beta_1X + \beta_2 Y)}$ . But in the scenario of a generative model , for instance a simple Naïve Bayes model(as that in the aformentioned blog): 80% of the emails are spam: 75% of them have the word “buy”, 40% of them have the word “win” 20% of emails are not spam: 12% of them have the word “buy”, 7% of them have the word “win” The 2 features are independent given their parent(a common cause trail from X to Y). I try to transfer the example in the blog as a coditional independence representation as follows: | z0 | z1 | |:-----|--------:| | 0.2 | 0.8 | | Z | P(X0|Z) | P(X1|Z) | |:-----|--------:|--------:| | z0 | 0.88 | 0.12 | | z1 | 0.25 | 0.75 | | Z | P(Y0|Z) | P(Y1|Z) | |:-----|--------:|--------:| | z0 | 0.93 | 0.07 | | z1 | 0.60 | 0.40 | Then I learned that there should be five parameters for the distribution as there are five rows in the above tables and that from $Pr(X,Y,Z)=Pr(X,Y|Z)Pr(Z)=Pr(X|Z)Pr(Y|Z)Pr(Z)$ I can get 2*3-1. I know how to calculate how many parameters should be needed in that simple generative model but don't understand why there should be 5 parameters as I understand concretely why there should only be 3 parameters in the discrimative model. Could anyone please show me where the parameters are used in this Bayes Model? As concrete as everyone can comprehend that in the discriminative model two for two features and one for the bias?
