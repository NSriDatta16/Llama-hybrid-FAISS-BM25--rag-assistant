The t test is primarily employed for data that is paired ( e.g. N independent pairs of readings before and after some activity) or for N independent readings on two characteristics (indices). You don't have independent observations since you have time series data that is most probably auto-correlated (within structure). The cross-correlation coefficient (among structure) also requires independent (within structure) draws as there is a requirement for joint normality which requires statistical independence of the draws. Again time series data is by it's very nature not usually independent. Please see "Why Do We Sometimes Get Nonsense Correlations between Time-series?" (1926), an investigation of a form of spurious correlation, in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udny_Yule AND http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/dbs202/cat/stats/corr.html for more. The best way to determine the relationship between two time series is to review How to identify transfer functions in a time series regression forecasting model? .
