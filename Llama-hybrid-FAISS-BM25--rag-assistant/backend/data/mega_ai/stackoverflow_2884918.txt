"driver class" could refer to a procedural programming style involving: (1) "container classes" and (2) "driver classes" Say that you are creating your own object as a container for data. Then you might want to create two types of classes: "containers" and "drivers" The "container class" might contain: - instance variables to hold the relevant data - getters and setters - methods to support moving data in/out of class (parsing, translation) - limited computations The "driver class" might contain: - main method that drives the execution of the overall task (aka entry point for execution) - calls to static methods, as with procedural programming - instances of container class objects to hold different data (may be organized in other data structures, e.g. arrays; manipulated to solve overall task)
