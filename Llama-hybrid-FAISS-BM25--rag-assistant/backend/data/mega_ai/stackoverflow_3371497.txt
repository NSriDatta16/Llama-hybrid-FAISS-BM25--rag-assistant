Probably it's the MySQL connection's fault. As robertbasic said, As Jan said, read http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-connection.html You'll most likely need to execute query something like SET NAMES utf8 right after connecting to the database. For more possible causes, check How to display a mysql table data in another language properly in php (as robertbasic said twice).
