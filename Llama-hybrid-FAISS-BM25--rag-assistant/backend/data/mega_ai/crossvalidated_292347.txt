Logistic regression with a categorical predictor having more than two levels isn’t a problem; you simply use dummy variables. With a four-level predictor, you would construct (or let your analysis software construct) three dummy variables. Suppose you had the following data: A Good B Good C Good D Good A Good B Good C Good D Bad A Good B Good C Bad D Bad A Good B Bad C Bad D Bad A Bad B Bad C Bad D Bad Let’s create three dummy variables (d1, d2, d3) for skin care product, using level D of the predictor as the reference level. d1 d2 d3 A 1 0 0 B 0 1 0 C 0 0 1 D 0 0 0 Regressing the binary outcome variable (coding “Good” as 1 and “Bad” as 0) onto the three dummy variables in a logistic regression gives coefficients of 2.7726, 1.7918, and 0.9808 for d1, d2, and d3, respectively. Applying exp() to these coefficients gives odds ratios of 16, 6, and 2.667. We see in the data that when the product is A, the odds of “Good” vs “Bad” are 4/1 = 4. For reference category D, the odds are 1/4=0.25. Therefore, the odds ratio is 4/0.25 = 16. Similarly, the odds ratio for level C vs. level D (corresponding to d3) is (2/3)/(1/4) = 2.667.
