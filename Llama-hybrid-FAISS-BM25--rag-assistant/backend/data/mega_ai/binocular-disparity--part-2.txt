uent stereo images by measuring the displacement of objects relative to the Rover. In some cases, this is the best source of this type of information, as the encoder sensors in the wheels may be inaccurate due to tire slippage. Depth information based on disparity is not always clear-cut (correspondence problem). In humans, this leads to the double-nail illusion.
