Word2Vec operates on words and you want to compare 'texts' (series of words of varied length). For that, doc2vec might more appropriate. You have very short 'texts' (names of campaigns) so generating embedding from them (only from them) want give greate effects. You could start with some pretrained vectors but anyway probably you want achieve much more. But the questions is: It's not sure from your examples and explanation what will be nature of texts you want to find the most similar campaign name with. On one side you are writing about finding the one most frequent with a given word - then you could just create statistics of words and campaigns. On the other side, in your example, you pass whole text - then above mentioned apply, finding most similar text using text vectors.
