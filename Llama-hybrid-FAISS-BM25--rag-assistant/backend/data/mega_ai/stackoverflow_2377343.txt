"Note that I am the network admin and everyone who I will monitor has local admin rights on their computer and we do not want to further restrict users access." You can have liberty or security, but not both. The number of paths to get data out of an unlocked box are too many to enumerate. Someone zipped up the files and put them on a thumb drive? What if they used tar or shar or pasted them into a Word document, or printed them to a PDF file and sent it out via e-mail steganographically embedded in pornography? Yeah, a former coworker was stupid enough to send a huge set of huge, logged e-mails to his future employer a couple of days prior to leaving, but you can't count on people being quite that stupid. What your boss wants isn't possible given a moderately motivated thief and not wanting to "further restrict" access.
