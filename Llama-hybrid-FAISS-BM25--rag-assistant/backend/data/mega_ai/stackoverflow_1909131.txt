If you are registered iPhone Developer (which I'm assuming you are since you're trying to build to a physical device), you do not have to pay for OS upgrades for the iPod Touch. The OS upgrades are apart of the iPhone SDK. If you're looking for an iPod Touch I would recommend either a 2nd Generation, or 3rd Generation model. Both should be fine for average app testing. Just keep in mind that there are a couple device limitations compared against the iPhone 3GS. No compass, GSM Controller, or camera (video or pictures (yet))... You can purchase an iPhone either from ebay or a third party without having to use a cell phone carrier. Your only limitation would being unable to use the GSM connection (carrier provided).
