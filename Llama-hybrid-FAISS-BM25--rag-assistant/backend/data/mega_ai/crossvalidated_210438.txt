DTW time warping with time series: statistical soundness

taking off from this topic here ( Hierarchical clustering, linkage methods and dynamic time warping ) and from this ( Dynamic Time Warping Clustering ) I was wondering if anyone could tell me what could make realiable the results of running a dtw / hierarchical clustering with time series (or a sound procedure in this case). I have read that its statistical soundness might be in jeopardy so, before I stress my CPU to death for no reason, I was wondering if anyone could shed any light on the matter.
