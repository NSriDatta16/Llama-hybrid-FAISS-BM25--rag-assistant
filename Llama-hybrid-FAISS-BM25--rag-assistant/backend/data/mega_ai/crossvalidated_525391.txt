Feed a target probability distribution to the input of a NN model?

I am trying to solve a multi class classification problem. I already have 2 known distributions of the target class . I want my Neural Network model to predict the target class based on the combination of these two distributions and also a couple of other inputs . How do i go about creating such a model ? explanation: For example : I want to predict the weather today of a certain town (rainy , sunny , normal) and it is known the weather depends on the past weather of two neighboring towns (and some additional factors) and the given data is in format (Town A : (rainy for 50% of the past 100 days , sunny for 25% and normal for 25%), Town B: (rainy for 20% of the past 100 days , sunny for 40% and normal for 40%)) . How can I feed this data into predicting the weather of Town C which depends on the past weather of Town A, Town B and couple other factors ?
