There is nothing built in to the Framework that would allow you to do this. It is possible using reflection, although I'm not sure I would recommend it. The following code shows you to get the list of all members of a type: Try Dim myObject As New [MyClass]() Dim myMemberInfo() As MemberInfo ' Get the type of 'MyClass'. Dim myType As Type = myObject.GetType() ' Get the information related to all public member's of 'MyClass'. myMemberInfo = myType.GetMembers() Console.WriteLine(ControlChars.Cr + "The members of class '{0}' are :" + ControlChars.Cr, myType) Dim i As Integer For i = 0 To myMemberInfo.Length - 1 ' Display name and type of the concerned member. Console.WriteLine("'{0}' is a {1}", myMemberInfo(i).Name, myMemberInfo(i).MemberType) Next i Catch e As SecurityException Console.WriteLine(("Exception : " + e.Message.ToString())) End Try In the loop, you would need to determine if the member is an event, and if so, hook an event handler to it.
