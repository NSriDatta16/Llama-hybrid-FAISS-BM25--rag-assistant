There is no one "confidence interval"; a confidence interval at level $\alpha$ is any interval with coverage level of $\alpha$ or greater. If you calculate the coverage of the confidence interval $[4, 19]$ (the rounded down / up version of your first interval) for $\lambda=10$, you'll get a coverage probability of approximately 0.967. If you do so with your Poisson-based interval $[3,17]$, you'll get 0.975. They are both 95% confidence intervals; as Michael Chernick has observed (+1), with discrete distributions it is quite possible that no interval has exact coverage. As MansT has observed (+1) , different methods for calculating intervals shouldn't be expected to agree, although they should, in general, provide the targetted coverage.
