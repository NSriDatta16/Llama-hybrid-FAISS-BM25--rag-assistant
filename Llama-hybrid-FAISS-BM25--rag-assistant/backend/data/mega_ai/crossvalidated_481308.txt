does one class SVM (SVDD) detect Novelty or Outlier and what are the supporting vectors of SVDD

From my understanding of one class SVM (SVDD) , the training data should all be the normal points (don't include outliers). Then a new point is added, we can use the trained SVDD to determine whether it is a Novelty (in the sphere or out the sphere). And SVDD cannot detect the outliers in the training data before training. Do I understand correctly for the above statement? Second, what's the supporting vectors of SVDD? The points in the training data with the non-zero Lagrange multipliers same as SVM?
