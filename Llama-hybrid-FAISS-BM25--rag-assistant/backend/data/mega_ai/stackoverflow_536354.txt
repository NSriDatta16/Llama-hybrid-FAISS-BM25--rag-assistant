You'd be better off using the get() method. futureOne.get(); futureTwo.get(); Both of which wait for notification from the thread that it finished processing, this saves you the busy-wait-with-timer you are now using which is not efficient nor elegant. As a bonus, you have the API get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) which allows you to define a maximum time for the thread to sleep and wait for a response, and otherwise continues running. See the Java API for more info.
