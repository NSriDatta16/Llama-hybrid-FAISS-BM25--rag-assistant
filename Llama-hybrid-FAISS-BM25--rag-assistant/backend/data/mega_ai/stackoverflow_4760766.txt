Cleanest ruby code to split a string with specific rules

imagine an array like this [ "A definition 1: this is the definition text", "A definition 2: this is some other definition text", "B definition 3: this could be: the definition text" ] I want to end up with the following hash hash = { :A => ["A definition 1", "this is the definition text", "A definition 2", "this is some other definition text"], :B => ["B definition 3", "this could be: the definition text"] } I'm creating a glossary, with a hash of each letter of the alphabet with definition arrays. I'm pretty new to Ruby so what I have looks really inelegant and I'm struggling on the split regex of the line on the colon so that the 3rd line only splits on the first occurrence. Thanks! Edit Here's what I have so far def self.build(lines) alphabet = Hash.new() lines.each do |line| strings = line.split(/:/) letter = strings[0][0,1].upcase alphabet[letter] = Array.new if alphabet[letter].nil? alphabet[letter]
