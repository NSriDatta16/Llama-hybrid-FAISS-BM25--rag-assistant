A fragment should not be calling startActivity() , IMHO. A fragment should be telling its activity to display something, and the activity should be deciding how to do that. In some devices, that might be launching another activity. In some devices, that might be by adding a fragment. That decision should be made at the activity level, as it is the activities that are deciding what fragments go in what activities, based upon screen size. Here is a sample application where a click on an item in a ListFragment causes either a separate DetailsFragment to be updated (for large / xlarge screens) or pops a new activity (for normal screens).
