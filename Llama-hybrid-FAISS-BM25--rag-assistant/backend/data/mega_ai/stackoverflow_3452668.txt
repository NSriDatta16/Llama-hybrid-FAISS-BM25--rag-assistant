Installing WiX 3.5 alongside WiX 3.0

Is it possible to install both WiX 3.0 and 3.5? If I install 3.5 after installing 3.0, it removes the 3.0 files - and if I attempt to install 3.0 after 3.5, it tells me there is a newer version already installed. I'm in the process of migrating from VS 2008 to VS 2010, so one version (branch) of my application is is using VS 2008 (existing production version), and another one is in VS 2010 (future version). WiX 3.5 is required for VS2010. What this means is on my build server, at the moment, I cannot build both the current version and the new version, as one will report an error about not finding WiX files: c:\buildAgent\work\fe55ddb47cebe4fd\MyApp.wixproj(25, 11): error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\WiX\v3.0\Wix.targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk. I'd prefer not to upgrade the current version of my product to WiX 3.5 as 3.5 is still in beta, and as is I had to cherry pick a weekly build to get it to work at all (I'm just hoping by the time my next version is ready, that WiX 3.5 will be stable). Is there a way to install both side-by-side? Do I just need to copy the 3.0 files into the Msbuild directory?
