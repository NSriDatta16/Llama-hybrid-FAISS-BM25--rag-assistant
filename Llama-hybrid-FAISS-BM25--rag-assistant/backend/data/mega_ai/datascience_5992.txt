Could one algorithm fetch keywords from texts of different natural languages?

I am new to practicing NLP and most topics related, but I want to make a program that can gather and extract data for me on its own. To be more specific, I want to tell the program "I want more information on this topic(i.e heart attacks)", and then the program shall find, gather and extract meaningful texts on the topic from around the www. I happen to live in Norway, which means that most interesting data will be in English, but I also want to fetch interesting data found in Norwegian. One challenge is the differences in stop words. For instance, "are" and "and" are both stop words in English and subjects in Norwegian. Other challenges are also likely to occur. So my question is: Would I need to create separate algorithms for every natural language to be interpreted?
