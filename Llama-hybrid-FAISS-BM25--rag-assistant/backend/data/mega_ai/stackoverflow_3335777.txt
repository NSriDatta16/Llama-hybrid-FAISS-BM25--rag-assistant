The 2nd is better practice but still incorrect. You are coding a getter which should not create memory. Instead it should return a reference to already created memory. It would be better to rename it as a factory method, "customEmployee" and use auto release as that is the naming convention encouraged by Apple and found in other API calls. You could also have a createCustomEmployee that doesn't autorelease. The naming convention is what's important here.
