There are many possible answers to this question. Data science applied to mechatronics and cybernetics can involve physical information , which I believe is what you are describing. The DS side of mechatronics often involves IoT and engineering cybernetics principles. More specific sub-fields include design optimization and control theory . Edit to add a few more examples: Fault detection Anomaly Detection Simulations Monte Carlo Modeling and Simulation
