Using Kruskal–Wallis test on large data sets

My research involves a huge number of data points (millions). I have one independent variable with 3 groups (patent organizational type (University/Industry/Collaborative Patent)) and 4 ordinal independent variables (Citations (Forward and Backward)/family size/claims). In order to check that there is a difference between the three types of organizations, I used Kruskal–Wallis (a nonparametric test) with all the three groups of patent organizational type. My questions are: 1. Is it okay to use Kruskal–Wallis with huge data (N=Millions)? And if I have inequivalent N with the 3 groups, for example examining FW Citation: University Patents = 14000 Industry Patents = 819161 Collaborative Patents = 997 2. Is there any issue with using Kruskal Wallis in this case?
