Creating an high number of objects shouldn't be a performance problem in your application even if you have to pay a bit of attention to the dimensions of these objects. Don't complicate too much your design, but i think that singleton pattern isn't a complication and it isn't difficult to implement. So if the same object instance can be reused more times upon different search from the same user (or even by different users, if it is possible inside your application logic), then don't be afraid of using singleton. It saves your memory and preserves you from doing errors related of having multiple instance of objects that performs the same task, eventually sharing resources.
