Expectations versus returns

I have calculated the probability of winning an event, say a horse race, and am comparing it with the odds on offer. I have two horses which look good prices. My model says horse A has a 5% chance of winning, but the betting market says has a 1% chance of winning. This horse will pay out at 100/1 so I will get back £101 for my £1 stake if it does, otherwise I lose my dollar. My model also says horse B has a 50% of winning, the bookies say it has a 25% chance of winning so I will get back £5 for a £1 bet paying out at 4/1. All the other horses are not worth backing. Which horse should I back if I am down to my last dollar? My expected winnings on horse A are £101 5% of the time, and -£1 95% of the time, so £4.10 on average. On horse B my expected winnings are £5 50% of the time and -£1 50% of the time, so £2 on average. On average then I would be better off betting on horse A, but most of the time I would lose. Intuition tells me to back horse B because I would be happy more of the time. Is there an area of statistics I could use to help me select which horse to back?
