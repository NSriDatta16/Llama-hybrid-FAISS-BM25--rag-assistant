Which is preferable; declaring & setting variable & calling twice, or calculating value on-the-fly twice?

Which is the most efficient way to do this? Sub pvaSetWeek(Optional weekOffset As Long = 0) Dim theDayToday As Long theDayToday = Weekday(Now, vbMonday) 'Set start to Monday Range("pvaStartDate") = Int(Now) - (theDayToday - 1) - (weekOffset * 7) 'Set end to Sunday Range("pvaEndDate") = Int(Now) + (7 - theDayToday) - (weekOffset * 7) End Sub or Sub pvaSetWeek(Optional weekOffset As Long = 0) 'Set start to Monday Range("pvaStartDate") = Int(Now) - (Weekday(Now, vbMonday)- 1) - (weekOffset * 7) 'Set end to Sunday Range("pvaEndDate") = Int(Now) + (7 - Weekday(Now, vbMonday)) - (weekOffset * 7) End Sub And why? Edit to add: I usually go with the first way as it is easier to read/debug and obviously scales better if the same value needs used more than a couple of times, but where the value may only be used a few times I've often wondered if there is any penalty, however small, for doing things one way or another.
