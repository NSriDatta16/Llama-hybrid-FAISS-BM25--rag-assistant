I once defined this very thing in XML and JSON... I think the JSON serialization would be alot faster and more efficient (not to mention easy) to work with in JavaScript, especially since JSON lends itself so well to variable length lists as you would require for "N" levels in each game. Using a standard format would also make it more reusable and (ideally) encourage more collaboration (if that's what you're looking for). You can check out my first attempt to create a Video Game schema for level structure . As fileoffset says, there are many ways to do it, but I highly suggest keeping your level data (i.e. concepts) separate from your rendering (i.e. objects in motion, paths, speed, timing, x/y/z co-ordinate positioning, etc...). Again, as the article said that area is the most quickly changing, and there's no telling if WebGL, SMIL+SVG, Canvas+Javascript, good ol' Flash/Actionscript or something else will be the best route for you, depending on your needs and the type of game you are developing.
