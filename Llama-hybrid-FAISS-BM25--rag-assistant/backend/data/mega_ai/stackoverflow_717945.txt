This isn't an answer but it doesn't fit in a comment. Under what circumstances would you be running so close to the edge of your available stack storage that the additional use of a temporary variable for the swap is going to cause you difficulties? I could see some embedded scenarios, but I'm hard pressed to imagine a scenario where you'd be so tight on stack space that this would matter (where you're not writing code in assembly language).
