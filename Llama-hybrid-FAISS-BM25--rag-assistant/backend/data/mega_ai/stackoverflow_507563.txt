From what i understand, you can just manage windows using microsoft. hold control and select multiple windows in the taskbar, then right click it and tile whatever way you want. what i've been looking for is a way to actually split a physical monitor into two. so you can run not just windowed prgrams (explorer, firefox, whatever) but full screen programs like games or movies or whatever else you want. this is super useful to fix bugs in full screen programs. im tired of these "windows mangagers" its easier just to click and drag it where you want. and im not OCD about it lining up just right. i just want to split a monitor into two. is that so hard to ask?
