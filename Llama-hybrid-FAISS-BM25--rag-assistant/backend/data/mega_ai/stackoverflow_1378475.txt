There is nothing wrong with your code. It's the NBC.com doing tricks on you. When NBC.com decides that your browser is not capable of displaying PDF, it simply sends back a webpage regardless what you are requesting, even if it doesn't exist. You need to trick it back by telling it your browser is capable, something like, conn.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073021 Firefox/3.0.13");
