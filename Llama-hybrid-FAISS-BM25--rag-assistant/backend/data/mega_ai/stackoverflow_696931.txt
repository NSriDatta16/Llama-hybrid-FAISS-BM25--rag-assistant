Well, What I'd do is, like you said, a web part with javascript that allow the user to drag and drop some files into a zone inside the webpart. Once the user has finished I'll upload those files after click on a Button of the webpart. I think is better to work with SharePoint in an unique transaction and not upload and delete files using AJAX. So, the drag and drop functionality can be done using some kind of javascript like Scriptaculous and the other one like a classic postback.
