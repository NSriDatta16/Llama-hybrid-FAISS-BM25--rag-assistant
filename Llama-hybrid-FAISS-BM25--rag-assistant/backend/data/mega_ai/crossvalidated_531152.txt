Compare two periodic sets of data

At my company, we have two tools (old and new) to measure the same thing (user requests/hits every 5 min). If you graph the data with time on the X axis and user hits on the Y, the data looks periodic (more requests at peak usage and fewer requests when people are sleeping). I will have control data sets where I will generate requests, so I will know what the correct curves are supposed to look like. But I'll also have "production" data sets which have hits for customers where I won't know what the right answer is. I am trying to verify the accuracy/precision of the new tool by comparing it to the results from the old. I was thinking of doing a moving average of the two data sets. I could then compare the moving averages to each other (and collect things like standard deviation around the moving average). Is there a better/standard way in statistics for comparing cyclical data? I'm going to write a computer program to do this, so I can do just about anything.
