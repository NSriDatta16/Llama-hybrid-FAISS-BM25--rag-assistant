Alpha blending with OpenGL ES 2.0?

What's the best way? I tried to do this na√Øvely with a fragment shader that looks like this: varying lowp vec4 color; void main() { lowp vec4 alpha = colorVarying.wwww; const lowp vec4 one = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0); lowp vec4 oneMinusAlpha = one-alpha; gl_FragColor = gl_FragColor*oneMinusAlpha + colorVarying*alpha; gl_FragColor.w = 1.0; } But this doesn't work, because it seems gl_FragColor does not contain anything meaningful before the shader runs. What's the correct approach?
