Is there any other classes or methods available to get the cookie information in blackberry. for (int j = 0; j 0) { break; } add(new RichTextField(key + " : " + field)); } I used this code to get the header information, but I didnt get-setcookie header ( which I'm supposed to get). the output is as follows.
