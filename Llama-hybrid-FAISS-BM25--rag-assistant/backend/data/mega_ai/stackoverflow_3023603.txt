I've had an issue like this where some code definitions were placed in a header file. The header was included in two places, and so conflicted with itself. My solution was to move them to their own cpp file. You might be seeing something like this. Another cause can be failing to use a #pragma once or wrap with the #ifndef technique in a header.
