Additional recommendation from a fellow psychologist/psychometrician. State of the art books: Bollen, K. (1989), Structural Equations with Latent Variables, John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY. Note: classical book, Kenneth Bollen is an influential figure in SEM Brown, T. A. (2006). Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research. New York, NY: Guilford Press. Note there is a new 2015 version of this book. Deep coverage of CFA Kline, R. B. (2015). Principles and practice of structural equation modeling. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. A lot of extra details on both SEM and CFA
