Masters thesis topics in Applied probability and Probabilistic models in Machine Learning

I'm looking for a topic for my masters thesis. Machine learning is my primary domain and I want to work on probabilistic models and applied probability in Machine Learning. Please suggest some exciting new topics that would make for a good masters thesis subject. Anything related to Markov chains Monte Carlo, Bayesian methods, Probabilistic graphical models, Markov models and so on in context of machine learning would be great!
