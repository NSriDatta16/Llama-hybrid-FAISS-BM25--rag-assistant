Arbitrary objects to handle actions?

My question may be a bit stupid, but why can't any object instantiated in IB handle, say, button click? I mean I'm able to add my own object to a xib, and link outlets to cotrols and control actions to object's method, but once I press the button everything just crashes (uknown selector). Do you guys have a hint around that? EDIT : The code, as requested: @interface TextController { IBOutlet UILabel * textLabel; IBOutlet UITextField * textField; } -(IBAction)buttonClicked:(id)sender; @end @implementation TextController -(IBAction)buttonClicked:(id)sender { textLabel.text = @"Ololo"; } @end Connections in IB are ok, just believe me. It's really hard to get them wrong with all this drag'n'drop stuff :) EDIT 2: TextController is not a file owner (in this case it works fine). However, I just want to understand why I can't wire up an action to some object (may be even not a subclass of UIViewController).
