Filter a view by user-created tags in Drupal?

I'd like to add a block to the user profile that shows them content listings in their groups based on tags that they have in their profile. (ie: someone puts a bike up for sale, the user has listed "bike" on their wishlist, it should show up to get their attention) Since these tags vary user-to-user, I'm not sure exactly how to set up the filter. Going a little farther, can I sort them by the number of matching tags?
