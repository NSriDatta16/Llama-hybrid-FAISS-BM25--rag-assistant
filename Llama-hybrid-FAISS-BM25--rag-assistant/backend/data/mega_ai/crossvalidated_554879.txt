In theory you can use also all algorithms having categorical data. You would need to encode them in a way the algorithm can read the information. This is often done using one-hot-encoding, but this can be very computational expensive if your data set is big. Have you tried xgboost and catboost? Especially catboost was developed handling categorical features and there is no pre-processing needed from your side. I would for sure try catboost (and if you have more time I would also try xgboost).
