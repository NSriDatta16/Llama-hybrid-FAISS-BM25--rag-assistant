One possibility would be to forecast/backcast both endpoints. Many seasonal adjustment methods like X12-ARIMA and TRAMO-SEATS do that. If you apply centered moving averages to the data, then you must somehow have more observations than series has. Some future and past values are needed. Regards, -A
