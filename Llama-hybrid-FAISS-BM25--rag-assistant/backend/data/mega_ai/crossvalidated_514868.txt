There are different concepts and some of them overlap. Also I think the main once are already been mention : ). I think these are also interesting in terms of time series and analysis. ' spurious regression ' high R2 values and high t-ratios yielding results with no economic meaning. This could happed ussually in a) just silly correlations as in https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations , or see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship , or b) very common in time series that are not stationary, see Unit Roots here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_root Correlation does not imply causation â€“ Refutation of a logical fallacy. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation . In many cases we not to better understand the situation, some useful tools could be Grander Causality (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality ) or the creation of experimental set up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments . Cum hoc ergo propter hoc ("with this, therefore because of this"). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc . Lucas Critique : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique It is naive to try to predict the effects of a change in economic policy entirely on the basis of relationships observed in historical data, especially highly aggregated historical data. Kind of saying that it is impossible to predict the future in human systems, for instance when including policies. A self-fulfilling prophecy is the sociopsychological phenomenon of someone "predicting" or expecting something, and this "prediction" or expectation coming true simply because the person believes it will and the person's resulting behaviors align to fulfill the belief. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy . I think this is curious with the toilet paper during the beginning of Covid 19. Similar pattern can be observe in the stock market during economics crisis and bubbles .
