Yes it can. One possibility is that all the examples in dataset A are similar, so your classifier may be overfitting this dataset, and may work worse on dataset B. It might well be your case, if you are fitting the features very common in A but nearly absent in B. Another possibility is that you are overfitting the same features of A and B. Adding more samples to A will make this dataset less biased, but the classifier will work worse on B. This is not specific to neural networks.
