What's pcap_pkthdr there for?

Code snippet from here : void packet_handler(u_char *param, const struct pcap_pkthdr *header, const u_char *pkt_data) { .... /* retireve the position of the ip header */ ih = (ip_header *) (pkt_data + 14); //length of ethernet header .... What's const struct pcap_pkthdr *header for( definition ), when do we need it, how is it populated (since there is no such info in the packet itself as below)? (source: lewis at www.dcs.gla.ac.uk )
