If this is really a big problem for you, you could do some sort of UUID based security with the help of the User Agent and other client sent variables. I have seen a recent POC (can't remember the address), saying that with javascript browser detection and php user sent variables, you can create a UUID to identify your users. EDIT : Found it, the script is called Panopticlick , it does a fingerprint identification of the user based on plugins available, fonts available, user agent, time zone, and screen size. From their say : Your browser fingerprint appears to be unique among the 777,809 tested so far. Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys at least 19.57 bits of identifying information. Of course this is not totally secure, as the user can easily spoof this information, but you can use it to create a gray list, so that if a user matches the UUID of your banned ip, you present him with a login screen, or a captcha, or any sort of added security you need.
