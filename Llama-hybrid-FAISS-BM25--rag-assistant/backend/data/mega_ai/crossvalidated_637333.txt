Non-standardized vs Standardized Data Normality

I have a dataset with over 900 cases. I performed a Q-Q Plot on the non-standardized HRV data (dependent variable), and the points formed a wavy curve indicating it does not follow a normal distribution. The accompanying histogram is right-tailed, and the box plot shows several outliers. The study design is repeated measures (within-subjects), where each subject is exposed to 13 scenes (treatments). I first standardized each subject's 13 responses within the subject (13 HRV scores standardized), and then grouped each subject's standardized results with 73 total subjects (73 x 13 = 949 data points). This resulted in data with a MEAN = 0, but STD = 0.96. I then "re-standardized" this data, which resulted in MEAN = 0 and STD = 1. The resulting Q-Q Plot is now a straight line with a few stragglers on the ends, the histogram is symmetrical, and the box plot shows only one near outlier. Furthermore, the Shapiro-Wilk normality hypothesis test no longer rejects the null hypothesis of the distribution of the population as normal. I realize as a dependent variable a normal distribution is unnecessary, but I would like to standardize to facilitate comparison with other physiological and psychological dependent variables I also have in the study. The questions: Is this a valid way to standardize DV values such that each participant's individual heart physiologies (some more consistently higher values, some more consistently lower values) are accounted for equally within the 73-participant group (such that no one individual's scores have more influence than another individual), and could the resulting normal distribution be a valid result? Two other alternatives suggested in feedback include 1) Adding a control for physiology, or 2) Using a Multilevel model, which I think would mean the Individual 13 responses = LEVEL 1, and the entire group of 73 participants together (949 responses) = LEVEL 2?
