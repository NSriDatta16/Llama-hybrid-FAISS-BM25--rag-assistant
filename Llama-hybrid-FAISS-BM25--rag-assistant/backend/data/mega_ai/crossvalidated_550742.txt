We actually don't know enough to be helpful. A few pointers: Your data may simply have a lot of noise, possibly skewed. Remember that your network (just like any model) is trying to disentangle the signal from the noise, and will predict only the signal (in general, predictions will vary less than observations, see here ). Try generating IID lognormally distributed data with high log-variance: you will get very high peaks, but if you feed this to your NN, the predictions will be far lower ( what the optimal predictions are depends on your evaluation function ). Alternatively, your high values may be predictable after all. Then you need to figure out which predictors are useful and feed these into your NN. How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
