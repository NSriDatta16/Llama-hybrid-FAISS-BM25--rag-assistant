Fast way to check if a server is accessible over the network in C#

I've got a project where I'm hitting a bunch of custom Windows Performance Counters on multiple servers and aggregating them into a database. If a server is down, I want to skip it, and just continue on with my day. Currently I'm checking to see if a server is live by doing a DirectoryInfo on a share that I've got to look at later in the process anyways, then checking the .Exists property.This is my current code snippet for testing: DirectoryInfo di = new DirectoryInfo(machine.Share_Path); if (!di.Exists) { log.Warn("Could not access " + machine.Name + "! Maybe its down?"); continue; // Skips to the next server in my loop where this snippet exists. } This works, but its pretty slow. It takes about 68 seconds on average for the di.Exists bit to finish its work, and I ideally need to know within a second whether or not a server is accessible. Pinging also isn't an option since a server can be pingable but not "live" in our environment. I'm still kind of fresh to the .NET world, so I'm open to any advice people can offer. Thanks in advance. -Weegee
