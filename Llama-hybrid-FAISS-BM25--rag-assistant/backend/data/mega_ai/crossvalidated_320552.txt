Projection of a vector on unit sphere

I am currently reading the paper G.Salton et al, A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing , November 1975, Volume 18 It is about indexing documents. Representing them in vectors to find similarities. But this particular part of the paper: Paragraph 3 in Document Space Configuration Instead of identifying each document as by complete vector, originating at the 0-point in the coordinate system, the relative distance between the vectors is preserved by normalizing all vector lengths to one, and considering the projection of the vectors onto the envelope of the space represented by the unit sphere. In that case, each document may be depicted by a single point whose position is specified by the area where the corresponding document vector touches the envelope of the space" I do not understand how they are going to find the projection of a vector on a unit sphere. Can someone please explain? Am I missing something?
