Many thanks for the quick and thorough answers. It turns out that what I needed is a one-sample t test . I had worked out a model in which I expected the results to average out at a certain mean value. With few measurements, it's uncertain whether the actual mean differs from the expected mean by chance or because of a real effect. This usually produces a high p-value. With many measurements, the one-sample t test can produce low p-values, indicating that it's statistically likely that there is a real difference. E.g. with a low number of samples, the following typically produces high p-values, indicating that the hypothetical mean of 102 could have come about from the sample: t.test(rnorm(10, mean=100, sd=5), mu=102) As the number of samples increases, lower p-values start to dominate, indicating that it's likely the sample really does have a mean different from the hypothetical value. t.test(rnorm(100, mean=100, sd=5), mu=102) Big samples consistently yield 2.2e-16, meaning that it's virtually certain the real mean is not 102. t.test(rnorm(1000, mean=100, sd=5), mu=102)
