Threads certainly did exist when C++ was being standardised during the 1990s. However, Windows and Posix have very different threading APIs. Designing a library of the quality you'd want from a standard language library, giving all the threading primitives you need and mapping well onto both popular APIs (and others), required a large effort. Including it in the initial standard would have required either delaying standardisation, possibly for years, or including a specification that may well have had significant shortcomings. That work has been done over the last decade or so (initially as the Boost.Thread library), and will be included as the standard thread support library in the next version of the standard, in addition to language-level features such as thread-local storage.
