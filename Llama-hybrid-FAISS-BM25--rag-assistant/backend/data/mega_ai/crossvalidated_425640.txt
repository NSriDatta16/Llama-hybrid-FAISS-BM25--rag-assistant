time series model with low pacf

I have data on annual temperatures covering 21 years, measured at one single loaction. I want to build a regressive model to find out whether there was a significant warming during that time span. I am working in R. This my data: > summer.temperatures year temperature 1 1996 10.99241 2 1997 11.83630 3 1998 11.99259 4 1999 12.41907 5 2000 12.06093 6 2001 12.27000 7 2002 11.79556 8 2003 13.32352 9 2004 12.10741 10 2005 11.98704 11 2006 12.89407 12 2007 11.24778 13 2008 11.85759 14 2009 12.51148 15 2010 11.29870 16 2011 12.35389 17 2012 12.33648 18 2013 12.24463 19 2014 12.31481 20 2015 12.73481 21 2016 12.43167 > plot(summer.temperatures) The pacf values turned out to be rather low, so there is no pattern of previous years predicting the current year - am I right? Here is the pacf - plot: > pacf (summer.temperatures $ temperature) My question is: based on these findings, how can I test whether there has been a significant warming over the 21 observed years? Normally, in time series I cannot use linear models, beacuse of the non-independence of the measurments. However, with such low pacf values, is it reasonable to state that the measurements indeed ARE independent? Or is there another way to deal with such a time series?
