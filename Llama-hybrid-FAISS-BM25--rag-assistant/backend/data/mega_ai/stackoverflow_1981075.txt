You should check files data storage options: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html Files are being saved in the applications directory, so there is no mess anywhere. Files will be finally removed with the app. You can also implement some method which will clear the cache when the app starts (for example remove files older than 2 weeks).
