After many weeks of trying to find a solution it looks like what is needed is a custom channel url as mentioned here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.init All I did was create the channel.html file containing this single line: Then I added the channelUrl : line so the final result looks like this: window.fbAsyncInit = function() { FB.init({ appId : 'MY APP ID', status : true, // check login status cookie : true, // enable cookies to allow the server to access the session xfbml : true, // parse XFBML channelUrl : 'http://www.example.com/channel.html' // custom channel }); }; (function() { var e = document.createElement('script'); e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js'; e.async = true; document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e); }()); Make sure to add a comma after xfbml : true if it was your last line. I'm not familiar with Javascript so I don't know if I'm taking full advantage of this but I know it prevents the fb_xd_fragment issue and allows FB comments in IE. As far as I can tell, this is the ONLY solution available online. Any further tweaks are welcome.
