Inside your receive handler you can use ui.item , there are several elements available off the ui object your function receives: ui.helper - the current helper element (most often a clone of the item) ui.position - current position of the helper ui.offset - current absolute position of the helper ui.item - the current dragged element ui.placeholder - the placeholder (if you defined one) ui.sender - the sortable where the item comes from (only exists if you move from one connected list to another)
