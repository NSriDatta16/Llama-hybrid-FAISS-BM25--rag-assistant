A quick search for "CreateObject" should some up all the COM objects created from VBScript in the ASP pages. You should also check the global.asa for any object tags, which is the other way COM objects get instantiated. If you also have server side Javascript then you should also look for "ActiveXObject". I expect you could extract this info with commandline tools like grep etc, but unless you are doing this over and over again on different setups then it would almost certainly be quicker to do in VS.NET or something like Agent Ransack .
