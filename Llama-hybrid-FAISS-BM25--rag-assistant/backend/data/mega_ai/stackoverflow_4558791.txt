Simple math formula to calculate average

I am making a software that deals with employee trust. I am trying to make a math formula (no need to tell that I am bad in math :) ). Here is the scenario: Employee 1 trusts employee 2 = > 20% or 0.2 (average trust of employee 1 with employee 2) Employee 2 deals with 10 customers => 13% (average - 10 customers trust on Employee 2) Employee 1 also deals with 7 customers that customers belongs to Employee 2's 10 customers. => 37% ( average 7 customers trust on employee 1) Employee 1 dealt with 10 customers for last 17 years. Employee 2 dealt with 7 customers for last 1 years. Now I want to calculate that how can we say that Employee 1 is much trust worthy than Employee 2? If I just see average than I can say Employee 1 but he only dealt with customers for 1 year. Now I want to make a generic formula to see which one is more trust worthy and I want to use all three values that are ( employee to employee, employee to customer, and number of year) to calculate average percentage. I want to increase or decrease an employee trust based on these values. Please remember I want to decrease as well for some employee I can not say that all employee or 90+ employee are trust worthy etc. What I did: I just simply plus employee to employee and employee to customer trust weight Employee 1 = 0.57 Employee 2 = 0.33 I don't know what to do for years. Current system just calculate employee to employee trust that is not good enough to trust itself. I am not restricted to any programming language because I just want to make a generic formula. All ideas and suggestions are most welcome ! If you think my problem relates to any previously developed trust model then please do let me know (I already know web trust model but I don't know how to fit that in my situation)
