Definetely possible with SSIS. Use Business Intelligence Studio to design the SSIS package, then you can schedule this package as SQL Agent job. SSIS can't transfer it directly to the table, but it can download it to temporary file (use FTP task), then load it to table (depends on file format, most likely you'll need to use Data Flow task), and delete file (File System task).
