There are a couple ways that I've handled this in the past. They both depend on the cursor being outside the element you're dragging. First, you could define a mouseup event handler on the document level, and determine which element was the target of the event. That element will be the element that your draggable item was dropped on to, and you can handle the event from there. Second, you could define a mouseup event handler for each droppable area. This allows easier customization of the handler. Keep in mind that both of these solutions rely on the cursor being outside the element you're dragging. Otherwise, the target of the event will always be the element you're dragging.
