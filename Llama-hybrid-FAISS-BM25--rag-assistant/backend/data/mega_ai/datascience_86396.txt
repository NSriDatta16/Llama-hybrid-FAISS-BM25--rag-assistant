Using GANs to generate synthetic tabular data to improve supervised learning

One topic I see some people trying is using GANs to generate synthetic tabular data for supervised learning. Also as a way to oversample the minority class in a binary classification. For me creating synthetic data is a bit dangerous. In practice, all the experiments that I have seen to generate new training data using GANs have failed. Is there any theoretical reason behind?
