Running WCF webservice on 64bit windows server and II6

I have deployed a wcf service on two different machines. One is running windows server 2003 x86 and the other is x64. The x86 version works fine but on the x64 it just displays page not found when I navigate to the service in a browser. The server is running IIS 6 and was set up the same as the x86 server. Any ideas? EDIT 1 Now I am getting Exception Details: System.BadImageFormatException: Could not load file or assembly 'AgentService' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.
