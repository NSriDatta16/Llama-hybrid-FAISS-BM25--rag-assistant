There are a couple of options that look OK to me (however I haven't used them) This other post references some of them Embedding a flowchart design surface in a .net application Personally I'd just try rolling my own. If your workflows aren't too complicated I don't think it would be that that difficult. If I were to implement this on my own I would generate a Bitmap and render the flowchart to the image through GDI. Another form that doesn't have to be drag and drop could control the logic of generating the flow chart structure.
