Support Vector Regression applied to time series with lagged predictors

I am relatively new to time series. I am dealing with an energy consumption prediction problem. Data points are sampled on a 15-minutes frequency. I have a set of exogenous variables such as temeperature and other calendar variables. Due to the multiple seasonalities present in my dataset I have preferred, at a first instance, SVR over autoregressive models. Now the question. I have included the t-1 lagged dependent variable among my predictors (consumptions measured 15 minutes before ahead). According to some evidence and other answers I have come across here, it shouldn't be an issue if the problem is predictive and not explanatory (as in my case). My question is: is this approach also correct when considering models such as SVR (with Gaussian kernel) which are not linear regression or based on OLS? Secondly: what about using the lagged variable as a predictor also in autoregressive models such as ARIMA or SARIMA? I think it may be an issue in this case because the autoregressive component of these models already takes into account the correlation between the dependent variable and its observation at t-1, t-2, t-n...but I would like to know more about that. It would be greate if you could provide some reference to deepen your explanation! Many thanks in advance.
