You've gotten some advice about how to fix that loop. My advice would be to eliminate it and use std::sort instead. While we're dealing with loops that don't terminate correctly, however, it's probably also worth mentioning one other (in getEnemies() ): while(!inputFile.eof()) { std::string line; inputFile >> line; if (line == " ") { // ... This is broken as well. For the loop to terminate correctly, you need to read the data, and then check whether the read succeeded: std::string line; while (inputFile >> line) { if (line == " ") { // ... It's probably also worth noting that this code is pretty fragile -- just for one example, something like: fighter1 will not be read correctly (it requires at least one whitespace before and after to read it as a single string).
