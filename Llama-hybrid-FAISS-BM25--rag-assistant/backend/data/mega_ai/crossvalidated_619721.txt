You did not get gender- or age-specific estimates because you didn't ask for them. The call emmeans(mod, pairwise ~ group asks for marginal means for each group, and pairwise comparisons thereof. Those group means are marginal means averaged over gender and age (unless age is numeric, in which case the average age is used). And region is excluded because it is not used as a predictor in your model. Or did you mean to say site? The emmeans package has a whole lot of vignettes with discussions and examples. I suggest you start by looking at the quick start one and the basics one.
