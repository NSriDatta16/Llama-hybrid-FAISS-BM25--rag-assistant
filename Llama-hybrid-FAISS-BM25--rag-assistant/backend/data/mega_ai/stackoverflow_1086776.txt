Can two different sites running on same host, share same database for storage and retrieval?

I am building a personal site, for a blog I wish to use WordPress and for a wiki i will use wikia . Is it possible that i use the same database for storing articles from both frontends (WordPress and wiki). If yes can i some how populate articles from my wiki to the blog, under a specific category. EDIT-- By two different sites I mean two different frontends, hosted at different subdomains.
