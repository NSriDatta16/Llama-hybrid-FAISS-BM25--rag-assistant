ASP.Net: Expiring a page when navigating back

Basically all pages on this site I am building cannot be accessed when the user clicks on "Back" (or with key control) in the browser, and the page should expire if one is trying to navigate back in history. I put into Global.asax::Application_BeginRequest Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache) Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1)) Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(False) Response.Cache.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches) Response.Cache.SetNoStore() This would clear out the cache and disallow going back to any pages when the user is logged out, but doesn't do the job while the user is logged in. I saw posts where people suggested using a javascript approach, by calling History.Forward(1) on the page. But I wouldn't like to do this, as it will require javascript enabled to work (which user can disable). Appreciate any suggestions.
