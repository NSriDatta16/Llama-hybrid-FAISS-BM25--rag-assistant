You can't really extend the built-in role-based system, as the other answerer have already noted. What you could do, however, in order to keep your current ASP.NET membership- and role-providers and keep benefitting from their services, is just simply create an extension table for the aspnet_Roles. Something like this: CREATE TABLE dbo.MyOwnRoleExtensions (ExtensionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, ApplicationId uniqueidentifier, RoleId uniqueidentifier, (whatever fields you need here......) ) You could then establish a foreign key relationship to the aspnet_Roles table on (ApplicationId, RoleId) and thus associate your "role extensions" table with the base aspnet_Roles table. Of course, if you need to retrieve the additional fields in your extensions table, you'll need to do that in your own code - but that way, you can still use and leverage all the niceties of the built-in ASP.NET membership and role providers and you don't need any dirty hack or anything.
