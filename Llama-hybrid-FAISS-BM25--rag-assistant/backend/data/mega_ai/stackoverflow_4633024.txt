Excel Generate Normalized Data

I am looking to generate data in which Given two averages (Average Click) and (Average Clicks over Time) will correctly output spaced out data. Hard to explain, but best with an example. Given the following data: Days: 10 Average Click Value: 3.5 Average Clicks over days: 0.7 You could then make data such as: Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 4 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7 Day 8 Day 9 3 Day 10 Where the average between Day 9 (3) and Day 3 (4) would be 3.5, and the total average (7 over 10 days) is 0.7. The following would NOT work because it has a click value average of 3.5, but an overall average of 1.4: Day 1 4 Day 2 Day 3 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 4 Day 7 Day 8 Day 9 3 Day 10 The following would NOT work because it has an overall average of 0.7 but a click value of 1.75: Day 1 1 Day 2 Day 3 2 Day 4 Day 5 3 Day 6 Day 7 Day 8 Day 9 1 Day 10 The click value must be a whole number , so the follow would NOT work: Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 3.5 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7 Day 8 Day 9 3.5 Day 10 The spacing between each should be rather random but follow a tight deviation. The pattern should be similar to how often a user visits their favorite website. I understand it will sometimes not be exact because some combinations cannot be done mathematically, but it should attempt to be as close as it possibly can. Is this type of pattern possible using excel (VBA can be used).
