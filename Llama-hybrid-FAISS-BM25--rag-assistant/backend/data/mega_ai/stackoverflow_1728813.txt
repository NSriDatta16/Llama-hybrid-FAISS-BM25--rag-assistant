This is one of those projects where the path is going to be defined more about what's on hand for ready reuse. You'll probably find it easier to continuously record and saving the data off in chunks (for example, hour long pieces). Format is going to be dependent on what you in the form of recording tools and audio processing library. You may even find that you use two. One format, like PCM encoded WAV for recording and processing, but compressed MP3 for storage. Once you have an audio stream, you'll need to access it in a PCM form (list of amplitude values). A simple averaging approach will probably be good enough to detect when there is a conversation. Typical tuning attributes: * Average energy level to trigger * Amount of time you need to be at the energy level or below to identify stop and start (I recommend two different values) * Size of analysis window for averaging As for number of participants, unless you find a library that does this, I don't see an easy solution. I've used speech recognition engines before and also done a reasonable amount of audio processing and I haven't seen any 'easy' ways to do this. If you were to look, search out universities doing speech analysis research. You may find some prototypes you can modify to give your software some clues.
