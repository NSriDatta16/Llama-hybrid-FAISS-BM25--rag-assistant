http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencast-tags/xcode4 After watching these great little videos, I instantly warmed to XCode4 They have really sorted it out big-time in so many different places, making conceptual changes such as: one window = NICE TextWrap removed annoying 'stop running + rerun' dialog good color scheme facility CMD SHIFT O to locate a header file The auto completion is sorted out beautifully clear console button search & replace NICE new keybindings NICE On-the-fly error checking - love it! As you can see, I made notes over the first 2 days of using it; every time I liked something, or every time something went wrong I would jot it down. So far I have listed 16 problems, but these are all glitches, such as the colouring system going wrong in certain situations etc... ie all minor things that will get patched up pretty soon in updates. With the occasional crash, I am not going back to 3.x unless I absolutely have to. The only thing which really gets my goat is that Apple STILL refuse to support incremental updates. it is totally crazy, and I hope everyone makes a lot of noise about it until they sort it out.
