Use of sitemaps

I've recently been involved in the redevelopment of a website (a search engine for health professionals: http://www.tripdatabase.com ), and one of the goals was to make it more search engine "friendly", not through any black magic, but through better xhtml compliance, more keyword-rich urls, and a comprehensive sitemap (>500k documents). Unfortunately, shortly after launching the new version of the site in October 2009, we saw site visits (primarily via organic searches from Google) drop substantially to 30% of their former glory, which wasn't the intention :) We've brought in a number of SEO experts to help, but none have been able to satisfactorily explain the immediate drop in traffic, and we've heard conflicting advice on various aspects, which I'm hoping someone can help us with. My question are thus: do pages present in sitemaps also need to be spiderable from other pages? We had thought the point of a sitemap was specifically to help spiders get to content not already "visible". But now we're getting the advice to make sure every page is also linked to from another page. Which prompts the question... why bother with sitemaps? some months on, and only 1% of the sitemap (well-formatted, according to webmaster tools) seems to have been spidered - is this usual? Thanks in advance, Phil Murphy
