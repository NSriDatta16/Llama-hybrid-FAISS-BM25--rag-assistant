Well, if you already have the terms for your classes you can use some different kinds of classifiers, e.g. a SVM , a Naive Bayes Classifier or even a Neural Network . There are some libraries out there which include this classifiers, like weka or mahout . Recetly I wrote an example how to do this with a Naive Bayes Classifier: Naive Bayes Example , but this is rather an explanation of the concept and no real-world-usable tool.
