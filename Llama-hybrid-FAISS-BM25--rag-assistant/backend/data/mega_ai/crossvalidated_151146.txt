Doubt with a distance based Redundancy analysis

I conducted a distance based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) to explore the relevance of some environmental variables in explaining the patterns of the distribution (i.e., spatial and temporal) of two organisms. I used a Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix based on the abundance of both organisms and the environmental variables were used as predictors. Results showed that along Axis 1 (along this axis seasons were separated) the "% of fitted" was 81.3% and the "% of total variation" was 38.5%. I do not understand the difference between "% of fitted" versus "% of total variation" in this analysis.
