Starting with the typical supervised vs unsupervised vs reinforcement learning could be more reasonable. Such a categorisation enables easier search for specific fields where these are used. Just go to Wikipedia and in the articles about them look for their applications (or ,,see also" articles). This way you can build your own chart of "ML types" from top to bottom. This might be a good start https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning As you go from the general to the specific, there is a smaller chance that you will miss something just because you do not randomly come up with it.
