From John Breakwell's Blog there are eleven possibilities: The thread pool for the remote read is exhausted (MSMQ 2.0 only). The number of local callback threads is exceeded The volume of messages has exceeded what the system can handle (MSMQ 2.0 only). Paged-pool kernel memory is exhausted. Mismatched binaries. The message size is too large. The machine quota has been exceeded. Routing problems when opening a transactional foreign queue (MSMQ 3.0 only) Lack of disk space. Storage problems on mobile devices Clustering too many MSMQ resources Too many open connections Computer name was longer than 15 characters Too many messages in the dead letter queue http://blogs.msdn.com/johnbreakwell/archive/2006/09/18/761035.aspx I would check the version of your queue and the amount of connections (to and from) your queue open at the time of error. Any of those "could have" caused your error.
