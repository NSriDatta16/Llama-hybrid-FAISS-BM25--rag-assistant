How to organize SQL script files & folders

We have an Oracle 10g database (a huge one) in our company, and I provide employees with data upon their requests. My problem is, I save almost every SQL query I wrote, and now my list has grown too long. I want to organize and rename these .sql files so that I can find the one I want easily. At the moment, I'm using some folders named as Sales Dept, Field Team, Planning Dept, Special etc. and under those folders there are .sql files like Delivery_sales_1, Delivery_sales_2, ... Sent_sold_lostsales_endpoints, ... Sales_provinces_period, Returnrates_regions_bymonths, ... Jack_1, Steve_1, Steve_2, ... I try to name the files regarding their content but this makes file names longer and does not completely meet my needs. Sometimes someone comes and demands a special report, and I give the file his name, but this is also not so good. I know duplicates or very similar files are growing in time but I don't have control over them. Can you show me the right direction to rename all these files and folders and organize my queries for easy and better control? TIA.
