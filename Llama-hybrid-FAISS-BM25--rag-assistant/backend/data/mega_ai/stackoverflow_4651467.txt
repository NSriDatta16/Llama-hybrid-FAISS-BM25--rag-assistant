What is a typical system resource consumption for medium-large websites, like this one?

Well, I know it's more of dart-in-the-air type quesiton, but I am just trying to get a general idea. What would be an average system that you might need, in terms of number of CPUs (cores, GHz, etc), bandwith, RAM, storage, etc. to run some of the medium-large sites, such as this site or other websites (I want to say craigslist, but I know that their userbase is way larger), that may have anywhere from 1K to 10K users at a time?
