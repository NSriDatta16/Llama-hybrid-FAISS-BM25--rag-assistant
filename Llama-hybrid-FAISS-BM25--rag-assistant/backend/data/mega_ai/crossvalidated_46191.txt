Similarity measure between two text documents

Let the first document involve the words $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ and the second one be composed of $\{y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_m\}$ where $n$ is not necessarily equal to $m$. I have a similarity measure that works for elements of the sets; $s(x_i,y_j)$ for all $i$ and $j$. This similarity may not be symmetric, that is, $s(x_i,y_j)\neq s(y_j,x_i)$. But I'm not familiar about the similarity of two sets of instances. I thought that the average of the best similarities is reasonable: $$s\left(\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\},\{y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_m\}\right) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \max_{j=1}^m s(x_i,y_j)$$ What are the main methods used to compute $s\left(\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\},\{y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_m\}\right)$ in such a case? Particularly the similairty of two text documents?
