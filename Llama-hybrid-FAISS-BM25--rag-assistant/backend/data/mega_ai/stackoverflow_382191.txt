My advice would be simply to use Hibernate. Hibernate coupled with JPA annotations + Hibernate annotations is pretty powerful. You can even configure an EntityManagerFactory to autodiscover Entities on the classpath but then call getSessionFactory() to leverage the native Hibernate APIs in your application. If you are using Spring it's very easy to do this with LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean and HibernateJpaVendorAdapter.
