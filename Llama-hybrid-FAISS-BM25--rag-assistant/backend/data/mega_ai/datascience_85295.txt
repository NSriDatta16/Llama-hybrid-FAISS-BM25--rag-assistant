If youre searching for neural network architecture that have varying number of inputs and outputs, Recurrent Neural Networks , LSTM's .. etc are examples. They are used in Natural Language Processing where the main goal is to examine patterns in sentences. But I highly doubt that they will work for your use case since no information about it is provided. Another way would be to create multiple neural networks with a different input/ output sizes, such that the input/output sizes are averages of the groups of similar input/output sizes.
