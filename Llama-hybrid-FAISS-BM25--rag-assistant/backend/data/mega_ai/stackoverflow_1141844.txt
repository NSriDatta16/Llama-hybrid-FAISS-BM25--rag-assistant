Creating a class dynamically in actionscript

Let me present the problem first. I need to load all images that I have used in my project externally without embedding. The images are present either in skins or as icons for items in trees. I came across the IconUtility class here I was able to modify it and use it for trees but the problem is we cannot use iconutility for the same component to set 2 different skins (like for a button - upskin downskin). I was not able to think of a workaround with iconutility. Is it possible to simulate embed and create a class dynamically and return the class at runtime?
