[u'JD, ', u'University of Florida Levin College of Law, magna cum laude , Order of the Coif, Symposium Editor, Florida Law Review, Awards for highest grades in Comparative Constitutional History, Legal Drafting, Real Property and Sales, ', u'2007'] 4) Write the scraped school info into schools.csv file Can you help me write this spider in Python?
