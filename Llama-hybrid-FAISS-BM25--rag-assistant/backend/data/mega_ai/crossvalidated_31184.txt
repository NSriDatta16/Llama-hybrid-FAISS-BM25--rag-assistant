When you're doing Maximum Likelihood Estimation you consider the value of the estimate and the sampling properties of the estimator in order to establish the uncertainty of your estimate expressed as a confidence interval. I think this is important regarding your question because a confidence interval will in general depend on sample points that were not observed, which is seem by some as an essentially unbayesian property. P.S. This is related to the more general fact that Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Point + Interval) fails to satisfy the Likelihood Principle , while a full (" Savage style") Bayesian analysis does.
