Pascal casing or Camel Casing for C# code?

I've been arguing with my coworkers about Pascal casing (upper camel case) vs. lower CamelCasing . They are used to lower camel casing for everything from table names in SQL databases to property naming in C# code but I like Pascal casing better, lower camel casing for variables and Pascal casing for properties: string firstName; public string FirstName { ... } But they are used to this: string _firstname; public string firstName { ... } I try to keep up with their "standard" so the code looks the same but I just don't like it. I've seen that at least the .NET framework uses this convention and that is how I try to keep my code, e.g.: System.Console.WriteLine("string") What do you use/prefer and why? I'm sorry if somebody else asked this question but I searched and did not find anything. Update: I've given a method example and not a property but it's the same. As I stated in the first paragraph my colleagues use the Pascal convention for everything (variables, methods, table names, etc.)
