You can use restricted boltman machine to obtain feature map, and then build a CNN with this architecture : conv layer -> pooling->conv layer pooling-> ....->fully connected layer. Add conv layer and pooling layer until the matrix size reduced into $1\times 1$, then treat them as input for your fully connected layer, then train the fully connected layer
