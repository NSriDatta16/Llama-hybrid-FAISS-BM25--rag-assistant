Given the way $k$ enters in the Poisson pmf (i.e. through $k!$), I believe you can do it only through a simple computational program: Since $k$ is an integer, if shouldn't be too timeconsuming, and the solution is unique: a not very elegant R solution could be: lambda=5; p=0.146 which(round(dpois(seq(0:100), lambda),3)==p) which returns $k=6$. Of course, your actual problem may be more complicated than this. On the other hand, usually obtaining $k$ is not of interest per se, as you may want to obtain the expected number of events. So, your question is a bit obscure on that regard.
