How to get code coverage when testing Silverlight

I'm looking for code coverage solution which works with silverligt. It must also work with msbuild because we run all the other unit tests automatically in the build server. Integration with Visual Studio and/or resharper is a plus and I have nothing against easy setup or a pointer to a tutorial. I don't usually modify the build files and unfortunately I don't have time to learn msbuild at the moment.
