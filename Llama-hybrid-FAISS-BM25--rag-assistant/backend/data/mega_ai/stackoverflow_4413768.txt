Most python guis I recommend tkinter but drag 'n drop isn't built into tkinter yet and I'm not a huge fan of the other libraries. Have you thought about IronPython in .Net and WPF? You'll need to learn the xaml syntax but it's not much harder than html (technically, it's stricter and simpler but you need to learn some library controls it will instantiate). There are free versions of visual studio for all of this. Another simple way would be to expose a command line or webservice interface to your python routines.
