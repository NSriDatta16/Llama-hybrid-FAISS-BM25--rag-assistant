Which test for small sample sizes?

I have got a total sample size of 12 soil samples which were split into 4 groups of $n=3$. A number of different variables were measured like content of organic carbon. These data are logistically difficult and expensive to collect, so collecting more data is not possible. Now I want to compare the means of the 4 groups ($n=3$) by testing. But there is the problem that the normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk) and homoscedasticity (Brown-Forsythe/Levene) is not given in each sample. So which test should I prefer? What do you think? Is it even useful to use test statistics in this case? Are there any alternatives beneath descriptive statistics? OK, here are some details. The soil samples are from a long-term experiment site with four different treatments (plough, no tillage and so on). From each of these four treatments I have 3 soil samples. The different variables are measured in metric data. For example - content of organic carbon [g/kg]: (Group 1: 12.1 // 13.2 // 13.5), (Group 2: 13.1 // 13.9 // 13.5), (Group 3: 8.9 // 10.2 // 11.9). Now I wanted to test if there are any significant differences among the medians of these groups. In addition, concentrations of different substances in soils are generally not normal distributed.
