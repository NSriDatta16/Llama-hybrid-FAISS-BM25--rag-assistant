Using neural network for "features matching" binary classification

We have a dataset of numerical features from two images and we want to check if these images match or not using only these features. Basically we have have these columns: fA1, fA2, ..., fA14: 14 features from image A fB1, fB3, ..., fB14: 14 features from image B We want to predict if image A match image B (y=1) or not (y=0). So it's a features matching problem. The main usecase is for face recognition using this framework: BERND HEISELE So is there any neural networks architecture known for this situation (we have a 7 million annotated training set) ? N.B: we don't have any images, we have only numerical features.
