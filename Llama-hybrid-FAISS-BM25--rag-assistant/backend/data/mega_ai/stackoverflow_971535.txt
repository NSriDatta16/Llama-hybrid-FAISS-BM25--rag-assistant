Given the lack of project management, organization, etc - I think you're going to run into problems trying to force yourself into a quarterly (or any fixed date) release cycle. This will be especially true if you have any "large" features which will take more than the 2 months to develop that you're allowing for development time. My suggestion would be to do a feature-based release cycle. Just make your queue of features, decide which ones you think you can reasonably do in a specific time frame. Implement those features, give yourself one month (or whatever) for testing, then release. Move to the next group of features. If it takes 2 months instead of 3, great. If it takes 4, that's fine too. That being said, I'd focus on trying to make this shorter, not longer. Having more, smaller releases will actually help you in this case, especially since you don't have the formal procedures (and personnel) to handle QA, etc. Staying flexible will help you fix problems that will get into your releases...
