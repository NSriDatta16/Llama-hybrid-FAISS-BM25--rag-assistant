Does logistic regression use crosstabs?

I am performing a binomial logistic regression with my outcome being a count with an upper bound which is 45. My data is of the following form: Now I am wondering whether the actual analysis happens on a crosstab or not? I am confused since I have 45 categories and also continuous variables so that would make to many cells, increasing the chance of empty cells? I want to know, because I want to know how many degrees of freedom I have, and whether this depends on my sample size, or the cells of a crosstab.
