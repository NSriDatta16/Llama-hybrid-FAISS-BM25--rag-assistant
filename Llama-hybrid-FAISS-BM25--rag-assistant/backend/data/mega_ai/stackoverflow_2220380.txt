Transactions billing on Windows Azure

My company currently has some serious problem. We've got an application as showcase on Azure which makes use of 1 web role, 1 worker role, a message queue and table storage, but in very moderate rates. We are billed for 8 days now and our billing for "storage transactions" seems to be abnormally high. We are at 25 EUR now which is really too much looking at the very limited size of our little application. Thus I just wanted to know: what exactly is 1 storage transaction on Windows Azure that we are billed for? Is it table storage, blob storage or message queue transaction as well? Perhaps we could make some conclusions afterwards. Thanks, Matthias
