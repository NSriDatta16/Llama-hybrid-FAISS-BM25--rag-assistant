Something like: ${hour.cells[col].hourOfDay} This will only work if hour.cells is a Map , so that the cells.get($col) expression in the original is calling get() on that Map . If it's an arbitrary method call, then it won't work, since JSP EL can only handle bean properties or collections. As @EliteGentleman points out, you can use the varStatus on the forEach loop to remove the need for a separate loop counter, which you should do. My fragment was a more literal translation.
