Problem using the index of a UITableView to change a String

I'm fairly new to iPhone programming and I have a project that needs to be completed soon. I am trying to use a UITableView to list three websites and then load up to desired website on selection. This is the code I have so far: -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { int storyIndex = [indexPath indexAtPosition: [indexPath length] - 1]; if (storyIndex = 1) { venueLink = @"http://kos-mediadesign.com/Storage/IconVenues/IconVenue.html"; } else if (storyIndex = 2) { venueLink = @"http://kos-mediadesign.com/Storage/IconVenues/SmythsVenue.html"; } else if (storyIndex = 3) { venueLink = @"http://kos-mediadesign.com/Storage/IconVenues/SinnotsVenue.html"; } } No matter what site I select the first one is always opened in my DetailView. I would really appreciate some help on this. Thanks, Kev
