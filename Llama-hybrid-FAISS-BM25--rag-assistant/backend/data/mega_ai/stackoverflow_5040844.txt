THe easiest way to check your model is to use the EclipseUML2 editor. This is not a graphical UML but a tree where you can create elements directly on the XMI model. The XMI is 2.1 corresponding to UML 2.3 and is really clean. This XMI is used by RSA IBM, Topcased, Papyrus at project level and you can even have multiple projects merge with Omondo. Really cool !!
