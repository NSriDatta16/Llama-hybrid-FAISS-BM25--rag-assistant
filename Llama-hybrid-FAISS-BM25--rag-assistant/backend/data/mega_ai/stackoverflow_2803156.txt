regexp in java problem

I found some problem while testing my NLP system. I have a java regex "(.*\\.\\s*)*Dendryt.*" and for string "v Table of Contents List of Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . " it just dont stop computing. Its clear that this regex complexity is very high, I will try to refactor it. Have you some suggestions for me for a future regex development ??? Thanks.
