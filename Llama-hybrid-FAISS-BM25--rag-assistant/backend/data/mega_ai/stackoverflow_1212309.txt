Not exactly what you are looking for but a very simple way to approximate a normal distribution of numbers is by adding multiple generations together. A classic example of this technique is in the game Dungeons and Dragons where a characters strength might be determined by rolling three six sided dice and adding the results. This gives a range of 3 to 18 with numbers around 10 the most likely. Variants include: Rolling 4 dice and discarding the lowest. This skews the distribution towards higher numbers. Averaging the scores rather than adding them. This makes the output range easier to understand. Alternatively, this is pretty close...
