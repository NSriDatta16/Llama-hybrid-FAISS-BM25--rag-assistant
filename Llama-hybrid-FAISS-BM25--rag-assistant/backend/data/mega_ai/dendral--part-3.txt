n samples of the Mars surface, using a mass spectrometer coupled with a minicomputer. As he was not an expert in either chemistry or computer programming, he collaborated with Stanford chemist Carl Djerassi to help him with chemistry, and Edward Feigenbaum with programming, to automate the process of determining chemical structures from raw mass spectrometry data. Feigenbaum was an expert in programming languages and heuristics, and helped Lederberg design a system that replicated the way Djerassi solved structure elucidation problems. They devised a system called Dendritic Algorithm (Dendral) that was able to generate possible chemical structures corresponding to the mass spectrometry data as an output. Dendral then was still very inaccurate in assessing spectra of ketones, alcohols, and isomers of chemical compounds. Thus, Djerassi "taught" general rules to Dendral that could help eliminate most of the "chemically implausible" structures, and produce a set of structures that could now be analyzed by a "non-expert" user to determine the right structure. The new rules include more knowledge of mass spectrometry and general chemistry. He also expanded the system so it can incorporate to NMR spectroscopy data in addition to mass spectrometry data. The Dendral team recruited Bruce Buchanan to extend the Lisp program initially written by Georgia Sutherland. Buchanan had similar ideas to Feigenbaum and Lederberg, but his special interests were scientific discovery and hypothesis formation. As Joseph November said in Digitizing Life: The Introduction of Computers to Biology and Medicine, "(Buchanan) wanted the system (Dendral) to make discoveries on its own, not just help humans make them". Buchanan, Lederberg and Feigenbaum designed "Meta-Dendral", which was a "hypothesis maker". Heuristic Dendral "would serve as a template for similar knowledge-based systems in other areas" rather than just concentrating in the field of organic chemistry. Meta-Dendral was a model for knowledge-rich learning systems that was later codified in Tom Mitchell's influential Version Space Model of learning. By 1970, Dendral was performing structural interpretation at post-doc level. Djerassi and his group would take over the program for their own research for a decade. In recent years, Dendral’s influence has extended into modern artificial-intelligence systems for chemical structure elucidation. Contemporary projects such as METIS (software) and SpecTUS (2025) continue Dendral’s legacy by applying machine learning to automate GC–MS data interpretation and de novo molecular structure prediction.
