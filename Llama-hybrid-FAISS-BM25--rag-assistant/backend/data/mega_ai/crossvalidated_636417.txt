The question I wanted to answer was: does the two GAM models fitted for each experimentalGroupForTable significantly differ from each other for predicting the value of FA? You can't actually tell that from this output (beyond the trivial difference that the groups have different mean values of the response, even though this difference is not statistically significant). The first two lines in the smooth terms section of the output are Wald-like tests against the null hypothesis of a flat constant function. As such, this output only tells you that each of the two estimated smooth functions differs from a constant, flat function. It doesn't provide any information whatsoever about the differences in the two smooths. To answer this you'd need to use the model to estimate the difference between the two smooths (see ?difference_smooths for example in my {gratia} package for a way to do this), or reformulate the model such that it contains a difference smooth, by making experimentalGroupForTable an ordered factor (as one option) and fitting: # make an ordered factor from your factor by variable my_df transform(expGrpOrd = ordered(experimentalGroupForTable)) # set the contrasts to be the usual treatment contrasts contrasts(my_df$expGrpOrd) Now the first smooth, the one without the by argument will be for the reference group (level) of the factor, while the smooth generated by the s() term with the factor by will be a smooth difference from the reference smooth. There are other ways to do this too; another is to fit the "average" smooth effect and then separate difference smooths one per level of the factor, which estimate how each group differs from the average. This is done using the sz basis, and importantly we don't want to include the factor by term as a parametric effect in this model: gam(FA ~ s(contrastGroupForTable, bs = "cs") + # !! In both cases I'm not sure what you hope to achieve by setting k so low? My interpretation now is since the $p$ -value for experimentalGroupForTableeYFP is >0.05, at this confidence interval, that my null hypothesis would be rejected. This is back-to-front; you fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 95%
