A general way to generate time series data based on an already existing dataset, is implemented by the Synthetic Data Vault, an ecosystem of libraries that allows one to learn single-table, multi-table and timeseries datasets to later on generate new Synthetic Data that has the same format and statistical properties as the original dataset: https://sdv.dev/SDV/ . As a caveat, it is not exclusively focused on on finance/trading strategies. However, the tutorial page of the PAR model ( https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/timeseries/par.html ) uses a dataset consisting of financial time series similar to the ones given in the question. A detailed technical breakdown of the methods used can be found in the published paper: https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SDV.pdf
