What are the implications for training a Tree Ensemble with highly biased datasets?

I have a highly biased binary dataset - I have 1000x more examples of the negative class than the positive class. I would like to train a Tree Ensemble (like Extra Random Trees or a Random Forest) on this data but it's difficult to create training datasets that contain enough examples of the positive class. What would be the implications of doing a stratified sampling approach to normalize the number of positive and negative examples? In other words, is it a bad idea to, for instance, artificially inflate (by resampling) the number of positive class examples in the training set?
