Hierachical Bayesian modelling using brms: how to insert a prior that reflects cut-offs of Reaction Times distribution?

I am running a hierarchical Bayesian model using brms on reaction times (RTs) of a GoNogo task. The predictors are categorical and include the 3 stimuli/condition that participants observed and the 2 sequences of trials. I used an ex-Gaussian distribution for RTs. here is the model: informed1_RTs.bmodel = brm(RTs ~ conditionStimuli * sequenceTrials + (0 + conditionStimuli * sequenceTrials | Num_part) , data = data_RTs_go , family = exgaussian(link = "identity") , warmup = 500 , iter = 2000 , chains = 2 , inits = "random" , cores = 2 , seed = 123 , save_pars = save_pars(all = TRUE) ) The pp_check shows a good fit (I think!) but the edges exceed the cut-off of the RTs (I chose a lower cutoff of 200ms and an upper cut-off o 750). I expect that inserting a boundary in the distribution reflecting the cut-off would improve the model predictions. How do I insert such a boundary? Following Gelman, 2006 I tried to insert a uniform(200,750) but it gives various warnings and errors that the boundaries are not possible. Thank you, this is an example of the data: Num_part trial_type Go_type conditionStimuli ITI_ms response RTs correctResponse order_pres sequenceTrials sdt 2 1 Go Bent leaves 819 1 301 1 1 NGG 1 3 1 Go Bent leaves 771 1 237 1 1 GG 1 4 1 Go Bent leaves 1086 1 393 1 1 GG 1 5 1 Go Straight leaves 652 1 331 1 1 GG 1 7 1 Go Bent leaves 919 1 372 1 1 NGG 1 9 1 Go Straight leaves 802 1 359 1 1 NGG 1
