I think mkoryak's answer (using no-cache headers) seems best. If you want certain pages to be seen only when a user is logged in, the best way is to instruct the browser to simply not cache the page. Furthermore, schemes such as tweaking cookies and using javascript do determine login state on the client are simply reinventing the wheel. If you want to leverage some caching and your page isn't something that is constantly updating, a good compromise is to set the Response.Expires header to some value you deem appropriate (it's measured in minutes I believe).
