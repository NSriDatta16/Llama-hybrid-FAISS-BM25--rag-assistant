Introduction to SNMP monitoring

I've been tasked with writing a monitoring program for my company's server software that integrates with zenoss via snmp. To be brief, I can't get anything up off the ground. I think my first goal is to figure out the correct way to write an snmp agent (in any language to start, although it will eventually be in java). Are there any good test harnesses out there? I've used snmptest , which ships with zenoss, but it's not much good to me if I can't get a test agent off the ground. Anything that I know the zenoss manual has a lot of info, but it seems to presume a prior knowledge of standard systems monitoring practices and tools, and I can barely penetrate it. Also, is it generally a good practice to use snmp to monitor software?
