How to build a AST for a proprietary language?

I m trying to understand how to build a AST for a proprietary language. I need to build a AST so I can feed in my rules and guidelines to check for the possible errors in the source code. How does one go about building a AST? Are there any books, articles that may help me get started. Will the dragon book on compilers help?. Please note i'm from a non-CS background. Thanks
