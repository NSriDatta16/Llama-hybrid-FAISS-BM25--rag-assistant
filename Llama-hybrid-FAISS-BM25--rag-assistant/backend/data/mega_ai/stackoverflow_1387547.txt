What is the most scalable PHP-based directory structure for a large site?

I am creating a very large PHP MVC-based site that will have a large library of php classes, javascripts, and many css files (not to mention a large amount of files for the MVC). For the first time ever, I am actually taking the time to plan out a clean and organized directory structure. What directory structures do you typically use, and which will be easiest to manuever when there are thousands of files?
