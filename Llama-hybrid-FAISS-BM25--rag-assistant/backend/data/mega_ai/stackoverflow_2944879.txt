It prevents user agents that are either not aware of the tag or do not handle it properly from trying to parse or display JavaScript code as HTML. It's common perception that you have to travel to the late 1990's to find a browser that's unaware of the tag. However, my own sites are often spidered by tools that implement very rudimentary parsers (why not? You can write a grabber with 10 lines of PHP). And I've also found JavaScript code showing up in the middle of a document after pasting from a web site into a desktop app that's supposed to accept HTML from the clipboard. Thus, escaping non-HTML contents in HTML comments is not as silly as it may seem.
