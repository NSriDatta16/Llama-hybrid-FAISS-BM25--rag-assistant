Even though you state you are not interested in the variance your exercise is very similar to econometric models trying to estimate the variance as a function of some regressors . They typically work in a two step approach like you suggest here, estimate a model for the mean, take the residuals from this first model, and then fit a seperate model on the residuals (which may or may not have different regressors than the mean model). If the first model is OLS and you square the residuals, a gamma model is often used as the link function (with the relationship between the residuals and a chi-square distribution the motivating factor I imagine). But in your case you have several complicating factors that make the choice of the link function less clear: The residuals from generalized linear models are more complicated than residuals from OLS (and are not even well defined - you have several options to choose from) You want to use the absolute value of the residual (instead of the square) You want to seperately estimate models for negative and positive residuals (This seems like a mistake to me, I would consider stacking the equations and using dummy variables to distinguish between negative and positive residuals in whatever subsequent equation you want to examine.) Because it is unlikely you will be able to even approximately derive a distribution of the residuals, an ad-hoc approach of simply using a distribution that will reasonably approximate the residual distribution seems called for. The distribution will look different for different types of generalized linear models (e.g. a logistic regressions residuals will look different than a Poisson regression) so it is hard to give general advice. A gamma distribution may work alright for the residuals from a Poisson regression, but I'm not sure it would for the residuals from a logistic regression (at least in the typical residual plots I have seen for these types of models). Gung gives other possibilities that aren't in the exponential family that may be considered as well. For an example application of estimating the variance as a function of regressors (along with a brief review of the econometrics literature that has similar applications), see Western, B., & Bloome, D.
