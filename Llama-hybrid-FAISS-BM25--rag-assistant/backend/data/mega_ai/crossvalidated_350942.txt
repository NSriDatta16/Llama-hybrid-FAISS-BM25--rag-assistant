Yes, it has been done. The following paper implements something of that form: Deep Unsupervised Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders . Nat Dilokthanakul, Pedro A.M. Mediano, Marta Garnelo, Matthew C.H. Lee, Hugh Salimbeni, Kai Arulkumaran, Murray Shanahan. They experiment with using this approach for clustering. Each Gaussian in the Gaussian mixture corresponds to a different cluster. Because the Gaussian mixture is in the latent space ($z$), and there is a neural network connecting $z$ to $x$, this allows non-trivial clusters in the input space ($x$). That paper also mentions the following blog post, which experiments with a different variation on that architecture: http://ruishu.io/2016/12/25/gmvae/ Thanks to shimao for pointing this out.
