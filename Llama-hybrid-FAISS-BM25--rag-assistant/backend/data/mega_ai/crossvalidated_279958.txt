You aren't interpreting PCA correctly. PCA finds a whole new basis for your data. It's analogous to a change of basis: https://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/changebasis/ but we choose a particular basis The new basis is not arbitrary: the vectors are selected based on how much variation they account for. That is to say, PC1 "points in the direction of greatest variability" Just because the primary component (vector projection) of PC1 and PC3 are in the direction of calcium, we can not say that calcium is the most "important" (whatever that may mean!). Geeking out about linear algebra: By the laws of linear algebra, all principal components are orthogonal to each other, and the the amount of explained variance for any given eigvenvalue, E_p is E_p/(sum(E_i) where sum(E_i) is the sum of all eigenvalues lastly, here's a good discussion on PCA: Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues
