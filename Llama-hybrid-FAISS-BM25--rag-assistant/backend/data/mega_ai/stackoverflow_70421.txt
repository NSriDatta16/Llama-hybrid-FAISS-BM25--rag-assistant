Actually, QuickSort is O(n 2 ). Its average case running time is O(nlog(n)), but its worst-case is O(n 2 ), which occurs when you run it on a list that contains few unique items. Randomization takes O(n). Of course, this doesn't change its worst case, it just prevents a malicious user from making your sort take a long time. QuickSort is more popular because it: Is in-place (MergeSort requires extra memory linear to number of elements to be sorted). Has a small hidden constant.
