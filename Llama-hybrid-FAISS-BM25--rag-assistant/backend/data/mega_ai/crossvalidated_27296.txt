Given that the tasting ability is ordinal, you could consider ordinal logistic regression, if you have learned that yet (since you tagged your question with homework). There are also tests of ordinal differences, such as Jonckheere-Terpstra, that are more similar to the spirit of $\chi^2$. But those don't mark one variable as dependent and the other as independent.
