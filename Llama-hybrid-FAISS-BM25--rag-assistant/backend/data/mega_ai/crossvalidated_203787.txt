Metrics to analyse neural networks

I am trying to find interesting metrics that can be used to analyse a neural network. So accuracy (test, and validation error) and computational complexity (space and time) seem like the obvious ones, but are there others? Why do we know that neural network 1 is better than neural network 2?
