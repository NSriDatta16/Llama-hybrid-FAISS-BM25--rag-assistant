You need to escape it again. Use %252f instead of %2f . To clarify, the URL is unencoded when the server receives it. URL encoding allows you to pass in a / that the server processes as a character instead of the special function that a reserved character would normally trigger. See the Wikipedia page for more info. Concerning your error with the a?@!&ee username, it seems almost certain that you're running into a problem that ASP.NET has with special characters (even urlencoded properly) that are not in the query string (that is, after the ? part of the URL). Joshua Flanagan talks about it in a blog post , and identifies % , & , * , and : as the problematic characters. He points to a Dirk.Net blog post that offers a couple of fixes. First, you can edit the registry to allow restricted characters (adding a DWORD key AllowRestrictedChars to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters and setting its boolean value to true). Or, you can ensure that you have the .NET framework 1.1 SP1 and edit the registry to set ASP.NET VErification Compatibility to true ( DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ASP.NET VerificationCompatibility = 1 ). Third, you can try setting ValidateRequest to false on the ASPX page. Finally, as Joshua decided to do, you can pass the information using the query string, i.e. after the ? as ASP.Net originally (pre MVC) expected.
