I've done this same thing to build an LDAP client for the iPhoneOS 2.2. You just to drag the .a into the "link with libraries" build stage. I recommend using the regular (non _r) version of the library, unless you specifically need reentrancy on your ldap stuff (which I don't recommend). You can also add the .h's to your project, which is generally the easiest way to access them.
