Interpreting Coefficients in the Presence of Interaction Effects

I have a model which estimates the average sqft price based on whether the estate needs renovation or not and whether it is downtown, suburbs or in the transition zone between those two ares. All variables are binary: $price = 402.45 − 23.10 ∗ renovation + 56.10 ∗ downtown − 10.01 ∗ transition + 15.90 ∗ renovation × downtown − 0.15 ∗ renovation × transition$ The reference groups are suburb estates that do not need renovation which price is represented by the intercept. But how do I e.g. interpret the coefficient of $renovation$ ? Does it mean that the price of estates that need renovation is 23.1 less than those which do not need renovation or is it that the price of suburb estates that need renovation is 23.1 less than suburb estates that do not need renovation? The same question goes to the coefficient of the interaction terms such as e.g. $renovation × downtown$ .
