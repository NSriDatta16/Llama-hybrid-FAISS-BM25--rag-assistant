Running PCA on top of tf-idf features?

Is it a good idea to run PCA on top of attributes obtained with Tf-Idf? The tf-idf returns a lot of attributes so in that case I believe it is a good idea to run PCA to reduce the number of dimensions. On the other hand tf-idf seeks to find something very specific to the example, while with the PCA you try to generalize, would you loose some signal with this sequence of operations.
