I don't know if they are really a lot slower but they make thinking about programming easier a lot of the times, because the state of the object/string can't change. That's the most important property to immutability to me. Furthermore you might assume that immutable string are faster because they have less state(which can change), which might mean lower memory consumption, CPU-cycles. I also found this interesting article while googling which I would like to quote: knowing that a string is immutable makes it easy to lay it out at construction time â€” fixed and unchanging storage requirements
