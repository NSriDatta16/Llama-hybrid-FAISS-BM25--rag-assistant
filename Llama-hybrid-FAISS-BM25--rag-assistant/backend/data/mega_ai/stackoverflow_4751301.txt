Strange "Out of Memory" Error

My app is running properly on some Android devices but on some devices it's giving an out of memory error. Here is the LogCat log: http://logcat.miui-dev.com/147001 What this Activity does is load Bitmaps, and display those Bitmaps through onDraw() . What would cause this error? what am doing ? Am just maping all images in a method image _bitmapCache.put(R.drawable.gb2, BitmapFactory.decodeResource( getResources(), R.drawable.gb2)); and when a constructor is called i call that method , while using image i just use canvas.drawBitmap(_bitmapCache.get(R.drawable.level1c1), 0, 0, null); to craw the image
