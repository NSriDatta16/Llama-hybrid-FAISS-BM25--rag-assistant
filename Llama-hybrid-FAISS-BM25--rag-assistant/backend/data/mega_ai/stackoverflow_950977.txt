The proper way to do this - binding to properties

I have 2 controls that both bind to the same dependency property "Weather". In the first control you put the current weather, the other one displays a forecast. In my XAML of the first control I bind a TextBox that contains the "Humidity" as follows. Whenever the Humidity changes, I want the other control to do something, however changing only Humidity does not change the Weather - so the other control it not notified. Changing the Humidity should change the entire forecast. (I'm not actually writing a weather app., but just using the above as an example) My question: what is the proper way to do this? The only way I can think of is setting a SourceUpdated event handler on the TextBox that touches the Weather property. Is there a more elegant way to do this? Thanks
