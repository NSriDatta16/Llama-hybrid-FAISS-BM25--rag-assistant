Cleaning up a string

I have the following string which I need to get onto one line for database storage and retrieval purposes: {"id":8,"heading":"heading goes here","content":" content goes here "} I am using the following command to get this onto one line: Dim strContent As String = Request.Form("strContent").Replace(vbCr, "").Replace(vbLf, "") This puts the above string onto one line as follows: {"id":8,"heading":"heading goes here","content":" content goes here "} However, within the string there seems to be a "tab" character How do I get rid of that?
