Consider using mod_rewrite: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html which is the proper mechanism to redirect incoming traffic to a particular page based on a variety of conditions (incl referrer url, user agent, etc). .htaccess is about authorization of resources, not redirection between resources.
