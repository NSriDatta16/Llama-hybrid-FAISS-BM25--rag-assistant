How about standing up out of your cubicle and "HEY! HAS ANYONE EVER....". To be fair, something more informal is likely better. Formal things take time. Time folks don't have. It's one of the dichotomies of development. We have time for interrupts, but not for anything else. I would suggest relying on simply social networking. i.e. "Hey Frank, have you ever...?" "Hmm, no, but Bob might...". Augmented by AIM or an in house IRC to help get conversations started, and then you can walk over or get on the phone to resolve the problem. As far as knowing what others are up too, well, that's basically what the water cooler is for, and lunch times, and internal socializing, right? Unless you're the persons supervisor. The larger the company, the larger the chance of duplication of effort. At the same time, YOUR time is basically set on YOUR project, not THEIR projects. If you have a public SVN, then maybe you can crawl that as well. The point being, rely on organic systems rather than something rigid, I think you'll have a better chance of success finding a happy medium.
