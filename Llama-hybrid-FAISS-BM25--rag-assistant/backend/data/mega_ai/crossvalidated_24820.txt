Combination of two Gaussians

Very close to: Finding the Bayesian classifier for a bivariate Gaussian distribution Can somebody tell me the joint Gaussian of the following two Gaussians (in which $C_j = C_1 \text{ or } C_2$): $$p(x|C_1) = \text{N}(μ_1,Σ_1)$$ $$p(x|C_2) = \text{N}(μ_2,Σ_2)$$ where $$μ_1 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1\\ 1\end{array}\right], \,\,\,\, Σ_1 = \left[\begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{array}\end{array}\right]$$ $$μ_2 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1\\ 3\end{array}\right],\,\,\,\,Σ_2 = \left[\begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{array}\end{array}\right]$$
