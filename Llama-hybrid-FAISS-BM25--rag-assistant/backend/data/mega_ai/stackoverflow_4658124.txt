Django: construct a QuerySet inside a view?

I have models as follows: class Place(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=300) class Person(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=300) class Manor(models.Model): place = models.ManyToManyField(Place, related_name="place")) lord = models.ManyToManyField(Person, related_name="lord") overlord = models.ManyToManyField(Person, related_name="overlord") I want to get all the Places attached with the relation 'lord' to a particular person, and then get the centre, using a GeoDjango method. This is as far as I've got: person = get_object_or_404(Person, namesidx=namesidx) manors = Manor.objects.filter(lord=person) places = [] for manor in manors: place_queryset = manor.place.all() for place in place_queryset: places.append(place) if places.collect(): centre = places.collect().centroid However, this gives me: AttributeError at /name/208460/gamal-of-shottle/ 'list' object has no attribute 'collect' Can I either (a) do this in a more elegant way to get a QuerySet of places back directly, or (b) construct a QuerySet rather than a list in my view? Thanks for your help!
