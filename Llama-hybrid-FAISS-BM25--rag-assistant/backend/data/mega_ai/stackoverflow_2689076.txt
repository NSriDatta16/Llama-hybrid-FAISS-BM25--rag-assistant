Webkit ondrop event while dragging

I'm trying to drag one img and so it fires ondragenter for IE and dragover event for standard browsers, on IE and FF after the user drags it could fire ondrop event however on Webkit based (chrome and safari), i need to cancel or preventDefault() on the dragover event, doing that so will disable the dragging. Any idea on solving this? Thanks Update: Im referring to designMode='on'
