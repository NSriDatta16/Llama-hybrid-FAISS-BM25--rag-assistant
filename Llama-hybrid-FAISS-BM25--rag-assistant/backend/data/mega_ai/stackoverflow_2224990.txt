To be brief, you said "I'm asking because I'm about to have people really go over my code for the first time and I want to look like I know what I'm doing". So, change your code, because it does make it look like you do not know what you are doing. The fact that you have raised it shows that you are aware that it will probably look bad (this is a good thing), and it does. As has been mentioned, you are breaking fundamentals of OO design for expediency. This simply results in fragile, and typically unmaintainable code.
