From your code (and my knowledge of AB testing), I gather your proportions come in discrete increments. That is, for every person who visits a site, they end up categorized as a "success" or a "failure". In other words, your proportions come from a finite number of Bernoulli trials ; they are not continuous proportions. As a result, the beta distribution (which is for continuous proportions) is not really appropriate here. Instead, you should use the binomial distribution . Provided your $n$'s are large enough relative to the proportion of successes, the normal approximation is quite acceptable (the standard rule of thumb is that the lesser of $np$ and $n(1-p)$ should be $>5$, in your case those values are $46$ and $33$). I would go with the chi-squared test in your situation, and not use the beta distribution. If you didn't have enough successes to trust the normal approximation, you could use a permutation test , as @jbowman discusses here: The $z$-test vs. the $\chi^2$-test for comparing the odds of catching a cold in two groups . On the other hand, if your proportions were continuous (e.g., the mass of a tumor as a proportion of the mass of an organ), the beta distribution would be preferable. You could use beta regression in an ANOVA-ish way (i.e., only having categorical predictor variables). I have a simple example of beta regression in R that could be adapted to such a situation here: Remove effect of a factor on continuous proportion data using regression in R .
