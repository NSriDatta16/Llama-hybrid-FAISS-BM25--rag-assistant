agglomerative clustering sensitivity to outliers: single-link vs complete-link

Agglomerative clustering can use various measures to calculate distance between two clusters, which is then used to decide which two clusters to merge. Two popular approaches are single-link and complete-link . There seems to be some discrepancy in whether single-link or complete-link is sensitive to outliers. I am stating a few examples below but I am sure that there are many more. (1) Stanford NLP IR book states " [complete-link] causes sensitivity to outliers ". (2) Chapter 8 in the Data Mining book by Tan and Kumar says the following in the section 8.3.2: " The single link technique is good at handling non-elliptical shapes, but is sensitive to noise and outliers. " " Complete link is less susceptible to noise and outliers, but it can break large clusters and it favors globular shapes. " (3) The Applied Multivariate Statistics book says (page 533): "... single link method which is also very sensitive to errors of measurement, but somewhat robust to outliers. The complete link and Wardâ€™s method tend to find compact clusters of nearly equal size with the clustering solution adversely affected by outliers. " To me it intuitive sense that complete-link is more sensitive to outliers a it uses max over the distances between the points in two given clusters which is a non local measure. So the question is which one is the correct view? Or maybe both are correct and are saying different things that I do not understand?
