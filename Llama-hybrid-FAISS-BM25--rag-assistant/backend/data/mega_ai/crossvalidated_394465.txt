Is the Franke-Wolfe algorithm the same as Manifold optimization?

The Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm describes optimization over a constrained domain. In the Manifold Optimization literature (e.g. [1]) a Gradient-Step is done using an exponential map . This maps takes account of both the gradient and the manifold constraint. I thus ask: can the Frank-Wolfe algorithm be seen as an instance of Manifold Optimization?
