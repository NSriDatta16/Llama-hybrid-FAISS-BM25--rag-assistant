There are two papers that discuss this topic in great detail, Chen, Haykin, On Different Facets of Regularization Theory Girosi et Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures The answer is yes, you can rigorously derive it within the framework of Tikhonov regularization. The link between the regularizer and the gaussians in the Green function that results from minimizing $H[h]$. This is derived in the appendix of the second reference . In case you are not very familiar with the functional derivative, check it in this book . It has, IMHO, one of the most accessible introduction to the topic.
