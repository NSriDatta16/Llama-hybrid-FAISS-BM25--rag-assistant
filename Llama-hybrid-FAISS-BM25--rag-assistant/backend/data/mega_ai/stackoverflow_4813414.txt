Webservice administrator gave me WSDL, two certificates and a private key If you only consume the service the private key is not required. I can guess you want 2-way authentication with https. If this is the case here is how it works: On the server the admin should install the cert with a private key to enable SSL (the key is used during SSL handshake). Its public key is used by your client to check if the cert is valid and to authenticate the service, so on the client side you somehow need to check it. If both machines are in Windows domain this is easy (it can be configured to use domain Certification Authority). If not, you need all the certs that were used to sign the original server cert to be installed on the client machine (in Trusted Root CA storage). The second part is client authentication to the server. You install the client cert (it contains public key) to Personal storage and configure WCF proxy to use it: Configure you endpoint to use this behavior. A few notes: client-CN is a name the client cert is generated for (not so important) server-CN is a name the server cert is generated for (usually the server DNS name) This is very complex topic and always require lot of time to research.
