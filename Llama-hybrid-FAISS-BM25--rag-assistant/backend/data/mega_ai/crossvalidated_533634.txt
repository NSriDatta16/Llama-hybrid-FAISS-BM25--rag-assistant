Summarise results of multiple posteriors on simulated data

For a Bayesian model $M(\theta_1, \theta_2)$ I simulated 100 datasets with fixed $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ and then ran posterior sampling on each dataset using model $M(\theta_1, \theta_2)$ . Now, my question is, what is the best way to present results for this experiment? My idea would be to report for both parameters the average posterior mean, 2.5% and 97.5% credible intervals extremes accross simulations and compare them with the true values, would this be a valid way of representing the experiment? Thanks
