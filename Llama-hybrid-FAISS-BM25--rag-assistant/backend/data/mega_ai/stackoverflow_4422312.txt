JQuery: Transferring Behaviors to Cloned Objects

I'm trying to quickly make copies of a class by binding the clone() method to the doubleclick event. My code, so far is: .draggable { float:left; clear: both; } $(function() { copyit = function() { $(this).clone().appendTo("body").css('position','absolute').draggable(); } $('.draggable').dblclick(copyit); $('.draggable').draggable(); }); Hi There! What's up? Everything works, except I can't get the cloned elements to clone themselves once they are added to the DOM. Any help is greatly appreciated.
