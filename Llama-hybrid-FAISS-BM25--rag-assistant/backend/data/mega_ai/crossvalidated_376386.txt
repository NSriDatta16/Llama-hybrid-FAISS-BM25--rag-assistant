Complete separation occurs in logistic (and binomial, and Poisson) regression when some categories contain 100% failures (or zero counts) or (in the logistic/binomial cases) 100% successes. In this case, the 'true' estimates are infinite (because logistic regression parameters are estimated on the logit scale, and logit(0) $\to -\infty$ while logit(1) $\to \infty$ ). Logistic regression typically leads to extreme (but not infinite) values of the parameter estimates, e.g. $|\hat \beta| > 8$ . Worse, the usual Wald standard errors also tend to be very large, because the approximation of a quadratic log-likelihood surface that the Wald SEs depend on is very bad. There's more explanation of complete separation here . A reasonable solution is Firth or bias-reduced logistic regression, implemented in R's brglm2 package as follows: ## install.packages("brglm2") library(brglm2) m1
