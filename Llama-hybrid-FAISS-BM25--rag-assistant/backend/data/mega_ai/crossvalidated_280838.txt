Do input features need to be in a distribution?

I am currently starting my machine learning project on binary classification and I have been taught that input data features should be in a distribution (although the distribution type itself need not to be determined), which arises questions to me Is it true? If it is true, why does the input features have to be in a distribution (The most important one): If it is true, how can I determine if an input feature is in a distribution or not, are there any ways or algorithm to determine this? Thank you
