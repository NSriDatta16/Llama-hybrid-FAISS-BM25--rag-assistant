Yes, you can use count data. However, from your brief description, it sounds as though your independent variables may be differently distributed (perhaps a case of zero-inflation, where the counts follow a distribution, but there are extra zeros in the overall distribution). In my experience, one way to address this is to introduce a grouping variable into your model. The new variable is ZERO which is 1 if the count variable (let's call it X) is zero and 0 otherwise. Then, you can run the model using both ZERO and X as predictors. Essentially, you end up with two predictor equations in one: if ZERO = 1, it gives the average prediction for a zero count; if ZERO = 0, it gives the average prediction based on the actual count values. Hope this helps.
