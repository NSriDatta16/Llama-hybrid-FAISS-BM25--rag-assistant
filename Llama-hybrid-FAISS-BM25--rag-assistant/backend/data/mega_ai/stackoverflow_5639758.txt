After looking in the Magento's code and reading the wiki, I was able to complete it, my new attribute was saved in the address edit form in the profile, but was not saved when I enter it in the checkout form, that was because I need to override some Magento core files, the first step was adding the new attribute to app\code\core\Mage\Customer\etc\config.xml , I copied to app\code\core\Mycompany\Customer\etc\config.xml , as my new attribute code is rfc , I located the entry and .... 1 1 now I need to add the new attribute to the app\code\core\Mage\Customer\Model\Entity\Setup.php i did the same to override, copied to my local namespace, and in the function getDefaultEntities() i locate the 'customer_address'=>array( .... 'rfc' => array( 'label' => 'RFC', 'required' => false, 'sort_order' => 135, ), ) now, I need to do also the same in app\code\core\Mage\Sales\etc\config.xml , but now should look like this ..... * ...... * ........ * * ......... * ....... * Hope it can help someone else
