Pinch Zoom in webview [Android]

On my website, which is loaded in the webview, there is a map. There are also java scripts that detects double tap for zoom, dragging etc. But is it possible to have a javascript that detects the use of pinch zoom ? there are several examples of it working on an iphone, and on my website there is a script for the pinch zoom but it is only working on iphone..... Is it possible to get it to work on Android ? Thanks
