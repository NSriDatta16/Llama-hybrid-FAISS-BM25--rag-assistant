ages ago there was discussion of this idea on comp.text.tex, and the general conclusion was you can't do it satisfactorily. satisfactory, in my book, involves not making characters active, but i can't see how that could work at all. personally, i would want to make space active, and have it then look at \spacefactor and \MakeUppercase the following character if the factor is 3000. something like \catcode\ \active % latex already has a saved space character -- \space \def {\ifhmode% \spacefactor is invalid % (or something) in vertical mode \ifnum\spacefactor this doesn't really do the job -- there are enough loose ends to knit a fairisle jumper. for example, given that we can't rely on \everypar in latex, how do you uppercase the first letter of a paragraph? no ... however much it hurts (which is why i avoid unnecessary key operations) we need to type latex "properly" :-(
