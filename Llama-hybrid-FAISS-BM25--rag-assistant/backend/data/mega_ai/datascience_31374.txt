Using z-score for neural network normalization

I've read many people use z-score to normalize their data for presenting to a neural net, and that all data should lie in a range (usually -1 to 1), but z-score can return results beyond those bounds. So, I guess I'm right in saying the feature data then needs to be scaled (using min-max?), after calculating z-score?
