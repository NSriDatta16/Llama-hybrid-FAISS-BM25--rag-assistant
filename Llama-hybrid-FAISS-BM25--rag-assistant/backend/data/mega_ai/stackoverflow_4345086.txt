c# namespaces for SQL management, used for sql server backup

I am trying to pragmatically run a backup of an SQL Server database using C# .NET 3.5/4.0. I have found out how to accomplish this, however I can't seem to find the namespace libraries that are used for the backup. I am looking for the Microsoft.SqlServer.Management libraries, I just can't find these anywhere. I have installed SQL Server 2005 Enterprise and all of the tools samples and the libraries still don't seem to appear in visual studio (version 2010) Any input is appreciated, thanks.
