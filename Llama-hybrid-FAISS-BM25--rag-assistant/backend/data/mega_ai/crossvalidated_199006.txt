I appreciate your replies. I realize that I have not been explaining the paradox, but instead simply applying different logic to the problem to come to the correct solution, despite me specifically trying to avoid just that. The paradox arises in part due to thinking about how much is won or lost, and not focusing on the actual goal of winning or losing, regardless of the amount. The goal is to develop a strategy to win more money than you lose. Winning more money than is lost is the strategy’s only goal. The amount of money won is irrelevant. Single trial: In any single trial with only 2 envelopes, the odds of winning are 50%. The strategy of trading every time doesn’t improve those odds. The fact that more is won than lost on average by repeatedly choosing the same amount doesn’t change the odds of winning a single trial. Multiple trials: In a multiple trial game, each individual trial is won 50% of the time. However, if the player trades every time, the player will lose 100% of the time that she chooses the largest amount in that game. On average, that and other losses will exactly equal the amounts won if she trades every time. That’s why the strategy of trading every time doesn’t increase the chances of winning. Consider a game with only one trial of 2 envelopes. The odds of winning and losing are both 50%. Trading doesn’t increase the chance of winning for any single set of envelopes. It doesn’t matter how much is won or lost for a single set of envelopes because there aren’t more trials (in a single trial game) to either win back or lose whatever is lost or won in that trial. There is only that one trial. You either win or lose, 50-50. Of course, she will say, “but if I lose this time, maybe I’ll win the money back in further trials with my strategy.” Let’s do some more trials and see what happens. Suppose the envelopes in the second trial contain higher amounts than in the first trial. Then, for both of the trials combined, all that matters is what happens in the second trial because the amounts are bigger. But for that second trial, regardless of whether or not she trades, the odds of winning are once again 50-50. That means that the overall odds of winning are also 50-50. Her strategy doesn’t work. Suppose the envelopes in the second trial contain the same amounts as in the first trial. On average, she’ll chose the other amount that she didn’t choose in the first trial and will either win or lose depending on whether or not she lost or won, respectively, in the first trial. Therefore, on average, she’ll exactly break even on those 2 trials. Her strategy doesn’t work. Suppose the envelopes in the second trial contain smaller amounts than in the first trial. Then they don’t matter to the overall winning or losing. Only the first trial matters, and the odds of winning on the first trial are still 50-50. The strategy still doesn’t increase the chance of winning. This logic continues for any number of envelopes. The logic that leads to the paradox goes awry in two places. First is in understanding that the amount won or lost in a single trial is irrelevant to the odds of winning or losing that trial. It seems liking winning more is better than losing less, but for a single trial, it isn’t. We either win or lose, and that’s it. 50-50. Second, the prospect of winning more in future identical trials than we lost in the first trial entices us into thinking about a game in which the same amount is repeatedly drawn, and then generalizing the outcome of that repeated event to include any number drawn. While a game in which the same number is repeatedly drawn seems intuitively possible, it rarely happens on average. Consequently, generalizing that (rare) result leads to an incorrect conclusion that spawns the paradox.
