Well, one way in which your code seems inelegant is that there is a lot of very similar sequences, specifically: if rmv2 == "3": if rmv Where the only thing that varies is what the input was, what stat gets modified, and whether you are adding or removing a value. You could make your code look a little nicer if you found a way to turn that into a reusable component, like with a function.
