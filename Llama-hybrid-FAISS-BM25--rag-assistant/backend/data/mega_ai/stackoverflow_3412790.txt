Handling touches

I have a UIView subclass with several subviews and I want to handle these events in the class: touchesBegan:withEvent: touchesMoved:withEvent: touchesEnded:withEvent: but I also want these event to be called at the subviews. How can I accomplish that? (I have already tried with hitTest, but I only get the touchesBegan event and no touches are send with the method)
