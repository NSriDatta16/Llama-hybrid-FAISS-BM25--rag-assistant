I am thinking of my data as having the individual at L2 and the statements (repeated measures/observations) at L1. I don't see how statements are nested within individuals because each statement occurs within every individual. Observations are repeated/nested/clustered within individuals, so observations on the same individual will be more alike one another than observations on another individual and hence not independent, and that's why we use a random intercept for ID . But observations are also nested within statements, that is, each observation "belongs" to a particular statement (as well as to an individual), and this creates further dependence among the observations for that statement, because observations on the same statement will be more similar to one another than those on another statement and hence the random intercept for statement . Statements are not nested within individuals because each statement does not "belong" to any one individual. So this is a 2-level model with crossed random effects (cross-classified) To make this clearer, contrast your setup with a 3-level model, where repeated observations (L1) are made on pupils (L2) in schools (L3). Observations are nested within pupils and pupils are nested with schools. Each observation "belongs" to one pupil, and each pupil "belongs" to one school You could model this as a (generalized) linear mixed model. Due to the nature of your outcome variable (7 point likert item) you should ideally fit a model that allows an ordinal outcome as well as crossed random effects, such as MCMCglmm or clmm in the ordinal package. With clmm this would look something like: clmm(credibility ~ writing_style + logic + (1|ID) + (1|statement), data=mydata)
