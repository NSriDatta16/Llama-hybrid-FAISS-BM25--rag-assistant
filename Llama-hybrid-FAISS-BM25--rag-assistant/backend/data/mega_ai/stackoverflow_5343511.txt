I see what you're doing here, but I wouldn't bother with hashes and such, where you have the risk of collisions (microscopic chances, granted). I would recommend doing the following: 1. Take the user's ID from the database (which will obviously be unique) 2. base_convert it to base 36. (See: http://php.net/manual/en/function.base-convert.php) 3. Use the resultant string as your URL The result will be a very small string that is guaranteed to be unique and collision-proof. From what I understand, URL shortening services like TinyURL and others use this mechanism to generate their URLs. I actually learned that on this site, but can't find the link to that other thread anymore. Many thanks to the original author smarter than myself who brought this to my attention! I hope that's helpful.
