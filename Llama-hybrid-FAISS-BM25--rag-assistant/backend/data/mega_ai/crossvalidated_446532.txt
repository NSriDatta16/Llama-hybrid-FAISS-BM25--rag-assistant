Some Machine Learning techniques are based on p values, e.g., ANOVA feature selection. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html f_classif (ANOVA) returns a p-value for each feature. As Tim writes the p-value is used for hypothesis testing. ANOVA tests whether means of two or more samples are equal. A low p-value shows that at least 2 samples have different means which is a good indicator for a feature. Usually values below 0.1 or 0.05 or 0.01 mean that this feature could be used. You could use for example SelectKBest ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html ) to take the first 10 features with the lowest p-values.
