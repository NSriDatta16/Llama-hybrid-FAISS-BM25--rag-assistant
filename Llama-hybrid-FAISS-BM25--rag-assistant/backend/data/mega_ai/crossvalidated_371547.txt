You could define a prior distribution on the hyperparameters and add the log-prior to the log-likelihood to obtain the log-posterior up to a constant. You could then maximise the log-posterior just as you'd maximise the log-likelihood to obtain a MAP solution, or you could use MCMC methods to obtain samples from this log-posterior - you'd then have samples from the joint sampling distributions of the hyperparameters. You'd then perhaps use the evidence (marginal likelihood) to compare different models/kernels, or if you're trying to fit more complex models, you could obtain lower bound approximations for the evidence and fine-tune parameters or model structures so that these lower bounds are maximised. Is this roughly what you were looking for?
