Error handling in SSIS is a bit awkward, I've had problems with packages following OnError constraints correctly and completing fine, but the SQL Agent still reports failure. My solution was: define OnError event handlers for the steps that are 'allowed' to fail, and then set the Propagate system variable to false. If you have too many individual steps to make that practical, you can group them in sequence containers and create the event handlers for each sequence instead. It seems to work fine for me, but it took me some time to work out the solution and I couldn't find any good documentation on error handling in SSIS so I don't know if this is a good solution or just a hack.
