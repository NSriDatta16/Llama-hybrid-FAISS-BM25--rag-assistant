Viewing Code Coverage Results outside of Visual studio

I've got some unit tests, and got some code coverage data. Now, I'd like to be able to view that code coverage data outside of visual studio, say in a web browser. But, when I export the code coverage to an xml file, I can't do anything with it. Are there readers out there for this? Do I have to write an xml parser and then display it how I want it (seems like a waste since visual studio already does this.) Seems kinda silly to have to take a screenshot of my code coverage results as my "report" Suggestions?
