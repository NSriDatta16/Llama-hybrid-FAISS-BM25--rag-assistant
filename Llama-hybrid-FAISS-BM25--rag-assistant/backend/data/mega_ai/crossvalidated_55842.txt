You could use resampling and order statistics. From your dataset of 100 points, select say, 100000 samples of size 100 with replacement. Find the average class size in each case. Order the averages from smallest to largest. Remove the bottom 2500 (2.5%) and top 2500 (2.5%). Now your 95% confidence interval is the range from the lowest remaining average to the highest remaining average. If you need a quick back-of-the-envelope answer just order your 100 data points and remove the bottom 2 points and top 2. That should give you a rough 96% confidence interval. You should also consider using a one-sided interval since you have a hard constraint on the upper end.
