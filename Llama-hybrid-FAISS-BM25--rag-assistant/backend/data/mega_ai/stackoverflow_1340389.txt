I am using SQL Query and below are the tables. Organization OrgID Name RAOGID RAOID SubGroupID StatusID 1 Org RAOG1 1 NULL NULL 2 2 Org RAO1 NULL 1 NULL 3 3 Org Sub Group1 NULL NULL 1 1 4 Org RAOG2 2 NULL NULL 2 5 Org RAO2 NULL 2 NULL 3 6 Org Sub Group2 NULL NULL 2 2 RAOG RAOGID AccredID 1 2 2 2 3 2 RAO RAOID RAOGID 1 1 2 3 3 3 Sub Group SubGroupID RAOID 1 1 2 2 3 2 I have four tables as shown above, here is details of them, 1) Every RAOG, RAO and SUBGROUP are a organisation 2) RAOG can have many RAOs 3) RAO can have many SubGroups I want to update my organisation table statusid, before updating I want to check if it is the RAOG type of oraganisation then it will update all the RAOs and SUBGROUPs under it and same with RAO it will update all the SUBGROUP under him it will not update it parent RAOG.And at last if it SUBGROUP type of organisation it will only update the subgroup not its parent records.
