This sounds to me like a shameless plug for the PLinqO product. I hope this is not your intent. I looked at PLinqO and perhaps would have got it except you had to purchase CodeSmith to get it. No thanks. I have built a full featured 3-tier platform using L2S, and I encountered and dealt with issues related to M:M relationships, detached entities (especially with updates), context handling etc. without the use of PLinqO and any other 3rd party tool. It can be done, once you understand how L2S works. I think our solution is pretty elegant and our performance is quite good. For those reading this, if you want to spend money on third party tools, invest in LinqPad and Linqer. You can pick up both of these tools for less than $75 total; they are fantastic. And I'm not associated with either of them. Randy
