There are many, many ways to copy web sites, and few ways to reliably and efficiently stop it. You could look into the server access logs to see whether there are any obvious bots crawling the site. Possible patterns: Very quick successions of page requests (A human being will take at least several seconds to read a page, and click on a link, while a bot can fire dozens of requests per second) unusual USER_AGENT string; comes back exactly every x hours, or at the exactly same time every day and block those IP addresses (See here how to do it in Apache; here in PHP). But this will be relatively easy for the offender to circumvent. The best way to stop this is to get a lawyer. This is pretty certainly illegal.
