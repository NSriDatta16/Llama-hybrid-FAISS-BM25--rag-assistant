I would recommend against rewriting as ADP (you do realize, I hope, that you can't convert an MDB to ADP?). ADP has been deprecated by MS for about the last 5 years, and has received no development attention in the last two versions of Access (A2007 and A2010). It may get some attention in the next version of Access, or it may be dropped (as was the case with DAPs after two versions of no changes). The easiest way to roll out multi-site access to an Access application is with Windows Terminal Server. This is extremely easy to implement and not all that expensive and requires no alterations to your Access application (I assume you'd upsize the back end regardless, of course). You also might want to familiarize yourself with the fabulous new features of Access 2010 that integrate with Sharepoint Server 2010 and its new Access Services to allow the development of an Access app that runs almost identically in the Access client and in a web browser (via Sharepoint). This would require a major rewrite, of course, but it's also quite scalable. It's also the future of Access, so far as I can see, and will be getting lots of attention from Microsoft over the next few years.
