Your eventual model will assume the features you give it are the truth, so this will affect your model. (The adage "garbage in garbage out" comes to mind.) However, if enough of the engineering works correctly, the model will only be slightly negatively affected, being driven by the (hopefully) much more common correct engineering. In the end, I think you should think of this as any other source of uncertainty: balance the accuracy needs from your final model against the cost of developing better feature engineering.
