You do not need the project files in order to debug files. You should read about remote debugging . Update: What you want to do sounds very dangerous in a production environment. If you want to develop, develop locally. Regardless - project and solution files are organizational tools in visual studio as well as build files for the MSBuild build tool. If you don't have either visual studio or MSBuild installed on the server, there is little point in having the project and solution files on it. Why do you need to develop on a production machine?
