Structure and Format for Skype history databases

Skype seems to use .db, .db-journal, and .lock files, as well as subdirectories full of .dat files for storing conversation histories.ces Are the formats of these files available anywhere, or is there an open source library for accessing them that I can examine and possibly modify? I think several libraries allow the retrieval of conversation history, but I would like to also achieve insertion of conversation history records.
