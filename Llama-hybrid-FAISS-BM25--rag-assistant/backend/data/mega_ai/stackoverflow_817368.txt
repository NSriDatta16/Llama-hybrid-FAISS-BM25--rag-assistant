Is there an automated procedure to upload mails from Outlook/Outlook Express to Exchange 2007?

I'm moving an organization from pop3 accounts to Microsoft Exchange 2007, and I have to upload all the users mails (which are in, mostly, Outlook Express and a few Outlook) to their Exchange accounts. Anybody knows an automated or semi-automated procedure to upload all the mails and address books from Outlook Express and from a .pst file without having to configure the account in Outlook?
