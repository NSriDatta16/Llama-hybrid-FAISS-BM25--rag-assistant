GARCH estimation for subsamples

I would like to apply a GARCH(1,1) model for subsamples at time intervals length $k\delta$ on a stock return time series $\big(r(i\delta,(i+1)\delta)\big)_{i=0}^{kq-1}$ each element of which is the return between time $i\delta$ and $(i+1)\delta$ . I take the recursion formula to be $$h(t,t+k\delta) = c+a\,u(t-k\delta,t)^2 +b\,h(t-k\delta,t) \tag1$$ where $h(t-k\delta,t)$ is the estimated variance for the and $r(t-k\delta,t)$ is the return for time interval $(t-k\delta,t)$ . Suppose the prices are observed at shorter time intervals of length $\delta$ . I would like to use them for Equation (1). Is it correct to use the following expression? $$u(t-k\delta,t)^2 := \sum_{i=1}^k r\big(t-i\delta,t-(i-1)\delta\big)^2 \tag2$$ If so, when I use the maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters $(a,b,c)$ , is it legitimate to apply it on the returns $r(t-k\delta,t)$ . Note that $r(t-k\delta,t)^2\neq u(t-k\delta,t)^2$ . $\big(u(jk\delta,(j+1)k\delta)\big)_{j=0}^{q-1}$ forms a new time series. Its Gaussian negative logarithmic likelihood $$l(a,b,c):=\sum_{j=0}^{q-1} \bigg( \frac{u(jk\delta,(j+1)k\delta)^2}{h(jk\delta,(j+1)k\delta)}+\ln h(jk\delta,(j+1)k\delta)\bigg).$$ Equivalently, we can substitute $u$ as the magnitude of the return into a canonical GARCH estimator to obtain the parameters $(a,b,c)$ .
