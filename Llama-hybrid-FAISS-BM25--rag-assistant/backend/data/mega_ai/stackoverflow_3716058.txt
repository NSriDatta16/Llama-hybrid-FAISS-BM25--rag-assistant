Rails: allow free text sql filter and still avoid sql injection

I have a requirement where a screen allows and end user to create a filter that is basically any valid sql fragment. For reasons beyond my control this is what is needed so I need to work within this boundary. This sql fragment gets appended to a where clause in a sql statement.Currently to avoid anything to nasty going on the login that runs the sql is limited to select operations on the required tables. Is there any way in Rails (2.3) that I can mitigate any risk of sql injection attacks but still allow free text input so very complex filter criteria can be specified? Cheers
