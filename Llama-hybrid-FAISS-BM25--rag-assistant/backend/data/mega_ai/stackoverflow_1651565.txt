If all the other solutions turn out to be unusable (and I would encourage you to find a better way than requiring the entire file to fit in memory!) you could consider using a direct ByteBuffer. It has the option of using mmap() or other system calls to map a file into your memory without actually reading / allocating space in the heap. You can do this by calling map() on a FileChannel -- API documentation . Note that this is potentially expensive and/or not supported on some platforms, so it should be considered suboptimal compared to any solution which does not require the entire file to be in memory.
