Sambridge et al. (2010) outline a method for assessing the conformance of time series data to Benford's law. Although your use case is a bit different, it may work for you too. Their method works as you basically describe: group your data into observation windows and test each window for conformance. This method has been used (and published) by the same authors in other articles, so it's at least sound enough to pass peer review a few times. Although they have their own goodness of fit measure, I don't see any reason why you couldn't use any measure that would typically work for benford's analysis. You will want to be sure that your measure has good properties for the window or sample size you selected.
