Moving Silverlight 2 popup windows

We are using popup windows in a Silverlight 2 application; these can be moved in the standard way by clicking on the title bar and dragging. If the title bar is dragged out of site behind the browser chrome, the window can no longer be moved. We have users that consider this problematic and I was wondering if there might be some other way to allow the window to be moved when they have got it stuck behind the chrome. Or perhaps a way to prevent any part of the popup from going out of the window would be better.
