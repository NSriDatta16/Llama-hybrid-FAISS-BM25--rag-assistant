Is machine learning the right tool for this job?

I would like to create a troubleshooting wizard. The user will go through the wizard and choose different options, what options they choose will determine what is displayed next in the wizard. Eventually the user will solve their problem (or not), at the end they will choose 'yes' or 'no' if there problem was solved. The wizard would learn what most common resolutions to a problem was based on past input. Before I go exploring machine learning further, does this sound like the right tool for the job?
