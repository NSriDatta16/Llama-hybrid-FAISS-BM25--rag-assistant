Absolutely none, IMHO. I use a js framework that I wrote to handle the setting of whatever server-side variables I need to have access to. It is essentially the same as embedding PHP in JavaScript, but much less ambiguous. Using this method allows you to also completely separate server-side logic and html away from javascript. This results in much cleaner, more organized and lowly-coupled modular code. You could do something like this in your html: registry = { myString : ' ', myInt : } And then do something like this in your js: if (registry.myInt === 1) { alert(registry.myString); }
