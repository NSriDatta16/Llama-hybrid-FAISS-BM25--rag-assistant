How to parllelize this, using OPENMP sections

I have this function which i want to parallelize using openmp sections. I broke the function into various sections and applied #pragma omp sections but it gives segmentation fault. Can somebody please explain why and a solution to it. Should i use some clause with sections. Which one and how please. /*! *********************************************************************** * \brief * calculation of SAD for larger blocks on the basis of 4x4 blocks // function 4 *********************************************************************** */ void SetupLargerBlocks (int list, int refindex, int max_pos) { #define ADD_UP_BLOCKS() _o=*_bo; _i=*_bi; _j=*_bj; for(pos=0;pos
