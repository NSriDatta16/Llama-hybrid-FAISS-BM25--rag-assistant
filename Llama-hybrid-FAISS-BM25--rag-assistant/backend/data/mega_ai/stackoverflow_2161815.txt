R zoo series sliding window calculation

Given I have a zoo dataset, I'd like to perform a sliding operation against it with the result being another zoo dataset. > x Y (09/24/09 08:00:13) 3.1 (09/24/09 08:05:13) 4.2 (09/24/09 08:10:13) 4.5 (09/24/09 08:15:13) 9.4 (09/24/09 08:20:13) 9.8 (09/24/09 08:25:13) 7.7 (09/24/09 08:30:13) 13.3 (09/24/09 08:35:13) 6.5 (09/24/09 08:40:13) 14.7 (09/24/09 08:45:13) 23.5 (09/24/09 08:50:13) 20.9 (09/24/09 08:55:13) 8.5 My goal is to produce a "smooth" average by iterating through each time interval and obtaining the mean for the set of Y points that are +/- 15 minutes of the current point. I have a bucketing method of averaging working, but it reduces the resolution of the data. I haven't worked out how to make relative subsets out of zoo with artibrary math, window should help but accessing the index is being difficult. Thanks.
