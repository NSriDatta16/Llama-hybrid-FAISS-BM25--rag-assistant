The basic idea is that the new pixels of the image are created by an weighted average of the pixels close to it (imagine drawing a circle around the pixel). For each pixel in the image you are going to create a little square around the pixel. Lets say you take the 8 neighbors next to a pixel (including diagonals even though do not matter here), and we perform a weighted average to get the middle pixel. In the Gaussian blur case it breaks down to two one dimensional operations. For each pixel take the some amount of pixels next to a pixel in the row direction only. Multiply the pixel values time the weights computed from the Gaussian distribution (or if you are doing this for an visual effect and not for a scientific reason, the weights can anything that looks good) and sum them up. Another way to look at it is the pixel make a vector and the weights make a vector and your are taking the dot product. Repeat this process in the column direction as a separate pass.
