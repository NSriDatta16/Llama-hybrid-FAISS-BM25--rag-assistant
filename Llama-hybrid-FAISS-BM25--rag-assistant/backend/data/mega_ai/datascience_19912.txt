I'm not a business analyst so I guess you'll have to take what I have to say with a pinch of salt. From my understanding, Business Analysts responsibilities are focused around improving processes within a company, for example how certain technologies could be implemented to improve a workflow, they are expected to understand how these technologies might improve the workflow, or a product etc, and manage these improvement projects. This seems to differ from Data Science on an abstract level in that it is exploring known unknowns ("can our process be improved? what technologies/methods exist that could improve it?"), whereas Data Science is great for exploring unknown unknowns. For example, why is this better for our workflow/product specifically? Data Science is great at throwing up results you don't expect, which is one reason why it is so valuable. I may be wrong in saying this, but Business Analysis seems to be relatively free-form depending on the company and the needs, whereas Data Science has a less subjective methodology. With this in mind, perhaps Data Scientists could be used to better inform your Business Analysts decisions? But the other way around, BAs could perhaps be used to better inform Data Scientists of business processes, or maybe your BA could focus on improving processes to make life easier for your Data Scientists such as data pipelines in a non-automated environment (example: how can we gather more useful data from our vehicle showrooms? What technologies do the DSs need and how can we implement them?).
