Standard 12.4/14 Once a destructor is invoked for an object, the object no longer exists; the behavior is undefined if the destructor is invoked for an object whose lifetime has ended (3.8). I think this section refers to invoking the destructor via delete. In other words: The gist of this paragraph is that "deleting an object twice is undefined behavior". So that's why your code example works fine. Nevertheless, this question is rather academic. Destructors are meant to be invoked via delete (apart from the exception of objects allocated via placement-new as sharptooth correctly observed). If you want to share code between a destructor and second function, simply extract the code to a separate function and call that from your destructor.
