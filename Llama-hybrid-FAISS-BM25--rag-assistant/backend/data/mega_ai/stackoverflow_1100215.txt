Where is a commercially usable dataset of temperature by zipcode by month?

Lots of web sites offer this data (see http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q= "average+temperature"+by+zip+code) but I don't see the dataset they are using. I looked at the national weather service for a bit (see for example http://www.rdc.noaa.gov/~foia/index.html#electronic ), and didn't see it. NWS is in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA links: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/climatedata.html#monthly http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/cag3/explain.html . It looks so close, but I still haven't found it.
