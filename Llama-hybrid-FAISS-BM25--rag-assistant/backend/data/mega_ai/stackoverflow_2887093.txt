Reporting system for organization. Architecture advise required

We have several legacy & 3'd-party systems in organization that use several RDBMS vendors (& more specific data storages). Cross-system data reporting (as well as extra-reports that are not implemented in 3'd-party systems) is required with charts and population of templates (winword, excel). Reporting system is visioned as intranet web-site with custom user access to reports. We expect ~50 reports per day. Would you suggest to use BizTalk or any other integration software if commercial-department doesn't plan to buy anything expensive. Would you suggest to create centralized data storage for reporting that is populated regularly or rely on on-demand services that provides always up-to-request data. Centralized data storage will bring the ability to use standard tools such as MSSQL Reporting Services but templated reports would be custom coded with light-weight solution (as I suspect) Thank you in advance!
