How can I model a binary outcome with four-level predictors?

I have 63,419 level-1 observations and 329 level-2, 138 level-3 and 21 level-4 clusters. Thus, 1) I have an average of only 2.4 level-3 clusters for each level-2 one, and of 6.6 level-4 clusters for each level-3 one. Also, I have only 21 highest-level clusters. 2) This also implies that my clusters are not balanced. I see an obvious problem of statistical power with such small numbers. Here: ( pdf ) it is found that at least 100 clusters, with a size of at least 50 are required to have unbiased (or only slightly biased) parameter estimates. I see that, in general, such calculations for adequate sample-size relate to 2-level models: I don't know whether they also apply to higher-level models, or things could be worse for them. In any case, it is clear that, with my data, I have a problem. 3) I also have predictors at all levels (5 at level-1, 2 at level-2, 4 at level-3, 4 at level-4) so I can't turn to a fixed-effect model. 4) Moreover, I wonder whether the fact that I'm using a population, so groups are not selected at random (but all included): ( pdf ) makes a random-effect model unfit in my case. 5) I have also thought about simplifying my model to a one with clustered standard errors (CSEs), however I found: ( pdf ) that the suggestion (and also typical software implementation) is to only allow for highest-level CSEs, that I find very counter-intuitive because I couldn't control for level-2 and level-3 clustering. How can I build a sensible model without ignoring same-cluster correlation and testing for the effect of (at least some) contextual variables?
