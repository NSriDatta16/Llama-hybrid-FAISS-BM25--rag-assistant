Because it then allows you to use the relationship between the latent variable and the observed variable to determine the variance of the latent variable. For example, consider the regression of Y on X. If I am allowed to change the variance of X, say, by multiplying it by a constant, then I can change the regression coefficient arbitrarily. If instead I fix the value of the regression coefficient, then this determines the variance of X. By convention, and to make it easier to compare the coefficients to each other. In that case, the latent variable simply becomes reversed. For example, suppose our latent variable is math ability, our observed variable is the number of errors on a test, and we fix the regression coefficient to 1. Then our latent variable will become "difficulty with math" instead of math ability, and the coefficients for any other observed variables will change accordingly. If the observed variable and the latent variable are both standardized (i.e., standard deviation equal to 1), then the regression coefficient is equal to the covariance. It is fixing spatial -> visperc to 1 that permits estimation of the variance of spatial (see answer to (1) above). Likewise, fixing verbal -> paragrap permits estimation of the variance of verbal. A model with only one of these constraints would not be identifiable. Because the differences between the unstandardized and standardized coefficients depend not only on the variance of verbal, but also on the variances of paragrap, sentence and wordmean. For example, the standardized coefficient for wordmean equals the unstandardized coefficient multiplied by $\frac{SD_{verbal}}{SD_{wordmean}}$, or $2.234 \times \frac{\sqrt{9.682}}{\sqrt{(2.234^2 \times 9.682) + 19.925}} = 0.841$. Finally, note that err_v is analogous to the error term in a regression model, e.g., $$visperc = \beta_0 + \beta_1 spatial + err\_v$$ We fix the coefficient on err_v (i.e., on the error term) to 1 so that we can estimate the error variance (i.e., the variance of err_v).
