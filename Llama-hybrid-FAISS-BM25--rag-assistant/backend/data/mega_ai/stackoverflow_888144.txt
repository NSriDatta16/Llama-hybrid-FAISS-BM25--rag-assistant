NCover on 64 bit - CorFlags fix - corflags : error CF008 : The specified file does not have a valid managed header

I'm trying to apply a fix to allow NCover v1.5.5 to run on Windows Server 2008 X64 via my TeamCity Continuous Integration server as outlined on this blog: http://abdullin.com/journal/2008/6/6/how-to-run-free-ncover-on-a-64-bit-machine.html Here is my log: [09:47:04]: run-unit-tests: [09:47:04]: [echo] Running NCover: tools\ncover\NCover.Console.exe with workingdir='build\Debug\UnitTests' [09:47:04]: [exec] NCover.Console v1.5.5 - Code Coverage Analysis for .NET - http://ncover.org [09:47:04]: [exec] Copyright (c) 2004-2005 Peter Waldschmidt [09:47:04]: [exec] [09:47:04]: [exec] [09:47:04]: [exec] Command: ..\..\..\tools\nunit\nunit-console.exe [09:47:04]: [exec] Command Args: "UnitTests.dll" "/xml:..\..\test-reports\UnitTests.xml" "/nologo" [09:47:04]: [exec] Working Directory: .
