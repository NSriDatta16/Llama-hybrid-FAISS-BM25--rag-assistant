Pattern recognition is a basic example when neural networks are studied. I don't know if is any library/framework to work with AI in C#. If you find one, first you have to do is to train the network (supervised learning) and for this you need to prepare a big sample set of images; more examples -> result more accurate. In the other hand you can use OpenCV (C/C++, Python and Java) that is a library specialized in computer vision and has a module to implement AI methods. Have a nice day! Oscar.
