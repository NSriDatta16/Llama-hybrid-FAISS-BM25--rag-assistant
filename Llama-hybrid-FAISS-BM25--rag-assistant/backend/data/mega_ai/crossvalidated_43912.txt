Thanks to @TenaliRaman for his answer.I am copying the same. Yes. Such data is called unbalanced/imbalanced data. Usually making the number of points per class equal helps a great deal in getting a better classifier. But then, not necessarily the best classifier. You need to try several things here, 1] Try uniformly randomly choosing 64 points from success class and training your SVM 2] Compute the mean of the failure class and choose 64 points from success class which are closest to the failure mean 3] If you are using libSVM, use the entire dataset and provide class weights proportional to the imbalance that you observe If you check the options of libSVM you will see the -wi option. In your case, (5544 - 64)/64 = 85.625. So, if your label for failure is 0 and success is 1, then you can add the option -w0 85.625 to your libSVM command
