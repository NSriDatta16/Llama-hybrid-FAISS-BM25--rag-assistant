What you want to do is to disable a column on the first datagrid and enable it on the second. You have to listen to DRAG_START events, find what field is the target column, and hide it on the first datagrid when the drag succeeds. Then you use a symetrical approach for the second datagrid... I guess you will have to create a custom drag proxy visual component if you want it to be visually coherent. Good luck =)
