How to build regression model in R for nested data and ordinal dependent variable?

I am looking at how some individual-level psychological variables relate to an organizational-level dependent variable. In this case, the dependent variable is the ranking of the organization (ordinal variable). I understand that I need to use ordinal logistic regression. I came across Râ€™s polr package mentioned here . But I am not sure if polr can account for the nested nature of my data: individuals nested in teams, and teams nested in organizations. Is there a way to model the following: y_ordinal ~ ind_psych1+ ind_psych2 + (1 + team_id/org_id) ? Many thanks!
