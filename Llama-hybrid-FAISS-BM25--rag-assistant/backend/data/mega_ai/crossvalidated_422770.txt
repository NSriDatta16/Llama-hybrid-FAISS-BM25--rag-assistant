Intuition of the convergence of sample ACF

One of the problems in Brockwell and Davis book about time series is to show that 1) if \begin{equation} x_t = a + b t \end{equation} then the sample autocorrelation ( $\hat{\rho}(h)$ ) converges to 1 as the sample size tends to infinity for $h \geq 1$ . 2) if \begin{equation} x_t = a \text{cos}(\omega t) \end{equation} then the sample autocorrelation ( $\hat{\rho}(h)$ ) converges to $\text{cos}(\omega h)$ as the sample size tends to infinity, where $a \neq 0$ and $\omega \in [-\pi, \pi)$ . I can prove these two results, but what is the message this question is trying to give?
