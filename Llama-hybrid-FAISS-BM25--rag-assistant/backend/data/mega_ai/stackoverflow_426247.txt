jquery behaves strangely in some sites when inserted via bookmarklet

I'm putting together a bookmarklet that inserts jquery into pages it is invoked on. On many pages it works just fine, but on pages like http://www.cnn.com (which includes both prototype and scriptaculous) it behaves a bit strangely. $(blah..).appendTo("body") does not work whereas $(blah..).appendTo(document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]) works $("#id").hide() , .show() and .css() don't work. I've tried changing the variable from $ to jQuery to $k = jQuery.noConflict() but the results are the same. Note: On many web pages it works fine, only on cnn.com and a few others it does not. Has anyone come across this, do you have any pointers??
