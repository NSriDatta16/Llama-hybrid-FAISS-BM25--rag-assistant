The academic research literature has a lot of information on this. What I found more readable and easier to understand is section 8.1.3 from the book "Practical Data science with R" by N.Zumel and J.Mount. From page 186 ff PICKING THE NUMBER OF CLUSTERS There are a number of heuristics and rules-of-thumb for picking clusters; a given heuristic will work better on some datasets than others. It’s best to take advantage of domain knowledge to help set the number of clusters, if that’s possible. Otherwise, try a variety of heuristics, and perhaps a few different values of k . They then discuss the "Total within sum of squares" and the "Calinski-Harabasz index" (with R code) One simple heuristic is to compute the total within sum of squares ( WSS ) for different values of k and look for an “elbow” in the curve. ... The Calinski-Harabasz index of a clustering is the ratio of the between-cluster variance (which is essentially the variance of all the cluster centroids from the dataset’s grand centroid) to the total within-cluster variance... But there are many more methods. CHeck out the (difficult) Coursera Course Cluster Analysis in Data Mining , week 3
