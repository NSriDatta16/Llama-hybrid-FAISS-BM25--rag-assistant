Firefox Addon Storage Security

I was reading the Mozilla Doc about Firefox Addon Storage and it says: Storage is a SQLite database API. It is available to trusted callers, meaning extensions and Firefox components only. Well, it says its available to firefox only, but I managed to acess my Echofon storage by using a simple SQLite Manager for Linux. I found the .sqlite at: /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/pmk9mj59.default/twitterfox_1.9.sqlite The question is: how to protect my .sqlite storage in order to have it safe from external resources.
