If you want to further reduce the code size, minify and gzip or deflate it. Beware that gzipped code needs to be uncompressed before it's executed, thus causing a delay. The jQuery download page offers an already minified and gzipped version. Another option you could look into is using CND hosted jQuery, that is jQuery hosted by third party organizations such as Google or Microsoft. Details in the jQuery download page .
