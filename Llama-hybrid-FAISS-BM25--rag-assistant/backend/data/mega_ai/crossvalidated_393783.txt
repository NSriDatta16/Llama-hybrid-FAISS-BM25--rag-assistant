How to change in y variable having means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficient?

The following statistics have been obtained by using the data of money supply growth rate and inflation rate for the last 30 years. The average money supply growth rate, its standard deviation, average inflation rate, standard deviation of inflation rate and the correlation coefficient between the two variables have been 20%, 4%, 25%, 6% and 0.6 respectively. If the currency authority sets the money supply growth rate of the next year as 15%, what would the inflation rate of the next year be? The answer is 20.5% but I don't understand how they got it. Can someone show me the equation?
