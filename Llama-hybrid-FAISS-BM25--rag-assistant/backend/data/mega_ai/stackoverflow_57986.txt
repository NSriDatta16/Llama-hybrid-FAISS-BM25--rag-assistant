It might be useful to think of HTML controls as an option when you want more control over the mark up that ends up getting emitted by your page. More control in the sense that you want EVERY browser to see exactly the same markup. If you create System.Web.UI.HtmlControls like: Then you know what kind of code is going to be emitted. Even though most of the time: will end up being the same markup. The same markup is not always emitted for all WebControls. Many WebControls have built in adaptive rendering that will render different HTML based on the browser user agent. As an example a DataGrid will look quite different in a mobile browser than it will in a desktop browser. Using WebControls as opposed to HtmlControls also lets you take advantage of ASP.NET v2.0 ControlAdapters which I believe only works with WebControls, this will allow you programatic config driven control over the markup that gets emitted. This might seem more valuable when you consider that certain mobile browsers or WebTVs are going to want WML or completely different sets of markups.
