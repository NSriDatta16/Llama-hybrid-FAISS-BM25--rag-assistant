Your question would be better phrased as "Using conditional comments to exclude content from IE browsers" ;-) Although CCs are most often used to provide additional content for IE, there is a variant that allows you to prevent IE from seeing content. With their usual arrogance, MS chose to call this " downlevel-revealed conditional comments " (because all other browsers are worse than IE in their world). Something like You are not using Internet Explorer. should be all you need. Note that describing this as a "Conditional Comment" is another example of MS's strange use of words to mean exactly what they choose them to mean rather than what everybody else means: the above works because it isn't actually a comment, so all browsers other than IE just assume you made a hideous mistake in your HTML and carry on parsing the content within. This also means it will probably fail badly in XHTML served with the application/xhtml+xml content type, but that's another story.
