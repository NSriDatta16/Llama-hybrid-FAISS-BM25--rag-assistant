Can an applied mathematics degree get you into data science?

I was looking at a statistics course (undergraduate degree), and I thought I probably would find doing only statistics a bit dry, and I thought about if doing an Applied Mathematics major (I am better with applied math than purely statistics, however, I'm still good with stats.), with perhaps a couple more electives in statistics, as opposed to a statistics major. E.g. on top of the applied math course (Real/Complex analysis, ODE's, PDE's, vector analysis, fluid flow, calculus), also do some stochastics courses (statistical analysis, stochastic analysis, SDE's). This way it's a bit more diversified because I feel like I'd do better if I have a bit of both. How relevant would some of the applied math topics be to data science? I may also do some data science electives as well. This is of course on top of knowledge in python, R and SQL.
