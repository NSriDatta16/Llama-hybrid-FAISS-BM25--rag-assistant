How to mix html with gwt widgets?

I try to generate a dynamically gwt ui. As a result I would get a html fragment like this: MyLabel The Label should be a GWT Label and the input should be a GWT TextBox. How can I achieve this with GWT? I've tried to use the HTMLPanel class, but how can I inject the Tags? I can't use UIBinder, since I would like to dynamically create such fragments as shown above.
