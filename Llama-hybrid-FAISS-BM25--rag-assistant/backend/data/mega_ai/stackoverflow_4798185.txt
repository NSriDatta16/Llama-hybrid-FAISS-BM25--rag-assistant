Embedding lua in my C# application : require "luainterface" fails

I downloaded the newest version of LuaInterface from their site, and referenced LuaInterface.dll and Lua51.dll. The interpreter itself works fine, but when I try to require("luainterface"), I get this exception : error loading module 'luainterface' from file '.\luainterface.dll': The specified procedure could not be found. Here's the example code which produces this behavior : static void Main(string[] args) { Lua lua = new Lua(); lua.DoFile("test.lua"); } The test.lua script just has this : luanet = require("luainterface"); Also, I've made sure that LUA_PATH points to where luanet.dll is. What could be the problem?
