The docs for LastWriteTime do note that the value returned may not be accurate. Note the comment about the Refresh method as well - whilst the code above would almost certainly not require this to be called, if you're creating FileInfo objects and holding onto them for any length of time this may be applicable. Windows is at liberty to delay updating the actual last write time for a file - as to how long this may be delayed for, check into the Windows API calls dealing with file information.
