In .NET 1.1 you would need to create a proxy unmanaged DLL (write it in C or Delphi or ... ) and call it's methods, and that unmanaged DLL would do the rest. In .NET 2.0 and later you use Assembly.LoadFile() and further. Not as elegant as just declarations you attempted to use, and requires quite a lot of coding. So I'd suggest a proxy way if possible.
