There are three ways to get around the Same-Origin Policy: Proxy -- as Strawberry Sheurbert did, perfectly effective but a waste of bandwidth and computing power JSONP -- loading the data through the script tag. Needs cooperation from source website and basically hackish and clumsy. CORS -- the "right" way, elegant and nuanced, but needs a lot of cooperation from source website and doesn't work with older browsers. You pays your money and you takes your chance.
