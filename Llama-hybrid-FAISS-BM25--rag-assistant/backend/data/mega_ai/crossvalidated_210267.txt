Can random point process generator generate pattern that is not random?

I am using esri arc to generate random points. I then analyze the pattern from this process using Average Nearest Neighbor which is also in esri gis but lets say it can be in any other software. Is there a chance that it comes as dispersed or clustered or will the random generator make sure it is always random?
