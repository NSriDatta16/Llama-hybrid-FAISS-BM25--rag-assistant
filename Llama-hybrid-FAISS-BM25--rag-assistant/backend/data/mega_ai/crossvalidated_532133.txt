While Bayesian hypergraphs seem very interesting, won't they be even more data-hungry than Bayesian networks?

There is a part of me that is absolutely enthused that someone has developed Bayesian hypergraphs and that it has causal interpretations related to Judea Pearl's work. But with Bayesian networks already being data-hungry in terms learning the correct structure, won't Bayesian hypergraphs be even more so?
