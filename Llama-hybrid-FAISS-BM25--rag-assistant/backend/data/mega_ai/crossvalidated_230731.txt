Identify the difference in two samples using parts of a linear regression model

I've built myself a linear model which has a fairly good predictive rate. I need to use this to explain the difference in customer satisfaction from one month to the other. My intention is to have a waterfall chart showing the impact of environment factors (things that can't be controlled), process factors, and unknowns. The sum of these factors builds the bridge from one time period from the other. What I can't get my head around is how to calculate the difference by the different factors. I'm thinking of it as a price volumne challenge that you might have for explaining change in performance, where you hold one thing the same but I run into challenges. Imagine that I have 2 variables Age (Environment) and AHT (Process), mocked up data below. How would you go about explaining how much of the change in Customer Satisfaction from average of 5.5 in time period 0, to 6 in time 1, is due to age and how much due to AHT. df This model then calculates a Customer Satisfaction score for every line. This then suggests to me that using mean values isn't appropriate. This becomes a further challenge when what I actually need to calculate is NPS (net promotor score) which uses the proportion of the detractors (6 and unders) and the proportion of promotors (9 and 10s) I was thinking could I just replace the values for Age in one time period to another, but these aren't the same customers and what happens if I then have a different number of customers in one period to the other. Maybe this is simple, but I'd appreciate a bit of guidance on splitting out the intepreation of the model. Thanks in advance for your time, James
