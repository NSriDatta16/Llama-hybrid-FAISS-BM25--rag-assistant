Point 2) is incorrect in your first paragraph. A p-value does not tell you that one variable is a good, bad or near perfect predictor of another. It tells you precisely this: If, in the population from which this sample was drawn, there really was no effect, how likely is it that we would get a test statistic this large or larger in a sample of this size? It also may not true that a linear regression is appropriate. WL % is bounded (0 to 100). It may be better to use a regression method (such as beta regression) that takes account of this. Also, if you have data over more than one season, you need to account for that and if you have data from multiple players on one team, you will want to account for that. However, the short answer to the question in your title is "Both".
