Longitudinal and panel data are synonym. There are only three possibility: cross section: several variable one time only time series: one variable only measured many times panel/longitudinal: several variables measured several times Moreover note that, at least in econometrics, the fact that we have a panel dataset do not imply that we must use models for panel data. For example a simple VAR (vector autoregression) is a typical time series model and do not represent a panel data technique, even if the dataset would be suitable for.
