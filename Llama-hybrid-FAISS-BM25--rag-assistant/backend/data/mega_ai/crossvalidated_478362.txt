averaging feature importance from different models

I have three data sets, each including a subset of some features. For example, dataset 1 have feature A and feature B. dataset 2 have feature B and feature C. dataset 3 have feature A and feature C. I would like to find the overall feature importance of A, B, C. Can I do the following procedure? (1) Find feature importance from three datasets separately (Using dominance analysis or pls-sem) dataset1 -> A : 50%, B : 50% dataset2 -> B : 25%, C : 75% dataset3 -> A : 40%, C : 60% (2) weighting feature importance by the sample number for each dataset: sample number in dataset 1 is 4000 sample number in dataset 2 is 5000 sample number in dataset 3 is 6000 feature importance of A = 50% (4000/15000) + 40% (6000/15000) = 29.3% feature importance of B = 50% (4000/15000) + 25% (5000/15000) = 21.7% feature importance of C = 75% (5000/15000) + 60% (6000/15000) = 49% I am not sure whether this procedure is reasonable. Can anyone give me some advice? Really appreciate.
