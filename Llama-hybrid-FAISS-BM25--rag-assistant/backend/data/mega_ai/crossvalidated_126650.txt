Is there a way to force a relationship between coefficients in logistic regression?

I would like to specify a logistic regression model where I have the following relationship: $E[Y_i|X_i] = f(\beta x_{i1} + \beta^2x_{i2})$ where $f$ is the inverse logit function. Is there a "quick" way to do this with pre-existing R functions or is there a name for a model like this? I realize I can modify the Newton-Raphson algorithm used for logistic regression but this is a lot of theoretic and coding work and I'm looking for a short cut. EDIT: getting point estimates for $\beta$ is pretty easy using optim() or some other optimizer in R to maximize the likelihood. But I need standard errors on these guys.
