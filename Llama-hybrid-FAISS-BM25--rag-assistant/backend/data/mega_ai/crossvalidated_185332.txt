The normal prior for the mean of a normal model represents a Conjugate Prior: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior This implies that the posterior of $\mu$ is also normal with certain parameters. This is a classical exercise in any introductory course in Bayesian statistics. The trick consists of expanding the binomial and then factorising in terms of $\mu$ in order to retrieve the normal kernel. Take a look, for instance, at the following lecture notes http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/lectures/lecture5.pdf
