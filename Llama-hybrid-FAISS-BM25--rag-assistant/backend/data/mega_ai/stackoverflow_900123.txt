COM, COM+, DCOM, where to start?

I am curious about COM+, DCOM. I know that MSFT does not encourage you to use this tools natively (meaning with C/C++, in fact there is not a lot of documentation available) but I want to learn to use these technologies, like embedding Internet Explorer into a C program. I thought that maybe I could find people that worked with this or that knows about this technology. Where to start? Any ideas? Any example (like Hello World DCOM)?
