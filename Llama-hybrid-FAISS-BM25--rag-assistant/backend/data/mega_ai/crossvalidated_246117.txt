Applying stochastic variational inference to Bayesian Mixture of Gaussian

I am trying to implement Gaussian Mixture model with stochastic variational inference, following this paper . This is the pgm of Gaussian Mixture. According to the paper, the full algorithm of stochastic variational inference is: And I am still very confused of the method to scale it to GMM. First, I thought the local variational parameter is just $q_z$ and others are all global parameters. Please correct me if I was wrong. What does the step 6 mean by as though Xi is replicated by N times ? What am I supposed to do to achieve this? Could you please help me with this? Thanks in advance!
