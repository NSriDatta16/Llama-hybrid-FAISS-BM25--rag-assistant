The answer is yes , the flex compiler does automatically compress data using one of the inbult algorithms (probably ZLIB) and transparently decompresses it on the other side (flash player) just before it gives you access to the uncompressed data. I was embedding a ByteArray into an SWF, and although the bytes are huge outside (200 KB), when embedded into a SWF it turns into 30 KB, producing almost exactly the same results as manually compressing this using ByteArray.compress("zlib") . I then tried manually compressing PNG/JPEG bitmaps, and it turned out larger than embedding it plainly using the [Embed] tag (172 KB as a compressed ByteArray vs. 168 KB as an embedded image). Letting the Flex compiler handle embedded data compression is actually better than trying to do your own tricks on the ByteArray side. Edit: To answer your question on PNG embedding, its hard to tell what's going on inside the flex compiler/flash player. Although known for proper documentation, Adobe is also known for many "undocumented features". Your specific question is best sent to a flash player architect (eg Tinic Uro ) or an adobe evangelist (eg Lee Brimelow ), some of whom you can easily reach on facebook (see this list ).
