We don't know enough about how the brain works to attempt to do what you're saying in a principled way. (I.e., anything of the sort is "guessing wildly".) So this isn't really a software question--if we had any idea of what to write, perhaps it would be, but right now we don't. However, you may be interested in the Blue Brain Project for a more biological approach, or in any of a number of machine learning projects like the DARPA Autonomous Vehicle Grand Challenge . A less useful but more conversational approach might be found in ALICE , but I wouldn't recommend that for anything useful.
