Parse JavaScript code in C#

I have the following JavaScript code as a string literal: var $Page = new function() { var _url= 'http://www.some.url.com'; this.Download = function() { window.location = _url; } } Is there a way I could get the value of the _url variable from my C# code? An open source library perhaps? I did this using a Regular Expression, but I was hoping for a more elegant way.
