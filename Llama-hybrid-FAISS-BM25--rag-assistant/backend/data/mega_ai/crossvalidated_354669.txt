Machine learning model with all categorical variables

I have a data with 250 predictor variables, all of them are categorical variables ( 0=Absent, 1 =Present ) and my Y variables is probability. (Y=1 means highest chance of occurrence of an event and Y=0 means lowest chance of occurrence of an event). I am interested in the following analysis: See the relationship between all 250 variables (to find multicollinearity) Variable reduction How the 250 predictor variables are affecting Y But, to see how these 250 predictor variables are correlated, I was thinking to use VIF and correlation matrix. But I am not sure if I can use VIF and correlation matrix for all categorical predictor variables. For variable reduction, can I use PCA or factor analysis for categorical variables? To build a model, which machine learning models should be good to start with?
