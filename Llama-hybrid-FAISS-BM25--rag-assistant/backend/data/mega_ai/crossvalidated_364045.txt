Micro- or macro-averaged AUC for highly imbalanced data?

I have a classification problem with 3 classes. With random forest classifier I'm getting the following confusion matrix: The micro-averaged AUC is 0.76 and the macro-averaged AUC is 0.55. On the other hand, let us assume we have the following confusion matrix: For this case I'm getting a micro-averaged AUC of 0.91 and a macro-averaged AUC of 0.85, i.e. a much smaller differene in AUC than above. Should I use for these cases micro- or macro-averaging? I have read that for heavily imbalanced classes (like in my case) it is prefarable to use micro-averaging.
