This is all more than enough for a Data Science curriculum. I did my Data Science masters programme with an Intel i5 from the 4th generation, 8GB RAM and a GTX 970. The only bottleneck was the RAM from time to time. Therefore, I would recommend at least 16GB of RAM. Currently, a compute capability of 3.5 is enough for an Nvidia graphics card to run tensorflow 2.0 . The higher the better, of course. 4 GB of VRAM should be enough to train most convolutional neural networks with a reasonable batch size.
