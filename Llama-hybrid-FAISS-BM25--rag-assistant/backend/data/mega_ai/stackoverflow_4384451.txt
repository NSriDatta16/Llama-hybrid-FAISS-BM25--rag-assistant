libpcap for Python2.6 (Windows)

Currently want to use libpcap under Python2.6 in windows. I tried Pypcap, but it only have binary build for python 2.5 or older, pylibpcap seems doesn't have any binary build. I also can't install them from source, seems that I have to build libpcap first. I want to develop an app, and then pack it using py2exe, then I want to make sure the lib is simple to install and compatible with py2exe
