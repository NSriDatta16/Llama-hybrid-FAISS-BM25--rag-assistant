column A seems to be a unique index independent from the features in column B, I don't understand why you want to predict it? If it's really unique it's impossible to predict for any new instance. The standard way is to split column B into as many columns as there are possible keywords, then the value for each instance is 1 if it has this keyword, 0 otherwise. From that you can train any supervised model, for instance decision trees or SVM, in order to predict column X. If you really want to predict column A for some reason, you can do the same process with an independent model or try to learn it jointly with column X.
