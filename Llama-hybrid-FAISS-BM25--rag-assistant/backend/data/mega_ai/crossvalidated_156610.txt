How do I set probability thresholds for a logistic regression and cutoffs in randomForest model to get a good confusion matrix?

Whenever I run a logistic regression, I need to set the threshold so that it groups probabilities higher than the threshold to my positive group: table(test$Noshow, logpred>0.5) What I sometimes do is to optimize my confusion matrix so that I get a good Sensitivity and Specificity values. Is this a good way to do it? On the other hand, when I run a randomForest model using the "randomForest" package, I can set the cutoffs such as this: k Again I optimize my confusion matrix to get a good cutoff or base the cutoff on a naive baseline proportion. What is a good way to do this?
