What is the correct mime-type for serving an iPhone .ipa file?

I'm trying to post .ipa files onto our apache web server for our beta testers to download. Currently I'm using the following line in .htaccess to serve the files: AddType application/octet-stream .ipa This works great in Safari and Firefox, but in IE the .ipa extension is removed and is instead replaced with .zip. So instead of MyApp.ipa, IE users will get MyApp.zip. I know that I could just zip up all the .ipa's before putting them onto the server and then I wouldn't have to deal with any of this, but I'd like to avoid that extra step if there is a more elegant solution server-side. Or rather, is it possible to simply prevent IE from altering the file extension?
