Deprecated generally means that you are discouraged from using it because better methods exist. It can also serve as a warning that it will be removed entirely in future versions. I would think you would want to stay away from absolute layouts because it can prevent your UI from scaling correctly on different resolutions, and it might not work at all on later versions of Android. "will the application work correctly after I deploy it on a phone" most likely yes, but like I said you are probably going to run into issues with phones having different display resolutions.
