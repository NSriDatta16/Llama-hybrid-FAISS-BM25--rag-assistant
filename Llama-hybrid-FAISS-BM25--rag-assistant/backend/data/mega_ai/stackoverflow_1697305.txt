large mysql (innodb) database - slow query performance, disappearing tables and long time to restore backups

I've a database with 3 of the tables having rows in excess of 20 million each. I've used GUIDs as primary keys (unfortunately). Now our database is about 20GB and growing 5GB per month. It takes about 2 hrs to take full backup of the database, and 30hrs to restore on a box with 4GB RAM. We once have all the tables from database disappeared. other mysql databases in same server were alright except one - for which only data was disappeared leaving empty tables. A select query (among many slow queries) - which get max of a date column in one of 20m table takes about 5 mins to return result. This query used pretty frequently. What I'm looking answers for recommended db design changes ways to improved select query performance - max date column on 20m records other queries' performance how to go about handling future db growth Thanks all for your attention.
