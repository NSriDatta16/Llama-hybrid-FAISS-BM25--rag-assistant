I have never used the libraries you listed but I have used OpenCV. OpenCV is a well supported and proven computer vision library. It has built in features to count the number of primitive shapes in an image. It is written in C++ but you could create a small wrapper to be invoked via JNI. RoboRealm is another proven computer vision system used by robotic hobbyists. It is a closed source commercial product that uses a socket based control API. http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/FullOpenCVWiki http://www.roborealm.com/index.php
