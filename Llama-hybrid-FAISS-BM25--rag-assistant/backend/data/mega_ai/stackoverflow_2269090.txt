Does it need to be a rich, native-OS style GUI? Or just any old user interface? You could get something up and running very quickly with CGI::Application - it's probably the best balance between clean, maintainable code and a short learning curve. For more heavily duty work, Catalyst seems to be the weapon of choice. If you want to make a full-featured GUI with menus and draggable dialog boxes etc. Perl is probably not the best candidate.
