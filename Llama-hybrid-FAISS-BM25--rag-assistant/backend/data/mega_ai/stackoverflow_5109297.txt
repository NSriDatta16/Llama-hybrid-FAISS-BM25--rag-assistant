iPad self made move animation

I have a problem with performance on iPad. I need to drag UIView with animation. It's like self made UIScrollView, but with bigger bounce effect. I use self made animation cycle with NSTimer (scheduletTimerWithInterval 0.3 sec). On each iteration I move view step by step. But the problem is that it's freeze time to time. Not too much... but enough to feel.. Do anyone knows any approaches to do following thing in correct way, so it will work as charm? Thanks in advance!
