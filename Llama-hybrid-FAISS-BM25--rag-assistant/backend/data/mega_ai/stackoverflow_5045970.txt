Django aggregate top value of foreign key

I have Django models that look like this class Solution(models.Model): score = models.IntegerField(); data = models.TextField(); class SolutionAuthors(models.Model): sol = models.ForeignKey(Solution); user = models.ForeignKey(User); date_solved = models.DateField() and I want to query to the most recent SolutionAuthor for each solution. The equivalent SQL might look like this SELECT * FROM Solutions s INNER JOIN SolutionAuthor sa ON sa.sol=s.sol WHERE sa.id = ( SELECT TOP 1 sa_id FROM SolutionAuthor sa2 WHERE sa2.sol=s.sol ORDER BY date_solved ) Any thoughts on how to do this with the annotate feature or otherwise? Solutions that reorganize the schema are welcome as well.
