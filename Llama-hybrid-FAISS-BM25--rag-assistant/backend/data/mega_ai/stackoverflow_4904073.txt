python variable function definition

First, please don't shoot me if this has already been asked - I have looked around but to no avail. I have a python file (named rpc.py ) containing many functions serving AJAX requests. For example: def test(self, vars): return vars['id'] def test2(self, vars): return vars['id']+1 And it is called with a URL like: rpc.py?fnc=test2&id=4 I want to call the function that matches the 'fnc' query parameter and pass the whole query string into 'vars' . So something like the following "pseudocode" is what I am after: vars = cgi.FieldStorage() print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n" print eval('vars["fnc"].value(vars)') Any ideas?
