Random forest classification with numeric response?

I have a dataset in which the response variable is categorical, but represented by by a finite number of numeric classes (i.e., 7000,8900,3100,4000). When running a random forest model in R using the randomForest package - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf , it states that for the response variable, y, "If a factor, classification is assumed, otherwise regression is assumed. If omitted, randomForest will run in unsupervised mode." In my case, will the response vector be interpreted by R as a factor, or as numeric even though there are a discrete number of classes. If the latter, is there way to force it to interpret the response as categorical?
