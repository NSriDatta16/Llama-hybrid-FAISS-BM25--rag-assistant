How to decode "application/x-qabstractitemmodeldatalist" in Qt for drag and drop?

I've created a child class of QTreeWidget that I want to be able to drag items from another tree widget too (I want to handle the insertion myself though), as well as from a QListWidget. I've overridden the dropEvent method in my class, and it looks like the mimetype of the data I'm getting from my QTreeWidget is application/x-qabstractitemmodeldatalist, how can I decode this to get the items from the tree back out?
