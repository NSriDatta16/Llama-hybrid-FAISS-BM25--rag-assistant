Marginalization of conditional probability

I am working through these examples of computations on Bayesian networks and came across this claim (part of the last sample computation): $$ P(E=e|A=a) = \sum_{c \in C} P(E=e, C=c | A=a) $$ I am newly familiar with marginalization, but I thought that it was: $$ P(A=a) = \sum_{b \in B} P(A=a,B=b) = \sum_{b \in B} P(A=a|B=b)P(B=b) $$ If the first equation is true, can someone explain? I have tried searching for "marginalizing conditional probability" but have not found anything that seems similar.
