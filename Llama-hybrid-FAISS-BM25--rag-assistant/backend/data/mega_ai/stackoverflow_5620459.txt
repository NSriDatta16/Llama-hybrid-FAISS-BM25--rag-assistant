Does DisplayAttribute encourage bad practice?

I'm struggling to find real world value in annotating my view models with DisplayAttribute . The only advantage I can see is that this weakly typed view code: IP address Becomes strongly typed: @Html.LabelFor(m => m.IPAddress) The disadvantage is that I need to recompile and redeploy my web app to fix a simple typo. Wouldn't it be better to keep display-only information where it belongs, in the view, and have some sort of HTML helper to render the correct field ID, like this: m.IPAddress)">IP address I guess I'm just curious as to why the MVC guys went for the attribute-based solution. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious?
