Solving "loader constraints violated when linking [...] class" error in Java

I am new to Java and experiencing problems understanding exceptions thrown by the framework. Right now, I am trying to implement a regular expression validator into an application consisting of Java 5 EE with myFaces 1.2 and Tobago running in an apache tomcat 5.5. I followed a couple of tutorials (including the Java 5 EE tut from SUN) and came pretty far. However, when calling my jsp, I get the following error message: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraints violated when linking javax/faces/validator/Validator class Can anyone explain to me what I need to do to solve this problem? So far, it seems as if MyFaces 1.1.7 has a version conflict to TomCat 5.5. Both contain javax.* packages (one of them namely javax.faces.validator). The validator class has a different version in the packages. The corresponding MyFaces library is called myfaces-api-1.1.7.jar and the TomCat library is called javaee.jar. The included javax packages in the myfaces lib is a subset of the packages from within the javaee lib. However... I cannot skip any of both, because the project will fail to start then. Any tipps?
