zlib: compressed stream always the same?

Is it guaranteed that for a given compression level and a given input, the compressed stream will always be the same, also for different (and upcoming) zlib versions? Or is there some way I can make it like this? Otherwise I would have to copy some specific zlib version to my project and stick to that. (Because I need that guarantee.) Thanks, Albert
