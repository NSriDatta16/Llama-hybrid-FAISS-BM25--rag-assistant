Does my neural network have a normal distributed output?

I have trained a binary classier neural network and I was interested in potentially using some standard statical analysis on it although they are often reliant on if the underlying distribution is normal. I have no idea if my neural network produces a normally distributed output, is there anyway to test such a thing? would it be correct to just take small portions of the data (say 10 images at a time) and calculate the response to check normality?
