This is the classic Monty Hall problem. You can show the solution with Bayesian inference, but it's not really necessary to come to the right conclusion, which is that you should definitely switch. https://sc5.io/posts/how-to-solve-the-monty-hall-problem-using-bayesian-inference/#gref Intuitively, you had a 1/5 chance of picking the right box to begin with. When the other boxes are opened specifically to avoid the prize, it hasn't changed your odds of having picked correctly to begin with - you still only have a 1/5 chance of having the prize in your box. Essentially, you can stick with your original choice, or switch to choosing the other four boxes together, and taking the prize if it's in any of them . You will win 20% of the time by sticking, and 80% of the time by switching.
