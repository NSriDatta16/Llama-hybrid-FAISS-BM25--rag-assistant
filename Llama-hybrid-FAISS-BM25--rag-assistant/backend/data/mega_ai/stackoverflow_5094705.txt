Running Instruments to check for leaks on iPhone without developer license

I'm trying to run Instruments on an iPhone app that I've compiled as debug, self signed (no developer license), and copied to the phone. If I select run with with Instruments from Xcode, first the Organizer will complain that the app is already installed, and Instruments doesn't do anything. If I try to go directly from Instruments, my app is not listed the in pull-down menu of available processes. Oh, and I can't run the app in the simulator because the dylib that I'm using is compiled for ARM, and if I select the simulator (which changes the architecture to i386), the source will fail to compile. Any thing obvious that I'm missing?
