You've got a classic multi-class classification problem. There are some specialized methods for dealing with these, but I'm under the impression they're not fantastic. This one is reasonably understandable, and has a good theoretical foundation. If you're going with the 1 vs. all approach to this problem (which is what you've described), I'd suggest starting with a bunch of N. Bayes classifiers. Often they work alright, and they're fast and easy to train. If you get poor performance, you could switch to something a bit more heavy duty, like a SVM .
