If you're using a shader, you can pass your vertex world positions into your vertex shader and they'll interpolate to your fragment shader, so for every fragment, you'll get where it is in world-space (of course you can use any space). Then it's just a matter of choosing whatever transfer function to change that value to a color. You can make any kind of elaborate algorithm using b-splines or whatever in your fragment shader.
