It means that their is no deterministic relationship from your feature vectors to the class it belongs to. Possible explanations include: The feature representation is not sufficient, The feature representation is noisy (unlikely, since the vectors are exactly the same), The underlying process is not deterministic. If you are able to engineer the feature representation I would say to try to get a richer one. (This depends on the application). Maybe this still fails and you should model the uncertainty by treating the class relationship as a random variable. In the case of KNN this is easy - just take something like $p(C|x) = \frac{\text{#vectors of class C in neighbourhood of size k}}{k}$. Other approaches, namely the probabilistic ones like logistic regression, do this naturally.
