You might be having problems getting the size of the image because it isn't guaranteed that it has been loaded by the time you're checking its dimensions. var $img = jQuery('div#drag_container img[alt="background"]'); $img.bind('load', function(){ // do all of your stuff with the width and the height of the image in here... var width = $(this).width(); var height = $(this).height(); }); $img.attr('src', source); /* kicks off the loading of the image, the bound function * above will get called when it's done. */
