You really don't want to "skip" code in your unit tests -- if you do, you'll never have coverage for those areas. It's far better to provide a mock interface to external systems, so you can insure that the rest of the code behaves as expected. This is especially critical when dealing with external resources that may be unavailable , as S3 can be in case of network issues, service interruptions, or configuration errors. Alternately, you could just use the Django S3 storage backend in your production environment, while configuring tests for use local file storage instead.
