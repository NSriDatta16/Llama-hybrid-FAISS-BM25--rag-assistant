Conducting a hypothesis test for the difference of the means of two populations if the mean of one population is known, but its s.d is unknown?

In the last part of this question, I have to conduct a hypothesis test for the difference of means of the two plants. H0 : uA - uB = 0 H1 : uA - uB > 0 So I consider the sampling distributions of A and B. But I don't know the variance of B. How should I proceed? The official answer has just assumed this variance to be 0, but just because we don't know it doesn't mean we can take it as 0.. For one, a variance of 0 would mean that every single plant produces the same mass of potatoes in the case of B, which would nullify the significance of the 'on average'.
