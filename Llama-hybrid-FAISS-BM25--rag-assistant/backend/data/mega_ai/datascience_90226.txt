Attention in NER

I am building a named entity recognition model and it is having BERT+BiLSTM+CRF in it. Now I am planning to introduce an attention layer. My question is - what type of attention I should use here and why? Data: It is an invoice data - I am trying to extract Company and person names from the invoices.
