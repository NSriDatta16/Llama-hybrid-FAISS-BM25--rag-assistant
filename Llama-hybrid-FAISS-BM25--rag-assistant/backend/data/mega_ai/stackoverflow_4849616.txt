can a magento adminhtml field depend on more then one field or value?

In http://alanstorm.com/magento_system_configuration_in_depth_tutorial @AlanStorm gives a very good tutorial for system configuration. He also explains how to use a tag to make a field show only when a specific value is set in another field. My Q is how can I make fieldB visible if field A has either value V1 or V2. and are there any other options with the ? Also If someone knows where in magento's code this is implemented I would also like to have a look at the code myself. Thanks
