How do i call WCF services in Silverlight?

Can anybody tell me why is this not working. I have created a WCF service which returns a list of customers from Northwind database. using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Runtime.Serialization; using System.ServiceModel; using System.Text; using System.ServiceModel.Activation; namespace WCFSilverlight.Web { // NOTE: You can use the "Rename" command on the "Refactor" menu to change the class name "Customers" in code, svc and config file together. [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)] public class Customers : ICustomers { IEnumerable ICustomers.GetAllCustomers() { NorthwindEntities objNorthwindEntities = new NorthwindEntities(); var query = from cust in objNorthwindEntities.Customers select cust; return query.ToList(); } } } And this is my App.xaml.cs code fragment :- private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e) { this.RootVisual = new MainPage(); CustomersClient objCustomersClient = new CustomersClient(); objCustomersClient.GetAllCustomersCompleted += new EventHandler (client_GetNameCompleted); objCustomersClient.GetAllCustomersAsync(); } void client_GetNameCompleted(object sender, GetAllCustomersCompletedEventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show(e.Result.ToString()); } If I am not wrong the methods in Silverlight are called asynchronously. So I have added a event handler to handle it and then called the method to retrieve customers. But I don't get anything in Messagebox. Further when I try to keep a breakpoint on client_GetNameCompleted , it never executes. But if I keep it in Application_Startup it does execute. What can be the problem? Also explain me am I doing it correct? I've seen one example where one person directly defines the function using some strange symbols like => . EDIT 1:- Kindly also explain me what is e.UserState in e. What does it contain and what can I possibly do with it? EDIT 2 :- :- I get this error http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/9070/53923202.jpg The WCF service is working perfectly i have tested the link query. So there is no problem with Sql Server connection or WCF. Something is wrong with my client only. This is my ServiceReference.ClientConfig :- Can you now tell me what is wrong? Thanks in advance :) Update :- I read in google you need to set serialization mode to unidirectional. But where do i set this? What do i write where?
