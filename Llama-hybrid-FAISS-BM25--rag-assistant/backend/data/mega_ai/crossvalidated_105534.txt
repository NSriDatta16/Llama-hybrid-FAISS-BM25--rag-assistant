Cross-Validation vs. AICc for LASSO

I was working on a research project in which I try to estimate the the individual contribution of a group of regional political leaders to local economic growth. The major challenge is that there is relatively few locality-year observations to the number of regional leaders. Overall I have about 300 political leaders and about 500 locality-year observations. The data matrix is also quite sparse as most regional leaders serve in one to three localities for an average of 3-4 years. I decided to use LASSO, which would grant me more degrees of freedom by throwing away the insignificant variables. Although I was told that AICc and cross-validation (and choosing the model that gives the minimum mean squared error) are theoretically equivalent, but in my dataset they perform very differently. LASSO gives much fewer non-zero individual coefficient estimates under AICc than under cross-validation (200 fold for a dataset wth 500 observations). So my question is: Why do I see different results under AICc and cross-validation? And which criteria should I be using in selecting the model and reporting the results? Any help on this will be greatly appreciated. And I'm happy to provide more details about my research if needed.
