how to write a generic GLSL shader to colorize an object

i have several objects in OpenGL and i want to mark the selected object. My idea was to use a GLSL shader to add the selected color. How can I get the 'original' color of the pixel in the fragment shader? I could look the color up in the texture, but when there's more than one texture?
