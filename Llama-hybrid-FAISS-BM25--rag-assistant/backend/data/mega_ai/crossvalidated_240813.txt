Yes, you should refeed the predictions if you want to predict further into the future. However, with a one delay only model you'll never be able to detect/predict ups and downs. This is because a NN with only one input is simply a logistic regression (if you use sigmoid) and therefore is a linear model, so predictions will either go up, down or straight. You'll need at least two inputs if you want your NN to detect ups and downs, because then maybe up-down predicts down again, down down predicts up and so on. I'm simplifying here, but I hope you get the picture.
