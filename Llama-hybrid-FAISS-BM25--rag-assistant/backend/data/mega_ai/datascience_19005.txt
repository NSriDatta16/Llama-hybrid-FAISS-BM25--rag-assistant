XGBoost change loss function

I'm using XGBoost (through the sklearn API) and I'm trying to do a binary classification. False Positives are much worse for me than False Negatives , how can I take this into account? The API confuses me a bit and I found two arguments that might be related to this: objective & eval_metric Which one is it? And how to use it?
