You essentially have two choices. Option 1: Add cocos2d files to your existing project Add cocos2d files to your project as normal (drag the source files in, copy to dest folder). Create an EAGLView in a View Controller and bind it to the CCDirector. (See an example project for reference. Option 2: Install your existing code into a fresh project using the cocos2d templates The latest version of cocos2d (1.0-RC) has XCode 4 templates. Install them: install-templates.sh --force Then create a new cocos2d project using those templates in XCode 4. Add your existing files and update the project that it creates, and you should be good to go. Personally, I've had better luck with Option #2, but most of my code is pretty easy to move around.
