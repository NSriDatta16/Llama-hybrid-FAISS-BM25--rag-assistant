PHP append one array to another (not array_push or +)

How to append one array to another without comparing their keys? $a = array( 'a', 'b' ); $b = array( 'c', 'd' ); At the end it should be: Array( [0]=>a [1]=>b [2]=>c [3]=>d ) If I use something like [] or array_push , it will cause one of these results: Array( [0]=>a [1]=>b [2]=>Array( [0]=>c [1]=>d ) ) //or Array( [0]=>c [1]=>d ) It just should be something, doing this, but in a more elegant way: foreach ( $b AS $var ) $a[] = $var;
