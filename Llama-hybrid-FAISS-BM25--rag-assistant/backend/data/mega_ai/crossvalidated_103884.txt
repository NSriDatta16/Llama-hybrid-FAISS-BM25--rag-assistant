Comparing ROC-curves

I would like to find if there is a significant difference between two ROC-curves. I've found the roc.test in the pROC package. However, I cannot seem to find any information on how this test is actually performed. Can anyone explain it to me or refer to a webpage that has information on this? From the documentation for roc.test() , I've found that the used test is DeLong's test (based on the article 'Comparing the areas under two or more correlated receiver operating characteristic curves: a nonparametric approach'). However, I don't quite understand the article. My ROC-curves have been found by comparing two logistic regressions, where one has a subset of attributes of the other seeing as I want to examine whether these attributes are useful. The probabilities are found using 5-fold cross-validation.
