Efficient Sorting?

I've been looking an answer for this question for sometime now... "What is the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers?" I feel that Quick sort is the most efficient in sorting.. with an average Runtime of O(n*log n). (with the worst case O(nÂ²)).. But some search results says that Radix sort/Merge sort are efficient for sorting million integers. Any pointers?
