I'm not completely sure about your queries but you could encapsulate the query logic in a stored procedure drag it with LINQ to SQL data context designer to use. If you need the results independently and you really don't want the round trip to database server, I think you should fall back to SqlDataReader and use NextResult by calling a procedure that retrieves the whole data.
