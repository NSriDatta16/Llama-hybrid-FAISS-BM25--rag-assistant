Is there a metric that combines recall and precision other than the F1 score?

I am looking for a machine learning optimization metric that combines recall and precision. One such metric is the F1 score , which is the harmonic mean of the precision and the recall of a model. The problem with this metric is that it puts too much emphasis on the recall. For example: A model with 5% recall and 90% precision has an F1 score of 9%. A model with 90% recall and 50% precision has an F1 score of 64%. So for the F1 score, a model that makes lots of mediocre predictions is better than a model that makes a few great predictions. Is there an alternative?
