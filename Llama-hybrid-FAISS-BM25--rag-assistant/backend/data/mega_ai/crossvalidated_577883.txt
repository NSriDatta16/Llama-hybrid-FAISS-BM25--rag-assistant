What you're looking for is called a cross-correlation . You'll find a lot of details if you read up on cross-correlation methods, but here's a quick example. There is a lot more that could be said about the challanges of what you're trying to do (multiple comparisons, non-stationary time series, etc.), but I won't go into that here. full_data = cumsum(rnorm(500)) k = 25 x = full_data[1:100] offset_x = full_data[(1+k):(100+k)] plot(x, type = 'b') result = ccf(x, offset_x, lag.max = 50, plot = T) result$lag[which.max(result$acf)] # [1] 25
