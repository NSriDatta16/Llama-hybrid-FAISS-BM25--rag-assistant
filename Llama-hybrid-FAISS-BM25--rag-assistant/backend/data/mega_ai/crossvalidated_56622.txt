Both are used (along with the median). Which is "best" depends on the context of how you are going to use it. Generally to a Bayesian the whole posterior distribution is interesting, not just one single number from it. Also interesting is the Credible intervals, but again you have choices, do you want the Highest Posterior Density? or the interval with equal probability in each tail? The HPD gives the narrowest interval, but the second means that when it does not contain the truth it is equally likely to miss on either side. There are other ways to construct the interval as well. So, How do you plan to use your single number? If it is the answer to a test or homework problem then use whatever your teacher specifies. If you want to gain understanding, then use the entire posterior. If this is for a client then you should start with a CI at a minimum, a single number will likely be misleading.
