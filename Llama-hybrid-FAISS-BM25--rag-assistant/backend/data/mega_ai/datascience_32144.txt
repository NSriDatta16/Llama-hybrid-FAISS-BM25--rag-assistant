Web page data extraction using machine learning

I would like to extract some specific information from web pages. Web pages contain person profiles, and I want to extract information such as name, email, research interested-areas. Structure of each page is different from one another. How can I extract such information using machine learning? What kind of a method, features I can use? Or can I use NLP for such task?
