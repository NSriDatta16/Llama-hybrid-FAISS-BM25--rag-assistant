From my experience of web design, that is the conventional way of making that happen (checking for IP addresses OR User-agents that is and not cookies). The way I know it is because: Do it in Chrome, works for the first time and doesn't work subsequently Do it in Chrome's Incognito Mode, doesn't work anymore Open up Firefox, it still doesn't work This means that they are using IP or User-agent to make this happen. It should've worked with Firefox if they were using cookies.
