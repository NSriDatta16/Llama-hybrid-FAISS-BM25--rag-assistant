When are Log scales appropriate?

I've read that using log scales when charting/graphing is appropriate in certain circumstances, like the y-axis in a time series chart. However, I've not been able to find a definitive explanation as to why that's the case, or when else it would be appropriate. Please keep in mind, I'm not a statistician so I may be missing the point altogether and if that's the case I'd appreciate direction to remedial resources.
