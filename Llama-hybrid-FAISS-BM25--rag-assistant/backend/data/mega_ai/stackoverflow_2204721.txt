I think the primary motivation (at least it was presented like this :-)) for adding nullable types in C# 2 were databases. In database, any data type can have the NULL value and when mapping these to C#, this is a problem. Nullable types allow you to deal with this quite elegantly - you can use int? , bool? and others. They are used for example in LINQ to SQL. What does the third value mean for booleans, that of course depends on the application. I guess that typically, it will mean that the value/field is not available.
