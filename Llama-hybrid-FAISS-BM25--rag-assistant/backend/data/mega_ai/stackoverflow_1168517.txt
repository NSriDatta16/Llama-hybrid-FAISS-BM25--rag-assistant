Using map() to get number of times list elements exist in a string in Python

I'm trying to get the number of times each item in a list is in a string in Python: paragraph = "I eat bananas and a banana" def tester(x): return len(re.findall(x,paragraph)) map(tester, ['banana', 'loganberry', 'passion fruit']) Returns [2, 0, 0] What I'd like to do however is extend this so I can feed the paragraph value into the map() function. Right now, the tester() function has paragraph hardcoded. Does anybody have a way to do this (perhaps make an n-length list of paragraph values)? Any other ideas here? Keep in mind that each of the array values will have a weight at some point in the future - hence the need to keep the values in a list rather than crunching them all together. UPDATE: The paragraph will often be 20K and the list will often have 200+ members. My thinking is that map operates in parallel - so it will be much more efficient than any serial methods.
