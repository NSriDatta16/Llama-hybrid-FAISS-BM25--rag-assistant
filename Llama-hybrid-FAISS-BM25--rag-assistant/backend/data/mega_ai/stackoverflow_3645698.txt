PHP scripts to calculate technical indicators

I am tasked to write a web application that can plot stock charts, with technical analysis like exponential moving averages, RSI etc. Plotting charts is not an issue. The issue is generating all those complex technical indicators. Does anyone know if there is any library, free or paid, available that provides PHP scripts to calculate a host of technical indicators?
