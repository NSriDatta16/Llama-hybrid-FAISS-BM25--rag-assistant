Not sure if your data model will allow it, but you can use a single index column and a Binary Tree to easily store this information in a single 'OrganizationTree' table. Also has the benefit you use a single query with no modifications to search at the category, subcategory, or organization levels (E.g. give me all results of X subcategory) Hope this helps. Adam.
