A question like this usually results in a pedantic answer. Languages are like tools. They are built to suit certain purposes. Logic programming language solve certain problems in a more elegant way than an object oriented program would. Similarly, many main stream solution are easily done by a typical object oriented or procedural language. Temperament and other factors of the tool user, in this case a programmer also matters. Some folks have achieved nifty solutions in Perl but it has always looked like black magic to me. I prefer Python's structural simplicity. For some, it's use of white space has been abominable. It would be at best a very subjective evaluation, if there can be an evaluation of a language clarity and expressivity. How ever, a clear indication is wealth of code production in that language. Some language like brainfuck has not been adopted while Python, Ruby etc have gained popularity. Although, these and many factor can be an indicator only. Some language, despite good constructs may not find much takers. Network effect also affect the language adoption.
