Take the time series without the first observation, $X_2, \dots, X_T$ , and the time series without the last observation, $X_1, \dots, X_{T-1}$ . You have two vectors of length $T-1$ . Calculate their correlation. The result is the lag 1 autocorrelation. Similarly, you can calculate the lag 2 autocorrelation, which is the correlation between $X_3, \dots, X_T$ and $X_1, \dots, X_{T-2}$ , and more generally any lag $k$ autocorrelation. A series is "autocorrelated" if any one of these is "large enough". Of course, all the sample autocorrelations will typically be nonzero, so one usually checks if any one is significantly larger or smaller than zero. More information can be found here or here .
