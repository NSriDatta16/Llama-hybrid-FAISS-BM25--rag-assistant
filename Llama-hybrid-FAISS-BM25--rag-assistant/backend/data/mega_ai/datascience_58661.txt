Getting answers to bullets (numbered items) from text via NLP

This is related to information extraction. In real world data, documents are written in bullets/numbered items form. For example, How to create a website: - Get A DNS - Get a Hosting - Deploy wordpress or some site ... above is sample of a structured data. Take another example where content is semi structured, While sandeep was going to home there was a road on the way he saw a - Car - 2 wheeler - cart and he carefully crossed the road If I have to find out the "steps to create a website" or "what is on the road" .. is there an established method using NLP? As some data is semi structured, so simple classification may not work in this case. Maybe deep learning network or some pretrained model? I have seen google is able to return such results when we search something like "what are steps create a website".
