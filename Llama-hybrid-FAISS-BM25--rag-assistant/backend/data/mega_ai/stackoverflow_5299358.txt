From the various questions and answers I've seen about trying to intercept requests for the Bing map control, I don't believe it's possible to intercept HTTP requests for offline map display. I've seen several questions about offline maps - including attempts at reading map tiles from Isolated Storage. Sadly, the existing controls simply don't seem to support this. You might be able to create your own control to draw the map tiles there are quite a few samples around in various languages - although I've not seen a SL one. Sorry it's not better news!
