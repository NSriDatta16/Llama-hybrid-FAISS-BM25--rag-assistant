I was browsing around the Microsoft Connect site and I am seeing bug reports where people are making the same claim you are. The claim being that an OutOfMemoryException is occuring which can be resolved by periodically calling GC.Collect . I saw one report where the lead engineer from the garbage collector team responded back and said a bug was fixed in .NET 4.0 that should resolve a fragmentation issue with the large object heap. That is why I asked what version you were using. It is certainly possible that you have stumbled upon a bug in the garbage collector. As with all GC related issues this could be very version dependent. My advice would be to: make sure you have the latest patches and service pack refactor the code so that it is not as memory intensive reuse LOH objects as much as possible instead of creating new ones continue using GC.Collect at strategic points if necessary as a workaround
