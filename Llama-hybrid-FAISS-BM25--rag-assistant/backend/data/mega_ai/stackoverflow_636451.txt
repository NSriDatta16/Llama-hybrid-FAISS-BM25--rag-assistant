I find logging in Java to be confusing, inconsistent, poorly documented, and especially haphazard. Moreover, there is a huge amount of similarity between these logging frameworks resulting in duplication of effort, and confusion as to what logging environment you are actually in. In particular, if you are working in a serious Java web application stack, you are often in multiple logging environments at one time; (e.g hibernate may use log4j, and tomcat java.util.logging). Apache commons is meant to bridge different logging frameworks, but really just adds more complexity. If you do not know this ahead of time, it is utterly bewildering. Why are my log messages not printing out to the console, etc.? Ohh because I am looking at the Tomcat logs, and not log4j. Adding yet another layer of complexity, the application server may have global logging configurations that may not recognize local configurations for a particular web application. Lastly, all these logging frameworks are WAY TOO COMPLICATED. Logging in Java has been a disorganized mess leaving developers like me frustrated and confused. Early versions of Java did not have a built-in logging framework leading to this scenario.
