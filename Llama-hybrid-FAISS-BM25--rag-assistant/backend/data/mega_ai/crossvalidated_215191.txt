What is the best form (Gaussian, Multinomial) of Naive Bayes to use with categorical (one-hot encoded) features?

I've been asked to use the Naive Bayes classifier to classify a couple of samples. My dataset had categorical features so I had to first encode them using a one-hot encoder, but then I was at a loss as for which statistical model to use (e.g. Gaussian NB, Multinomial NB). I ended up using the multinomial version because I read somewhere that it worked well in NLP and IR tasks due to documents being represented as term-count vectors or TF-IDF weights. I would like to know if that was correct and, if possible, a quick explanation on why that is so. PS There is this somewhat similar question, but I'm not sure whether that also applies to strictly binary (0 or 1) feature vectors.
