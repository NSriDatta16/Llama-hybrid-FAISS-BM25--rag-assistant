You can always compute the probability that a study would have produce a significant result for a given a priori effect size. In theory, this should be done before a study is conducted because there is no point in carrying out a study with low power that has a low chance to produce a significant result when an effect is present. However, you can also compute power after the study to realize that a study had low power or, unlikely, high power to detect even a small effect. The term post-hoc or observed power is used for power-analysis that use observed effect sizes in a sample to compute power under the assumption that the observed effect size is a reasonable estimate of the true effect size. Many statisticians have pointed out that observed power in a single study is not very informative because effect sizes are not estimated with sufficient precision to be informative. More recently, researchers have started to examine observed power for a set of studies to examine how powerful studies are on average and whether studies report more significant results than the actual power of studies would justify. https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/tag/observed-power/
