Also found these books myself: http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Window-System-Oliver-Jones/dp/0134999975/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288651669&sr=1-4 (old and expensive, but it's something) http://www.amazon.com/Window-Programming-Scratch-Jesse-Libertys/dp/0789723727/ref=sr_1_25?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288651711&sr=1-25 (this one is quite recent, compared to most other resources I could find, but it's got some bad reviews. Maybe worth the read) http://www.amazon.com/Window-Toolkit-Complete-Programmers-Specification/dp/1555581781/ref=sr_1_44?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288651754&sr=1-44 (supposedly good, actually on Xt, but I guess it might be worth the read) And this website which seems to at least contain something usable: http://manuals.itc.virginia.edu/unixdocs/u014.xwindows.html If anyone has read any of these, please leave a comment.
