Can I retrieve physical/unmanaged information of .Net (C#) managed object

I am learning .NET/C# and because I almost always want to find out how managed object represent in real memory, I am wondering if there is any programmatic method to get these information, including object memory address, size in byte, memory layout and so on? I know that .NET discourage it and hide information as internal implementation detail. But I am really curious about it for debugging and learning purpose.
