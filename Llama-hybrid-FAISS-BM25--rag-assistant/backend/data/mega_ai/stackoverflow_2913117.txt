Moving webshop storage to NoSQL solution

If you had a webshop solution based on SQL Server relational DB what would be the reasons, if any, to move to NoSQL storage ? Does it even make sense to migrate datastores that rely on relations heavily to NoSQL? If starting from scratch, would you choose NoSQL solution over relational one for a webshop project, which will, after a while, again end up with a bunch of tables like Articles, Classifications, TaxRates, Pricelists etc. and a magnitude of relations between them? What's the support like in .NET (4.0) for MongoDB or MongoDB's support for .NET 4.0? Can I count on rich code generation tools similar to EF wizard, L2SQL wizard etc. for MongoDB? Because as what I have read so far, NoSQL's are mostly suited for document storage, simpler object models. Your answer to this question will help me make the right infrastructure design decisions. UPDATE: If I was developing my solution around ASP.NET MVC and rely heavily on Model classes, would it be the easiest way to go to choose DB4o to simply serialize and deserialize my objects to and from datastore?
