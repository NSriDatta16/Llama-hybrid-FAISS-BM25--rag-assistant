You could try one of the following plugins which preserves code formatting within the html editor: TRUEedit Plugin WP Super Edit ps-disable-auto-formatting Unfiltered MU (multisite only) I believe most of these plugins removes the wptexturize filter that WordPress uses which replaces characters and patterns (which messes up some shortcodes and html). If your using 'Deans FCKEditor' or 'Foliopress WYSIWYG' that could be the problem since they convert quotes to html quotes, add paragraph markup, mess up shortcodes, and do some other html character replacement.
