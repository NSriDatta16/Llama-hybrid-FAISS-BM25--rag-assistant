oduct division, founder of software company Niantic, Inc. and creator of Ingress & Pok√©mon Go, is a fan of Den-noh Coil and Ghost in the Shell. In 2008, the Virtual World Institute of GLOCOM; found new possibilities in the augmented reality depicted in Den-noh Coil, which overlays a network on the real world rather than in virtual reality. They then discussed the feasibility of infrastructure to support society and the form of organization to run society as an exploration of the future society. At the time, with the Second Life boom that occurred around 2006, there was a lot of talk about a virtual society, but in Europe and the U.S., the idea of creating a completely different world where people could do whatever they wanted, like the metaverse in the science fiction novel Snow Crash. In contrast, they saw in this work the possibility of not only that, but also the possibility of a virtual world embedded in the real world. They also suggested that while the virtual worlds and community services offered by the online gaming industry are Snow Crash-like, future services could appeal to a wider audience by adopting the Den-noh Coil concept.
