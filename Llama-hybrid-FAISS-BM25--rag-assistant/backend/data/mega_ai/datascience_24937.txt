Finding similarity between two histogram plots

I have data census(name, sex, age, capital_gain) and I want to plot all possible views (in a histogram) and find the most interesting view based on the distinction to other views. So, I have to compute the similarity between two histogram plots, for example: Average Capital Gain vs Sex (which computed by aggregate Capital gain to Sex) Average age vs Sex (which computed by aggregate average age to sex) My questions is, what kind of measurement that can be used to check the similarity between those two histogram plots? I consider the features that want to be compared are (x-axis, y-axis, and pattern of the histogram) I really not sure about distance function that can be used for this case. I know Jaccard distance, but not sure it can be used in this situation or not. Thank you,
