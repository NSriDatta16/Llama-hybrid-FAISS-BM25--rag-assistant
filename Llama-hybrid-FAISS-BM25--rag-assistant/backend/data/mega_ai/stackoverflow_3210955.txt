Don't forget that when you load a compressed image (and a JPEG might be VERY compressed), the memory required to hold it once loaded is almost always based on its uncompressed state. So it can be very misleading to look at the file sizes and then think about memory - you should look at the image pixel sizes - start with length x width x 4 as a rough rule of thumb - and then reconsider if the memory use is so outrageous.
