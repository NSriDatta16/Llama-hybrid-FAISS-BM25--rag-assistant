How to detect and predict sensor faults and failures (for weather stations to be specific)?

Need help. Especially those knowledgeable in weather systems/meteorology. Best approach in detecting and predicting faulty weather sensors and their failures based on their readings alone? I'm doing a project regarding detection and prediction of faulty sensors employed at weather stations to improve maintenance and optimize scheduling. I've seen studies using operational data such as battery level, communication status, and temperature to detect faults. This is especially the case for industrial machines. They employ sensors to read the temperature, vibration, rotation, etc. of those machines. They also have labeled data such as if the machine/equipment is operational at the time being. What method can I do if such data mentioned above isn't available for my weather station dataset? I also don't have maintenance data due to confidential concerns from our local weather agency. I only have access to historical weather data, which contains values of actual physical phenomenon being sensed (temperature, humidity, etc.) Anomaly detection would work but I'm thinking if it's really that accurate since sudden rain affects temperature, humidity, wind speed values might confuse the model as saying the sensor's faulty. Pardon me if I sound noob because this is only my second machine learning project. Dataset looks like this (per station) Timestamp Temp Humid 12/24/23 00:00:00 28.4 10.1 12/24/23 00:00:10 28.5 10.2 12/24/23 00:00:20 28.3 11.8 I tried anomaly detection but haven't produced a good model as I am still in practicing stage.
