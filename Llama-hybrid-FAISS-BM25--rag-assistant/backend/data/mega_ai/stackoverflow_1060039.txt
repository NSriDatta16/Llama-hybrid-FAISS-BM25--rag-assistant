GTK detecting window resize from the user

In GTK (or pygtk or gtkmm...) How can I detect that an application window has been manually resized by the user, as is typically done by dragging the window's edge? I need to find a way to differentiate manual resizes from resizes that originate from gtk, such as changes in window content.
