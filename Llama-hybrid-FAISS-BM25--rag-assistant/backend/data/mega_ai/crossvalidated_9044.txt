Google translate gives "rms error of assessment" which (as root mean square error ) seems to be the intended meaning. The difference between mean square error and root mean square error is similar to the differrence between variance and standard deviation : if you want the average error to be reported in the same units as the measurement (metres or degrees or whatever) then you need to take the square root.
