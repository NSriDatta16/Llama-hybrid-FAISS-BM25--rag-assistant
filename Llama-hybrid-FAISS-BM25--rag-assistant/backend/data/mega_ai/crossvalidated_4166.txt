A deep understanding of survival analysis requires knowledge of counting processes, martingales, Cox processes... See e.g. Odd O. Aalen, Ørnulf Borgan, Håkon K. Gjessing. Survival and event history analysis: a process point of view . Springer, 2008. ISBN 9780387202877 Having said that, many applied statisticians (including me) use survival analysis without any understanding of stochastic processes. I'm not likely to make any advances to the theory though.
