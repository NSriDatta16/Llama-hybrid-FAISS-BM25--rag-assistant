The short answer is yes: nonparametric statistical methods allow the data to determine the complexity of the model. Frequentists (usually) do this by not completely specifying the likelihood function, and Bayesians do this through expanding the prior with infinitely many parameters. Here is a not so gentle comparison of the two from a Bayesian perspective while trying to answer basically your question. I highly recommend reading it to get a better theoretical notion. The whole class series of presentations might interest you.
