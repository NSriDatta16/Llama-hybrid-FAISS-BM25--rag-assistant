R comes with several mechanisms for searching for help, most of which naturally use CRAN. Some examples: the sos package , cranberries , crantastic , and rseek . In many cases, these could be adapted to use a local repository (you can find out how to create a local repository in the R manual, which is very easy to do). Otherwise, if you package your scripts and submit them to CRAN, you will naturally have these available to you. I would also highly recommend this presentation on the subject: Creating R Packages, Using CRAN, R-Forge, And Local R Archive Networks And Subversion (SVN) Repositories from Spencer Graves and Sundar Dorai-Raj. These would require you to put your code in packages, and create documentation, all of which is worth doing anyway. The package documentation turns out to be very useful for both documenting what things do, and helping your find them in the future. You can use roxygen to create this documentation in-line with your code. Also read this related question: Organizing R Source Code . Alternatively, the help.search() function can be very useful for searching local packages, regardless of whether you have a repository set up.
