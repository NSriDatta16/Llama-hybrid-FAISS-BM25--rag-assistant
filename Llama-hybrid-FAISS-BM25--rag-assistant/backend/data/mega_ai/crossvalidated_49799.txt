How to test for a break in a time series cycle

I've been scratching my head over this issue and would appreciate some help. I have a time series from 1920-2011 which I've used a Baxter Kings filter on to detrend. I would like to test whether the series has fundamentally changed between periods 1950-1979 and 1980 to 2009. Spectral analysis shows periodicity is increasing in frequency, but I would like to go at this in more ways than just that. Spec analysis also says that coherence is unity at each frequency, which seems suspect to me. If anyone has any ideas, please throw them out there, I would be so appreciative!
