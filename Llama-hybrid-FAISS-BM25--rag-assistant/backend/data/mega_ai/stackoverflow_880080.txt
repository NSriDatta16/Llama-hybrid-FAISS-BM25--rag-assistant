Adding text labels to sliders in iPhone Settings application

When configuring a Settings.bundle as part of an iPhone application bundle, it's trivial to add minimum and maximum value images to sliders (PSSliderSpecifier), but not simple maximum and minimum text labels. http://developer.apple.com/iPhone/library/documentation/PreferenceSettings/Conceptual/SettingsApplicationSchemaReference/Articles/PSSliderSpecifier.html iPhone gurus: Is anyone aware of a simple means to apply text labels to these sliders for use within the Settings application (therefore, no slider subclassing shenanigans; it all has to be done via a plist)? I suppose I could just use an image of the label but...ew. Bonus points if there's a way to show the current value of a slider in some sort of number format.
