Time series regression with instrument variable

I want to know what model I should use to make causal inferences with time series variables with the instrument variable method. For instance, I want to estimate the effect of price on sales. I have an instrument variable for the price variable. Price and advertisement are endogenous and non-stationary. $Sale_t = Price_t + Advertisement_t + error_t$ My first thought is difference all the variables and run TSLS. Then I think the potential problem is that the lagged effect of price on sale is not considered. Should I use a VAR model in this case? Then the question is, how can I use instrument variables in a VAR model?
