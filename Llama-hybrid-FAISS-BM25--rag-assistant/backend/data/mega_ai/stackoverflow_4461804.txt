android fastScroll only covers part of the list

I have a class which implements expandable list activity . In the XML code (or I can do it in java), I set fastScrollEnabled to true . This does in deed enable fast scroll. BUT fast scroll only works in the top portion of the list. Like I can use the fastscroll thumb bar to scroll the whole list but only works in the top section of the scroll bar. It's not proportionate to the entire list. I can drag the thumb bar to the bottom of the list but it does no scrolling since the listview is already scrolled to the bottom due to the odd behaviour of it only working in the top portion of the list. Confusing I know, I can try to clarify more if needed.... I do implement a custom BaseExpandableListAdapter.
