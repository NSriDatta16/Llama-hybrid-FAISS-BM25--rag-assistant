A generalized randomized mean estimate based on the Chebyshev inequality

Let $X$ be a random variable that does not take on a single value with probability 1. Let “black-box" sample access to the random variable $X$ be given. Let $M_k$ be an upper bound on the $k$ th central absolute moment of $X$ , for $k>1$ . Suppose a probability $\delta$ and an error $\epsilon$ are user-specified. Is the mean $\mathbb{E}[X]$ within $\epsilon$ of the mean of $n$ i.i.d. samples, where— $$n=\left\lceil\frac{M_k}{\delta\epsilon^k}\right\rceil,$$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ ? If yes: Let $f(x)$ be uniformly continuous on the real line. Let $m(\epsilon)$ be an inverse modulus of continuity of $f$ , that is, a function that satisfies $|f(y)-f(z)| whenever $|y-z| . Then is $f(\mathbb{E}[X])$ within $\epsilon$ of the mean of $f$ on $n$ i.i.d. samples, where— $$n=\left\lceil\frac{M_k}{\delta(m(\epsilon))^k}\right\rceil,$$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ ? A partial proof of the first question: $$\mathbb{P}(X\ge\epsilon) \le \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{\epsilon} \tag{Markov's inequality}$$ $$\mathbb{P}(|X-\mathbb{E}[X]|^k\ge\epsilon^k) \le \frac{\mathbb{E}[|X-\mathbb{E}[X]|^k]}{\epsilon^k} \tag{Change of variables}$$ $$\mathbb{P}(|X-\mathbb{E}[X]|\ge\epsilon) \le \frac{\mathbb{E}[|X-\mathbb{E}[X]|^k]}{\epsilon^k} \tag{Simplify}$$ This is already interesting; has the last inequality already appeared in a published work before? I have found the case $k=4$ in Markowsky et al. 1978. Motivation The idea for this comes from the Chebyshev inequality and also from the references below. The answer to this question will help improve my article on randomized estimation algorithms . It was moved out of a more general question on estimating $f(\mathbb{E}[X])$ with a guaranteed error performance .
