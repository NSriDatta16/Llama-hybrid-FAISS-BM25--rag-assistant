So the amount of data you will need depends on how much variation you have in your data. I will give a silly classification problem to illustrate this: Say you want to classify people who eat meat and people who don't eat meat based on data you have on what food your subjects eat every day. For illustrating the idea of variation in data, consider two cases: Case 1): All meat-eaters eat meat every day and all vegetarians never eat meat. Case 2): Meat-eaters mostly eat meat once or twice a week and all vegetarians never eat meat. If case 1 is how your subjects behave, your classification model essentially needs like one day of data to perform a near-perfect classification (whether your chosen model can function under low data is a different question). If case 2 is how people are, you will need at least 7 days of data to make a good classification model. So like Demetri Pananos said, it depends. I don't think there is a magic number of sample points above which all our statistical problems are sorted (like the magic sample size of 30 data points used by biologists). You have to decide it based on how much variation is there in your data. Since you are not intending to do some sort of hypothesis testing (I am assuming), you can take some arbitrary amount of data, see if it gives a good fit and if not try with some more. Now to answer your second question of data a year ago is bad, consider the same example: How long do you think people might take on an average to change their meat-based diet to completely meat-free or vice versa? It is very likely someone who is a meat-eater today was a meat-eater yesterday and two weeks ago. But it might not be a great idea to predict whether someone is a meat-eater based on data on what he ate ten years ago. So think about a reasonable timeframe in which your data can vary. I hope that helps. I am pretty new to this field so I might have some shortcomings in my understanding. Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.
