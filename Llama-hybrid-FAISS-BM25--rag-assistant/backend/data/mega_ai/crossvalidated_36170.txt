Among other spatio-temporal techniques, the Kriged Kalman filter can be a solution. The spatial smoothing captures the spatial low frequencies thanks to the Principal Kriging Functions and seems comparable to that of thin plate splines. RBF are used if the covariance kernel is square exponential. See Sujit K. Sahu and Kanti V. Mardia A Bayesian kriged Kalman model for short-term forecasting of air pollution levels Applied Statistics 2005, vol. 54 pp. 223â€“244. as well as later papers by the authors on spatio-temporal modeling.
