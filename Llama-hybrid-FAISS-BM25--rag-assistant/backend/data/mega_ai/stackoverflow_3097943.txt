Sort of. If you are using innoDB as your main storage engine, there is a configuration option called thread_currency that you set in my.cnf that is suggested to be set at 2x the number of CPUs you have. If you're using MyISAM mainly, then no. In either case, if you haven't already enabled the mysql slow query log ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/slow-query-log.html ) on that machine, and haven't tried EXPLAINing ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html ) all your select queries, do that first, as hardware may not be your problem.
