Perhaps the prediction being the same as the input reflects that your network is under-trained. So called persistence model for time series prediction, is often used a baseline for other models. Persistence model is using the last observation as a prediction. It is simple and often yields reasonable accuracy. My guess is that your network starts by learning the persistence model, and only if you train it more and it is possible to make a better model, it will learn it - but this requires a lot of training.
