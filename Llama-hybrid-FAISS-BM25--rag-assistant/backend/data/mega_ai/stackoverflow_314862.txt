You can also separate presentation out from code and just use a templating system without needing to bring in all the overhead of a full-blown framework. Template Toolkit can be used by itself in this fashion, as can Mason , although I tend to consider it to be more of a framework disguised as a templating system. If you're really gung-ho about separating code from presentation, though, be aware that TT and Mason both allow (or even encourage, depending on which docs you read) executable code to be embedded in the templates. Personally, I feel that embedding code in your HTML is no better than embedding HTML in your code, so I tend to opt for HTML::Template .
