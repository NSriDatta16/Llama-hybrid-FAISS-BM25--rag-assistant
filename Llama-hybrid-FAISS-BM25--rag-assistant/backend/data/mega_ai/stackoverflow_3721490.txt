I would say no, they are not the same concept, noting that a JAR can be used like an assembly. If you really want to get your head around a JAR file, just think of it as a ZIP file. That's all it really is. Most often, that archive contains compiled class files. And most often, those class files are arranged in a hierarchal fashion corresponding to the class's package. But JAR files frequently contain other stuff, such as message bundles, images, and even the source files. I'd encourage you to crack one open with the unzip client of your choice and take a look inside. The JAR format is however the most common way of packaging a distributable for a Java library or application so in that way they are very similar. From a language standpoint, JAR files are in no way required to make a Java application or library, nor would I say they are intrinsic to Java, however both the standard library and the JDK has support for dealing with JAR files.
