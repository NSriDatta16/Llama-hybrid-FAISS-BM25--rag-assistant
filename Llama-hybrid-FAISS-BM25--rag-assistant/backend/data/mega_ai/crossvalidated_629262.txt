Interpretation of interaction (time x intervention) in an intervention study when baseline values are unequal

I came across an intervention study that measured a significant decrease in a specific treatment group. However the starting conditions where not the same and are like*: So there is a difference between group a and b, but it was before the intervention that the two groups differed. I imagine that such interaction 'effect' can be likely something like regression to the mean and that, given the null hypothesis is true, the observation of an effect is more likely when the starting conditions were different (since the changes correlate with the starting condition, a higher starting value is more likely to decrease). So I simulated ten thousand data sets for a 2x2 design based on a null hypothesis that all four groups are the same. I computed p-values of two t-tests. One for the difference in the starting conditions. One for the difference in the change between time points $0$ and $1$ . I created a scatter plot for the p-value of the second t-test conditional on the p-value of the first t-test (I used an average of the second t-test, conditional on binned p-values of the first t-test). And it appears that we observe a lower p-value for the interaction effect, when we already have a low p-value for the t-test of the starting conditions. If the starting conditions are different, then we are more likely to observe a significant interaction effect (assuming that the null hypothesis is true). Question: Are there methods (asside from ensuring equal starting conditions during the assignment of treatments/interventions) that correct for this sort of regression to the mean? Are there examples of types of analyses, like hypothesis tests, that have accounted for this effect? For example, possibly a Bayesian approach will be less influenced by differences in starting conditions? *: The example here is simplified. The specific data and study are from Figures 2S and 3S from the supplemental information of the study "Cardiometabolic health improvements upon dietary intervention are driven by tissue-specific insulin resistance phenotype: A precision nutrition trial" by Trouwborst et. al. **: code for images set.seed(1) sim = function(n=10) { y0a = rnorm(n,2) y0b = rnorm(n,2) y1a = rnorm(n,2) y1b = rnorm(n,2) p_start = t.test(y0a,y0b) $p.value p_exp = t.test(y1a-y0a,y1b-y0b)$ p.value return(c(p_start, p_exp)) } p = replicate(10^4,sim()) pc = seq(0,1,0.05) k = length(pc)-1 ### number of bins conditional_p = rep(0,k) p_condition = (pc[-1]+pc[-(k+1)])/2 for (ki in 1:k) { sel = which((p[1,]>pc[ki])*(p[1,]
