Examples where simple classifier systems out-perform deep learning

I have been working on a problem where published results using deep learning are substantially worse than results I have obtained on the same task (using the same experimental protocol) using simple statistical methods (in this case, multinomial logistic regression). I'm wondering if this is not an uncommon event. Can anybody provide concrete examples where deep learning performs demonstrably worse than simple classifier systems?
