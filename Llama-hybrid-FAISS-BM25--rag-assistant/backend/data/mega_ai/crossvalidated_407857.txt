Two logistic regression or one Softmax regression

The following question is from Geron's Hans-On Machine Learning book. Suppose you want to classify pictures as outdoor/indoor and daytime/nighttime. Should you use two Logistic regression or one Softmax regression classifier? The answer the books gives is that Need to use two Logistic Regression classifiers since these are not exclusive classes (i.e. all four combinations are possible). However, the part I don't understand is that we can make them into following four exclusive classes: Daytime and Outdoor Nighttime and Outdoor Daytime and Indoor Nighttime and Indoor This way we still cannot use Softmax regression classifier? Thanks!
