Like the others mentioned, you should absolutely not do it this way, even if it was possible. Facelets is a pure XML document that's parsed by an XML parser for the sole reason of creating the component tree. As such it's only used for component layouting. There is no facility whatsoever to include any kind of scriptlet. Technically there are a few tricks which more or less would give you the (wrong) idiom you're after. E.g. you could put that code fragment in a backing bean and call it via an EL expression at the start of each page. You could also create a Java based custom component and place that at the start of each page. Finally you could define your own custom EL function containing that code and call that. But I can't stress enough however that such an approach is plain wrong . Use the filter or phaselistener suggested by mmanco and Bozho. If you can't live with this, then maybe JSF and Facelets is just not the best technology for you and you'll be better off programming in JSP or PHP.
