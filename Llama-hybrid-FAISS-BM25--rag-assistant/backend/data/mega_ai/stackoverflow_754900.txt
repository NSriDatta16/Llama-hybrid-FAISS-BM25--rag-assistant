Prepending and animating text loaded via AJAX with jQuery

Old hand with Prototype, new to jQuery, and writing a simple app to get a feel for the framework (and because I want to use it). I've got an HTML fragment that I load via AJAX, and I want to stick this at the top of a div , with a slide-in transition animation. This bit works, and does the prepending bit: // Get the HTML fragment and stick it at the top of the containing div. $.post("/create_new_thing", function(data) { $('#container_div').prepend(data); }); What I'd like to do, and can't figure out, is animate the newly added HTML fragment with a show() effect. Any suggestions?
