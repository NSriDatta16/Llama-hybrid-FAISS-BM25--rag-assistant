This may help answer your question, from the FAQ : Is it thread safe to modify Element values after retrieval from a Cache? Remember that a value in a cache element is globally accessible from multiple threads. It is inherently not thread safe to modify the value. It is safer to retrieve a value, delete the cache element and then reinsert the value. (emphasis added by me)
