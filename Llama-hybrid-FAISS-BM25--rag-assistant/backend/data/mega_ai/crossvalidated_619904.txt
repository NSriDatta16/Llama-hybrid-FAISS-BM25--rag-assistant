Suddenly the door opens... (Diabolical laughter) - Nobody expects the Simpson's Paradox ! You are asking if the combined metric can be calculated as a weighted average of the metrics within groups, but it's not that simple. As Simpson's paradox shows us, it is possible for the in-group metrics to be completely different from the total metric. In simple scenarios there are possible corrections , but there is more to this than just taking the weighted average. So the general answer is "no", you should not expect that you could simply combine the metrics within groups and get the correct total. Also not for all the metrics averaging them makes sense, e.g. weighted average or mean squared errors does make sense, but for RMSE (square root of MSE) it doesn't, as you would need to square the RMSEs first and average the MSEs.
