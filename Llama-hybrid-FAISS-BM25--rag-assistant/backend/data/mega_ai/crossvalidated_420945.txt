Most multiclass models return the most probable class, or the max of the probabilities. So if A, B, and C have probabilities 0.34, 0.33, and 0.32, you will get A. If they have probabilities 0.01, 0.01, 0.98, you will get C. The concept of a threshold really doesn't work here. I find it is useful to know each class's probability. In my two cases above, the prediction for C is much more reliable than the prediction for A. But you wouldn't know this just by looking at the predicted class, or just the probability of that prediction. You need to see all three predicted probabilities. That is why models that provide such information are very useful. For instance, XGBoost does not provide that probabilities for all the classes, at least not in python anyways.
