Formula to determine minimum sample size for logistic regression

I was researching logistic regression's critieria, and I found in many different sources that the ideal sample size = (10 * #of explanatory variables) / (probability of least frequent observations) Can anyone explain the reasoning behind this formula? I want to understand why this formula is used before I blindly use it to determine if my sample size is large enough for a logistic regression model to be accurate.
