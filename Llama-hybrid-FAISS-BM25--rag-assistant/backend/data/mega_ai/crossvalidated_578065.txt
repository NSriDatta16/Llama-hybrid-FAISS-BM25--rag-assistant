You either need to construct the covariance matrix, as stated, which you could quite easily do by a) analyzing the data from each study e.g. using logistic regression and outputting the estimates along with their covariance matrix, or b) based on theoretical asymptotic considerations, which should give you a very similar results with a reasonable number of events. Alternatively, you can just switch to logistic regression instead of trying to figure out the correlations, for which the input format would be one record per study arm (containing a studyid, the number of cases and the denominator). E.g. a (exact, if you worry about small sample size effects with very few events in some arms of some studies) logistic regression with treatment main (fixed) effects and study main (fixed) effects is a way of doing a fixed effects meta-analysis for binomial data. If you want a random effects meta-analysis, you would additionally specify a study random effect on the treatment effect.
