Datatype misalignment exception(0xA0000002) on ARM processor

My application runs well on HTC HD2 which has Qualcomm 1GHz Snapdragon processor but when try to run on Windows professional emulator 6 or PIDION which has ARM processor, it crashes with datatype misalignment exception. Can anyone please help me out to find why it crashes and how to resolve it. According to this link, __unaligned should solve the crash but did not work in my case.
