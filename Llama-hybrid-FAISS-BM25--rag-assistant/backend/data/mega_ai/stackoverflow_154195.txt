I beg to differ, Wikipedia is pretty clear on this. In computer science, marshalling (similar to serialization) is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission. It is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)
