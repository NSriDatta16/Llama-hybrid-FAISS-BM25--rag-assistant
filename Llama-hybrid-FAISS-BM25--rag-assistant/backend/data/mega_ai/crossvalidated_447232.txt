Factorization of Proper Scoring Rules

Suppose that we have a joint probability distribution $P(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$ . Given a sample $x = (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ , the proper scoring rule log score can be computed as follows: $$S(P,x) = \log P(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$$ If the components are independent then the density can be factored as $$P(X_1,X_2,...,X_n) = P(X_1)P(X_2)...P(X_n)$$ hence the score is: $$S(P,x) = \log P(x_1)P(x_2)...P(x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log P(x_i)$$ In general it is possible to conduct inference with any proper scoring rule such that: $$S_n(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n S(P_\theta,x_i)$$ given the sample is generated $IID$ by minimizing/maximizing the above expression. My issue is that factorization of the joint distribution doesn't imply a summation of individual scores for other types of scoring rules. So how come we can do inference using $S_n(\theta)$ with a proper score other than log score by summing up (or averaging) individual scores?
