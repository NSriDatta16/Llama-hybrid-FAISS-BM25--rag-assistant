Yep. Similar to how MusiGenesis has answered, you won't be able to do much without keeping the device up and running. Similar to how some phones will notify that "Game/App Running" and thus your battery is being slapped around. What about writing an interface from your phone to leverage text messaging (which still works) and get it to send a text message to the web service? Would that be possible? I'm guessing that sort of method might also stop running, but I figure it's a thought?
