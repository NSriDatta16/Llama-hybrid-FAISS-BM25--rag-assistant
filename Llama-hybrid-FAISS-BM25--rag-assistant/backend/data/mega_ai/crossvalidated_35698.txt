Comparing Hierarchical Linear Model with non-HLM techniques

I'm a fairly inexperienced statistician fighting a huge deadline and just need some peace of mind that I'm not making a massive error here. I'd be most grateful for any pointers. I've been working on fitting an lmer() model that explores the spatial relationships between crime and socio-economic factors. The ICC demonstrates a 40% attribution of variances to group factors, which is encouraging. The model's evolution has seen a steady improvement of AIC scores. I am now a little confused about how to demonstrate its effectiveness against other non-HLM techniques. Is this purely by standard error residuals, or am I missing something important?! Many thanks
