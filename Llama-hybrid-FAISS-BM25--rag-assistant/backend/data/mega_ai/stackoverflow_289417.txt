It could be the system caching references to your images in memory, assuming you have just drug in the images from the media browser in IB the code underneath is probably using the UIImage imageNamed : method... You could try loading all the images with imageWithContentsOfFile : , or imageWithData : and see if it behaves the same (dragging in unfilled UIImageViews in IB and setting contents in viewDidLoad :). Read the UIImage class reference if you'd like a little more detail, it also describes which methods are cached. If it's the cache it's probably OK though as the system would free it if needed (did you also try hitting the Simulate Memory Warning in the simulator?)
