You should consider the Cross Correlation Function as that is meant to identify the lead/lag relationship. Dirk had mentioned the Autocorrelation Function, but that is meant for just one single time series and not for multivariate. You should consider looking at the Box-Jenkins textbook Chapter 10 where they introduce the steps do this. You say your data is noisy, but if it has a pattern where the lead/lag response is strong then you will find significance.
