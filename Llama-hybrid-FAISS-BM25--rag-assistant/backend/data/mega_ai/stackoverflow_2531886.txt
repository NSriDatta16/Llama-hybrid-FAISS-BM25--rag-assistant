Subclassing UIScrollView for drawing w/o views

I'm contemplating subclassing UIScrollView (the way UITextView does) to draw a fairly large amount of text (formatted in ways that NSTextView can't). So far the view won't actually scroll. I'm setting contentSize, and when I drag, I see the scroll indicator. But nothing changes (and I don't get a drawRect: message). An alternate approach is to use a child view, and I've done this. The view can be over 5000 pixels high, however, and I'm a bit concerned about performance on an actual device. (The other approach, be like UITableView, would be a huge pain -- I'm "porting" Mac Cocoa code, and a collection of views would be a huge architecture change.) I've done some searching, but haven't found anyone who is using UIScrollView to do the drawing. Has anyone done this and know of any pitfalls?
