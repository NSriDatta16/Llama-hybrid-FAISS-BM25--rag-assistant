TagLib# Windows distribution? Or another good ID3 reader?

I wanted to write a quick program to get the file organization of my MP3 files back into sync with the info in my ID3 tags... I had tried to get the Windows Media Format SDK, but when I go to install it says it can only run on WinXP. I found someone on here suggest TagLib#, which looked REALLY good, from the code examples. Problem is it seems the official site is gone, and the other links I've found to a hosting on Novell's servers is also down. Anyone know where I can still get a distro of TagLib# for C#/VB.NET for Windows? Or another good ID3 tag reader?
