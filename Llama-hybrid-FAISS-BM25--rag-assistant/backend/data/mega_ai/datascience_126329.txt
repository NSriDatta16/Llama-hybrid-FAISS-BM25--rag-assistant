Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score: is this suitable to measure quality of individual generated image or only for group of generated images?

If I want to measure the quality of the images generated from GAN, what metric should I use and any reference for it so that I can check how it's done? I was thinking of using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score, but had one doubt. Is FID score suitable if we want to measure the quality of individual images? Or, FID only used to compare distribution of n real images vs n generated images?
