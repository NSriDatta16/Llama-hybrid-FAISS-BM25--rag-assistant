You would probably be better off using whatever tool you usually use for managing your time/schedule than having some specialized tool. Be it Outlook, Sunbird, Lightning, a PDA, cell phone, paper calendar, etc. Just use whatever tool you normally use for keeping track of dates. [ADDITION] To elaborate, the reason you want it all in the same place as the rest of your important dates is that it ensures (at least a little) that you pay attention to the list. If you're using some other kind of program, it's too easy to get busy for a couple weeks, and forget to look at your special tool, and end up letting something expire that shouldn't expire.
