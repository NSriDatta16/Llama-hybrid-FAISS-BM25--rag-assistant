The units or the scale does not affect what is predicted by the model, in logistic regression, linear regression or any kind of regression I can think of. The fitted coefficients will simply compensate the scale effect completely, so that the difference is strictly invisible to you. This is not true, however, if you use regularization or if the scales are so different that the gradient algorithm fails to find the good coefficients. The latter is rather unlikely if the software you use is mature. However, using regularization can truly impact the result: it says that "coefficients" must be "rather small", and how small depends on the scale and unit. The best way to make sure scale/units has no influence on your predictions is to normalize the data first: divide each input variable by its standard deviation or use a normalization utility provided by the software.
