Related objects in reportingviewer 10.0.0.0 give #error

In my VB.net apps i make use of Linq2SQL and Reportviewer with RDLC reports. With Visual Studio 2010 they upgraded this reportviewer component so you can use the newer RDL specification from 2008. Now I've a problem to show related objects. For example assume you provide an order to the datasource of the report and then you can show something like Fields!Customer.Value.Name where Customer is a related entity. I also got the error in my immediate window: Warning: The Value expression for the textrun ‘Name_1.Paragraphs[0].TextRuns[0]’ contains an error: The specified operation is not valid. (rsRuntimeErrorInExpression)
