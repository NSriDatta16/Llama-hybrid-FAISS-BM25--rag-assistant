SQL Server agent job account issue

I am using SQL Server 2008. I am confused about which account will be used when a SQL Server agent job runs. My confusions are, SQL Server agent as a Windows Service which we could control from Windows Service Management Console, from there we could set the account to run SQL Server Agent (LocalSystem in my computer); Could I set SQL Server agent job level account to run on? Could I set in each step which account SQL Server agent job step will run on? I have above confusions because 3 different account systems may be used and my concern is what is the actual account each step will run on, and I want to avoid any permisson issues (i.e. I want to make sure the account have enough permission.). Any comments or advice? Appreciate anyone could clarify the 3 levels of accounts, which makes me very confused. thanks in advance, George
