Depends on what Your infrastructure is. We're just using debian packages and buildbot to make them. On other setups, I use Fabric scripts. As for format, I'm just using tbz2 files, but I've heard about people just depoloying eggs. I'd strongly recommend having proper build and having BuildBot/Hudson to build packages, as using SCM beats the purpose and encourage bad practices.
