How would I intercept HTTP traffic in a Cocoa application?

Ok so what I want to do is create a background agent that monitors http traffic to/from a certain application and performs actions when there are requests and responses to a certain website. Is there a good way to do this in Cocoa? I'd like to avoid using really low level sniffing and/or requiring root access to do this (admin access is ok).
