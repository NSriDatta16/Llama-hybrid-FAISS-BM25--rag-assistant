A standard approach for this is a hierarchical model, in which there is a random company effect so that the years are correlated within company. This is presumably what you meant when you referred to panel data. Alternatively, one could of course treat the records as independent, but that is typically an untenable assumption that leads to inappropriately overconfident conclusions. A random company effect improves a lot over this, but assumes all years are equally correlated for the same company. Time series methods or more sophisticated random effects structures (e.g. allowing for a different correlation over time) relax this assumption and are even more likely to correctly reflect the real correlations in the data. None of these things get you around the fact that year and macroeconomic variables are mixed up. So, if that variable is of interest, it may be tricky to say much about it. 10 years may well be too short to give you enough variation that is not mixed up with specific years. Other countries (ideally very different ones) with different macroeconomic situations one be one way to try to deal with that, but may not help (availability of data, some trends may be the same globally etc.).
