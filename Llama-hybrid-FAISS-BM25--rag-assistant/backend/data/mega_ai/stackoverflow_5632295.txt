jQuery Draggable IFrameFix

I have a little problem with the jQuery Draggable IFrameFix. I have a container (as shown below) with an iframe inside of it. I turned on the iframeFix in my draggable setup, but it doesn't change a thing. Anyone who had the same problem or anyone who might know how to solve this? No support for iframes This if my javascript code. $(".container").draggable({ snap: ".snapper_col", containment: "#element_container", handle: '.opt1', snapTolerance: 20, iframeFix: true, cursor: "crosshair", start: function(ev,ui){ }, drag: function(ev,ui){ }, stop: function(ev, ui){ } }); Thanks!
