How to move OpenLayers Vector programmatically?

The API documentation for OpenLayers.Feature.Vector says that Vector itself has no methods at all. I know how to let user move the Vector by adding OpenLayers.Control.DragFeature control to map. So if the user can move the Vector then there has to ba a way to move it programmatically too. But I can't figure out how to do it.
