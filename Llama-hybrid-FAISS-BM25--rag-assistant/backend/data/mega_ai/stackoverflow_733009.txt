You would not typically organise your SQL database in quite this way. What you are describing are two entities (Meeting & Participant) that have a one-to-many relationship. i.e. a meeting can have zero or more participants. To model this in SQL you would use three tables: a meeting table, a participant table and a MeetingParticipant table. The MeetingParticipant table holds the links between meetings & participants. So, you might have something like this (excuse any sql syntax errors) create table Meeting ( MeetingID int, Name varchar(50), Location varchar(100) ) create table Participant ( ParticipantID int, FirstName varchar(50), LastName varchar(50) ) create table MeetingParticipant ( MeetingID int, ParticipantID int ) To populate these tables you would first create some Participants: insert into Participant(ParticipantID, FirstName, LastName) values(1, 'Tom', 'Jones') insert into Participant(ParticipantID, FirstName, LastName) values(2, 'Dick', 'Smith') insert into Participant(ParticipantID, FirstName, LastName) values(3, 'Harry', 'Windsor') and create a Meeting or two insert into Meeting(MeetingID, Name, Location) values(10, 'SQL Training', 'Room 1') insert into Meeting(MeetingID, Name, Location) values(11, 'SQL Training', 'Room 2') and now add some participants to the meetings insert into MeetingParticipant(MeetingID, ParticipantID) values(10, 1) insert into MeetingParticipant(MeetingID, ParticipantID) values(10, 2) insert into MeetingParticipant(MeetingID, ParticipantID) values(11, 2) insert into MeetingParticipant(MeetingID, ParticipantID) values(11, 3) Now you can select all the meetings and the participants for each meeting with select m.MeetingID, p.ParticipantID, m.Location, p.FirstName, p.LastName from Meeting m join MeetingParticipant mp on m.MeetingID=mp.MeetingID join Participant p on mp.ParticipantID=p.ParticipantID the above should produce MeetingID ParticipantID Location FirstName LastName 10 1 Room 1 Tom Jones 10 2 Room 1 Dick Smith 11 2 Room 2 Dick Smith 11 3 Room 2 Harry Windsor If you want to find out all the meetings that "Dick Smith" is in you would write something like this select m.MeetingID, m.Location from Meeting m join MeetingParticipant mp on m.MeetingID=mp.ParticipantID where mp.ParticipantID=2 and get MeetingID Location 10 Room 1 11 Room 2 I have omitted important things like indexes, primary keys and missing attributes such as meeting dates, but it is clearer without all the goo.
