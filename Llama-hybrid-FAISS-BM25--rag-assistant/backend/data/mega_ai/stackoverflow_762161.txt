Well, a question like "what is the best way for data access" is rather vague. You may want to be a bit more specific on your needs and especially what database you intend to use or whether tat is still open. Having said that, SqlCE with typed or untyped Datasets and/or direct Commands is solidly supported. There are also options to hook that into the sync framework. To add a little more info, there is a SqlCeResultset that is more efficient (memory wise) than a regular Dataset. Make sure to investigate that option. In short: create a normal typed dataset first, then find the properties of the XSD file and change Custom_Tool to MSResultSetGenerator Concerning the uploading, forget RDA. Take a look at the Patterns&Practices Disconnected Service Agent or the Sync Services for ADO.NET
