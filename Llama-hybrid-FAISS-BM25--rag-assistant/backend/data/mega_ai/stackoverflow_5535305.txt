Your code "example" contains tons of code not directly contributing to the problem (why data doesn't end up in realArray as expected). Reducing the amount of code before posting would have given you valuable insight into which parts of code are not faulty, and possibly uncovered the bug before you even had to ask. Even worse, you dumped 500 lines of code on us and it does not even compile ( FThis.h is missing, copying the required function declarations into the example would have been trivial.) And once I fixed the declarations and added #include so I don't get diagnostics about atoi() not being declared, I still get several warnings regarding stuff like this... char letterGrade('NR'); // character constants may only have *one* character ...or this... int i(0); int numOfArrayBox(5); // This is broken on several levels; chiefly, "i Hint: for ( int i = 0, int numOfArrayBox = 5; ( i ...and at that point, I'm somewhat reluctant to spend more time debugging your code. Try Machete Debuggung and asking questions the smart way . But I have a general hint for you: This is C++, not C. In C++, you don't use arrays of arrays, because you organize your code and data object-oriented . Define a class (say, class Student ), which contains the data (name, ID, grades), does the validation of data in the constructor, and also contains the functions to operate on that data ( sumOfAssignments() etc.). And when you need a collection of students, use instead of arrays: #include // ... std::vector class; Student input( "John", "Doe", 420012345, 64, 71, 89, 91, 88, 75 ); class.push_back( input ); Bottom line, your problem is not about realArray not containing the data you want, your problem is that you jumped into deep C++ water while still wearing (C) swimmies. Try reducing your example into something compiling without warnings and clearly exhibiting a single problem, and we will be able to give you a concise answer.
