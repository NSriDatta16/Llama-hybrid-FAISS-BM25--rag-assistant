This is more a comment than a solution because, disclaimer, I don't know what the correct solution is. The two main approaches I would recommend trying are L2-penalisation LASSO and dynamic linear models. L2-penalisation LASSO model in theory should find the optimal allocation of budget within a limit. In particular I think L2 would be better suited over L1 as L1 tends to result in more 0 coefficient parameters which I am assuming would not be an appropriate solution. The downside here is that it doesn't account for any time dependencies or non-linear relationships. Its been a long time since I studied dynamic linear models but my memory is telling me that they can essentially be thought of as a time varying regression model. This would help account for the time series nature but again doesn't help with the budget limits or non-linear relationships. Personally I would run both of the above and see if they provide similar solutions. If they do then great thats good evidence for a solution, if they don't then indeed there is a more complicated underlying process for which I personally don't know how to account for :)
