As Sean Patrick Floyd noted, Sessions are not components, so the automatic injection supplied for Wicket components doesn't apply. A common idiom for injecting stuff in a non-component is to add the line InjectorHolder.getInjector().inject(this); to the constructor. I haven't used this for a WicketSession extension, but I don't know of a reason it won't work. In JavaEEComponentInjector , the inject method is almost certainly doing a JNDI lookup, and you could do a JNDI lookup yourself to get the object, but this is reusing the existing injection, and if you decide to change injectors (say by extending JavaEEComponentInjector ), it ensures that you'll continue to use the same injection.
