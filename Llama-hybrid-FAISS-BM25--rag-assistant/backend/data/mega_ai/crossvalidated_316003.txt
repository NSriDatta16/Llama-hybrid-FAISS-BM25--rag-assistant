Parameter Tuning for Random Forest Text Classifier

I train a binary random forest classifier on skikit-learn's 20 newsgroups dataset. I want to tune the parameters and try so by gridsearch and 3-fold crossvalidation on the training data. Is there any problem with that methodology? For the max_depth parameter i get the really high value 500 and that seems quite too much. Any advice?
