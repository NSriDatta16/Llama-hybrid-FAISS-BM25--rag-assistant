A goodness of fit test for two discrete distributions with unequal variance?

I have a computer simulation in which a virtual agent end up in different areas of a layout based on several factors. There are 18 conditions, so the data (you can find the csv file for a toy dataset here ) would look like this: If I collapse the datapoints into bins, where each bin is one of the areas, the data would look like this: x0 Note that if I would be to repeat the simulation, it would produce exactly the same results. Now I would like to validate this model having human subjects going trough the same conditions, but I run into two sets of issues: the first issue is due to the fact that the dataset is discrete and small (there may be less than 5 counts in a bin, and that's a problem for a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test), also there may be ties. After some online digging I found two options: a permutation test a Cramer-von Mises test of goodness-of-fit (see this paper ) I thought the Cramer-von Mises test of goodness-of-fit test could work, so I ran it with made-up data for one human subject and I get the following result: x0 Cramer-von Mises test of goodness-of-fit >Null hypothesis: distribution ‘ecdf(x1)’ >data: x0 >omega2 = 0.14667, p-value = 0.4106 So far so good. But now let’s say I would like to have more than one human subject , let’s say four of them: x2 Now I run in the second set of issues: on the one side I have a single computer simulation, on the other side I have data from four subjects. Should I take the mean of the results for the human subjects? Then would my data still be “discrete”? Or should I run my simulation four times? But I would get always the same results, so the variance between the two datasets would be different. Any ideas? Maybe I should change the design and have more levels for my factors, so that I have more trials and the bins get bigger?
