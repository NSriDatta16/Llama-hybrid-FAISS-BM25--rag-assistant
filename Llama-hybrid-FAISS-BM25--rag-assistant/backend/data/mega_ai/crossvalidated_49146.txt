I don't know how to calculate class-specific accuracy. It sounds to me that each class accuracy is the same as overall accuracy. No, class-specific accuracy it is not necessarily the same as overall accuracy. In addition, you need to be careful of the actual definition: there are several possibilities for both terms. Wikipedia is a good starting point. It is about binary classification, i.e. two classes that are mutually exclusive. Depending on your field and problem, sensitivity and specificity positive and negative predictive value producer's or consumer's accuracy precision or recall are names for different types of class-specific classification accuracy. The overall accurracy may be the average sensitivity (for binary classification, you can use average of sensitivity and specificity) average positive predictive value (for binary classification, you can use average of pos. and neg. predictive value). the average may be weighted to give each test sample or each class the same weight, or weight each class according to its prior probability (prevalence). Extensions for more complicated situations, like multiple classes, classes not mutually exclusive (one-class classifiers) exist. Bottomline: you need to define carefully what kind of accuracy you want to measure. In general, you'll want to report at least two performance measures (the pairs in the first list are common pairs of measures to be reported together). Proportion of variance doesn't need to have anything to do with the classification accuracy, here's an example in R: > df pca pca Standard deviations: [1] 10.1435332 0.5011764 Rotation: PC1 PC2 x -0.999995404 -0.003031692 y 0.003031692 -0.999995404 > pca$sdev^2 / sum (pca$sdev^2) # % variance [1] 0.997564748 0.002435252 > plot (pca$x, asp=1, pch = 19, col = df$y + 1) The first PC explains more than 99.7% of the total variance, yet it doesn't help at all for the classification into red or black. But the 0.25% of variance in the second component allow perfect classification.
