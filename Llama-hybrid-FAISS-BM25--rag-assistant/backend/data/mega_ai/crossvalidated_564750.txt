How to predict t+2 until t+5 when use multivariate time series?

I want to make stock price predictions for the next 5 days. For example, to predict the closing price on the t+1, I will use the closing price, the lowest price, and the highest price on the t, (t-1) to (t-10). This is allowed right and does not include data leakage? What I'm confused about is how to make predictions on t+2 to t+5? I read that to predict t+2 and so on, we use the predicted data from the previous day. However, in this case, I only predict the closing price. For example, to predict t+2 I will use the predicted closing price at t+1, but what about the data for the lowest price and the highest price at t+1? Is the multivariate time series unable to make predictions for t+2 and so on? and do I have to use multistep multivariate time series in my case?
