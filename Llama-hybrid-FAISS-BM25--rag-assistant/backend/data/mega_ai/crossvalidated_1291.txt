As you have found out there are no easy answers to your question! I presume that you interested in finding strange or different book stores? If this is the case then you could try things like PCA (see the wikipedia cluster analysis page for more details). To give you an idea, consider this example. You have 26 bookshops (with names A, B,..Z). All bookshops are similar, except: Shop Z sells only a few History books. Shops O-Y sell more romance books than average. A principal components plot highlights these shops for further investigation. Here's some sample R code: > d = data.frame(Romance = rpois(26, 50), Horror = rpois(26, 100), Science = rpois(26, 75), History = rpois(26, 125)) > rownames(d) = LETTERS #Alter a few shops > d[15:25,][1] = rpois(11,150) > d[26,][4] = rpois(1, 10) #look at the data > head(d, 2) Romance Horror Science History A 36 107 62 139 B 47 93 64 118 > books.PC.cov = prcomp(d) > books.scores.cov = predict(books.PC.cov) # Plot of PC1 vs PC2 > plot(books.scores.cov[,1],books.scores.cov[,2], xlab="PC 1",ylab="PC 2", pch=NA) > text(books.scores.cov[,1],books.scores.cov[,2],labels=LETTERS) This gives the following plot: PCA plot http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/7263/tmplx.jpg Notice that: Shop z is an outlying point. The others shops form two distinct groups. Other possibilities You could also look at GGobi , I've never used it, but it looks interesting.
