Is it normal for logistic regression, to have predictors which have good Wald's Chi Sq, but still bad performance?

I have trying to build a logistic model with some 10 variables. All of those variables have Wald Chi sq value The concordance: 55.1%, Discon:28%, Tied: 17%. Is this behaviour normal? What can I do, to decrease the ties and increase concordance?
