Filter size in CNNs and how they relate to overfitting/underfitting

Would a smaller filter size (e.g. 3x3) potentially be more prone to overfitting than a larger filter size (e.g. 10x10) in a CNN. I know it's all dependent on the specific dataset at hand, but I'm just trying to understand this in terms of the bias variance tradeoff. In my interpretation, having a smaller filter size would train the CNN to identify more local patterns in each input image, potentially leading to greater variance (and the overfitting problem), while a larger filter size would lead to better identification of more global trends in each image, potentially leading to greater bias (subsequently underfitting). Is this interpretation correct in theory? Thanks
