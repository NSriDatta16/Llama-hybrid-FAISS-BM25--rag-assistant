Is this a blackhat SEO technique?

I have a site which has been developed completely in flash. Now the site owners do not want to shift to a more text/html based site. So am planning to create an alternative html/text based site which the googlebot will get redirected to. (By checking the useragent). My question is that is this allowed officially by google? If not then how come there are many subscription based sites which display a different set of data to google compared to the users? Is that allowed? Thank you very much.
