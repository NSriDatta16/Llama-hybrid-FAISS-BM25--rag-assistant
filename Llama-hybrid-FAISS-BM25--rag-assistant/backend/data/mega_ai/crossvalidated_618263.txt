Confused about AUC of 0 from a logistic regression classifier with a non-informative predictor

I am using logistic regression as a classifier to predict the variable Group (old/young) from a variable called Sentence_length. When I plot density functions of Sentence_length by Group, it is clear that that two groups are totally non-separable using Sentence_length: And indeed, the coefficient of Sentence_length in a GLM model that predicts Group from only Sentence_length is completely non-significant (p=0.84). However, when I use logistic regression with leave-one-out cross validation, I obtain an AUC of 0, which implies complete separation in the logit space (though in the opposite direction, predicting old to be young and young to be old). I plotted here the density function of the predicted values (logit scores), so you can see that the Groups are indeed totally separable: This makes no sense, because the predicted values in logistic regression are supposed to be a monotonic transformation of the input. Are they not? I.e., higher score on sentence length should increase the probability of one class vs. the other, and hence increase its logit transformation as well. It can't be that from a completely uninformative variable that provides absolutely no separation between the groups, we receive perfectly separable scores. What am I missing here? How can this be? Here is my code written in R to obtain the predicted values and the AUC: # Initialize data frame to save the scores and true labels Real_labels $Score_length[Real_labels$ Subject==sub] $Group, Real_labels$ Score_length, auc=T, percent=T, ci=F, plot=F, show.thres=F, quiet=T, direction= " Please find the .csv file with the relevant data frame here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qVbm1ZbQmTsrAapW_pmJWTH6H4XoZ1Ds/view?usp=sharing Your help is highly appreciated! Thank you!
