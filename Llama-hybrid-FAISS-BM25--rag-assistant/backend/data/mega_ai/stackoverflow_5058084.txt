Fast way to convert directed to undirected graph (array of lists) in python?

I'm trying to convert a set of arcs to a set of edges for some simple visualization work. my arc data currently looks like: ( ['A','B',2], ['B','A',3], ['A','C',4], ['B','C',2], ) I need to convert it to edges, so the directions are combined, looking like this: ( ['A','B',5], ['A','C',4], ['B','C',2], ) I'm thinking there should be a very pythonic way to do this, but not sure what the most elegant way is.
