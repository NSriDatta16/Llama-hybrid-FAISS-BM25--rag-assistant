Treating 'Don't know/Refused' levels of categorical variables

I am modeling Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the Center for Disease Control (CDC). One of the independent variables is High Blood Pressure. It is categorical with the following levels 'Yes', 'No', 'Don't know/Refused'. Should I remove those rows with 'Don't know/Refused' while building the model? What difference does it make to keep or remove those rows from the model?
