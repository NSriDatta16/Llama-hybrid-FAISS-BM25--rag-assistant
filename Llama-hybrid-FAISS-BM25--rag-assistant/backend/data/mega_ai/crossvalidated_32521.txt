I think that there are no universal solution. So, I try yo give a couple of general advices. If problem dimension is high you have to use MCMC gingerly, in this case another methods are seems to be more helpful. Another point - are variables you consider independent or not. If they are you can use Expectation Propagation or a method which takes this issue into account. Also, you can test your distributions do they have close-to-normal form. In this case you can just plot them or use some normality hypothesis testing. If they are close to normal you can use gaussian or Laplace approximation
