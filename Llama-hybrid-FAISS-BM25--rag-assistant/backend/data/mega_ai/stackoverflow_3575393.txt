Creating a .net webservice stub with xml storage

I've been asked to come up with a .net web service stub for multiple similar webservices which will: implement create/read/update/delete/find for an arbitrary object. hold persistent xml data for objects of that type. Is there anything out there that does this job already or anything that can make the job of creating it easier?
