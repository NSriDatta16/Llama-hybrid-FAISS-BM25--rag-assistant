Converting C++ code to HTML safe

I decided to try http://www.screwturn.eu/ wiki as a code snippet storage utility. So far I am very impressed, but what irkes me is that when I copy paste my code that I want to save, ' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML#Character_references ) invariably screw up the output as the wiki interprets them as either wiki or HTML tags. Does anyone know a way around this? Or failing that, know of a simple utility that would take C++ code and convert it to HTML safe code?
