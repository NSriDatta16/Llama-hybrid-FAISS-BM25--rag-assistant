How can I implement drag-out-to-delete in Flex?

I have a List component from which I'd like to be able to remove items using drag & drop, but without having a specific target. If you use the mac, the behaviour I'm looking for is something like what the Dock uses; when you drag something out of the bounds of the control it should get an icon that indicates that it'll be deleted (OSX uses a cloud or something?) and then if you release it it will be removed from the list. How can I do this? (If I need to provide a more clear description, please comment; I'll fill in what I can)
