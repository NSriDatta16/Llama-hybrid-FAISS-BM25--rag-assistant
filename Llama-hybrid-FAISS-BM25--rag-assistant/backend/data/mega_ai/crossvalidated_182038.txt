Piironen and Aki recently published a paper comparing several variable selection methods from a Bayesian perspective. They ultimately recommend fitting a full model and projecting its information onto sub-models; further details and a working example with R and Stan code are provided in the supplement to their paper. A subsequent publication details an extension of the method to Gaussian Process models.
