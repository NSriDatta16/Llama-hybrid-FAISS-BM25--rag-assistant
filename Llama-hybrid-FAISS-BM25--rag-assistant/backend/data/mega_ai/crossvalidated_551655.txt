How to incorporate time element in logistic regression to build a failure prediction model?

I would like to build a model that can predict the probability of failure for individual components of a system. What I have is historical data of component failures recorded in the last 30 years. I am thinking of formulating the problem as a binary classification (Failure: 1, Non-failure: 0) using logistic regression. The challenge, however, is the nature of the data, illustrated in the figure below. As you can see in the figure, the components in the system were not all installed at the same time. Moreover, some of the components failed quickly compared to the others. Further, there are right-censored data (all components that have not failed). Even though I am only interested in the probability of failure and not the exact "time-to-failure" for individual components, I would like to somehow incorporate the time element in my model for three main reasons (in addition to addressing the different data types): I would like the predicted probability of failure to be for the next n-specified years e.g. probability of failure of Component X within the next 5 years is p. My understanding could be wrong here but if I considered the entire 30-year period the prediction will be for the next 30 years, correct? I would like to somehow incorporate the concept of component degradation over time in the model. To explore if the effects of predictors vary over time. To incorporate the time aspect, I am thinking of breaking the 30-year period into shorter study intervals and doing progressive logistic regression (left to right in the figure). I have seen similar concepts with pooled logistic regression and repeated measures logistic regression (Wu and Ware, 1979), but I wanted to check if this approach actually does address the concerns that I have. Also, I wanted to ask if I can add predictions from the model from the preceding time interval as input (degradation term proxy) to the following model. What kind of challenges does this bring?
