Java code/library for generating slugs (for use in pretty URLs)

Web frameworks such as Rails and Django has built-in support for "slugs" which are used to generate readable and SEO-friendly URLs: Slugs in Rails Slugs in Django A slug string typically contains only of the characters a-z , 0-9 and - and can hence be written without URL-escaping (think "foo%20bar"). I'm looking for a Java slug function that given any valid Unicode string will return a slug representation ( a-z , 0-9 and - ). A trivial slug function would be something along the lines of: return input.toLowerCase().replaceAll("[^a-z0-9-]", ""); However, this implementation would not handle internationalization and accents ( Ã« > e ). One way around this would be to enumerate all special cases, but that would not be very elegant. I'm looking for something more well thought out and general. My question: What is the most general/practical way to generate Django/Rails type slugs in Java?
