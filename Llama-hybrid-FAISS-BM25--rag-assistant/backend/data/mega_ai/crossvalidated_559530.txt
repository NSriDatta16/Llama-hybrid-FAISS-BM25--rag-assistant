In logistic regression: points above the line labeled as positive and below as negative

I have two primary questions on logistic regression from a geometric point of view. Why points above the line is labeled as positive and below as negative? Why we write value of y as (w^t * x) / ||w||, where (w^t * x) / ||w|| is the distance between the point and the line?
