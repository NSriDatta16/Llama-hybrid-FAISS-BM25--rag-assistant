What is the curse of dimensionality?

Specifically, I'm looking for references (papers, books) which will rigorously show and explain the curse of dimensionality. This question arose after I began reading this white paper by Lafferty and Wasserman. In the third paragraph they mention a "well known" equation which implies that the best rate of convergence is $n^{-4/(4-d)}$; if anyone can expound upon that (and explain it), that would be very helpful. Also, can anyone point me to a reference which derives the "well known" equation?
