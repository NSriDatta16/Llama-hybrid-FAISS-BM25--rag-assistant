Changing the number of columns for the New Products grid widget in Magento

How do I change the number of columns for the New Products grid widget in Magento? I know I have to update the layout.xml file somehow but I'm not sure what to insert.Or maybe do I have to do a layout update in the CMS pages that include the widget?
