While this approach looses one of the main advantages of DCNN's; it can be done utilizing sequence classifiers, see Kera's Sequence tutorial or Jason Brownlee's http://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/ note: you'll likely have just as much accuracy as if you did a Bayesian classifier, which is going to be easier to visualize and troubleshoot. A note that you want to ensure the classes are separable and not bi-modal; so you do want to plot your training space to ensure you have enough classes. If one class is bi-modal, just figure out how to break it into two classes. Also note that the old-style Neural nets typically never out-perform a Baye's classifier. It's only been the recent advances in DNN that do.
