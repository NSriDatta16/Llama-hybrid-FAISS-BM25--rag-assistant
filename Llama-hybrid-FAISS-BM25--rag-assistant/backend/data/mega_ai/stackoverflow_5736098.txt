In ASP.NET setting the ID doesn't mean the DOM element will represent the same ID You have an onclick event handler, try removing that. Instead I would add a class onto it and do something like $(function() { $('.my-text-box').click(function() { alert('Clicked!'); }); }); The ID property of a control in ASP.NET WebForms is what will get used when building the control tree. If you look at the actualy ID in the DOM it probably says something like MainContent_txtAgentName instead. You might want also to take a look at setting the ClientIDMode http://beyondrelational.com/blogs/hima/archive/2010/07/16/all-about-client-id-mode-in-asp-net-4.aspx If you're using ASP.NET 4.0 you can use this will render verbatim what you have in the ID attribute as the actual ID on the DOM.
