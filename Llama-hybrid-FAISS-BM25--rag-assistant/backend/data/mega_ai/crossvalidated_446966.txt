Difference between glm and optim for likelihood value on logistic regression in R

I still confuse my previous question on here1 and here2 . About logLik of logistic regression in the case of proportion(=yes/yes+no). I try to validate it using optim() by following program. But it was not same. (I could check the same value in the case with “weight=n”). When estimating as the proportion without “weight=n”, I can’t understand how to estimate log-likelihood . Please give me some advice. logLik() : -1.547104 optim : 2.474444 x |z|) #(Intercept) -2.0608 3.0155 -0.683 0.494 #x 0.5152 0.7038 0.732 0.464 # Null deviance: 0.85152 on 3 degrees of freedom #Residual deviance: 0.25523 on 2 degrees of freedom logLik(modelcp) #'log Lik.' -1.547104 (df=2) #-----optim f1 $par #[1] -2.0608361 0.5152331 #$ value #[1] 2.474444 it was same, “with weight = n” #-----glm modelcp my previous question1 : Difference between binary and count data of same data on logistic regression in R my previous question2 : Difference between with and without “weight” option of the same data on logistic regression in R
