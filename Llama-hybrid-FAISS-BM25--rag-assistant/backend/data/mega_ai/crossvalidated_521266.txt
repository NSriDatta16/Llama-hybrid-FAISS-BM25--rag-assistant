How to calculate the value of one predictor at which probability of response=0.5 in a multivariate GLMER model?

I've developed a glmer model to predict the presence/absence of a certain behavior based on multiple environmental predictors (temperature, windspeed, precipitation). 14 animals were observed continuously throughout the daylight hours over multiple days, and data were summarized over two-hour periods. The response is the proportion of the two-hour period that the individual spent performing the behavior, and the predictors are the average temperature, windspeed, and precipitation over that two-hour period. Because the response variable is a proportion, I've included a weighting factor in the model. I'm most interested in the relationship between temperature and the response behavior. The model is specified as: Model I'd like to calculate the temperature at which, with other predictors (precipitation and wind speed) held at their mean values, the probability of the response = 0.5, and I'd also like to calculate 95% confidence intervals for that estimate. I found these threads , which describe how to adapt the dose.p function to work with glmer models. I've used those as a basis for my code: dose.p.glmm However, this code was written for glmer models with a single predictor variable. Is there a way to adapt my code to specify that in calculating this, I want to hold precip and windspeed at their mean observed values and then find the value of temp at which the probability of the response=0.5? And if not, is there another way to calculate that value and its 95% confidence intervals?
