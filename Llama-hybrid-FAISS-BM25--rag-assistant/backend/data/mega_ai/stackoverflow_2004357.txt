MagentoCommerce development environment domain issue

I am working on a ecommerce based on MagentoCommerce . I use 3 environments: dev (on my local machine), staging and production (both on my dedicated server). The problem is that when I want to switch from local to staging, I have to edit my hosts file to point the domain used by Magento to my server's IP. However, this is time consuming and I was wondering what other magento developers out there were using as a strategy to not always have to change the hosts file when switching from an environment to another. Plus, when my ecommerce goes into production, I'll have to deal with 2 environments on the same IP. The best would be if Magento had the domain hardcoded in only one file. That way I could keep different config files in each environment. Is that the case ? Otherwise, what places are domains "hard coded" ?
