You seem to have made up your mind that you want to turn this 6-30 variable, which for all we know may communicate finely grained information, into a coarser 1-5 variable which figures to have lower reliability. Also that you want to conduct an ordinal logistic regression. To tell you the truth it's hard to see good reasons for these decisions. Moreover --and backing up--it's not always obvious that 6 different rating items will yield a valid and reliable indicator if summed to create a composite. You'll see why if you browse through threads on this site related to the tags of scale, composite, psychometrics, and/or Likert.
