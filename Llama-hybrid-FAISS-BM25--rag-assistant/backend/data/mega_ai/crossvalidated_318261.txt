How to create a cause specific hazard function for a nonparametric Bayesian model for survival analysis?

I am reading an article on a nonparametric Bayesian model for survival analysis with competing risks, which can be used for jointly assessing a patientâ€™s risk of multiple (competing) adverse outcomes. Let $D=\{X_i,T_i,k_i\}_{i=1}^n, X_i\in\chi$, a d-dimensional vector of covariates associated with subject $i$, $T_i\in\mathbb{R}_+$ is time until an event occur. $k_i\in K$ the type of event that occurred, $K=\{\varnothing,1,\dots,K\}$ being a set of K mutually exclusive, competing events that could occur to subject $i$, and where $\varnothing$ is right censoring $T$ is a multivariate random variable, $T=(T^1,\dots,T^k)$ where $T^k,k\in K$ is the net survival time of a subject with respect to event $k$. They assume that $T$ is drawn from a conditional density (which I don't understand on which condition they base themselves upon). function that depends on the subjects covariates. For every subject $i$, we only observe the occurrence time for the earliest event, that is to say, $T_i=\min (T_i^1,\dots,T_i^k), k_i=\arg\min_j T_i^j$ The cause specific hazard function $\lambda_k(t,X)$ represents the instantaneous risk of event $k$ and is formally defined as : $$\lambda_k=\lim_{dt\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{dt}P(t\le T^k I don't get the $?$ part. First because it seems that it is already taken into account in $P(t\le T^k\dots$ part. Second as far as I am not sure about what we are talking about here : we only take events $k$ such that the net survival time of a subject with respect to these event is greater than $t$ for a given d-dimensional vector of covariates associated with subject $i$ ? That is to say the events that may occur at $t$ and kill someone ? Is it the instantaneous probability of death at $t$, conditional on survival until $t$ ?
