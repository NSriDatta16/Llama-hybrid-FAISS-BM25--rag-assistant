The easy way would be to simply remove the DNS entries for 'www.mysite.com', so the only DNS entries that exist are for 'mysite.com'. Alternatively, here's a couple of techiques for redirecting to a canonical URI: http://www.kalyani.com/2010/01/redirecting-to-canonical-url-in-iis7/ https://web.archive.org/web/20211020203216/https://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/072810-1.aspx http://www.stevenhargrove.com/redirect-web-pages/ Basically you want to hand back a 301 Moved Permanently status for the non-canonical URIs, along with the canonical URI so the user agent may load it instead.
