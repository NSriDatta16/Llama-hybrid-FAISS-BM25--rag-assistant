Tutorial OpenCl event handling

In my last question, OpenCl cleanup causes segfault. , somebody hinted that missing event handling, i.e. not waiting for code to finish, could cause the seg faults. Since then I looked again into the tutorials I used, but they don't pay attention to events ( Matrix Multiplication 1 (OpenCL) and NVIDIA_OpenCL_GettingStartedLinux.pdf ) or talk about it in detail and (for me) understandable. Do you know a tutorial on where and how to wait in OpenCL? Merci!
