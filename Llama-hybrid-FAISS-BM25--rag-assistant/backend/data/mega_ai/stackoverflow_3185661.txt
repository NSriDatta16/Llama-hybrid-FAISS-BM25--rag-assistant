If i understand you correctly then you cannot optimise the process in its current form. What you can conisder though is switching to a more elegant file upload solution such as SWFupload , Uploadify or Plupload (to name a few) . This will provide you with a graphical file upload progress bar so you dont have the same sense of the browser hanging.
