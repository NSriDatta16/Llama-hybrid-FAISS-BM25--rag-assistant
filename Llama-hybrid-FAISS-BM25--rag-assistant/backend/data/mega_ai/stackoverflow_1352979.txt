I think the biggest problem is that you're attaching event listeners to functions, instead of functions-as-event-handlers to buttons. Those lines near the end of your first block should probably be like this: homeBtn.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, btn1Press); Or instead, there's a property page within Flash on buttons where you can attach a "Click" handler for that button. You should try Flex Builder. What you're building here really feels like something that should be built in Flex rather than Flash. Flex has a lot of the pretty transitions and such, and it's easy to build something in Flash Professional and drop that into a Flex project. This will fix much of your style and organization problems. There are many other flaws in this code, not all of which are fatal, just ugly: In AS, like JS, semicolons at the end of statements are optional, but it's still a good idea to add them. (Line 1, "stop()".) You've reinvented 1980's style BASIC here, complete with "GOTO LINE". Switching to Flex is one way to improve your code style, since Flex Builder enforces many good style rules. If you have to stick with Flash Professional only, there are probably Flash design patterns to avoid this in that environment, too. Get a book on AS3-heavy Flash development. I'm sure you'll find lots of good style advice there. Ditto with the numbered controls, only that brings you up to beginner-class VisualBasic. btn1Press(), for example, should be called something like homeButtonPressed(). A year from now, you'll have to go clicking all around the Flash development environment to figure out what "btn1" is. If you call the button and the functions it calls by their meaning , you won't have this problem.
