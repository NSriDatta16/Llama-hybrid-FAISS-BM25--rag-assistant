Restoration of gender balance after wars - what principle underlies this?

I am wondering what is the statistical principle that underlies the following observation. After every war in history, the male population of a given region would severely decline, tipping the male/female ratio from its usual (roughly) 50/50% to one that favours females by a more-or-less dramatic difference. Still, it seems to me that this balance somehow always picks up on its own, such that in a relatively short period, the gender ratio becomes balanced again. I haven't looked up the numbers, but I believe that in post-war Germany, it didn't take more than half a decade for the balance to reach 50/50 again. That's very short when compared to an average 25 years per generation. Obviously, even if people specifically wanted to re-establish the gender balance, this could only be done by increasing male natality or/and increasing female mortality, none of which is possible/desireable. Yet, it seems the balance is restored whether people want to or not. Rather than being a series of coincidences, I'd bet there is a statistical explanation for this phenomenon. What comes to my mind is the principle of regression to the mean, however that doesn't seem to be a good explanation, since the "extreme values" initially encountered were not part of random sampling but were due to an external - and biased - change at the level of the population, namely increased male mortality in wars.
