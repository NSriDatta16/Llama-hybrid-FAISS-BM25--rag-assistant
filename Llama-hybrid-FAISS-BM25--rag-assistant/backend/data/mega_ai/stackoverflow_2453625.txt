Using a single visual studio 2005 solution with multiple source control applications

In my recent SO question I was helped tremendously in using git as a front-end to ClearCase. However actually trying the suggested answer(s) led to further complications. Visual Studio keeps a reference to the used source control provider in both the .sln as well as the .csproj files. I tried resolving this issue by keeping a modified copy of the .sln with the source control provider paragraph removed but this did not help since each project also has some source control provider information. I don't want to keep private copies of all the projects since this would be a maintenance nightmare. Do any of you have suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
