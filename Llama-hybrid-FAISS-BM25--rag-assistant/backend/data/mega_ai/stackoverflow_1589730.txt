Java: flushing memory out to disk

Let's say I have a Java application which does roughly the following: Initialize (takes a long time because this is complicated) Do some stuff quickly Wait idly for a long time (your favorite mechanism here) Go to step 2. Is there a way to encourage or force the JVM to flush its memory out to disk during long periods of idleness? (e.g. at the end of step 2, make some function call that effectively says "HEY JVM! I'm going to be going to sleep for a while.") I don't mind using a big chunk of virtual memory, but physical memory is at a premium on the machine I'm using because there are many background processes.
