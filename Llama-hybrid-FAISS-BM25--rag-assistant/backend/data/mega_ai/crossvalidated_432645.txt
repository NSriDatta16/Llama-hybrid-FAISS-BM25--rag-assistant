Explanation of Equation 5.3 from Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning

I am currently reading through C. E. Rasmussen & C. K. I. Williams' Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning and was going through chapter 5. I could not exactly understand the derivation of equation 5.3. It would be helpful if any of you can explain how the equation was derived. My attempt was as follows: \begin{equation*} P(w |X, \theta,y, H_i) = \frac{P(\theta | X, y, w, H_i).P(y | X, w, H_i).P(X|w, H_i).P(w|H_i).P(H_i)}{P(X, \theta, y, H_i)} \end{equation*} In the numerator, the first and the third terms are 1. I do not know how the authors derived the numerator.. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here $w$ , $\theta$ , $y_i$ , $X$ and $H_i$ are respectively the model parameters, the model hyperparameters, the labels, the data and the hypothesis set.
