What exactly does the term "inverse probability" mean?

I keep seeing the term "inverse probability" mentioned in passing albeit without any explanation. I know it has to do with Bayesian inference, but what exactly do we mean by inverting a probability? My thinking at the moment is that in "normal" probability we take outcomes of random experiments and try to estimate probabilities based on the outcomes of these experiments whereas in "inverse probability" we're interested in going from a probability (a prior for an unknown quantity) to knowing the "outcome of an experiment", the experiment being finding out the value of an unknown quantity (i.e. via the posterior, and maybe finding the MAP hypothesis). That is, in "conventional probability" we go from outcomes of an experiment to probability vs. in inverse probability we go the other way: we go from a prior to uncovering the outcome of an experiment.
