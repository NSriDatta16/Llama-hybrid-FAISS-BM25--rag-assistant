Python and text manipulation

I want to learn a text manipulation language and I have zeroed in on Python. Apart from text manipulation Python is also used for numerical applications, machine learning, AI, etc. My question is how do I approach the learning of Python language so that I am quickly able to write sophisticated text manipulation utilities. Apart from regular expressions in the context of "text manipulation" what language features are more important than others what modules are useful and so on.
