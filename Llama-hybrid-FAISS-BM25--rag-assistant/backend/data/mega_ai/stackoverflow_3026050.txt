See Gepsio: XBRL Document Object Model for .NET to load XBRL documents. Checkout the Gepsio Documentation for a basic example to implement it. See Rivet Software Dragon View XBRL Viewer to view XBRL taxonomies. Unfortunately, XBRL's momentum on .NET platforms is very slow so documentation on how to implement it will be hard/impossible to come by.
