How can I organize collections of strings in OOP?

I am writing an application that sends command line commands to a 3rd party application. So I have a list of commands like: "process images" "apply effect blur" "save as png" ... I don't know how to best organize them in OOP style. Right now I have: switch ( e.KeyCode ) { case Keys.A: SendCommand ( "process images" ); break; case Keys.B: SendCommand ( "apply effect blur" ); break; case Keys.C: SendCommand ( "save as png" ); break; ... } I want to be able to do this in a clean way. Maybe like: SendCommand (Commands.ApplyBlur) , etc. But I don't know which way is the best. I thought of storing these in a collection but thought it wouldn't be clear or reasonable.
