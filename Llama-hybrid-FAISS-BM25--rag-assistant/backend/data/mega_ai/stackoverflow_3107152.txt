If someone has defaulted to one browser (let say Chrome), you cannot ask the current browser (using JavaScript) to open the link to a specific browser (i.e. you want Internet Explorer instead of Chrome). I am not sure about Flash or Silverlight's ability to do what you want. I have found a technique but it is specific to VBScript inside Excel and it may need the UA agent check to make sure it works correctly for a target environment if you want to adapt the similar code in Silverlight: http://www.mofeel.net/87-microsoft-public-excel/30085.aspx
