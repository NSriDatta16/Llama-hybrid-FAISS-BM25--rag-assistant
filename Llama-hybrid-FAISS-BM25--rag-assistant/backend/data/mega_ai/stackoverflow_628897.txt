If you open it in an external editor, there are two possibilities: there is no guarantee that the changes you make will work (and not break anything) in the Netbeans UI Editor The next time you edit the file in Netbeans it will be regenerated. Either way, probably not what you want. The best thing to do would probably be to make the whole design up in the gui editor and when you are happy with it, delete the comments and continue on. [sarcasm] With the drag and drop gui editor, what could you possibly want to change by hand anyway? [/sarcasm] ;)
