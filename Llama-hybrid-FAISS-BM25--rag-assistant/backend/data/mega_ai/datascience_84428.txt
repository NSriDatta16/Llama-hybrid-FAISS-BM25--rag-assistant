In case the con(text) is not too complex, you will not necessarily need a neural net to classify the text. Often a simple „bag of words“ with a ridge regression will do the job. This is more efficient (less code, less tuning). Find a minimal example of (binary) text classification here: https://github.com/Bixi81/R-ml/blob/master/NLP_regression_bag_of_words.R
