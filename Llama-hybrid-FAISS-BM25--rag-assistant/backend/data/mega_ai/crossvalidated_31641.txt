Do inputs to a Neural Network need to be in [-1,1]?

I want to create an weather forecast using Neural Networks. All the examples I saw used only values [-1,1] as an input. Is it also possible to use bigger values (like air pressure, degree calcius of the last couple of days,...) as inputs and get an number as output? Thank you
