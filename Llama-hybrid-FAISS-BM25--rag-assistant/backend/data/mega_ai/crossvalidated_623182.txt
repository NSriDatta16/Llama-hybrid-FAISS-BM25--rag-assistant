Welcome to CV.SE! $V$ is indeed a descendant of $X_2$ , as is $X_1$ , which violates the conditions of the back-door criterion. Additionaly, $X_1$ is a collider ( i.e $c$ in $x\rightarrow c \leftarrow y$ ) in some of the paths going through the $\textrm{budget}$ element ( e.g. $X_2 \leftarrow \textrm{budget} \rightarrow X_1 \leftarrow V \rightarrow \textrm{organic search} \rightarrow Y$ ), so it must not be in $Z$ . Pertaining to your second question: if there's a back-door path which cannot be blocked ( i.e. d -separated) by any element set, that means that you can't establish a causal relationship by observation alone; you need to set up an experiment where you explictly intervene on some variables and watch what happens with the others. In the example, one experiment might comprise intervening on the search queries $V$ independently of the non-search contributors $X_2$ and the consumer demand, which would break the parental relationship among them. Then, conditioning on $Z = \{\textrm{consumer demand}, \textrm{budget}\}$ ( $X_1$ is a collider in some of the paths, so it can't be in $Z$ ) would allow you to establish the causal relationship between $X_2$ and $Y$ .
