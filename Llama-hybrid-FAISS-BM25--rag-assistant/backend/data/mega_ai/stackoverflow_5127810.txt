If you are using ANT 1.8+, you could specify a URL and host the common build fragment on a website. Since Ant 1.8.0 the task can also import resources from URLs or classpath resources (which are URLs, really). If you need to know whether the current build file's source has been a file or an URL you can consult the property ant.file.type.projectname (using the same example as above ant.file.type.builddocs) which either have the value "file" or "url".
