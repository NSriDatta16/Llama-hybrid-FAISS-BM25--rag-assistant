As the lead developer of Nagare, I really encourage you to try it in real on your product, which is the best way to see how Nagare is truely different than the others frameworks like Django, Pylons or Flask. Nagare is components oriented (it shares the same components model than Seaside ) and its set of advance features like direct callbacks registration, stateful components, Ajax without to write any Javascript code or the use of continuations makes a Web application looks like a desktop one. In fact we have often found that developers like you, without prior Web experiences, can be quicker to get Nagare because they have nothing to "unlearn". Talking about reliability, scabability and compatibility, you can check some of our important projects in production today. For more info, don't hesitate to ask and share your experiences with us .
