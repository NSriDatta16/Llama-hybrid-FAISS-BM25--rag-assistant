Component doesn't have a way to do this. However, one option would be to use a static map and provide a wrapper around it so you can query for data relating to any UI (or other) object. I've done this sort of thing before and as long as you set it up as a kind of service with interfaces, it can be pretty elegant and doesn't break your OO design.
