You can read about forecast package for R by Rob J. Hyndman and its auto.arima function. The package is described in the paper Automatic Time Series Forecasting: The forecast Package for R . It uses the following defaults max.p = 5, max.q = 5, max.P = 2, max.Q = 2, max.order = 5, max.d = 2, max.D = 1, start.p = 2, start.q = 2, start.P = 1, start.Q = 1 Since the package implements what you are trying to do (and does it very well), it would be worth checking.
