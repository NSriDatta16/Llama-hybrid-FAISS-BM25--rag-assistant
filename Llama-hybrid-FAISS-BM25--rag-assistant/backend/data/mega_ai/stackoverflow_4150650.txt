If you're using C#, grab SharpPcap and look at the examples in code to get a feel for how it works. Set the filter to only capture UDP, capture a packet, parse it to udp, and extract the payload. The payload's format is based on the application sending it. There's a lot of extra gibberish because every udp packet contains a stack of: Ethernet header IP header UDP header of information before your data and all incoming data is in binary format until you parse it to something meaningful.
