use CreateUserWizard control to create records in your own database

When dragging a CreateUserWizard control into the ASP.NET application, the "Create user" button uses the default database: "aspnetdb" to insert or create the new user. I want to use the CreateUserWizard control of ASP.NET to create my own users (from my own database), but I cannot do so, because I cannot access the click event of the submit button whose text is "Create user" (that is a part of the CreateUserWizard control) How can I do this? Thanks
