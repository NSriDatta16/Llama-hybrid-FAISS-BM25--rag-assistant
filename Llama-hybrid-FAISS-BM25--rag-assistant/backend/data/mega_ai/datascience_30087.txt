There are alternative solutions for self organizing maps. Best of them I found pymvpa where the example is easy to read and understand. It is also maintained quite activately as you can see from their Github . I tried to run the kohonen 1.1.2 test file, but it did not run after two days of trying. So, let's have a try for the another solution. To run pyMVPA example som.py, you have to do the following (at least): 1 install some pre-requisites: at least numpy, scipy, nibabel and swig to be able to run setup.py 2 run the commands: python setup.py build python setup.py install 3 modify example under doc/examples (som.py) to have import matplotlib.pyplot as pl 4 run command: python som.py Note that this works only in python 2, not python3 can be used as command.
