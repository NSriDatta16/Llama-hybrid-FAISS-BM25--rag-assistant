Forecasting a time series multiple steps ahead

I've been reading up on time series forecasting, but most of what I've come across assumes that we want to predict the next value in a series. As such, I have access to lagged values (maybe I look at t-4, t-3, ..., t when I predict the value at t+1 ). Suppose I want to predict the next two weeks worth of values. Now I run into trouble, because I can make my first prediction using lagged values, but my second prediction ( t+2 ) will be missing the true value for t+1 . I'll have my prediction for t+1 , but that seems far inferior to the using the ground truth. Are there standard ways this is handled in?
