Will borrow Luca Morin's answer from the comments : "yeah some algo can't learn that and need feature engineering. And some algo can, typically NN are universal function approximators (see: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), trees too." Almost all non-linear ML Algorithms can understand Feature Association, but they are much slower than linear ones. Thus Feature Engineering like adding interaction and high-order features with Linear Algorithms is recommended. Would recommend for scikit-learn poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2,interaction_only=True, include_bias=False) for adding interactive features. Keeping in mind that whilst the graph shows a linear interpolation example, it is just to demo the idea whilst the Target variable is a product sum of arrays (non-linear), and thus a linear solution will not fit well without feature engineering mentioned in the above paragraph.
