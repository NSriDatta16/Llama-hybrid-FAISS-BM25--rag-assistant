Using the stats package in R for kmeans clustering

I'm having difficulty understanding one or two aspects of the cluster package. I'm following the example from Quick-R closely, but don't understand one or two aspects of the analysis. I've included the code that I am using for this particular example. ## Libraries library(stats) library(fpc) ## Data mydata = structure(list(a = c(461.4210925, 1549.524107, 936.42856, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 131.4349206, 0, 762.6110846, 3837.850406), b = c(19578.64174, 2233.308842, 4714.514274, 0, 2760.510002, 1225.392118, 3706.428246, 2693.353714, 2674.126613, 592.7384164, 1820.976961, 1318.654162, 1075.854792, 1211.248996, 1851.363623, 3245.540062, 1711.817955, 2127.285272, 2186.671242 ), c = c(1101.899095, 3.166506463, 0, 0, 0, 1130.890295, 0, 654.5054857, 100.9491289, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 789.091922, 0, 0, 0, 0), d = c(33184.53871, 11777.47447, 15961.71874, 10951.32402, 12840.14983, 13305.26424, 12193.16597, 14873.26461, 11129.10269, 11642.93146, 9684.238583, 15946.48195, 11025.08607, 11686.32213, 10608.82649, 8635.844964, 10837.96219, 10772.53223, 14844.76478), e = c(13252.50358, 2509.5037, 1418.364947, 2217.952853, 166.92007, 3585.488983, 1776.410835, 3445.14319, 1675.722506, 1902.396338, 945.5376228, 1205.456943, 2048.880329, 2883.497101, 1253.020175, 1507.442736, 0, 1686.548559, 5662.704559), f = c(44.24828759, 0, 485.9617601, 372.108855, 0, 509.4916263, 0, 0, 0, 212.9541122, 80.62920455, 0, 0, 30.16525587, 135.0501384, 68.38023073, 0, 21.9317122, 65.09052886), g = c(415.8909649, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 637.2629479, 0, 0, 0), h = c(583.2213618, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), i = c(68206.47387, 18072.97762, 23516.98828, 13541.38572, 15767.5799, 19756.52726, 17676.00505, 21666.267, 15579.90094, 14351.02033, 12531.38237, 18470.59306, 14149.82119, 15811.23348, 14637.35235, 13588.64291, 12549.78014, 15370.90886, 26597.08152)), .Names = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i"), row.names = c(NA, -19L), class = "data.frame") Then I standardize the variables: # standardize variables mydata My question is, how can the plot which shows the number of clusters (marked Q1 in my code) be related to the actual values (cluster number and variable name) ? Update: I now understand that the clusplot() function is a bivariate plot, with PCA1 and PCA2. However, I don't understand the link between the PCA components and the cluster groups. What is the relationship between the PCA values and the clustering groups? I've read elsewhere about the link between kmeans and PCA, but I still don't understand how they can be displayed on the same bivariate graph.
