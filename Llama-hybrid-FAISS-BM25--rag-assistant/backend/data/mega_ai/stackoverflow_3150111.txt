Perhaps there is a better way to manage your .htaccess file. Are your redirects for single pages, paths, subdomains, or domains? It may be possible to include an external file, so that your redirects are in their own file and the .htaccess inlcudes that and stays uncluttered. Finally, there may be a better way to maintain your redirects. So rather than focusing on how long to maintain your redirects, save some maintenance work and change your question to ask about mechanisms that make it easier to add and organize your redirects. IIRC mod_rewrite will do this. There has to be a mechanism that will let your server determine redirects by using a script (perhaps query a DB). At minimum, it would be smart to use a script to manage your .htaccess files redirects. An advantage to never having redirects expire is that you also never have to go back in and clean out the old redirects. They just sit there, forever. If you have redirects that expire, you now have a second operation to perform to remove the old redirects. So you're actually doing more work by expiring redirects.
