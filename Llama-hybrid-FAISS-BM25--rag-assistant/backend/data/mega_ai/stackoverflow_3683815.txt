To get the current location of the mouse cursor in text coordinates (not just x,y) you need to do either this: $txt->index("current"); or this (where $x and $y give the mouse cursor location relative to the text widget ): $txt->index("@$x,$y"); The first is definitely more convenient, but the second is needed if you're in the middle of a drag (the current mark isn't updated while any mouse button is down).
