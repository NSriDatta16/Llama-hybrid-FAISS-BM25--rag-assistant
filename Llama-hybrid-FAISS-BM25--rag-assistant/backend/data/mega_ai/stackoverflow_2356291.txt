From StringTokenizer documentation : StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead. The following code should work : String s = "ABC|DEF||FGHT"; String[] r = s.split("\\|");
