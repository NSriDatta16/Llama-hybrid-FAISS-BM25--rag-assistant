Decision tree in sentiment analysis

Creating a classifier to do "Sentiment Analysis" can be done with several algorithms like SVM, KNN, Neural networks,Decision tree... and lately i have read about Decision tree and how it works and i would like to ask if someone can provide me with an explanation and a conceptual representation of how the decision tree will be created to tackle this problem, and what/how attributes will placed in the nodes of the tree to classify a sentiment of a text as positive|negative|neutral ? any help would be appreciated, and thanx.
