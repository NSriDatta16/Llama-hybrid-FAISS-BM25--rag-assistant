In Bayesian terminology, what does evidence refer to?

In Bayes theorem of a parameter $\theta$ with data $D$, we have: $$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$ where I know $P(D)$ as the marginal likelihood. Is it true that the marginal likelihood is referred to as evidence in Bayesian statistics? If not what is commonly refered to as evidence?
