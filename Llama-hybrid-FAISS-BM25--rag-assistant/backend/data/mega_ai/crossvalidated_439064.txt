I'll try answering according to the problem description you gave in the comments. Say that you're waiting for an event to happen, and that event has a PDF $ f_1(x) = exp(-x) $ if $ 0 , but if you've waited until $ t_0$ , the PDF changes into $ f_2(x) = 2 \cdot exp(-2x) $ . You can say that the time ( $x$ ) in the second part is not the time since you began waiting for the event, but the time since you entered that second stage, i.e. $t_0$ : this changes $f_2(x)$ to $ 2 \cdot exp (-2(x-t_0)) $ . Additionally, you know that the probability to reach that second stage is $ exp(-t_0) $ to begin with, so the total probability for the event to happen at any time in the second stage must be multiplied by this factor (or, put otherwise, must sum to this) - giving $ f_2(x) = exp(-t_0) \cdot 2 \cdot exp(-2(x-t_0)) $ To sum it up, you can define the PDF $ f_1(x) = exp(-x) $ if $0 and $ f_2(x) = exp(-t_0) \cdot 2exp(-2(x-t_0)) $ if $ x>t_0$ . From here, it's relatively easy to calculate the CDF: $ F(x) = 1-exp(-x) $ if $ 0 and $ F(x) = 1-exp(-2x+t_0) $ if $ 0
