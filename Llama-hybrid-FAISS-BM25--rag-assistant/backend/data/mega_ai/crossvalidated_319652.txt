Two R functions for Bayesian updating with different output

Basically, I have made two posterior ( ps ) updating R functions; auto1 and auto2 . That is, ps from one set of n and s becomes prior ( pr ) for the new set of n and s . But it seems the two functions produce different posteriors, I'm wondering which function is accurate; auto1 or auto2 ? auto1 #============================================================= auto2
