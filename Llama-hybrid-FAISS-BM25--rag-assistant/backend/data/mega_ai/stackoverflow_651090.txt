That's the namespaces that was selected to be in the template for a new file, in that specific type of project. Different types of projects have different templates and thus different sets of using directives. The using directives were just chosen depending on what's needed for that type of file, and what you are likely to use. The using directive only tells the compiler where to look for classes, so there is no harm in having using directives that is not neccesarily needed by the code, as long as they don't cause any conflicts (ambiguous class names). If you right click in the file and open the Organise Usings submenu, you find the option Remove Unused Usings that you can use to remove using directives that it not needed in the file.
