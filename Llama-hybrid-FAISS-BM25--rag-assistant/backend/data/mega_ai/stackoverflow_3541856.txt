Delphi - Create instance of subclass

I have a class defined as: TfraFrame = class(TFrame); then I have several subclasses all inherting from this, such as: TfraUsers = class(TfraFrame); TfraGroups = class(TfraFrame); TfraMenus = class(TfraFrame); In my main form i have declared variables as: var fraUsers: TfraUsers; fraGroups: TfraGroups; fraMenus: TfraMenus; Now my question is, I would like to have one single function to control the generation of the instances of each class. There should only be once instance of each class, but i only want to create the instances if the user requires them. I would like to pass the variable like this: procedure ShowFrame(Frame: TfraFrame) begin if Frame = nil then begin Frame := TfraFrame.Create(self); Frame.Init(Panel1); end; Frame.Show; end; and call it like this; ShowFrame(fraUsers); I was expecting it to create a instance of TfraUsers (because that is what fraUsers is declared as), however, i suspect it may be creating an instance of fraFrame . Is there a way to create an instance of the type that the variable was declared as?
