There are a variety of tools for working with shaders (such as RenderMonkey and FX-Composer), but no direct equivalent to CoreImage. But stacking up fragment shaders on top of each other is not very hard, so if you don't mind learning OpenGL it would be quite doable to build a framework that applies shaders to an input image and draws the result to an HDC.
