Unable to receive response from the SNMP port

I am using SNMP to access the remote system data. According to the requirement I am encoding the SNMP request data to OAMPDU packet format and sending to remote system. The remote system receives the OAMPDU packet, decodes it and sends the snmp request to snmp agent through UDP socket which is bound to port 161. But I am unable to receive the response from snmp agent. I have created a UDP socket which is bound to 161 port to receive the response. If I use any other free port number other than 161 for receiving SNMP agent does not send responses to that port. Can anyone please suggest me how to overcome this problem? Can we configure the different ports for tx,rx ??? How do we know on which port does snmp sends the response ???
