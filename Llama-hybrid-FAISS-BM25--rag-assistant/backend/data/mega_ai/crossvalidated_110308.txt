Multinomial logistic regression with geepack in R

I am working on fitting a GEE model to a multinomial logistic outcome using the R package geepack . My understanding is that the package uses glm to fit the formula. However, from what I can see, glm doesn't have a family for a multinomial outcome, just binomial. How do you go about fitting a multinomial logistic equation using gee in R? Thanks.
