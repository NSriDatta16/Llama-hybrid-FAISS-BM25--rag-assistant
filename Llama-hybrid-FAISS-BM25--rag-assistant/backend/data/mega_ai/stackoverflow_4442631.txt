public and private are access modifiers for members. This refers to who can access the members directly through code. public means that access is not limited so that anyone can access the member directly through code. private means that access is limited only to the containing class. So everyone can access numberOne directly through code, but only the containing class can access numberTwo directly through code. There are a total of five access modifiers: public : access is not limited protected : access is limited to the containing class or classes derived from the containing class internal : access is limited to the containing assembly protected internal : this is an OR of protected and internal so that access is limited to the containing class or classes derived from the containing class OR the containing assembly private : access is limited to the containing class Note that the clause "directly through code" is critical here; it is possible to access these members using reflection. The relevant section of the C# specification is ยง3.5, especially ยง3.5.2.
