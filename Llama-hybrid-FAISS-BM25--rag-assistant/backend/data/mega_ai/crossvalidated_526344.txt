Centering continuous variables in a multilevel logistic regression model

We are fitting a two-level logistic regression model with continuous variables in Level 1 and no variables in Level 2, except the groups. We considered only a random intercept in the model, but it is possible to consider a random slope for one or more independent variables. What is the best method to center the variables in Level 1, by the total mean or by the group means?
