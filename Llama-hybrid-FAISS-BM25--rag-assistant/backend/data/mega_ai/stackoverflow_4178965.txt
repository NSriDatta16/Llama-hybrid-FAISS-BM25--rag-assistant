What's the easiest way to explain What is Hadoop and Map/Reduce?

It's very easy to explain NoSQL from high level view - it is basically "key-value" storage. Of course with thousand minor and important things, but in general it's just key value storage. What's the best way to explain Hadoop and Map/Reduce? May be some "real world" example which can be easy to give an compare for even newbies? Thanks!
