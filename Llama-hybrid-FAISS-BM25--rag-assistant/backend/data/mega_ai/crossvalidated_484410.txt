How can the function multIndepTest on the R package Copula work?

I'm preparing for the test of dynamic dependence using the copula package, so that I tried to test the independence among the time series of the sample. The function multIndeptest from Copula package doesn't work despite my writing it in the normally correct form as following: multIndepTest(Base3mod,d=5,m=1772,N=1000,alpha =0.05,verbose = interactive() ) where Base3mod is the data.frame Name , 5 is the data dimensions and m is the dimension of the 5 time series. The error text posted is the following: Error in multIndepTest(Base3mod, d = 5, m = 1772, N = 1000, alpha = 0.05, : m should be an integer greater than 2 and smaller than 1 Thank you for explaining to me the error cause.
