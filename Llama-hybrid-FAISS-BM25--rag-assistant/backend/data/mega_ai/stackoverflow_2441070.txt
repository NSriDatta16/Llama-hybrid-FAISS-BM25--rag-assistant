Why I cannot get correct class of a custom class through isKindOfClass?

I've created a custom class AnimalView which is a subclass of UIView containing a UILabel and a UIImageView . @interface AnimalView : UIView { UILabel *nameLabel; UIImageView *picture; } Then I added in several AnimalView onto the ViewController.view. In the touchesBegan:withEvent: method, I wanted to detect if the touched object is an AnimalView or not. Here is the code for the viewController: @implementation AppViewController - (void)viewDidLoad { UIScrollView *scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:... [self.view addSubview scrollview]; for (int i = 0; i However, nothing happened when I clicked on the animal. When I checked the class of hitView by NSLog(@"%@", [hitView class]) , it always shows UIView instead of AnimalView . Is it true that the AnimalView changed to a UIView when it is added onto the ViewController? Is there any way I can get back the original class of a custom class?
