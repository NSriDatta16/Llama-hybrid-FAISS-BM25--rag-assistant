Continuous proportions are sometimes modelled using beta regression. Logit transformation of the proportions are sometimes used. If there are multiple proportions that sum to 1 (compositional data), this is sometimes done via Dirichlet models. These terms should help you find many relevant questions and answers here on CV, and good pointers more generally (google searches are highly productive). references - e.g. Smithson, M. and Verkuilen, J.
