Can I perform a meta analysis with my data?

I have 10 studies who look at a surgery for facial paralysis. The main outcome is time to nerve recovery. I have the mean, SDs for the time in months to recovery but obviously there is no control or baseline data. Do I just use zero for the mean and SD for my pre-op values? This gives me a weighted average which is essentially what Im looking for, but want to make sure I present the date the correct way.
