Online machine learning updates the estimates without re-running the full model. So it is not about having automatised the procedure, but about updating the estimate only based on the previous estimate and the new data (as in the example provided by DanielTheRocketMan ). Re-evaluating the whole caboodle would be computationally expensive in the case of online sales and alike, and also not a good idea for estimates of drifting statistics (e.g. where the underlying model actually changes, as in the case of stock markets or climate change). The classical approach is to use the current estimate as prior and the new data as observation in the Bayesian equation. That is typically not an option in "deep" learning, where the link above lists alternative approaches.
