The tool NDepend for .NET code will let you analyze many dimensions of the code complexity including code metrics like: Cyclomatic Complexity, Nesting Depth, Lack Of Cohesion of Methods, Coverage by Tests... ...including dependencies analysis and including Code Rules over LINQ Queries (CQLinq) dedicated to ask, what is complex in my code, and to write rule. Around 200 default Code Rules are provided. They concern anti-patterns like the Singleton , detection of threading problems , detection of coupling problems like UI layer shouldn't use directly DB types ... A while back, I wrote an article to summarize several dimensions of code complexity: Fighting Fabricated Complexity
