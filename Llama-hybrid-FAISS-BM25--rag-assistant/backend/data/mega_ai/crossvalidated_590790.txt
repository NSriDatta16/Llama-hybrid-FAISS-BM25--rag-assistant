In Python, one good choice for changepoint detection is the ruptures package. If somebody is looking for a Bayesian alternative, the Rbeast package may be worth a try (a package I wrote): https://pypi.org/project/Rbeast or https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast . It is intended for changepoint detection and time series segmentation/decomposition. Unlike nonBayesian methods, it tells not just when and how many changepoints/segments there are but also the probabilities associated with changepoint occurrence (e.g., what is the probability of having 3 changepoints...). Install it via pip install Rbeast . Below is a quick example: import Rbeast as rb nile, year = rb.load_example('nile') # a time series of annual streamflow of the River Nile o = rb.beast( nile, start=1871, season='none') rb.plot(o) rb.print(o) o # see a list of output fields in the output variable o
