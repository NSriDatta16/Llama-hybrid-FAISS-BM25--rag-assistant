Semantic structure in HTML - Subtitles (Pre-HTML5)

I'm new to HTML and want to make semantically correct HTML, however I'm finding it hard to work with what seems to be only headings, lists and paragraphs. Particularly, I can't find a place that makes sense for subtitles. I'm writing a blog site so lets use that as an example: A BLOG TITLE the best blog in the world post_title1 post_title2 post_title3 Semantically 'A BLOG TITLE' is h1. It makes sense to me that the post_titleX are h2, but it doesn't feel right for the subtitle - 'the best blog in the world' to be classed at the same level as them.
