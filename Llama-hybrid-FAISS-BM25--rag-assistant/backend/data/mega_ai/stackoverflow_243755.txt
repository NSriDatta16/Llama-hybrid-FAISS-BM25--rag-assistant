I second opinions that you should choose the iteration method according to your need. I would suggest you actually not to ever loop through native Array with for in structure. It is way slower and , as Chase Seibert pointed at the moment ago, not compatible with Prototype framework. There is an excellent benchmark on different looping styles that you absolutely should take a look at if you work with JavaScript . Do not do early optimizations, but you should keep that stuff somewhere in the back of your head. I would use for in to get all properties of an object, which is especially useful when debugging your scripts. For example, I like to have this line handy when I explore unfamiliar object: l = ''; for (m in obj) { l += m + ' => ' + obj[m] + '\n' } console.log(l); It dumps content of the whole object (together with method bodies) to my Firebug log. Very handy.
