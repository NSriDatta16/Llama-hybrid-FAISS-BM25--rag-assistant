Programatically Remove TCP/IP restriction in XP/Vista/7

My company needs to internally test infrastructure. Our organization is rapidly moving from a very small development environment to a larger more scalable production environment. Specifically we want to flood some of our new request routers from the inside. We need to write the tool ourselves, and it has to be automatable. We can't use third-party tools because, to be frank, they're written by less than scrupulous hats and are virtually all are chock full of malware. To be more specific, the tool is to be written in C# and the first obstacle we have to get past is overcoming kernel imposed restrictions on half-open outbound requests (we're clearly a Windows shop...I wouldn't be posting if we were all Linux). We would be dealing with Vista. Any tips on anything are greatly appreciated. Where to get started, open source tools (so they can be verified to not be malware), anything. Thanks in advance. And no, I'm not a hat or a script kiddie. EDIT: The main goal here is not the actual generation of the traffic (I can do that), but rather programmatically overcoming the OS imposed "10 half-open outbound requests" restriction. Theoretically a single system should be able to spawn 255 of these half-open requests at a time, but the OS artificially locks this down.
