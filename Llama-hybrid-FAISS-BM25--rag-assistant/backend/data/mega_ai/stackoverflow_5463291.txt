File download over HTTP in IE

I am experiencing problems with file downloads (in my DNN module) in IE over HTTPS. It is a known problem in IE ( Microsoft support ) and I found many related articles, like the one here . The post suggests not touching the cache settings for a secure connection in IE. But our code has always been using HttpCacheability.Public. Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Although, when I inspected the headers for the HTTP response in question, it shows Cache-Control: no-cache, Pragma: no-cache How else can these values be controlled?
