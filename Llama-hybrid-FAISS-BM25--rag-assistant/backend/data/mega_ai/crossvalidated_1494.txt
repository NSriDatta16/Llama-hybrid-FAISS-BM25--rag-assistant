How did you normalise your microarray data? Standard ways are: Robust Multichip Average ( RMA ) Genechip RMA - this can be a bit slow for lots of samples. This presentation gives a good overview of the two techniques. There are two R microarray tutorial papers which may also help: A microarray analysis for differential gene expression in the soybean genome using Bioconductor and R ( link to paper ) Analysing yeast time course microarray data using Bioconductor ( link to paper ). Both these papers provide the data and R commands. Competing interest: I'm a author on the second paper.
