Which is better for Data Science, a double major in Math & CS or Physics & CS?

My dream occupation is to work as a Data Scientist. I'm soon going to be completing my first semester as a physics student, as part of an incredibly prestigious physics program. We get to run an experiment at CERN in our third year! I'm currently ranked highly in this program (top 25%), and I could push myself to top 10% if needed. Thing is, I'm not really interested in working as a physicist. Should I switch to Math & CS? (I'd be in a mediocre program.) Note - I'm currently in both physics and CS, not just physics. I'm asking if I should switch the physics major with a math one.
