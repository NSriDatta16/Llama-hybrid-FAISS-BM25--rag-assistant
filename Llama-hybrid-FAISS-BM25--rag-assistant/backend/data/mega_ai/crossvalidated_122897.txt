Inconsistent outcomes of boostraped hypothesis tests on max and median

I am trying to make an hypothesis test using bootstrapping. I compute a quantity Q from a sample set (the exact calculation should not be relevant, but let's say that Q is the average time between two particular events). I have N different sample sets, so that I have Q1...QN . I am interested on the following two quantities: Q_max : this is the maximum of ( Q1, ... QN ) Q_05 : this is the median of ( Q1, QN ) Q_max and Q_05 are therefore two different statistics which depend on N different sample sets. I want to test the hypothesis that Q_max is larger than 0, and also that Q_05 is larger than 0, i.e., the maximum average and the median average are larger than 0. Note: the same procedure should work for every percentile. I start with the null hypothesis which assumes that all the Qi are 0 (which would imply that the median and the maximum and all other percentiles are also 0), i.e., I subtract the mean mu1 from the first sample s1 to obtain sample p1 , so that Q1 is zero, etc. Then I apply bootstrap as follows. I re-sample (with replacement) from p1 and compute the average E1 , I do the same for all samples so that I get all averages E1..EN . Then I compute E_max=max(E1..EN) and E_05=median(E1..EN) . I do the same process 10000 times, now I have an empirical distribution of E_max and E_05 . Now I can compute the p-value of (the initial) Q_max and Q_05 to reject the null hypothesis. Assume I decide that the max p-value is 0.1. I have two questions: I obtain that the p-value of Q_max is 0.15 (so I cannot reject the hypothesis that the maximum of the means is 0) but I obtain a p-value of 0.06 for Q_05 . This implies that the median is larger than 0 but the maximum is not significantly larger . How is this possible? By logical arguments the maximum should also be larger than 0 if the median is larger than 0? Is the method described above OK?
