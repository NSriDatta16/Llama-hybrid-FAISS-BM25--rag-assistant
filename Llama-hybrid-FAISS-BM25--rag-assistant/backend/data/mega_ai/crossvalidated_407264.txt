Visualize cross over interaction logistic regression categorical variable in R

I have performed a logistic regression with the following variables: X: Categorical with three levels (St, An, Int) M: Moderator, which has two levels (Mob,Desk) Y: Dichotomous dependent variable (0/1) I found no main effect of X on Y or of M on Y but I did find a significant interaction effect between level 'Int' of X with M. Hence, I want to show a graph in which I show the cross over interaction but I can't figure out how. I already read this question ( Plotting logistic regression interaction (categorical) in R ) but I couldn't rewrite this to my own dataset. PS: I am using R in case anyone would kindly like to provide an example.
