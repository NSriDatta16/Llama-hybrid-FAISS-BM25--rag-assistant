Complexity of creating decision boundaries for a a logistic regression with polynomial terms?

I've read in a few places that creating the decision boundaries for a logistic regression with polynomial terms is rather complex and exceeds the complexity of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. I am wondering where this complexity comes from compared to the regular linear logistic regression model? Where is the complexity in fitting the model or in determining where the boundaries are? Thanks.
