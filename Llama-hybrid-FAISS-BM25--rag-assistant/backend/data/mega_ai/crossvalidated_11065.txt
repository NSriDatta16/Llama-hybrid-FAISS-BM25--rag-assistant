If for some reason you know the intercept (particularly if it is zero), you can avoid wasting the variance in your data for estimating something you already know, and have more confidence in the values you do have to estimate. A somewhat oversimplified example is if you already know (from domain knowledge) that one variable is (on average) a multiple of another, and you are trying to find that multiple.
