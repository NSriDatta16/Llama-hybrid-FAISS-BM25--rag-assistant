For what it's worth, I've found it much easier to use a floating-point column for my sort position than to use an integer value. For new records, you would still need a trigger that sets the value equal to the largest existing value plus some constant (say 100). For updating the sort position of an item, though, you can simply find the sort position of the entry before and the entry after the entry you are moving. Average those two values and you have your new sort position.
