Is it possible to do time series forecasting using monte carlo simulation ? If yes , how?

I have gone through some research paper 1 in which forecasting was done using monte carlo simulation. The paper from Davies et al . is one among several papers. I was not able to understand how we can forecast signals after stage 2 (random number generator). Please go through the paper (only monte carlo simulation part is needed) & if possible reply to my query. 1 Davies et al . (2014) The Application of Time Series Modelling and Monte Carlo Simulation: Forecasting Volatile Inventory Requirements. [ link ].
