Is proportional hazard regression unbiased?

I am studying the results from a simple Cox PH regression, and I'm curious about the unbiasedness of the estimated log hazard ratios (i.e. coefficients) from the model: Are those estimates universally unbiased, or just asymptotically unbiased (like in logistic regression)? Thanks in advance!
