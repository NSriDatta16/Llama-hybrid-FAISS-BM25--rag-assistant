Re Hogan: Yes, a copy gets made by it. In fact, when I was running into it (today) I was banking on it being a modifieable copy: foreach (string Token in tokenize(Command)) { foreach (KeyValuePair Replacement in TokensToReplace) { if (Token==Replacement.Key) { Token = Replacement.Value; } } TokenList.Add(Token); } I think it's unfortunate that this doesn't work.
