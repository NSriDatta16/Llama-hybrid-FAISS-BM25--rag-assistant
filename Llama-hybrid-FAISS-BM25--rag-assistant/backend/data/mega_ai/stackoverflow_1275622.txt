This might be slightly off what you were asking, but here it goes: I really don't like using velocity as a measure of how much work to do in the next sprint/iteration. To me velocity is more of a tool for projections. The team lead/project manager/scrum master can look at the average velocity of the last few iterations and have a fairly good trend line to project the end of the project. The team should be building iterations by commitment as a team . Keep picking stories until the iteration has a good amount of work that the team will commit to complete. It's your responsibility as a team to make sure you aren't slacking by picking to few and not over committing by picking to many. Different skill levels and specialties work themselves out as the team commits to the iteration. Under this model, everything balances out. The team has a reasonable work load to accomplish and the project manager has a commitment for completion.
