two-way PERMANOVA and violation of Multivariate homogeneity of groups dispersions

I would like to perform a two-way PERMANOVA for my data ( n = 17; factor 1 with 2 factor levels, factor 2 with 3 factor levels and 20 continuous variables ) using the vegan package. In order to adequatly use a PERMANOVA, I have to check the assumption of multivariate homogeneity of groups dispersions: > bd permutest(bd) Permutation test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 Response: Distances Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F N.Perm Pr(>F) Groups 1 0.006977 0.0069768 0.9529 999 0.447 Residuals 15 0.109828 0.0073218 > bd permutest(bd) Permutation test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 Response: Distances Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F N.Perm Pr(>F) Groups 2 0.036202 0.0181011 2.9745 999 0.033 * Residuals 14 0.085196 0.0060855 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > ad ad Permutation test for adonis under reduced model Terms added sequentially (first to last) Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 Df SumOfSqs R2 F Pr(>F) factor_1 1 0.069949 0.22920 5.3269 0.003 ** factor_2 2 0.058774 0.19258 2.2380 0.062 . factor_1:factor_2 2 0.032022 0.10492 1.2193 0.351 Residual 11 0.144444 0.47329 Total 16 0.305189 1.00000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 However, I am not sure if I have to use betadisper for factor 1 and 2 seperatly. Moreover, I have the problem that the assumption of of multivariate homogeneity of groups dispersions is not met for factor 2. Therefore, what can I do in this situation? Thanks in advance for your help.
