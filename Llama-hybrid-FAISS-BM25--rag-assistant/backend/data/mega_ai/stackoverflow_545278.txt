libusb-win32 requires you to install their generic driver, which then makes a USB device available to you. I'm not sure that it's possible to do driver-less access of an USB device unless the device belongs to one of several standard classes (storage and HID, in particular). There is a Java wrapper for libusb-win32 which might work for you. I haven't used it myself, though.
