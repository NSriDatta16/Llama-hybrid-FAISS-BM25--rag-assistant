calculate exponential moving average in python

I have a range of dates and a measurement on each of those dates. I'd like to calculate an exponential moving average for each of the dates. Does anybody know how to do this? I'm new to python. It doesn't appear that averages are built into the standard python library, which strikes me as a little odd. Maybe I'm not looking in the right place. So, given the following code, how could I calculate the moving weighted average of IQ points for calendar dates? from datetime import date days = [date(2008,1,1), date(2008,1,2), date(2008,1,7)] IQ = [110, 105, 90] (there's probably a better way to structure the data, any advice would be appreciated)
