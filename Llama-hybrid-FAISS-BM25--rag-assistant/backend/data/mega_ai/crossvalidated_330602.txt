Is it possible to make a label automatically in supervised learning(Machine Learning)?

My background knowledge: Basically, supervised learning is based on labeled data. Using the labeled data, the machine can study and determine results for unlabeled data. To do that, for example, if we handle picture issue, manpower is essentially needed to cut raw photo, label on the photos, and scan on the server for fundamental labeled data. I know it sounds weird, but i'm just curious if there are any algorithms/system to make a label automatically for supervised learning.
