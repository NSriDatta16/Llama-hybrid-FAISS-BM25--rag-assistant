You can't help the memory problems much until Flash adds destructors and explicit object deletion, unfortunately. See this thread: Unloading a ByteArray in Actionscript 3 There's a limit to how much memory Flash applets can use; the GC seems to fire upon reaching that limit. I've seen my memory-easy applets use as much as ~200MB, just because they run for hours on end and the GC doesn't want to kick in. Oh, and I don't think using a single instance is an elegant solution, either. Currently I just write a dispose() function for my custom classes, waiting for some day when it can be turned into a proper destructor.
