You do it like you would in any other ORM/Database based web application. You need to store the IDs for each related entity type in the database, either by adding properties/columns to your base model to store the IDs, or using an id/id look-up table. Then you'd add methods to each of your Models to load the related models as a collection and/or array of Objects using the stored information. You might some some help in the Zend_Db classes for doing many to many lookups. Magento's ORM has some kind of support for including Models that are linked to Models, but nothing magic for including Models that are linked to multiple models (or nothing I know of for sure).
