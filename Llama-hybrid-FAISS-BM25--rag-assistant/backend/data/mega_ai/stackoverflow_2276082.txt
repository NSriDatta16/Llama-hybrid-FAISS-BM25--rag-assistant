Magento CMS page (or block) mass import

I have 50 CMS pages I want to create in Magento. These are essentially mail merges off of a database with different content (but same structure) in each, so I'd love to be able to import them if possible. I want individual pages so they can be indexed by the search engines. Is there a handy/dandy way to do this? I could alternatively do it with CMS blocks and categories as well if that is easier. (which will also give me the option of plopping related products in as well.) Thanks in advance for your help.
