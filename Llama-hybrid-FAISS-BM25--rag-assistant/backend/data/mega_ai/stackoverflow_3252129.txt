Using OpenCV to detect clothing buttons on a piece of paper

I have no background in computer vision, but I was curious to know how I could use OpenCV library to achieve the following: I have a jar of spare buttons, assorted in colour, style and diameter. For the most part they are circular. I evenly scatter them on a piece of white paper, and under good lighting, take a fairly high resolution picture with your average digital camera. How would I got about slicing this image to grab each button individually as a separate object/image? Thanks in advance.
