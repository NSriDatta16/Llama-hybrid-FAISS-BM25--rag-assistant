How to chose a store by optimizing my costs?

Let's say that I wanted to chose between two grocery stores (store $a$ and store $b$) in my area. They have the same items, and they both charge a variable price / cost for each product ($a_1$, $b_1$, $a_2$, $b_2$ for $n$ products). I don't know how often I'll need to buy any particular item, I just know that I will need to buy food in general (have to eat!). How can I make sure that I choose the right store to optimize / minimize my total cost? First, how would I properly describe this type of problem? What are some possible ways of approaching this? Are there certain statistical models that are better suited for this type of problem? (Be it traditional regression models, Bayesian models, machine learning, etc). I want to learn more but having trouble finding good information (likely due to my inability to properly describe what I'm looking for). From comments: Let's assume there is a known probability that I will have to buy each item on any given trip ($p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$).
