One way of doing it is by creating a variable $c = a/(2 \times 62) + b/(2 \times 1) \in [0;1]$ , where $a$ is the variable in the 0 to 62 scale and $b$ is the variable in the 0 to 1 scale. Therefore, $c$ would be the average of the normalized values of $a$ and $b$ (here the term "normalize" is not intended to mean the Gaussian distribution). The value of $c$ is close to $0$ if both $a$ and $b$ are close to zero and $c$ would be close to $1$ if both $a$ and $b$ are close to maximum of their respective scale. Alternatively, you could create a variable that is the mean of the standardization of the other variables: $$z = \frac{a-\bar{a}}{2s_a} + \frac{b-\bar{b}}{2s_b} ,$$ where $\bar{a}$ is the (sample) mean of $a$ and $s_a$ is the (sample) standard deviation of $a$ (and the same for $b$ ). This way, $z$ would have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. By the way, if you want another variable from $a$ and $b$ that has a low correlation with $z$ , you could use the difference between the standardization of the variables: $$w = \frac{a-\bar{a}}{s_a} - \frac{b-\bar{b}}{s_b} .$$
