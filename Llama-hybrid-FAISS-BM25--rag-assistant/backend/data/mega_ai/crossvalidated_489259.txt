Time series forecast with multiple time series

Supposing that I have 1000 data of characteristics of a machine (Period = 1..1000), with 6 dependent variables (Pressure, Speed, Temperature, Sound, Noise, and Vibration). Most of these variables follow an exponential distribution. How do I get predictions for periods 1001 through 1100 based on this old data using R? An example of the data is shown below. The behavior changes in certain periods of time due to machine failures, for example in Period 14. In this case, the values of Period 14 are equal to Period 1.
