Search strategies in ORMs

I am looking for information on handling search in different ORMs. Currently I am redeveloping some old application in PHP and one of requirements is: make everything or almost everything searchable, so user just types "punkrock live" and the app finds videos clips, music tracks, reviews, upcoming events or even user comments labeled that way. In environment where everything is searchable ORM need to support this feature in two ways: providing some indexing API on "O" side of ORM providing means for bulk database retrieval on "R" side Ideal solution would return ready made objects based on searched string. Do you know any good end-to-end solutions that does the job, not necessarily in PHP? If you dealt with similar problem it would be nice to listen what your experience is. Something more than Use Lucene or semantic web is the way oneliners, tho ;-)*
