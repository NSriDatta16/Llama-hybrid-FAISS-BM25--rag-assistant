In .Net MVC, how do you access variables from URL Routing outside of the Action?

I'm building a controller that other controllers can inherit (provide base functionality across site without repeating code): public abstract class ApplicationController : Controller { protected ApplicationController() { //site logic goes here //what is the value of agentID from the Action below?? } } public class AgentController : ApplicationController { public ActionResult Index(string agentID) { return View(); } } The logic that applies to the entire site will go into the constructor of the ApplicationController class. The problem is in that constructor I need to access the value in the parameter from the Action, in this case agentID (it will be the same across the entire site). Is there a way to read that value in?
