Depending on you want to go get.. I would do Anova to detect the behaviour beetwen groups and within the group... PCA is more useful to reduce the dimension, in some point it doesnt make too much sense to use this method... of course with an homogeneous group with PCA you can get one component but it is not too much useful if you want to get the measure of variance and so on..
