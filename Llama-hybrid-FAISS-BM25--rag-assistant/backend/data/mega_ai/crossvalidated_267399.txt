interrupted time series with binary outcome in R (specific impact models)

I want to fit an interrupted time series model in R. My outcome variable is binary, so I would want to fit a glm model and I know the exact time point of my intervention. How would I specify a certain impact model in R? Let's say I want to fit a model where the level but not the slope changes and another model for which the slope but not the level changes before and after intervention, how do I actually specify this difference in my glm ? I'm basing this on the Bernal et al. (2016) paper (see page 4)... I'm particularly interested in the models shown in Figure 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d and how to model these in R when my outcome is binary.
