Java: transform document to an existing document: merge?

I cached an XSLT and apply it to several documents in a loop. Each result has the same format. DocumentResult allResults = new DocumentResult(); for (iter = requests.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) { transformer.transform(new DocumentSource(request), allResults); } return allResults; Although the code doesn't work it should display what I'm trying to attempt: requests having the same ID value should be merged or appended otherwise. Is there a way to implement this without having to perform the merge manually?
