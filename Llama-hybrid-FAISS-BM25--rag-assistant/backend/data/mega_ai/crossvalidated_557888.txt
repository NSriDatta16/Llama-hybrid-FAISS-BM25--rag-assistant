Time Series Analysis for multiple companies at the same time range?

I have sales data of 100 different companies from 2016 to 2020 (monthly data). These companies are from different sectors (SAAS, Ecomm, Service provider, etc) I am working on an exercise to understand if companies from a sector is following the same seasonality on the monthly sales data. The approach I am taking is analyzing one company at a time and checking the seasonality and taking another company and so on, what approach I can take to compare all companies from a sector to check if they are following same pattern or not?
