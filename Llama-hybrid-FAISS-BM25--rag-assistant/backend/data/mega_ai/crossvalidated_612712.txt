Here are a couple situations where you may not want to use cross-entropy, Class imbalance: In situations where the number of samples in different classes is imbalanced, cross-entropy may not perform well. This is because cross-entropy puts more emphasis on correctly classifying the majority class, which can lead to poor performance on the minority class. In such cases, loss functions like focal loss or class-balanced loss can be more effective as they help to address this issue. Addressing the model's limitations: Different loss functions can encourage the model to focus on different aspects of the data that are important for the task. For example, polyloss tries to address the limitations of softmax by encouraging the model to focus on the hardest examples in the dataset. This can help to improve the model's performance on difficult examples, which may not be well-addressed by cross-entropy.
