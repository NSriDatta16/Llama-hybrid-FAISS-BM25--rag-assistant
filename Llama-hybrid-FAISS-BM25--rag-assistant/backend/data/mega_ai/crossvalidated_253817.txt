Looking at the Kwiatkowski paper, they assume the model $$ y_t = r_t + \varepsilon_t$$ (forgetting about the trend, i.e. setting $\xi = 0$ in their model). Here $(r_t)$ is a random walk $$ r_t = r_{t-1} + u_t$$ with $u_t$ i.i.d. $(0,\sigma_u^2)$ and $(\varepsilon_t)$ is a stationary time series. The assumption that $\sigma_u^2 = 0$ corresponds to $r_t = constant$ in which case $y_t = constant + \varepsilon_t$ is indeed a stationary time series.
