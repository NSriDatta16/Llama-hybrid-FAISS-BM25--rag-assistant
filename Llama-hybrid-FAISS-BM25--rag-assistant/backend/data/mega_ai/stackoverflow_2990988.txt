Create bookmark into 1st column of MSWord table

does anyone have a VBA code to create a bookmark into the first column of an MSWord table? Let's say I have a table looking like this .-----.----------------. . ref . Title . .-----.----------------. . 1 . Title 1 . .-----.----------------. . 2 . Title 2 . .-----.----------------. . foo . Title 3 . .-----.----------------. . bar . Title 4 . .-----.----------------. and I want a VBA code fragment that creates a bookmark named "T1_1" on the string "1" in row 2 / column 1, and bookmarks named "T1_2", "T1_foo" and "T1_bar" on the strings in the other cells of column 1. I don't mind to hardcode the prefix "T1" (and substitute for other tables each time). I don't mind to select tables before running the macro, I don't mind giving those cells a special format, and I don't mind to get a superfluous bookmark "T1_ref" from the first row - so the code doesn't need to distinguish between table title and table row. Thanks a lot in advance
