Choosing a Cut-Off Value from an ROC Curve for a Cross Validated Dataset

I am currently doing a logistic regression analysis and wanted to cross validate the results. Now that I have the probabillities calculated for each fold, I made a ROC Curve for each one as well. But how do I choose Cut-Off-Values? I want to sum up the classification of all folds and then calculate the accuracy based of the values of all folds. Does it have an impact, when I choose a different Cut-Off Value for each fold, which I chose from each indepent ROC curve? If so, how should I do it? Thanks in advance :)
