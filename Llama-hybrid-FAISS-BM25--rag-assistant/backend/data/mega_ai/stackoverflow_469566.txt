The cheapest way to go would be to tailor the intranet app to the standards of the organization. If they are paying you by the hour, really it is their decision as to what you spend your time on. If they say it is FireFox only, then that is the way it should be done. If it is a fixed bid, then you might have some leeway, but ultimately it is their decision. They may have reasons why they don't want it to work with chrome (I can't think of a reason, but that doesn't mean there aren't some.)
