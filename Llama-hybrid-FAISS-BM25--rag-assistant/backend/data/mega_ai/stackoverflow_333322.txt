You were on the right lines with pivot tables. Drag in TransID as a row field then drag in two copies of Time as data fields in the pivot table; right click on each and specify Min as the summarization function for one and Max for the other. To the right of the pivot table add a formula to calculate the difference. alt text http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/5866/pivottableey5.jpg "Looks good, the only problem I have is that the formula I add is of the the form =GETPIVOTDATA("Max of Time, $A$4, "ID", 1) - GETPIVOTDATA("Max of Time, $A$4, "ID", 1). When I copy that to the cells below, the 1 doesn't update to 2, 3 etc so they all show the same time. â€“ Kris Coverdale " Use this button on the pivot table toolbar to switch GETPIVOTDATA formulae off. alt text http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/9937/pivottabletoolbarjn3.jpg
