How do do configure a Hudson linux slave to generate core files?

I've seeing occasional segmentation faults in glibc on several different Fedora Core 9 Hudson Slaves. I've attempted to configure each slave to generate core files and place them in /corefiles, but have had no luck. Here is what I've done on each linux slave: 1) Create a corefile storage location sudo install -m 1777 -d /corefiles 2) Directed the corefiles to the storage location by adding the following to /etc/sysctl.conf kernel.core_pattern = /corefiles/core.%e-PID:%p-%t-signal_%s-%h 3) Enabled unlimited corefiles for all users by adding the following to /etc/profile ulimit -c unlimited Is there some additional Linux magic required or do I need to do something to the Hudson slave or JVM? Thanks for the help
