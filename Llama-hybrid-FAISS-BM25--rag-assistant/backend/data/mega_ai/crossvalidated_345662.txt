caret is a wrapper package that unifies the call of a (large) bunch of algorithms and makes common tasks like cross-validation easy. As such it is not performing any optimization itself. For a given penalization (lambda, alpha), the solution of logistic regression in glmnet basically is found by iteratively performing a quadratic approximation to the likelihood and solving it by coordinate descend.
