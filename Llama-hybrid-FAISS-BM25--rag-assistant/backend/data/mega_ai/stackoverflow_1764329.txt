ClearCase UCM - best practices using components

We are migrating a fairly large codebase from VSS to Clearcase w\ UCM and are considering organizing our source into one or more components within a single project. What best practices\potential pitfalls should we keep in mind? The source is organized into layers (data layer, business layer, GUI layer). The team is fairly small, developers tend to own a certain layer of the codebase and we anticipate a fair amount of branching due to parallel development efforts.
