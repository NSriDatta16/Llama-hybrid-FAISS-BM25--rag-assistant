Can you see programmatically how much amperage a USB device is requesting in windows?

I don't necessarily need to see real time plots or anything but as I understand it if you attach a USB device it gets like 100 mA then after some negotiation it will bump the power up to 300 mA or 500 mA so on and so forth till the device stops requesting. Does anyone know of anyway to see all the USB ports on a machine and what they are "allowed" to output? edit update: in windows preferably using a .net language
