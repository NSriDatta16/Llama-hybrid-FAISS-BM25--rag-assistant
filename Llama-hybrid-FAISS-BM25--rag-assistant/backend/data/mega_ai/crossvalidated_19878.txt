It should fail, you should be grateful that it failed. Your observations showed that failures occurred at the very moment you started observing them. If this is a real process, coming from real (and not simulated data), you need to somehow account for the reason why you're getting zeros. I've seen survival studies where 0 times show up as a consequence of one of several things: The data are actually truncated: objects were at risk and failed before the study started and you want to pretend you had observed them all along. The instruments are poorly calibrated: you don't have enough measurement precision for the study and so failures occurring near the start time were coded as exactly zero. The thing coded as a zero is not a zero. They're people or objects that were excluded from the analysis one way or another. The zero just shows up in the data as a consequence of merging, sorting, or otherwise recoding missing values. So for case 1: you need to use proper censoring methods, even if that means retrospectively pulling records. Case 2 means you can use the EM algorithm because you have a precision issue. Bayesian methods work similarly here as well. Case 3 means you just need to exclude the values that were supposed to be missing.
