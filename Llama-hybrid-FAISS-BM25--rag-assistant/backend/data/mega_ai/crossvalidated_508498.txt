In the Cox proportional hazards model, you can make a statistical statement about which variables have statistically significant impact (coefficients that are different from zero). In the random forest model, you can say that those three variables are the most important according to the importance heuristic, but you can't make a statistical statement about it. So my answer is that no, it is not correct to conclude that variable importance from the random forest tells you that V1, 3, 5 have a significant contribution. If you need to make a statement about the relationship between the variables, stick with the Cox proportional hazard model. If you want additional accuracy and possibly additional robustness, the random forest might be better. The variable importance of the random forest helps you understand the results and the model, but it doesn't do the statistical work.
