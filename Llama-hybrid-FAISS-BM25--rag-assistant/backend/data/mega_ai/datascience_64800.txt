Where do I find the .csv file for the submission after creating it?

I am making a submission of a classificaition problem with CNN on Google Colab. So I have arrived at doing this: subm.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False) so in theory I should have finished. The only problem is that I don't know where to find the newly created csv file. Can somebody please help me? Thanks in advance.
