xslt regular expressions to match xml entries and display

I know it is so simple to some of you. All I want to do is look through an xml doc and print out the xml entries that contain specific string fragments. The string value is passed to the xslt and the xml doc is looked at and if a word begins with the string expression it displays it. What I have errors with the following message... MM_XSLTransform error: Error while transforming: 'matches()' is an unknown XSLT function. here is my code sample... - Any ideas? Would so appreciate help on this!
