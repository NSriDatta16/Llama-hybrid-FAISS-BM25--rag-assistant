It could be regarded as a predictive maintenance problem: The aim is to detect when the tool has to be repaired or replaced before it makes too many faults. That's why you can detect the intervals between faults: the closer they are, the more the tool is damaged. Thanks to this information, you could alert to repair or change the tool. Algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost can easily detect when the situation is critical if you have enough data with the whole tool service time (= until there are too many faults). Like any predictive maintenance project, it is possible to detect the main root causes and see if an action could be taken before the situation worsens. This is possible if you classify faults into categories. In terms of algorithms, multi-class predictors are a good option, but they work better if there are several correlated features.
