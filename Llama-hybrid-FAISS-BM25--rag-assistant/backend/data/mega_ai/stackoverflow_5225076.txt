I had the same problem. I configured my .testsettings to include code coverage as detailed here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd504821(VS.100).aspx What I was doing wrong is that I was running the test by pressing F5 in Visual Studio. What I needed to do was double-click the ".vsmdi" file, which will open the "Test List Editor". Then I clicked the "Run Tests in Current Context" - (Ctrl+R, T) in the Test Code command bar. Code Coverage worked after that. Hope this helps.
