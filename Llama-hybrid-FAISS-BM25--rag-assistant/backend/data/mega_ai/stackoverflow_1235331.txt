How can I roll my own PyPI? For example, for 'egg' distribution

I would like to run my own internal PyPI server, for egg distribution within my organization. I have found a few projects, such as: EggBasket http://plone.org/products/plonesoftwarecenter As I understand it, pypi.python.org uses software called Cheese Shop. My questions: Why can't I use Cheese Shop itself? (I can't find it and am not sure it exists) How do other people solve this problem? (Currently we use blush SVN to distribute 'eggs') This seems canonical: The Python Wiki , Python Implementations . Still, I'm interested in feedback. How can I roll my own PyPI?
