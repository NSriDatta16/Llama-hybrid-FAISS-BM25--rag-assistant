Difference would be there since these two algorithms work in a different way. ExtraTreeClassifier: fits a number of randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. whereas, RandomForest: fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if bootstrap=True so please check if you put bootstrap=True or False. Now the question is how can you decide what is the correct feature importance order, use three or four algorithms to find feature importance and let the majority wins! (almost every classification algorithm in scikit-learn offers feature importance) Thanks!
