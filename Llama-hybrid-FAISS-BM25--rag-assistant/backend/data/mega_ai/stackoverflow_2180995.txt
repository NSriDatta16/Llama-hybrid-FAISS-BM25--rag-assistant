How can I use FancyUpload (with mootools) side by side with prototype.js?

I have a site that I am using prototype and scriptaculous on. One one page of my site, I would like to use Digitarald's FancyUploader (I have not found anything else that is as elegant, and offers multiple file selection). Is it possible to use the two on the same page? If so, how would I do it?
