To be honest, you should use always just use a development/test cycle that works. A lot of people like TDD, and a lot of big players like Google have embraced it; because of the high test coverage. However, it seems that you and your team tend to be doing pretty well without it—and remember, and change in development style decreases productivity at least temporarily. So remember the old adage, don't change what works. However , if you and your customers are finding that there still are a lot of bugs that the tests don't cover, TDD is an ideal way to up that—so you should tell management that TDD is a way to increase customer satisfaction, thus make money. (That's management-speak for you!)
