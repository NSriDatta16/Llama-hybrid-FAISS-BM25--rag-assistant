I'm amazed what DOS batch file experts make work. Since I'm not one of them, I take an approach that's pragmatic for me. It might work for you as well. Get a list of destination folders C: Cd\ Dir original.config /s > original.bat Edit original.bat in your favorite text editor (I like Notepad++) Search for "original.config" and replace with "" (empty string) Insert the text "Xcopy C:\edited.config " at the front of each line Proof-read the result to be sure it's what you want. If you're not sure put an "Echo " in front of each line for a dry run. Run the batch file.
