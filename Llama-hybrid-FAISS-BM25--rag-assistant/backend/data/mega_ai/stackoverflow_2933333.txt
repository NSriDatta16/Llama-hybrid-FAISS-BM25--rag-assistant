I'm trying to determine the appropriate way to leverage the Android framework in order to best achieve this without violating the integrity of the framework. Phones have very limited RAM and very limited CPUs. Your average Android device has the power of a decade-old PC, or worse. Please do not over-engineer your application. To be more specific, I'm trying to determine if this view is best designed as a composite of several custom View classes or a composite of several Activity classes. I'd argue "none of the above". If you are aiming to make "custom View classes" for distribution to the Android developer community at large, that's one thing. For your circumstance, though, just build your Views -- don't subclass them. I am definitely of the "composition over inheritance" mindset when it comes to Android's View system. IMHO, Activity is your controller (or perhaps presenter, a la MVP, is the better architectural analogy), layout XML and their constituent Views are the view layer, and your database is your model.
