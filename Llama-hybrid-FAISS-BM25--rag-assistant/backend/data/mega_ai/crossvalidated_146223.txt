Using the Weibull curve to model responses from a direct mail campaign. Model isn't fitting the data very well

I'm trying to build a model to forecast direct mail marketing campaign responses. In the "response" vector are the average number of responses from a marketing campaign from day 1 to day 63 (8 weeks). Before I took the average, I first normalized the individual campaign responses to adjust for seasonality (day-of-the-week, holidays, promotions, etc.) and lined up the campaigns from the first day to the last. My goal is to model this "response time series" with a smooth curve (i.e. continuous probability) via a Weibull curve. Then I want to differentiate between days to get the % of total responses that I'll get in a certain day. In the past I've had success using the Weibull curve to model data that takes on this "response curve shape" but this time it's not working well. Any suggestions? Here's my code: #The "responses" vector contains an average number of responses to a Direct Mail marketing campaign from day 1 to day 63 (8 weeks) #these repsonses have been normalized to account for day-of-the-week variability, holidays, promotions, etc., then lined up by the first starting day responses Compare the actual response data with the smooth curve created using the weibull () function. Comparison: After @tristen suggested that I need to make my "responses" vector the actual observations (as opposed to a histogram of the total by day), this is the new "responses" vector I should be using. However, as you'll see, the curve is still not capturing the height of the actual data: responses However, the curve is still not capturing the height of my original data (see picture below). Any thoughts? @tristen suggested that I use a log-normal distribution as opposed to a Weibull distribution which essentially solved my problem. BIG THANK YOU! See below for the finalized product:
