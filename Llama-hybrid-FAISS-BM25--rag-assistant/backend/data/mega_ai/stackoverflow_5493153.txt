Square Grid Edge Weight Storage in MATLAB

Consider a usual square grid in two dimensions. Between adjacent grid points I need to store a number. Essentially, I'm storing edge weights. What is the best way to do this, say in MATLAB so that if I call up a grid point, it will produce the weights of adjacent edges. The edges are undirected so for example, the upper edge at (0,0) has the same value as the lower edge at (0,1). Thanks!
