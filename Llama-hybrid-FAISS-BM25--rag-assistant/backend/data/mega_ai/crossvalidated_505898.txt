my answer will not be specific to R but I think you can find the way of doing this by looking elsewhere. UPDATE: you say you just want to see if they learn at all. Then you don't need to use $k$ , but check if $r_0 \neq r_\inf$ . For this actually, you don't need to fit a logistic. I think a simpler approach should suffice. In the end, the best way would be to have many different values of $r_0$ and $r_\inf$ and then use hypothesis testing to assert whether their averages differ or not. Points 1 & 2 Let's call your learning rate $r$ and the trial number $n$ . A general logistic curve is $$r(n)=\frac{a}{b+e^{-k(n-n_0)}}$$ where $n_0$ is the number you use for the first trial. Let's call the first trial $n_0=0$ since that will simplify the maths. Now, you calculate your empirical success rates $r$ and fit them versus the trial number (starting with trial #0), from where you get the values of $a$ , $b$ , and $k$ . That curve does not make any assumptions about the initial learning rate, or even the final learning rate Now we can interpret the parameters in terms of what you want. You start with a pure-chance success rate of $r_0$ for $n=0$ . Also, when $n$ tends to infinity, the rate will be $r_\inf$ . Substituting those conditions in the logistic, we have $$r_0 = \frac{a}{b+1}$$ $$r_\inf = \frac{a}{b}$$ If you substitute there the parameters you obtained from the fit, you will see if the initial learning rate is $r_0=0.5$ , and which is the maximum rate reached after a lot of training, $r_\inf$ . The learning rate is characterized by the parameter $k$ , which you also get from the fit. Point 3 I don't fully understand. Do you want to see if different animals learn faster? What you can do is make a fit for each animal, from where you will get different values of $k$ , and then compare those values. However, depending on your data, the results might not be statistically conclusive about the existence of different values of $k$ , and they might all be the same but the noise makes them look different. Point 4 Maybe you can repeat the analysis for each different experiment setup, and then compare the values of $r_0$ , $r_\inf$ and $k$ and see if there is a relation between e.g. color and maximum learning by plotting $r_\inf$ vs color etc. You can compare everything against everything and find possible correlations. Point 5 I don't know the commands in R, but once you have $a$ , $b$ and $k$ you can plot $r$ vs $n$ , and if you plot the data points in the sample plot you will see if your data is well described by that logistic (the first thing to do!). Afterward, you can do as I said in the previous point and plot parameters vs parameters as a summary.
