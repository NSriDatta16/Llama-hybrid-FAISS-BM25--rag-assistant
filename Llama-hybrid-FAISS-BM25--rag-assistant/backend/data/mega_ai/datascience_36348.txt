Intuitive explanation of Convolutional layers in Deep CNN

I am studying a bit about deep learning and CNNs . I understand the math. However, I am a bit stuck on a basic concept related to filters. In Convolutional layers, the number of filters corresponding to the depth. For instance, if I have 128 filters, I'll apply each of these individually to the image. Since all these filters are being applied to the image, would this not make it Fully connected? (image is connected to each filter). Can I have filters of different sizes in a single layer?
