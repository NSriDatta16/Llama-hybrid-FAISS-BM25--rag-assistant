I think this is a simple situation but you are just confused because your dependent variable "gap size" is created by subtraction. You calculate gap size before undertaking any statistical test. Once you obtain the gap size, you just need to proceed with statistics as usual. To answer your first question, to test whether there is a significant difference in gap size between school subjects, you simply perform a 1-way ANOVA, with school subject as the independent variable and gap size as the dependent variable. To answer the second question, whether there is a change in a student's gap size from year to year, first please clarify whether you are interested in change within an individual student (i.e. do students' gap sizes increase over time) or the average gap size. If you are interested in the change within the individual student, you would use a paired t-test testing time 1 against time 2. If you are interested in a change in the average, you would use a unpaired t-test testing time 1 against time 2.
