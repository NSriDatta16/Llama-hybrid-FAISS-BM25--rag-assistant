JavaScript API -- support for IE 5.5 onwards

Hi: jQuery spoiled me a lot ;-) I am one of the early adapters of jQuery and I can't think anything other than that. Recently I am involving in a project, where I need to support any browsers, say from IE 5.5 onwards. Is there any other JavaScript API supports IE 5.5? I know what you are thinking about IE 5.5, some of the end users are poor non-profit organizations which don't have enough budget to upgrade to latest. So I don't have a choice here. Please let me know your thought. Thanks.
