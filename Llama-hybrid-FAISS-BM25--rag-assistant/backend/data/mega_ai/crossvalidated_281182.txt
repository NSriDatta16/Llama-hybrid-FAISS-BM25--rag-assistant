Non stationary residuals from stationary regression

I was wondering, if I perform linear OLS regression with stationary (verified) time series $y_t$ on $x_{1t}$,$x_{2t}$: can the residuals be non-stationary? it is not part of a list of Gauss-Markov assumption that the residuals of the OLS linear regression must be stationary so we usually don't need to perform stationarity test on residuals as a part of time series linear OLS regression?
