You cannot fix this in the graphics code. If your data is noisy then the graph is going to be noisy as well, no matter what kind of line smoothing algorithm you use. You'll need to filter the data first. Create a second data set with points that are interpolated from the original data. A Least Squares fit is a common technique. Averaging is simple to implement but tends to hide extremes.
