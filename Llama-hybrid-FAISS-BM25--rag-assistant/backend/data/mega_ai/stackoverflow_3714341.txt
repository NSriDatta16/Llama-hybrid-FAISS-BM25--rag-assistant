I have looked through mozilla firefox 3.6.9 sources and discovered neither mozilla-1.9.2/modules/plugin/base/public/npapi.h nor mozilla-1.9.2/embedding/browser/activex/src/pluginhostctrl/pluginsdk_include/npapi.h doesn't contain this function. Also I have discovered these two files has different NP_VERSION_MINOR values. Public header assigns 22, but embedded assigns 11. Is it a bug? Firefox 4.0b6 supports this function and assigns 25 to NP_VERSION_MINOR in /modules/plugin/base/public/npapi.h . Activex version is 11.
