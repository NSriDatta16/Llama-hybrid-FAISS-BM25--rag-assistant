The disadvantage to leaving the logic to the database is then you increase the load on that particular server. Web and application servers are comparatively easy to scale outward, but a database requires special techniques. As a general rule, it's a good idea to put as much of the computational logic into the application layer and keep the interaction with the database as simple as possible. With that said, it is possible that your application may not need to worry about such heavy scalability issues. If you are certain that database server load will not be a problem for the foreseeable future, then go ahead and put the constraints on the database. You are quite correct that this improves the organization and simplicity of your system as a whole by keeping validation logic in a central location.
