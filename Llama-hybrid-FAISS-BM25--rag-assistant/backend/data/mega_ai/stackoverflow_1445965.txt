StateServer and SQL Server modes are running in a configuration where they could be servicing N number of clients in a load balancing scenario and would have to maintain this list and send out messages across process/machine to signal the Session_OnEnd. InProcess knows that Session is managed within the same process as the application so sending the callback to a single listener is straightforward and inherent to the .NET Framework. If you don't like this you could write your own handler, but be aware of the cavaets.
