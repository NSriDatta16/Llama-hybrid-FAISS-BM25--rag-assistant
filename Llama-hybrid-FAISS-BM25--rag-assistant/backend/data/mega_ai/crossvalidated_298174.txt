Also, think Neural Nets (with softmax activation), Decision Trees (or Random Forests) do not require the IIA assumption to be met considering the unreliability of these tests concerned with checking the IIA assumption. So this might be an advantage compared to the multinomial logistic if all we are concerned is only predictions. Alternatively, multiple logistic models can be built for the K-1 categories with the Kth category as the reference. This also allows for different predictors to be plugged for each of the equations in contrast to the multinomial
