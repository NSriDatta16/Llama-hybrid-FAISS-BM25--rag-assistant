Like many data retrieval performance questions, which of these is better will depend on the usage scenario. Option 1 is better if the user is likely going to peruse through most or all of the pages before the data becomes too stale to be useful. It's also better in cases of relatively small total result sets (2-3 pages), and cases where the result set won't change much (i.e. pulling user permissions from a DB), allowing you to store the entire data set in memory long-term, increasing performance of future runs by eliminating the network round trip. Option 2 is better for situations involving long data pages and/or total result sets, "wide" records, or data that changes often enough that locally caching it doesn't do much good. It spreads the cost of retrieving records across the use of the result set, to the degree needed to show them. Such "lazy-loading" of paged results does increase the overall time and overhead of getting records (because there are more round trips), but your users are far more likely to notice and complain about a ten-second turnaround time on their search results than a half-second per page.
