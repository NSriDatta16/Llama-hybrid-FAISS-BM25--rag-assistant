Do warnings matter?

EDIT: I have fixed all but two warnings now, so thank you all for the advice and the encouragement. The two warnings I have left would require me to change the database: /Locations.xcdatamodel:tiles.Map: warning: tiles.Map -- relationship does not have an inverse /Locations.xcdatamodel:Waypoint.description: warning: Waypoint.description -- property name conflicts with a method already on NSObject or NSManagedObject I have an iPhone app that throws more than 100 warnings when I compile it, but it is time-tested and solid. Should I care about warnings? EDIT Because the respondents asked, here are some of my warnings: Warning: Multiple build commands for output file /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/Gaia Places.app/wrench.png /Locations.xcdatamodel:tiles.Map: warning: tiles.Map -- relationship does not have an inverse /Locations.xcdatamodel:Waypoint.description: warning: Waypoint.description -- property name conflicts with a method already on NSObject or NSManagedObject /TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:58: warning: passing argument 1 of 'initWithViewController:withTitle:' from distinct Objective-C type /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m: In function '-[TrailTrackerAppDelegate applicationDidFinishLaunching:]': /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:202: warning: no '-initWithFrame:forHelpScreen:' method found /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:202: warning: (Messages without a matching method signature /TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:329: warning: 'gpsController' may not respond to '-setAccuracy:' /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes /TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:411: warning: local declaration of 'tabBarController' hides instance variable /TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:422: warning: 'TrailTrackerAppDelegate' may not respond to '-getAudioPlayer:' /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:633: warning: 'Reachability' may not respond to '-isHostReachable:' /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TrailTrackerMapView.h:18: warning: 'myTopoMapSource' defined but not used warning: 'dbCache' defined but not used /TrailTrackerAppDelegate.m:58: warning: passing argument 1 of 'initWithViewController:withTitle:' from distinct Objective-C type /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TripViewController.m:68: warning: 'TripViewController' may not respond to '-checkForNullImages' /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/TripViewController.m:94: warning: 'TrailTrackerAppDelegate' may not respond to '-blamblamblam' /Users/andrewljohnson/Desktop/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/Classes/MapViewController.m:406: warning: passing argument 1 of 'initWithData:' from distinct Objective-C type
