In xcode's menu bar, go to windows->organizer. I don't remember exactly what it looks like, but once you plug in an ios device (aka the iPad) it should appear under devices on the left hand side. Click on it, and it will take you to a screen with 2 or so buttons on it, one of which will be 'use for development', or something like that. Clicking this will provision the iPad for development, and everything should work fine after that. Repeat for all other ipads/phones/touches.
