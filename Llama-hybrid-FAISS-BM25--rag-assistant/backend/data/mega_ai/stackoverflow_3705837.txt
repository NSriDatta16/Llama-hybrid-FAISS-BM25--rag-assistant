If the target script tries to check the UserAgent HTTP header to determine if the request is being made by a browser, you can try populating the HttpWebRequest.UserAgent property with a valid value. This has worked for me on at least one occasion. There are a number of other HTTP headers that you could set to make the target script think it is being hit by a browser rather than a program. Check out any of the HTTP header properties that can be set. See HttpWebRequest Properties for more information.
