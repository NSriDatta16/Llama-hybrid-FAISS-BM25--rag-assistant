Are deleted files still downloaded with an hg clone?

In our Mercurial repo we added a really big file (and did an hg push), then deleted the big file (and did another push). Now if someone does an hg clone will they still pull down that big file? I know it won't appear in their working directory as it was deleted, but will the file still be pulled down and stored in Mercurial internal storage? I'd like to ensure people don't have to pull down the file. I've learned that really big files should be stored outside of Mercurial, so I deleted the file. But I was wondering if people will still be pulling down the big file - in which case I guess I will recreate the repository from scratch.
