First , you are right, Pooled OLS estimation is simply an OLS technique run on Panel data . Second , know that to check how much your data are poolable, you can use the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier test -- whose null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the variance of the unobserved fixed effects is zero $\iff$ pooled OLS might be the appropriate model. Thus, if you keep $H_0$ and suspect endogeneity issues, you may want to leave the panel-data world, and use other estimation technics to deal with those, e.g. IV (multiple-SLS), GMM . Third , in a FE specification, individual specific parameters do not vanish and can be added back in (with identical coefficients but standard errors that need to be adjusted). This is actually all what LSDV model is about (with added-back grand-average and within averages). Fourth , to deal with autocorrelation (of errors), GLS -like transformations may help you theoretically, but in practice, it only deals with heteroscedasticity ( WLS , FGLS ). However, note that depending on the space (temporal, geographical, sociological, etc...) in which you assume the autocorrelation works through, you can proxy its structure and finally perform a GLS-like transformation, e.g. spatial panel.
