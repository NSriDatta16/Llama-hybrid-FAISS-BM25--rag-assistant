Using Object tags in asp.net

I have this html code for embedding a video in an aspx page: The thing is, I want to set its parameters from my C# code-behind (f.e., the path to the file to be played). I know I should add runat="server" but that's not the only thing. The code-behind doesn't recognize any element of the type MediaPlayer no matter what. (I'm trying to access it from my Page_Load(..) ) How should I do this? 10x
