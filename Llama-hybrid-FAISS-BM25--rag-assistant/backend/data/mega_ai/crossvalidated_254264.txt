Be sure to read the full example on the UCLA site that you linked. Regarding 1: Using a multivariate model helps you (formally, inferentially) compare coefficients across outcomes . In that linked example, they use the multivariate model to test whether the write coefficient is significantly different for the locus_of_control outcome vs for the self_concept outcome. I'm no psychologist, but presumably it's interesting to ask whether your writing ability affects/predicts two different psych variables in the same way. (Or, if we don't believe the null, it's still interesting to ask whether you have collected enough data to demonstrate convincingly that the effects really do differ.) If you ran separate univariate analyses, it would be harder to compare the write coefficient across the two models. Both estimates would come from the same dataset, so they would be correlated. The multivariate model accounts for this correlation. Also, regarding 4: There are some very commonly-used multivariate models, such as Repeated Measures ANOVA . With an appropriate study design, imagine that you give each of several drugs to every patient, and measure each patient's health after every drug. Or imagine you measure the same outcome over time, as with longitudinal data, say children's heights over time. Then you have multiple outcomes for each unit (even when they're just repeats of "the same" type of measurement). You'll probably want to do at least some simple contrasts: comparing the effects of drug A vs drug B, or the average effects of drugs A and B vs placebo. For this, Repeated Measures ANOVA is an appropriate multivariate statistical model/analysis.
