MCMC: what is the problem with correlated parameters?

I'm new to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Various sources suggest investigating the joint distributions of all pairs of esimated parameters. Refer to the figure below for an example. alpha and beta[4] are clearly more correlated than other pairs. Sources would suggest reparameterizing alpha and beta[4] in this case but I cannot find detailed explanation of the reasons why alpha and beta[4] being correlated could cause problems and what harms would alpha and beta[4] being correlated bring to the results. Could anyone provide an explanation or point me to related references?
