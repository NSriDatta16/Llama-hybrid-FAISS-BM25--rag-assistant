It would be worth writing tests to test specific functionality that you are working on and you want to remain stable. With a large existing application that has no test coverage at the moment, you wouldn't want to sit down and write tests all in one go in order to get 100% unit test coverage and you never will. You'd just single out specific functionality for testing. I don't think there's such a thing as too little or too late; unit tests for only a tiny bit of very important functionality is better than none at all, and some unit tests now are better than no unit tests ever.
