analysing difference in variability between multiple related time series

I have constant time series (yearly from 1950 to 2010) of the abundance of several species that were captured by different groups. These series are somewhat related because the quantity of all species captured is dependent on the same effort (which is not always the same each year, but evolves differently per group). Also, parts of the area were groups capture species is common ground. My data looks like this: Year | group | species | abundance How can I analyse the variability (variance) in abundance between species and groups? So I would want to know for which species the captures fluctuate more heavily, independent of the groups. And the inverse for the groups. I could calculate the variance of each series (per species and per group) and then do an anova, but this wouldn’t take into account the dependence of the data,… Also, I already performed crosscorrelations, autocorrelations, spectrum analyses,… for other purposes, but I can’t find anything to answer my question. Could I have a sort of ordered list output?
