Why divide by 1-leverage?

I'm reading about resampling methods, and specifically leave-one-out cross-validation. I understood the method, and how to calculate the estimate of the test MSE (Mean squared error): In the setup of linear regression we have: $h_i$ is the leverage of the $i$ th observation. I want to know the utility of dividing by $1-h_i$ . And why not just use the normal formula of MSE?
