Expected agreement if random

I am looking to measure agreement between participants in choosing which member of a group is most like certain attributes. I want to calculate the expected agreement if they were to choose by chance. e.g. assume we have 3 participants (P1, P2, P3) and they can choose from a list of 3 people (A,B,C) to associate with a characteristic (Cx). The results could be: characteristic P1 P2 P3 C1 A B A C2 C B B C3 A A A ... If, in this case, the agreement is an average of P1vP2, P1vP3, and P2vP3 and agreement was {0,1} then we would have: C1 1/3 C2 1/3 C3 3/3 How could I calculate the expected agreement if the choices were made at random?
