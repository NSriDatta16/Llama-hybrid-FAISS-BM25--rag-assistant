As you have binomial data with possibly different probability parameters, you could use logistic regression. See Where does the binary logistic regression model equation come from? and search this site. Another possibility is a logistic mixed model, that is, representing the per ID probabilities as random variables, and estimate their expectation and variance. That might give better per-ID estimates since it is a way of shrinking the individual noisy estimates toward a common center value. If a random effect variance of zero is consistent with the data, it means that all the probabilities equal is consistent with the data.
