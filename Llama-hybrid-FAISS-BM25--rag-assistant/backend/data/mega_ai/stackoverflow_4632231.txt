Is there any way to store full size image returned from camera activity in internal memory?

I am using Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT,Uri.fromFile(externalFileObj)); intent to call default camera activity. To get full image you need to specify intent.putExtra(). But this always requires URI that works only for external storage files. I tried to create a temp.jpg image in internal memory and pass its URI Uri.fromFile(new File(getFilesDir() + "/temp.jpg")); but the camera activity won't return back after the image is captured. So there is no way to get Full size image from default camera application in our activity without using any external storage ? Assuming that the device do not have SD card or currently in use is there no way I can avoid using it ? Yes I know we can create our own camerapreview surface but I want to use the default camera application as it is natural with many more options. Thanks.
