requires named attributes

After I migrated my project from Windows to Mac, every time I try to embed an asset in Flash builder like this: [Bindable] [Embed("assets/assets.swf#mySymbol")] public var myClass:Class; I get this error: [Embed] requires named attributes if I close the files containing the embedding, it compiles fine and doesn't give any problem. I googled the error, and haven't found anything similar.
