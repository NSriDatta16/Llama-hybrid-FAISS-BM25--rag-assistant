This ended up being somewhat problematic since this is a CMS environment. I am also working with a client that is not totally html savvy. Turns out he was stripping the ul tags out of the lists which complicated the spacing issues. My solution was to restore the ul tags and then do the following: ul {margin-top: -10px;} This effectively pulled the list up to the preceding paragraph and looks right. Thanks for all the input.
