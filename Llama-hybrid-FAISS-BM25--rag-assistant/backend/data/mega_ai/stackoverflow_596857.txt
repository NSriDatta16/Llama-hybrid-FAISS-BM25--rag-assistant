... how do you test how easily accessible your user-interface is? With usability tests. Basically, you grab a bunch of your friends (because you won't have any money to encourage strangers to participate) give them the documentation a new user would have and ask them to perform the system's key use cases. Ideally, you want your test users to have at least some of the qualities of your target users, so if your system is aimed at a technical audience then your classmates will work; however, if your system is aimed at the general public then you're going to want to get your friends in Arts, Human Kinetics, etc. to participate. So how do you turn that into requirements? You identify your key use cases and stipulate what how usable should they be (walk-up usable, a few minutes with the documentation, real actual training...) and then verify that your test subjects can complete the use cases without too much frustration, with the right amount of training, in a reasonable time.
