EDIT: Per your comment, I believe that if you turn off many of autobox 's options, you'd probably get a similar answer to auto.arima . But if you do not, and in the presence of outliers there will definitely be a difference: auto.arima doesn't care about outliers, while autobox will detect them and handle them appropriately, which would give a better model. There may be other differences as well, and I"m sure IrishStat can describe those. I believe autobox detects outliers and other things beyond just searching for the best AR, I, and MA coefficients. If that's correct, it would require more analysis and a couple of other R functions to have similar functionality. And IrishStats is a valuable member of this community, and quite friendly. Of course, R is free and can do a bazillion things beyond ARIMA. Another choice that's free for economics-style ARIMA is X13-ARIMA SEATS , from the US Census Bureau, which is open source. There are binaries for Windows and Linux, but it compiled straightforwardly on my Mac, given that I'd already loaded gnu's gfortran compiler. It's the successor to X12-ARIMA , and was just released in the last few days, after years of development and testing. (It updates X12 and also adds in SEATS/TRAMO features. X12 is the official US tool, while SEATS/TRAMO is from the Bank of Spain and is the "European tool".) I really like X12 (and now X13) a lot. If you output a fair amount of diagnostics and read through them and learn what they mean, they are actually a fairly good education in ARIMA and time series. I've developed my own workflow, but there's an R package x12 for doing most work from within R (you still have to create the input model (".spc") file for X12). I say X12 is good at "economics style" ARIMA to mean monthly data with more than 3 years of data. (You need 5+ years of data to use some diagnostic features.) It has an outlier identification feature, can handle all kinds of outlier specifications, and can handle holidays, floating holidays, trading day effects, and a host of economic things. It's the tool that the US government uses to create seasonally-adjusted data.
