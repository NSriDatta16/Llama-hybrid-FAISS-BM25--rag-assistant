Your recommendation system will be designed to tell the customer what product they should choose, however, this doesn't account for what products the customer likes. A ML method could take all the input parameters from the recommendation system and provide a recommended product based on what similar users liked. There's no specific ML technique for considering HIPPA constraints. This would come into play more in the pre-processing stage. For example, you might not be able to acquire specific birth dates and addresses, but maybe you can get an age range and a zip code (first 3 digits only). Logistic regression is frequently used in healthcare for binary classification. There are lots of tutorials online for building ML models. Kaggle has a good tutorial for Python and R using titanic survival data.
