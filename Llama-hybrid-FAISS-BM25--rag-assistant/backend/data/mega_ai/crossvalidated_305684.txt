In practice, there is always an upper limit ... thats not the point, really. If your count is never close to the upper limit, a poisson regression should be fine. Otherwise maybe logistic regression, that is an binomial model. Remember the poisson limit to the binomial distribution? If the upper limit $n$ is large and probability $p$ is small, the poisson is a good approximation to the binomial. If that is the situation, go along with the poisson model. Otherwise, think binomial.
