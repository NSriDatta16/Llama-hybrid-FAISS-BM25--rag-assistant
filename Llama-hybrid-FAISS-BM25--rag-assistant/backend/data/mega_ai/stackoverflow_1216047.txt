Mysql How to check and change the value of MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes variable of NDB Cluster

When I am trying to create a table using NDB storage engine I get the following error: "Got error 904 'Out of fragment records (increase MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes)' from NDB" How to change the size of this variable? I can't figure out where this is stored or set.
