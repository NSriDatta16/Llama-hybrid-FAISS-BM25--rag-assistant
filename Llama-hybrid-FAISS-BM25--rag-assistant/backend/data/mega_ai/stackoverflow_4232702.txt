You should consider take a look at the MVC. Even if you are OOP beginner it should be not so difficult to understand the idea. And what would really help you is its (MVC) implementations in PHP. Some very good tutorials about: http://anantgarg.com/2009/03/13/write-your-own-php-mvc-framework-part-1/ http://php-html.net/tutorials/model-view-controller-in-php/ http://www.phpro.org/tutorials/Model-View-Controller-MVC.html And speaking in the context of MVC you will eventually come up with organizing all of your create, delete and insert functionality into a different methods (actions) in your controllers.
