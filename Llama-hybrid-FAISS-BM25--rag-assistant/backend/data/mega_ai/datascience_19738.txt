I would recommend using Kaggle or a similar website. There are a lot of competition so you probably can find one that motivates you. One point that is imho often overseen is their very large collection of non-competition datasets. I am rather confident that you will find one that meets a personal interest of yours. You can then start to explore it and discuss results with others. I really think that machine learning like other programming skills is best learned on practical examples. You will fail, learn from your mistakes only to fall into the next trap and this is very important as these experiences will help you later on!
