1) I have two classes (Admitted & Not-admitted) 2) Around 25 input variables 3) Run a logistic regression (Statsmodel logit or Scikit-learn?) Do we always have to predict the outcome class to know the risk factors that lead to admission/hospitalization? 5) Then identify the significant risk factors based on p-value. Not necessary, you can just perform clustering. Than remove features until classes are not distinct anymore. At this point the features that are left are the most important risk factors.
