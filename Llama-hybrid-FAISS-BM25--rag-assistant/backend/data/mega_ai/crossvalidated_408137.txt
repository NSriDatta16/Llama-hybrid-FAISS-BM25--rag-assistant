What we can see from this plot is that the observation with fitted value high leverage point: that means it is merely capable of being an outlier . It has the beneficial trait of improving inference and reducing standard error. You can think about the inclusion of this point as producing a more comprehensive design by covering a larger range of $X$ values. Despite the presence of this (high leverage or HL) value, the point cloud of observations > 0 appears to have the desirable quality of being symmetric about the line (meaning that the trendline might not change much if the high leverage observation were excluded). If the HL point were inconsistent with a strong trendline in the point cloud, you would observe a non-zero sloped trendline over a subdomain of the fitted values. At this point, the data are too noisy to say if such a line exists. The counter example to all this is if the high leverage observation is also a high influence observation, meaning that this point is strongly "torquing" the trendline toward the direction that intersects a meaningful range of its value. Indeed, the point cloud may be independent and has, alone, a trendline with slope 0; yet the addition of the high leverage/high influence (i.e. outlier) changes the slope of the trendline through that point cloud. You do not actually see such a thing in this plot. A better diagnostic graphic is just a histogram of the dfbetas. An outlying dfbeta would support the high leverage/high influence theory for that -2 fitted value.
