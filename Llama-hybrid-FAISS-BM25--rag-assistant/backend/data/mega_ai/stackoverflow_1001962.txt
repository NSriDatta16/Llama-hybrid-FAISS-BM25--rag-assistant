The padding doesn't look to be the issue, it's the margins you have set. In the stylesheet you have img { padding:0px; border:0px; margin:-2px; } The "margin: -2px;" part is what is making your images 97px rather than 95px. Set it to "margin: 0px;" and the images appear normal. You then also need to add, menu img { margin: -2px; } in order to keep your menu images aligned as you had them. For the up and down arrows you need to re-think your markup. The down link is within a form, yet the up link isn't, which is a bit inconsistent. They're also contained within paragraph tags which are displaying as blocks, which is making them appear one below the other, so the down arrow doesn't appear until after the bottom of the quantity box, etc.
