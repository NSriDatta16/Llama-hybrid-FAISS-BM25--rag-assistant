What questions would a statistician ask about analysis of E. coli outbreak?

You may have heard about the recent enterohaemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ) outbreak in Germany . What questions would a statistician ask about EHEC analysis ? I'm thinking of Q+As between reporters / public officials â†” non-experts, say teachers and engineers with a Diplom / Master's degree but at most a smattering of statistics. (Is a picture, a map of EHEC land showing various strains of EHEC and the coverage of various tests, possible ?) Monday 20 June: I thought that the EHEC outbreak would be an area where statistics really matters in the world at large: what's the evidence for various causes, how can these be communicated to the public ? So, starting a bounty.
