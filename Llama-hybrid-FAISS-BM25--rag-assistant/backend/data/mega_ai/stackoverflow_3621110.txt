How to specify a sortBy through a javax.xml.transform.Transformer.transform() call?

I'm using javax.xml.transform.Transformer.transform() to convert one xml to another through an xsl stylesheet. I would like to programatically set the sorting of the first level of children, but am unsure how to go about it. I've checked out the docs , but I don't understand which type of property/parameter to use and how to specify in sort: I am open to other ideas, but would rather not parse the xml result into a w3c document. Edit: To clarify I am looking to set the sort key and direction for the elements in a xsl:for-each tag via the Transformer API.
