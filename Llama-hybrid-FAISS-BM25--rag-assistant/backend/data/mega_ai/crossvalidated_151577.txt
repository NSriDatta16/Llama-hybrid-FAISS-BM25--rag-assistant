Difference between PCA and spectral clustering for a small sample set of Boolean features

I have a dataset of 50 samples. Each sample is composed of 11 (possibly correlated) Boolean features. I would like to some how visualize these samples on a 2D plot and examine if there are clusters/groupings among the 50 samples. I've tried the following two approaches: (a) Run PCA on the 50x11 matrix and pick the first two principal components. Project the data onto the 2D plot and run simple K-means to identify clusters. (b) Construct a 50x50 (cosine) similarity matrix. Run spectral clustering for dimensionality reduction followed by K-means again. What is the conceptual difference between doing direct PCA vs. using the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix? Is one better than the other? Also, are there better ways to visualize such data in 2D? Since my sample size is always limited to 50 and my feature set is always in the 10-15 range, I'm willing to try multiple approaches on-the-fly and pick the best one.
