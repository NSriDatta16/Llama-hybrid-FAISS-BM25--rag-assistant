This may be a problem of interpretation, a misunderstanding of what a so-called "direct effect" coefficient really is. In regression models with continuous predictor variables and no interaction terms -- that is, with no terms that are constructed as the product of other terms -- each variable's coefficient is the slope of the regression surface in the direction of that variable. It is constant, regardless of the values of the variables, and is obviously a measure of the effect of that variable. In models with interactions -- that is, with terms that are constructed as the products of other terms -- that interpretation can be made without further qualification only for variables that are not involved in any interactions. The coefficient of a variable that is involved in interactions is the slope of the regression surface in the direction of that variable when the values of all the variables that interact with the variable in question are zero , and the significance test of the coefficient refers to the slope of the regression surface only in that region of the predictor space . Since there is no requirement that there actually be data in that region of the space, the apparent direct effect coefficient may bear little resemblance to the slope of the regression surface in the region of the predictor space where data were actually observed. There is no true "direct effect" in such cases; the best substitute is probably the "average effect": the slope of the regression surface in the direction of the variable in question, taken at each data point and averaged over all data points. For more on this, see Why could centering independent variables change the main effects with moderation?
