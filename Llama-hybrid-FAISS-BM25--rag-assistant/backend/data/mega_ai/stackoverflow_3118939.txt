Generally speaking, in the presence of a garbage collector, it is never good practice to manually call the GC. A GC is organized around heuristic algorithms which work best when left to their own devices. Calling the GC manually often decreases performance. Occasionally , in some relatively rare situations, one may find that a particular GC gets it wrong, and a manual call to the GC may then improves things, performance-wise. This is because it is not really possible to implement a "perfect" GC which will manage memory optimally in all cases. Such situations are hard to predict and depend on many subtle implementation details. The "good practice" is to let the GC run by itself; a manual call to the GC is the exception, which should be envisioned only after an actual performance issue has been duly witnessed.
