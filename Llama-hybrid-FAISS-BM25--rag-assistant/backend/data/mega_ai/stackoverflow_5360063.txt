How does an index work internally in mysql?

I am using indexes with my tables, but I honestly do not know how they work internally. Let's say I have the following table id age 1 20 2 35 3 19 4 18 if I make an index of 'age', how does mysql organize the rows? Does it organize depends on field type? or...? how does mysql make indexes for unicode??
