STL-decomposition of a time series with deterministic trend and seasonality

what is the relationship between STL-decomposition and deterministic components of time series like trend or seasonality? I have a time series with deterministic trend and deterministic seasonality, so can I use the STL-decomposition? or what other options do I have to adjust my time series or to estimate the trend and seasonal component?
