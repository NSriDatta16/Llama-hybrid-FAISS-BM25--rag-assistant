How to calculate in R attribution of conversions using Shapley value?

I want to compare attribution results made by Markov Chain and Shapley Value. My data set contains 2 columns (path and nb_of_conversions): path=c('Paid Search > Direct > Paid Search','Organic Search > Display (impression) > Display (impression) > Display (impression) > Direct','Referral > Direct','Direct > Organic Search','Paid Search > Display (impression) > Display (impression)','Paid Search > Direct > Direct > Direct','Display > Display','Direct > Direct > Paid Search') conversions=c(77,125,68,50,32,29,43,84) data For Markov Chain there is a good library 'ChannelAttribution', so I have no problems with it. But I'm struggling with Shapley value. How can I built my code to attribute conversions to each tochpoint using Shapley value princips?
