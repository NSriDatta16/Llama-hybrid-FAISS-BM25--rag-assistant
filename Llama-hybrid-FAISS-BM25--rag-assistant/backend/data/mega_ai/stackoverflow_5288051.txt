static state is generally a bad thing. every time you see it, be wary this code will be executed in a multithreaded environment, so what you have written will not work - you will get ConcurrentModificationException you dont have a domain model! sets of longs are not meaningful. try to express what is going on in terms of a higher level abstraction. you are not following "tell dont ask", and specifically violating LoD-F (http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask) - which is a way of saying yur code will soon be difficult to follow who does what. alternatively, to hack in something that will mostly work, use a CopyOnWriteArraySet .
