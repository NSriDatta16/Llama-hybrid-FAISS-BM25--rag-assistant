How to organise large code files?

I am increasingly aware that my code in any single file can often span hundreds of lines quite easily and although I know the implementation might be sound, it still feels messy and unorganised. I understand that there are situations where a lot of code is neccessary, but whats the best way to organise it all? I've thought about separating variables from methods, private s from public s and internals but I don't want to because I can't help thinking that the components of ONE class belong in ONE file. This whole thing is compounded when I'm working with the codebehind of a WPF window, which always seem to grow at an exponential rate into one huge mess very quickly. Also: C# has a keyword called partial , which allows you to split a class over any number of files without affecting the functionality. However, I have noticed that Microsoft only seem to use partial to hide generated code from you (Winforms / WPF.) Which leads me to question whether splitting a class simply because it has many lines is a legitimate use of partial - is it? Thanks
