There are 4 solutions i have provided which you can try. Sometimes all you need to do is click and drag the breakpoint one by one in your project and drag it off the screen. If that doesn't work try these options. At least one will definitely work. Solution 1: Or the more better solution would be to turn the breakpoints off. There is a button on the top bar where the build and run button is located; on the left of it, there is a breakpoints button an image of an arrow pointing to the right is on the button. thats the button you want to click to activate/deactivate breakpoints in your project. EDIT: Further explanation Solution 2: If you want to delete some break points that you dont need you locate the breakpoints in your project and then click and hold on the specific breakpoint you want to get rid off, then you drag it off the sidebar; you will see your cursor change to a scrunched up paper ball, to let you know that if you let go then your object that is being held by the mouse (in this case a breakpoint) will be deleted. Solution 3: Another way of deleting a break point is by right clicking on the specific breakpoint you want deleted and click on the menu option: remove breakpoint. Solution 4: If you want access to the place where all break points are stored, you right click on the breakpoint in the sidebar, click on 'Reveal in Break points': Then a screen appears which displays all break points, and from here you ahve full control over the brakpoints, where you can select the break point and delete it from the file. I believe this is what you wanted. PK
