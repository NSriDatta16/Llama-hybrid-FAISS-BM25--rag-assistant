This is an interesting problem. My intuition is that if you wait long enough, we may consider the inputs as independent and from there it is much easier to answer your two questions. For instance, if we can derive a single probability for each hour (or 2/, 3, ... hours) of the day, then we can answer question 2 analytically using a Poisson-Binomial distribution . Then the question is, how long is long enough? I don't think it is easy to answer this question from the data, but we can elicit your domain expertise: how fast is a cat? If there is a cat, how long does it stay on average? etc. Once we have a number, let's call it the characteristic time $\tau$ , my strategy would be to do combine the output probability by doing a moving average, for example a simple moving average with a window length $\tau$ or an exponential smoothing, with an smoothing factor $\alpha = 1 - \exp(- \Delta T / \tau)$ where $\Delta T$ is the time between frame. And finally I guess you can represent the probability for a specific time frame of length $\tau$ by the expected value or the midpoint. I am making a lot of assumptions here, so it would be interesting to investigate how the results are sensitive to these assumptions. For instance, you can assume a prior distribution for $\tau$ and propagate the uncertainty to your final estimates using Monte-Carlo simulations.
