It looks like that header file is getting included multiple times. You need to add guards. At the top of each header file you should have something like: #ifndef MY_HEADER_FILE_NAME_H #define MY_HEADER_FILE_NAME_H ... // at end of file #endif If you are using g++ or MSVC then you can just add: #pragma once At the top of each header file, but that isn't 100% portable. Also, you shouldn't define constants in header files, only declare them: // In header file extern const int my_const; // In one source file const int my_const = 123;
