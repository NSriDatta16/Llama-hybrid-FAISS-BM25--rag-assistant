How to improve Guice performance at startup

Ok, I know my computations are not objective and so on, but anyway, I hate to wait so much time when performing my unit-tests: My guice swing application takes about 7 seconds to initialize. It's a simple IRC client. At that moment, no connection are open, I even haven't called any java.io or java.net classes yet. I've tried to narrow down what exactly is wrong and I get that 5.8 seconds (average) are used by Guice in order to create the injector with the 2 modules I'm using (one normal module and one built with FactoryModuleBuilder , installed within the original module). When I remove all modules (so basically calling only and exactly Guice.createInjector() ), it still takes 3.5 seconds. The version of Guice I use is the 3.0 rc2. My computer is certainly not the latest, but it is still not older than 3 years. So how can I improve Guice's performance, if possible? For reference, here's the main method I'm using, causing the 3.5 seconds. Subsequent calls take 0.01 second public static void main(String[] args) { long t = System.currentTimeMillis(); Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(); long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis(); System.out.println(((t1 - t)) / 1000.0); } And the result 3.578
