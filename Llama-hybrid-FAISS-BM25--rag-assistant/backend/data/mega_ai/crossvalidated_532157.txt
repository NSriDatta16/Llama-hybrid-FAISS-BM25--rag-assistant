How to interpret interaction becoming non-significant after removing one non-significant main effect from model?

I am interested in an between-within interaction in a hierarchical logistic regression. I start my analysis with a model including all theoretically relevant predictors, including the between factor A, the within factor B, and their interaction AxB. However, the main effect A is not significant, therefore I decide to only include main effect B and the interaction, which improves my model fit (BIC). However, in this new model, the interaction is not significant anymore (p = .0504), however main effect B is still highly significant. When adding another variable that greatly improves model fit, the interaction term is "even more non-significant" (p = .067). How can I interpret this? Can I safely assume that the interaction effect I am interested in is simply not there and was an artifact in the earlier model? Why is it significant when including the non-significant main effect? I am currently interpreting this as a power issue as the interaction effect has been shown in a previous study with a higher number of trials per participant.
