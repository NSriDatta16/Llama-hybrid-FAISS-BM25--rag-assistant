Can I use raw data for mixed effects model when some subjects have more observations than others?

I am analysing a repeated measures experiment with four conditions. I had 13 participants under each of the four conditions, and I was measuring the number of "clicks" they gave in each session, as well as the duration of each click. My dependent variable is the "inter-click time", i.e. the time between the end of a click until the start of the next click. I first tried to fit a mixed effects model on the log mean inter-click time, with a random intercept of subject id: mx_av = lmer(logMeanInterclicktime ~ condition + (1|subject), data= averagedData) However, each condition also had a different effect on each participant, so I think a random slope of subject is also necessary, for which the averaged data doesn't have enough observations. Hence, I tried fitting the raw data: mx_raw = lmer(logInterclicktime ~ condition + (1+condition|subject), data= allData) However, since there was no restriction in the number of clicks subjects could give, some have many data points and others a lot less, so I am not sure if this latter approach is correct? The first model has only one condition with a significant effect, while the second one gives two conditions with significant effects, and higher estimates for those two conditions as well. The raw data has many observations as well (30,861!), which has made it difficult to calculate things like df, boot confidence intervals, etc. I just wanted to check if the second approach is correct? I would like each subject's data to be weighted equally, rather than each data point to be weighted equally. Happy to provide the data if that would be helpful. Thanks in advance!
