If your target application has custom components , I would definitely recommend Marathon to automate your tests. I was given the task of automating an application with several extremely complicated custom components, written in-house from the ground up. I went through a review process that lasted two months, in which I made the decision on which test tool to use, from a list of close to 30 test tools that were available, both commercial and FOSS. It was the only test tool that was able to successfully automate our particular custom components; where IBM's Rational Functional Tester, Microfocus' TestPartner, QF-Test, Abbot & FEST failed . I have since been able to successfully integrate the tests with Cruise Control such that they run upon completing each build of the application. A word of warning though: 1) it is rather rough around the edges in the way it handles JTables. I got around this by writing my own proxy class for them. 2) Does not support record/replay of drag-and-drop actions yet.
