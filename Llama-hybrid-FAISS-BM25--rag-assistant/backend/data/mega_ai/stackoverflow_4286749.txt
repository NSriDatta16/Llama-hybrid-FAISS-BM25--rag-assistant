Nope, as far as I know, there is no way to do this in PHP. What you could do is return an object of a class that has a method getLine() . With that, you could do $item = $this->prepare_items(array($item))->getLine(0); you could - I'm not saying it's necessarily always a good idea, but it's becoming more and more popular, probably influenced by jQuery's elegance - also store the results of get_item in the object, and have it return $this to allow for method chaining like so: $item = $this->get_item($id)->prepare_items()->getLine(0);
