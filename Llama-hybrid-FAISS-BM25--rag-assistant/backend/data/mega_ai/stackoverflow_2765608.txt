I can't compare all of the options you've listed but if I wanted to implement control to control drag drop feature I would the DragDrop and the DragDropTarget classes from the Silveright Toolkit. Its the only DragDrop framework I know of that has been refreshed for SL4 and if you already use elements from the Toolkit then that would be a natural solution.
