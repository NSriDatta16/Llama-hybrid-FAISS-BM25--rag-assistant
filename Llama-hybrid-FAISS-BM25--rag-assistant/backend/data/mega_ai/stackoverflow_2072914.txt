One big difference between Java and MS IDEs is that with Java IDEs you will not get the support for data binding via drag and drop as with MS IDEs. This is actually discouraged in the Java camps because it results in tough to maintain code. So while the Java IDEs do tend to have very complete toolboxes, don't expect anything that favors RAD over OOP .
