I have a small note to contribute. While attempting to follow-along on this post, I began with three installs of Python: The default Apple Python 2.5.1 located at: /usr/bin/python A version located: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 And a Macport version located: /opt/local/bin/python2.6 My trouble was that: $ python would always default to the 2.7 when I needed it to use the Macports version. The following did not help: $ sudo python_select python26 I even removed the 2.7 version which caused only an error. I figured out I needed to change the default path to the Macports version using the following: $ PATH=$PATH\:/opt/local/bin ; export PATH And then reinitiate the ports, etc. Finally, I was not able to reference the scrapy-ctl.py file by default through these instructions so I had to reference the scrapy-ctl.py file directly /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/scrapy-ctl.py UPDATE A quick addendum to this post with instructions to create the link, found on the Scrapy site (#2 and #3). Starting with #2, "Add Scrapy to your Python Path" sudo ln -s /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/scrapy-ctl.py /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/scrapy And #3, "Make the scrapy command available" sudo ln -s /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/scrapy-ctl.py /usr/local/bin/scrapy
