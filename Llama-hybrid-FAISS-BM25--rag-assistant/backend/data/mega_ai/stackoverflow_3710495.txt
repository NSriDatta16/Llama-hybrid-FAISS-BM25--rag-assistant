I would split everything up into separate solutions, especially the libraries that will be used in multiple applications. As you mentioned, different applications and libraries have different release cycles and might end up being developed separately. It's up to you to split them up into logic units and ensure that the libraries are independent of the applications they will be used in. As for what to do in Git, it would make sense to have separate repositories for each logical unit of work (application or library), or at the very least, separate branches within the same repository. Good luck and don't be discouraged. This will be beneficial to you in the long run.
