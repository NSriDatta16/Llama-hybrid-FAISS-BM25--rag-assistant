Is there a way to make an img tag not selectable in a browser?

I have an image in my page and I don't want it to pick up mouse clicks (as in the browsers inherent drag and drop or the drag select where it highlights the image in the browser.) Is there something I can do to the img or its parent dom element or the page to make the browser not do anything when I click on the image? I need to use the mousedown for something else, but the browser seems to perform my mousedown event as well as do its own dragging or highlighting, and I don't want it to. Any ideas?
