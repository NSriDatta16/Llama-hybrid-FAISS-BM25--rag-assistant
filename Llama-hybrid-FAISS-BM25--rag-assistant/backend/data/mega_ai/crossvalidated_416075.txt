If the purpose of this exercise is to assess balance for the purposes of comparing groups in an observational study, you shouldn't be using hypothesis tests to do so. This is commonly referred to as the "balance test fallacy". In a balance test, you only care about assessing whether the groups in your sample differ from each other. See Imai, King, & Stuart (2008) and Ho, Imai, King, & Stuart (2007) for a discussion. If you are truly interested in making an inference about the population from which your sample was drawn, what you probably want is a multivariate t-test (MANOVA), or the logistic regression approach could work as well. One problem with the logistic regression approach is that it tests for conditional associations between each variable and the grouping variable, when you actually want marginal associations. The MANOVA makes some assumptions about normality.
