Write Array to File

I am trying to do an exercise in the book that asks to write the contents of the array list to a text file, can someone give me some ideas on what I am doing wrong opposed to full solutions, do I need to make a method that returns a single string then write that? import java.util.ArrayList; import java.io.FileWriter; import java.util.Iterator; /** * A class to maintain an arbitrarily long list of notes. * Notes are numbered for external reference by a human user. * In this version, note numbers start at 0. * * @author David J. Barnes and Michael Kolling. * @version 2008.03.30 */ public class Notebook { // Storage for an arbitrary number of notes. private ArrayList notes; /** * Perform any initialization that is required for the * notebook. */ public Notebook() { notes = new ArrayList (); } /** * Store a new note into the notebook. * @param note The note to be stored. */ public void storeNote(String note) { notes.add(note); } /** * @return The number of notes currently in the notebook. */ public int numberOfNotes() { return notes.size(); } /** * Remove a note from the notebook if it exists. * @param noteNumber The number of the note to be removed. */ public void removeNote(int noteNumber) { if(noteNumber edit: the problem I am having now is that I can't get each string on a new line even if I use the writer.write('\n') , I realized I forgot the writer.close(); ;)
