Interpreting a Negative Binomial Regression

I've produced a negative binomial regression where the dependent variable is the number of AIDS-related laws passed by each of the US's fifty states in 1989, with the independent variable of legislative session length (unit of analysis = 1 day) and various other control variables. The coefficient for the legislative session length variable is .0013589 (p , 0.5). Based on the above, can I make the following calculation about the percentage likelihood that a state would pass an additional AIDS law: (e^(.0013589*100))-1 = 1.145 Hence: Controlling for all these other factors, I estimate that an extra 100 legislative days increased the likelihood that a state would enact an additional AIDS bill by an average of 15 per cent. Thanks in advance for your help! If the above is not correct, then I'd really appreciate any tips about expressing the coefficient's effect in substantive terms.
