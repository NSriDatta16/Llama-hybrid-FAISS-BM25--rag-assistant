Does it work? If so, then I say go for it. For a one-shot event that looks to be quite elegant. What I like... If s is garbage collected, so will the event handler. The detaching code is right next to the attaching code, making it easy to see what you are are doing. You might be able to generalize it, but I'm not entierly sure how to because I can't seem to get a pointer to a event.
