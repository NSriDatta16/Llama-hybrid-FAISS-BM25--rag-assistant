Calculating a probability of a function of a random variable in a limit

I am reading the paper Luo et al.: Parameterized Explainer for Graph Neural Network and trying to understand the mathematical reasoning after Equation (4) on page 5: How do they calculate $\operatorname{lim}_{\tau\to0}P(\hat e_{ij}=1)$ ? I tried to rewrite (4) as $$\hat e_{ij} = \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\epsilon}{1+ \epsilon}\operatorname{exp}(w_{ij}) \right) ^{-1/\tau}}$$ but we have $$\operatorname{lim}_{\tau \to \infty} x^{-1/\tau}=1$$ which would imply $$\operatorname{lim}_{\tau\to0}P(\hat e_{ij}=1)=0$$
