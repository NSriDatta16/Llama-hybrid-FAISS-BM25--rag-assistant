Help embedding FSI

Starting here - Embedding F# interactive - I've been trying to embed FSI in my application. However, I'm getting weird stuff back from StandardOutput. for example, in standard FSI, if I send this: let a = 3;; I get this back: [empty line here] val a : int = 3 [empty line here] > | (with Pipe representing the input position) But if I send let a = 3;; to StandardInput, I get this back on StandardOutput: > val a : int = 3 | Has anyone else tried this? Is there something I'm doing wrong, and if not is there any way to work around this? None of the things I've tried so far work, and before I try the 'worse' thing I can think of (set a timer after sending stuff, add the > myself on timeout), I'd like to know if there is a better way!
