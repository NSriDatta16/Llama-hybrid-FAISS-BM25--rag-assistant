I will answer your questions as you numbered them: This question really isn't meant for a statistics forum, but I would say that the power produced by a photovoltaic system is very dependent on the system's efficiency while actual solar irradiance allows you to predict power output given your individual system. Unless I am mistaken it seems your data was not taken at continuous intervals since it covers five-minute intervals, but not for continuous days (only one a month). For that reason, there is not a particular "frequency." For time series forecasting, however, this is not important. If you string together your data you will obtain artificial patterns but you could still forecast temperatures for every five minutes on the sixth day of any month. If you want to forecast this for any other day, however, you might be in trouble since your sampling is irregular and you could be overlooking cyclical effects (monthly or weekly). It may be ignorable, but I would suggest collecting/finding more data. For this type of cyclical data and "very-short" forecasting, I would not recommend using ARIMA (as the coeffients would cause problems). If you have a reasonable amount of computing power and want to be really accurate, I would suggest a neural network approach, such as LSTM. Otherwise, approximating what should (contextually) be a smooth curve with a low-number polynomial fit should work just fine.
