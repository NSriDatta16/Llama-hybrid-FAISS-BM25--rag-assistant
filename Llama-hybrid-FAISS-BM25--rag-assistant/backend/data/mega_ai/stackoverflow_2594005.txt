I while ago I was having the same question, after doing some benchmarks I found that hash mode in the native edition is much faster and storage efficient than anything the java edition has to offer, so I decided to go with the native implementation. I suggest you do your own benchmarks for the storage capacities you expect and decide if the Java edition is fast enough. if it is, or if performance is not a big issue for you (it's critical for me), just go with the Java edition. otherwise go with the native one (assuming you see the same performance boost for your own use case). btw: my benchmark was test the speed of querying random keys out of 20,000,000 records, where the key is a string and the value is an int (4 bytes). I saw that inserts (populating the benchmark) was much faster with the native version, and queries was twice as fast. (This is not due to Java shortcoming but because the Java version is not of the same version as the native version - 4.0 vs 4.8 IIRC).
