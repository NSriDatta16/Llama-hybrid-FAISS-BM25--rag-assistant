It really depends on the amount of variance relative to the size of a measurement that you care about. If you need to be able to tell the difference between a mean of 2 and a mean of 0, and your data look like this: -4.4 3.8 -2.0 -5.1 0.2 7.1 0.9 -5.4 2.8 0.5 Then you're going to need a lot more data! But if you only care if the average is less than or more than 10, then that much data is adequate. @cgillespie gives the technically correct response. You need to have some idea what size of effect you care about, as well as some idea how much variance your measurements have. If the equations of power analysis are more than you can deal with, you can always use random numbers in an Excel spreadsheet! Generate columns of random numbers with a normal distribution and various means and variances, then figure out whether the confidence intervals (2 * standard deviation / sqrt(N)) around the mean of each set of numbers include differences that you might are about. Do that a bunch of times. That'll give you a good idea of how many measurements you need, and it's not too hard to explain to others.
