If you're formatting the drive, won't you want to set the capacity to the size of the drive (not 0)? Formatting the drive will depend a great deal on what format you want to use. FAT? FAT32? ext[234]? NTFS? Your own custom format? Regardless, you'll need some way to access the USB device directly, using the UMS (USB Mass Storage) protocol . Good luck!
