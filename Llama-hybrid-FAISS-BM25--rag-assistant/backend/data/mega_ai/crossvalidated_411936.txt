Mean of the conditional Gaussian distribution

I am referring to the book "Pattern recognition and machine learning" book by Bishop. Equation 2.104 states that the precision matrix for the joint distribution is $ \begin{equation} R = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \Lambda+A^TLA & -A^TL\\ -LA & L \end{array}\right) \end{equation} $ and the mean of the joint distribution is $ \begin{equation} E[z] = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \mu\\ A\mu+b\end{array}\right) \end{equation} $ For conditional Gaussian distributions equation 2.75 states that $ \mu_{a|b} = \mu_{a} - \Lambda_{aa}^{-1}\Lambda_{ab}(x_{b} - \mu_{b}) $ From the equation for R $ \Lambda_{aa}^{-1} = (\Lambda+A^TLA)^{-1} $ $ \Lambda_{ab} = -A^TL $ $ \mu_{a} = mu $ and $ \mu_{b} = -A\mu + b $ Substituting in expression for $\mu_{a|b}$ I get $ E[x|y] = \mu + (\Lambda+A^TLA)^{-1}(A^TL)(y - (A\mu + b)) $ But this expression is different from what is concluded in equation 2.111 which is $ E[x|y] = (\Lambda+A^TLA)^{-1} [A^TL(y - b) + \Lambda\mu] $ How do I reconcile what I got above and what equation 2.111 reproduced above gives?
