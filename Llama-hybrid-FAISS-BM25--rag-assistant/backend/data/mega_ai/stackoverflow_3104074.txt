Magento version upgrade in SVN

I have a Magento Enterprise Edition install in a repository, client's site is running, all is well. Now I want to upgrade this client to a new version of Magento, but the only help that EE gives me for upgrades is to delete the entire app/code/core directory and move the new files in. This is, to say the least, non-optimal. Any good thoughts on how I can do the change while preserving my SVN history cleanly? Thanks, Joe
