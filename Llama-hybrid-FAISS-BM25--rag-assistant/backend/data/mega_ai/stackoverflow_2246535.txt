You might want to take a look at the simpleBool.py code on this page that uses the pyparsing module. Otherwise, here's some simple code I wrote. This isn't a module, but it might get you in the right direction. def found(s,searchstr): return s.find(searchstr)>-1 def booltest1(s): tmp = found(s,'george') and not found(s,'bush') return found(s,'president') and (found(s,'ronald') or tmp) print booltest1('the president ronald reagan') print booltest1('george bush was a president') and you can test other ones. I used tmp because the line was getting so long
