How to: Schedule a Job (SQL Server Management Studio) In Object Explorer, connect to an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine, and then expand that instance. Expand SQL Server Agent, expand Jobs, right-click the job you want to schedule, and click Properties. Select the Schedules page, and then click New. In the Name box, type a name for the new schedule. Clear the Enabled check box if you do not want the schedule to take effect immediately following its creation. For Schedule Type, select one of the following: Click Start automatically when SQL Server Agent starts to start the job when the SQL Server Agent service is started. Click Start whenever the CPUs become idle to start the job when the CPUs reach an idle condition. Click Recurring if you want a schedule to run repeatedly. To set the recurring schedule, complete the Frequency, Daily Frequency, and Duration groups on the dialog. Click One time if you want the schedule to run only once. To set the One time schedule, complete the One-time occurrence group on the dialog.
