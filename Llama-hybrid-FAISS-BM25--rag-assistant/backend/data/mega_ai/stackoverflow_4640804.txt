python-scrapy: how to fetch an URL (not via following links) inside a spider?

How can I have inside my spider something that will fetch some URL to extract something from a page via HtmlXPathSelector? But the URL is something I want to supply as a string inside the code, not a link to follow. I tried something like this: req = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com/' + some_string + '/') req.add_header('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0') response = urllib2.urlopen(req) hxs = HtmlXPathSelector(response) but at this moment it throws an exception with: [Failure instance: Traceback: : addinfourl instance has no attribute 'encoding'
