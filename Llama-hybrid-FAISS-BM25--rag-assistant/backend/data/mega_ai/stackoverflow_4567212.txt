looks like your system loads the data for each products seperately in one query. and there are a lot of products on that page. same problem for example in magento. thats the tradeoff if you get "too object oriented". im afraid theres nothing much you can do about it without changing the guts of your system. you may want to consider switching to another shop system that is more focused on performance. oxid is good from what ive heard, and i've seen some convincing benchmarks and loading patterns. other "higher layer" approaches to optimize your current system are checking whether opcode caching is doing ok have a local database server for selecting this stuff (maby replication from the master) make sure query caching is doing good and the ram allocations for your database are fine maby move your sessions to apc/memcached maby you have something like page html caching in your system
