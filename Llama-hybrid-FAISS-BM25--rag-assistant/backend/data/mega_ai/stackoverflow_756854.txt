Symlinks are not a "hack" - they're legitimate and useful entities in the filesystem. They're no or more less fragile than any kind of file, they reduce redundancy, and reduce the amount of apache configuration you need to do. I'm not quite following why it is you'd want to avoid them. The symlink solution is far more elegant than writing apache rules, IMO.
