winform localization

If there are hundreds of form and 20-30 projects in the application and during localization the number of .resx files generated will be very high. Is there any way to organize the .resx files and satellite assembly? If I move the .resx file to common assembly then the design time support for previewing the form is lost. Is there any standard ways for handling projects with large number form.
