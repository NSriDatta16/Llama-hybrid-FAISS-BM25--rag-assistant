Usually one would expect a method to perform better if its assumptions are met, and if that holds for several methods, the one which makes the most stringent assumptions. The problem with many machine learning algorithms is that they do not have explicit assumptions. Because of this it is almost entirely an empirical question which method performs best on given data. Meaning, there's no real answer to your question.
