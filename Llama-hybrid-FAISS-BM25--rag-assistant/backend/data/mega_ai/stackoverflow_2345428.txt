I don't know what that one-character-a-line is about because you didn't tell us the reason, but the textwrap module will give you what you want: s="WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, ESTABLISH JUSTICE, INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE, PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, AND SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY, DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA." import textwrap print "\n".join(textwrap.wrap(s, 80)) I reconstructed your original code from your comment, and this is a corrected version: # You don't even use this so why import it? --> import string def main(): user_string = raw_input() all_caps = user_string.upper() # guess you wanted to make it uppercase output = [] # this will hold the decoded characters for char in all_caps: if char.isalpha(): value = ord(char) if 70
