Copy to output is, of course, the simplest solution. If you don't want to have this exe hanging around together with your app files, put it to resources and when your application needs to run that exe, just save it to temp folder and run from there. Here's proof-of-concept code: class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var fileName = Path.ChangeExtension(Path.GetTempFileName(), "exe"); File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, Resources.QueryExpress); var queryAnalyzer = Process.Start(fileName); queryAnalyzer.WaitForExit(); } } In project properties go to Resources and drag-drop there your exe file. This sample is using application named QueryExpress.exe . You may also wish to compress your app into ZIP file to make it smaller. This will add one more step to unpack archive before running the process.
