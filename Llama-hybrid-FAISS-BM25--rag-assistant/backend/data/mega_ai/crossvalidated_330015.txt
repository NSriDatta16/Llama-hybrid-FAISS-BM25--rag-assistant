Can a neural net with unsupervised learning be used for detection of player formations in soccer?

I'm having a concrete problem I'm trying to solve but I'm not sure in which direction I should go. Goal: Identify formation of a soccer team based on a static positional data (x,y coordinates of each player) frame Input: Dataframe with player positions + possible other features Output: Formation for the given frame Limited, predefined formations (5-10) like 5-3-2 (5 defenders, 3 midfield players, 3 strickers) Possible to manually label a few examples per formation I already tried k-means clustering on single frames, only considering the x-axis to identify defense, midfield and offense players which works ok but fails in some situations. Since I don't have (much) labels im looking for unsupervised neural network architectures (like self organizing maps) which might be able to solve this problem better than simple k-means clustering on single frames. I'm looking for an architecture which could utilize the additional information I have about the problem (number and type of formations, few already labeled frames, ..).
