Decide on some quality measure you wish to optimize. In your specific case of logistic regression, this should include some trade-off between Type I and II errors . Are false positives worse than false negatives? Then run cross-validations to compare the different ways of reducing your model complexity. Choose between feature selection, dimension reduction and regularisation depending on which approach yields the best model, as per the quality measure defined above. And if you are willing to go beyond logistic regression, there are of course a couple of machine learning approaches, like random forests, that are "somewhat" orthogonal to your three approaches, although RFs in particular include elements of feature selection.
