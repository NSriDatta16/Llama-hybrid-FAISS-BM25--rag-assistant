Google Maps - Add two markers (directions)

Playing around with Google Maps these days, with some directions. I have a map that gets the directions and address (reverse-geocoding) when dragging and dropping the markers. If there is two nodes on the map ( http://dev.korebogen.dk/gmap/ ) the script is working fine (click set directions) - but I need to add a click event so I can place those two markers instead of hard-code the location by hand, but still be able to drag them around - or place new with new click. But I only need A to B markers. Ive been playing around with some click events, but I can not seem to accomplish what I am looking for - hope to see some help here. Thank you very much.
