You are much better off if the "shortish string" is in a fixed length column so that the table has fixed length rows. MySQL with MyISAM will operate quite efficiently for you then. Allocate as much memory as you can for the Key Buffer so that much of the index in memory. Your goal should be a single random access to the disk to retrieve one row -- you can't do better than that given 100GB of data and 8GB of memory. You should not expect to achieve more than a few hundred such queries per second, because that's all the random accesses a disk can do. You might be interested in my MySQL custom storage engine (described here ). It manages memory differently from MyISAM, although the profile of your application isn't exactly what my engine was optimized for.
