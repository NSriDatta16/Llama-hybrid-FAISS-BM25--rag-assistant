Series prediction for any given time

I have a time series of data points. Then I am given a future timestamp and I have to predict the value for the data point. For simplicity, you can assume that the timestamp is bounded i.e. for e.g. query can be of at most 1 hr in the future. This is different from tradition train and predict models. Here you will be given the time as query input apart from past data. Currently, I am training different models for each minute(yeah, 60 models: lots of waiting time ). I am wondering if there is something available for this specific task? EDIT: To get the view about the data, you can assume a simple time series of real numbers, and I have to use history to predict for any general time(within next 1 hr).
