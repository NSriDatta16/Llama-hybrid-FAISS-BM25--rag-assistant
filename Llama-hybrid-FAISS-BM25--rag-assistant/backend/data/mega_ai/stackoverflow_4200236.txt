jQuery ajax, by default, makes an asynchronous request (meaning it will make the request in the background, without blocking execution in the rest of the function). EDIT: While you can make synchronous requests, I should note that this is very discouraged. Instead, you should design your code in a way that takes advantage of event driven programming. You can make a synchronous request like this: function getDealerPoolSelectOptions() { var selectOptions = "1:A;"; $.ajax({ async: false, url: "DealerManagement/GetAllDealerPoolCodes", success: function(data) { alert("Data: " + data.toString()); //Displays all the data I'm looking for selectOptions = data; } }); alert("SelectOptions: " + selectOptions); return selectOptions; }
