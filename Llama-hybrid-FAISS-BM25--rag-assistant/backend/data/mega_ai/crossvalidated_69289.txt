How to extract uniform noise from the mixture distribution

Let $X$ be a sample from the distribution which is the mixture of the useful signal with the distribution $\xi(\theta)$ and a uniform noise $U[a, b]$. The probability of observing $U[a, b]$, the parmeters $a$ and $b$ are not known. I would like to estimate $\theta$. How do I do it? By the mixture I mean weighted average of probability density functions
