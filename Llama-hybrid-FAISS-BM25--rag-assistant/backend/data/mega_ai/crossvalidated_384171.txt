Are latent variable models the same as latent source models?

I am interested in the research done in this thesis and accompanying paper . This research discusses models termed latent source models . I have never heard of this specific term and the papers don't reference much else. On page 20 of the thesis, it describes latent source models as: ...we propose a setting for model specification and selection in supervised learning based on a latent source model. In this setting, the model is specified by a small collection of unknown latent sources. We posit that the data were generated by the latent sources according to a stochastic model relating latent sources and observations. I was wondering if these were the same as latent variable models which are described here and that are more commonly heard of in statistics and machine learning. I would love if someone could clarify this confusion and, if possible, provide some references about latent source models since that is my current focus.
