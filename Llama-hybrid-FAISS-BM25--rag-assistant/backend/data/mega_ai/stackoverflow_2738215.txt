A database will work fine for this. Just link the session to a visitors table and have a table called visitor_list_items that stores the selected items as rows. 2000 isn't an insane number to fetch. I mean, geez, if they're gonna sit there and select 2000 list items, they can wait one second for the page to load! (Are you sure there isn't a way to break this selection process up into steps?) If it's in the db, you can leverage the conventional db uses (i.e., more easily run reports on what items visitors are selecting when they come to your site, etc...).
