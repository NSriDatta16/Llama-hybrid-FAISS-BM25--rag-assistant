You could watch the speed of scrolling while the UIScrollView is decelerating, and when the speed falls beneath a certain value, snap to the nearest menu item. You will likely want to implement the UIScrollViewDelegate methods scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate: and scrollViewDidScroll: . When the user lifts their finger to finish a scroll gesture, scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate: will be called. Begin monitoring the scrollViewDidScroll: events, and watch the delta between the UIScrollView 's current position and its previous position, divided by the time delta: float velocity = (currentPosition - lastPosition) / (currentTime - lastTime); When the velocity falls below a minimum value, call scrollRectToVisible:animated: on the UIScrollView .
