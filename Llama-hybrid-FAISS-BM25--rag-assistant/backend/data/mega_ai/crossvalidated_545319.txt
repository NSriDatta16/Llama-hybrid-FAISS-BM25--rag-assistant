If the two lists are (ordered) translations of each other, you are doing sentence alignment. You can refer to this paper: Vecalign: Improved Sentence Alignment in Linear Time and Space . If the two lists are of the same language, you can just give a try BLEU or its alternatives NIST, TER, Precision and Recall, and METEOR. Either they are of one language or two languages, you can try the following two methods: you train a predictor trained on human-labeled datasets to directly output the score; you can try methods like BERTSCORE , and you can rank the sentences in the other list for a sentence in one list by F1.
