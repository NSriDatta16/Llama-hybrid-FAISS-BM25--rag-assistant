What is the effect of data scaling when compared between kNN, naive Bayes or logistic regression?

I am a complete noob and have just started with machine learning. However there was this one question I faced which I was unable to answer. What is the effect of data (feature) scaling on the three classifiers, namely kNN, naive Bayes and logistic regression? Would there be any difference between the optimum parameters found by cross validation and evaluation results for scaled vs raw data. It would be a real great help if some one can explain it graphically.
