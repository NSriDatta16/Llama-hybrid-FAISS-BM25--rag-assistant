Probit and probability of being a member of a group

I was wondering if there was a specific way to convert probit regression results into a probability that a test subject is a member of group 1 (vs group 0) if you break up the dependent variable into 2 groups (e.g. success vs. failure.) I know that for logistic regression you use the inverse logit of the sum of the coefficients * the subject's values + the constant but I am unaware of how to do it with probit. I'm sure there is a way because Stata can check the model's ability to classify with estat classification. I primarily use R now for my data analysis, so if you know how to do this in R, I would appreciate your help even more (currently I use inv.logit from the boot package.)
