Well, the basics are there. You can drag and drop controls onto a XAML surface in VS.NET 2008 just about as easily as you can with Windows Forms. Sure, there's the binding syntax stuff, but getting started isn't too bad. But you DEFINITELY need to buy a good book on it. You don't need to have read it from cover to cover in order to get started. A decent book will have you up and running in a chapter or two, and you can take it from there. Just make sure that whatever book you buy, it was published after .NET 3.5 (and SP1 preferably) came out. Also, understand WHY you want to use WPF. Is it just because it's new? Then you're right, that's not a good enough answer. WPF does have some big benefits though: A powerful binding expression syntax that actually works No need to repaint your own windows in response to WM_PAINT messages _ (corrollary to the previous point) It's much easier to owner-draw and make your own controls MS is spending a LOT of effort to actually develop it MS is spending minimal effort on developing WinForms
