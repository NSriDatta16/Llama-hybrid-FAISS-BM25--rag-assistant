Random forest probability meaning

Lets say I trained a random forest on classes 0,1,2 as seen below. Now I predict the classes probabilities with random forest for new points A and B. Would I get... For point A a probabilities classes of: 50% - class 0, 25% class 1, 25% class 2? For point B a probabilities classes of: 90% - class 0, 5% class 1, 5% class 2? In other words, does the class probability meaning is some kind of normalized distance between classes? Now, let's say class 0 had only one point. Would this change the probabilities above? Would appreciate if someone can put some light on this. Thank!
