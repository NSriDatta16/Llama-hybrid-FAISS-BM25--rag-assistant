using glm for logistic regression and scaling

I came across this great tutorial , which shows how to compare/visualise main effect of logistic regression GLMs (apart from other things). All independent variables appear to be numeric and are thus scaled (z-scored). This allows a great comparison of the impacts of the main effects: When I apply this methodology to my data, which also contains factors, the factors estimates are quite large. Do I have to explicitly introduce dummy variables (which would be 0 or 1) or how do I make the estimates of my dummy variables comparable with the scaled numeric variables? Thanks!
