Macports sudo expands ~ to /var/root in python

I installed the macports version of sudo . All is well, except for one thing. Using python 2.6 to expand ~ to the user's home directory results in a different output than the version of sudo that comes with Snow Leopard. For example consider the following python code: #expand_home_dir.py import os os.path.expanduser('~') Below are 3 different calls of the code listed above. The first call using sudo is using the Macports version because my $PATH begins with /opt/local/bin : robert$ python2.6 expand_home_dir.py /Users/robert robert$ sudo python2.6 expand_home_dir.py /var/root robert$ /usr/bin/sudo python2.6 expand_home_dir.py /Users/robert Any idea why this is happening?
