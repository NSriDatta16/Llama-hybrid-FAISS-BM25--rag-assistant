Poorness of Kernel methods on visual pattern recegnition?

I am currently reading the recent papers mainly written by Y. Bengio [1] , [2] ,[ 3 ]. There are very strong claims about poorness of Kernel methods on recognizing handwritings in many general cases but there are no references for the claims of this poorness. I want to know if this is really the case in Machine Learning research. e.g.: " Unfortunately, devising such similarity measures, even for a problem as basic as digit recognition, has proved difficult, despite almost 50 years of active research. Furthermore, if such a good task-specific kernel were finally designed, it may be inapplicable to other classes of problems."
