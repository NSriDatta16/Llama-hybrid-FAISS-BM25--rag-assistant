myDBR reporting tool might be suitable for you. With myDBR you can create reports quite easily using the built in Query Builder. Once your reports are done you can organize them in categories and also specify access rights for users and user groups. You can fully concentrate on creating your report content (using SQL) and myDBR will take care of the data presentation. For example creating charts from data is just a matter of adding one extra line to your stored procedure. myDBR also provides Single-Sign-On Integration so that your users can continue to log in with their already existing username/password. The tool is also very affordable, community version is free of charge and premium version is only 129 EUR / year.
