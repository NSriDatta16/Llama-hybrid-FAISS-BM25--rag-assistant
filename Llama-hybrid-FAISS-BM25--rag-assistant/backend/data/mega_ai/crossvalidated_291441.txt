How do I know which time-value to use in my calculations? This isn't a question that your model can answer you. How did you choose the cutoff points? The result of a Cox-PH model is a survival distribution over time for each patient. Without time dependence, one can look at the overall hazard of each patient to compare relative risks between patients. With time dependence, one could use the cumulative hazard. If you are interested in time dependence in your data, I would suggest other approaches (such as Random Forest survival) rather than modified Cox-PH, which is ad hoc.
