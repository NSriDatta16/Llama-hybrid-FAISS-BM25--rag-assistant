One way to deal with data that have two mutually exclusive outcome values at any one observation (call X and call Y in your case) is a binomial regression, typically a logistic regression. This UCLA web page has links to ways to do this with 5 different software systems. You would use location as a (binary) predictor, season as a categorical predictor with 4 levels, and include an interaction term between location and season. The outcome (in R, at least) could be formatted as a 2-column matrix of counts of each type for each location/season combination. That would model the log-odds of one call type versus the other at all combinations of location and season. (Log-odds can be converted to probabilities.) That model allows statistical assessment of the reliability of differences among those 8 scenarios. With a large data set like yours you might well find "statistically significant" difference among all scenarios. You would apply your knowledge of the subject matter to evaluate the practical significance. Finally, remember that this doesn't directly model differences in the total number of calls recorded in each scenario, although it does take those differences into account in the analysis.
