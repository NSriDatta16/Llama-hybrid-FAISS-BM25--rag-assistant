what does object.start() mean?

Sorry i am new to C#. I have a program, where there is a class CatchFS. The main function in the class , has the code CatchFS fs = new CatchFS(args); fs.Start(); Can someone tell me what it means. I hv heard of thread.start() but object.start() is new to me . Am i even thinking right ? Thanks a lot, Yes it is derived from a class called FileSysetm.cs. The start does this : public void Start () { Console.WriteLine("start"); Create (); if (MultiThreaded) { mfh_fuse_loop_mt (fusep); } else { mfh_fuse_loop (fusep); } } Now im trying to do a fusemount. The program starts and it hangs. there is some call that was not returned and i couldnt figure out which one. I tried using debug option of monodevelop, but no use, it runs only in my main function and I get thread started and thats it !! I think the file FileSystem.cs is from library Mono.fuse.dll. Thanks for all your time. I hv been looking at this question for 2 whole days, and I dont seem to figureout much as to why the code wont proceed.Im expecting my azure cloud storage to be mounted in this fusemount point. My aim is after running this code I should be able to do an ls on the mountpoint to get list of contents of the cloud storage. I am also suspecting the mountpoint. Thanks a lot for providing me all your inputs.
