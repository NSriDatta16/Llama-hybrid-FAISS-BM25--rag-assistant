Not quite. The sum of the eigenvalues of any PCA performed on a $P$ by $P$ correlation matrix ( $\textbf{R}$ ), where $P$ is the number of variables, exactly equals $P$ . This is why such eigenvalues are typically interpreted as apportioning the total variance in the data among $P$ different components. In this case the sum of the eigenvalues averaged over $P$ exactly equals 1. Sometimes, however, a PCA is performed on the variance/covariance matrix ( $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ) instead. This is typically done when $\mathbf{\Sigma} \approx \textbf{R}$ , so you get roughly similar interpretations if the approximation is close, with a similar value of eigenvalues averaged over $P$ . $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \textbf{R}$ exactly when the data are standardized. Otherwise PCA on $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ can produce eigenvalues that do not sum to $P$ , and thus the sum of eigenvalues averaged over $P$ will not equal 1. Properly speaking, PCA is not performed on the data but on either $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ or $\textbf{R}$ .
