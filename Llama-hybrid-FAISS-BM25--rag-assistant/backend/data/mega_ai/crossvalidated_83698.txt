If you have only 2 possible outcomes you should use a logistic regression. From your question I gather you have >2 possible outcomes, hence you should use a multinomial logit model. It is basically the same as a logistic (binomial) but more outcomes. These are all examples of generalized linear models this book has hands on coverage of GLMs as well as classification/regression trees. I did an example fit of a logistic regression in an answer to this question , you might want to check it out. A classification tree make sense here too if you don't believe the interaction between the factors are too complex and significant. Here is example code of how you would fit a multinomial in R (in this code none of the factors will be relevant because I randomly assigned them but with your real data they might be): gender= c("male", "female") ethnicity= c("asian", "caucasian") lineupType = c("A","B") outcomes = c("FALSE POS","TRUE POS","MISS") genderObs = sample(gender,400,replace=T) ethnicityObs = sample(ethnicity,400,replace=T) lineupTypeObs = sample(lineupType,400,replace=T) outcomesObs = sample(outcomes,400,replace=T) library(nnet) mmodF = multinom(outcomesObs ~ (genderObs + ethnicityObs + lineupTypeObs)^2) # full model with inter mmod = multinom(outcomesObs ~ genderObs + ethnicityObs + lineupTypeObs) # only the factors no interaction mmodW = step(mmodF) # remove noise factors (here it will just be a fixed probability) predict(mmod,data.frame(genderObs = "female", ethnicityObs = "asian", lineupTypeObs = "B")) predict(mmod,data.frame(genderObs = "male", ethnicityObs = "asian", lineupTypeObs = "B")) predict(mmod,data.frame(genderObs = "male", ethnicityObs = "caucasian", lineupTypeObs = "A")) predict(mmodF,data.frame(genderObs = "female", ethnicityObs = "asian", lineupTypeObs = "B")) predict(mmodW,data.frame(genderObs = "female", ethnicityObs = "asian", lineupTypeObs = "B")) Here is a classification tree in R (on the same data): library(rpart) ct = rpart(outcomesObs ~ genderObs + ethnicityObs + lineupTypeObs) pct = prune(ct, cp=0.05) # pruned tree predict(ct,data.frame(genderObs = "female", ethnicityObs = "asian", lineupTypeObs = "B")) predict(pct,data.frame(genderObs = "female", ethnicityObs = "asian", lineupTypeObs = "B"))
