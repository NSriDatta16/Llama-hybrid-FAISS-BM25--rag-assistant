In my view, the notions of "PCA" and "FA" are on a different dimension from that of notions of "exploratory", "confirmatory" or maybe "inferential". So each of the two mathematical/statistical methods can be applied with one of the three approaches. For instance, why should it be unsensical to have a hypothese, that my data have a general factor and also the structure of a set of principal components (because my experiment with my electronical apparatus gave me nearly errorfree data) and I test my hypothese, that the eigenvalues of the subsequent factors occur with ratio of 75% ? This is then PCA in a confirmatory framework. On the other hand, it seems ridiculous that in our research team we create with much work an item battery for measuring violence between pupils and assuming 3 main behaves (physical agression, depression, search for help by authorities/parents) and putting the concerning questions in that battery ... and "exploratorily" work out how many factors we have... Instead to look, how well our scale contains three recognizable factors (besides neglectable itemspecific and possibly even spuriously correlated error). And after that, when I've confirmed, that indeed our item-battery serves the intention, we might test the hypothese, that in the classes of younger children the loadings on the factor indicating "searching-help-by-authorities" are higher than that of older pupils. Hmmm, again confirmatory... And exploratory? I have a set of measures taken from a research on microbiology from 1960 and they had not much theory but sampled everything they could manage because their field of research was just very young, and I re-explore the dominant factorstructure, assuming (for example), that all errors are of the same amount because of the optical precision of the microscope used (the ppca-ansatz as I have just learnt). Then I use the statistical (and subsequently the mathematical) model for the FA, but in this case in an explorative manner. This is it at least how I understand the terms. Maybe I'm completely on the wrong track here, but I don't assume it. Ps. In the 90'ies I wrote a small interactive program to explore the method of PCA and factoranalysis down to the bottom. It was written in Turbo-Pascal, can still only be run in a Dos-Window ("Dos-box" under Win7) but has a really nice appeal: interactively switching factors to be included or not, then rotate, separate itemspecific error-variance (according to the SMC-criterion or the equal-variances-criterion (ppca?)), switch the Kaiser-option on and off, the use of the covariances on and off - just all while the factorloadingsmatrix is visible like in a spreadsheet and can be rotated for the basic different rotation-methods. It is not highly sophisticated: no chisquare-test for instance, just intended for self-learning of the internal mathematical mechanics. It has also a "demo-mode", where the program runs itself, showing explanative comments on the screen and simulating the keyboard-inputs, which the user normally would do. Whoever is interested to do selfstudy or teaching with it can download it from my small software-pages inside-(R).zip Just expand the files in the zip in a directory accessible by the Dos-Box and call "demoall.bat" In the third part of the "demoall" I've made a demonstration how to model itemspecific errors by rotations from an initially pca-solution...
