You require standardizing (in a particular fashion, not necessarily to standard normal) for the CLT itself, otherwise you won't get convergence in distribution. However, to "use" the CLT to argue that some sum or average should be approximately normal* -- you don't need to standardize, since if the standardized version is approximately normal, so is the unstandardized version. * how this is to work** without knowing some pretty particular things about the distribution is unclear. The sense in which the distribution of some mean (say) at finite $n$ and a normal distribution are close*** is not necessarily particularly helpful for every possible purpose (e.g. knowing that two cdfs are 'within' epsilon of each other at each point may not be particularly helpful if the thing you need isn't directly related to that -- distributions with very similar cdfs may have some quite distinct properties even though their cdfs are alike). ** 'work' in the sense of being confident that the approximation will lead to sufficient accuracy for your purposes in some particular calculation *** the value of this closeness at finite $n$ for a particular parent distribution isn't actually given by the CLT either. [The Berry-Esseen inequality does given a bound on the difference in cdf in terms of a scaled absolute third moment, $E(|X-\mu|^3)/\sigma^3$ and the square root of the sample size. No doubt other kinds of bounds should be possible, though offhand I can't name any.]
