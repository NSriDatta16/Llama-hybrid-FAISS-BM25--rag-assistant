Regarding (c): if your enumerations are defined correctly you should be able to pass them as arguments without a problem. A few things to consider: enumeration storage is often compiler specific, so depending on what kind of development you are doing (you don't mention if it's Windows vs. Linux vs. embedded vs. embedded Linux :) ) you may want to visit compiler options for enum storage to make sure there are no issues there. I generally agree with the above consensus that the compiler should cast your enumerations appropriately - but it's something to be aware of. in the case that you are doing embedded work, many static quality checking programs such as PC Lint will "bark" if you start getting too clever with enums, #defines, and bitfields. If you are doing development that will need to pass through any quality gates, this might be something to keep in mind. In fact, some automotive standards (such as MISRA-C) get downright irritable if you try to get trig with bitfields. "I have just discovered the joy of bitflags." I agree with you - I find them very useful.
