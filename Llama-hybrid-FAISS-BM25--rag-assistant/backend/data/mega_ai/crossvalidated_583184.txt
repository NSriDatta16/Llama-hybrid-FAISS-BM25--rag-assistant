Logistic regression is a generalized linear model. The probability of the response is transformed on the logit scale: $\eta = \log ( \frac{p}{1-p})$ and modeled as a linear combination of variables: $$ \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \beta_0+ \beta_1X$$ The $\beta_0$ is the log odds of response when $X=0$ , and the $\beta_1$ is the log odds ratio comparing groups differing by 1 unit of $X$ . (similar formulations for multivariable models are possible akin to linear regression). In typical biostats pedagogy, they'd explain that odds only make sense to one who gambles. In horse racing, for instance, the odds of victory would reflect the ratio of times you'd expect a champion to win versus lose. So an odds of 1 reflect a proportion or probability of 0.5. Conversely an odds of 2 (read 2-to-1), reflect a proportion or probability of 0.66. Usually we transform the log odds ratio to the odds ratio scale and test the hypothesis for OR=1 to describe a possible association between $X$ and $Y$ . For a binary $X$ , $\exp(\beta_1)$ is exactly equal to $ad/(bc)$ in the $2\times2$ contingency table given by: $$ \begin{array}{c|cc} & Y & \bar{Y} \\ \hline X & a & b \\ \bar{X} & c & d \end{array} $$
