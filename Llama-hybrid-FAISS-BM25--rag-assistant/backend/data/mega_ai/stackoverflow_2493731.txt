This symfony blog article from Fabien describes an elegant solution for an iPhone-optimised version of your website. Change the regexp he uses to something that more broadly matches the browsers/clients used to access your site, and you have a 'mobile' version. EDIT: I would add that perhaps a different 'app' altogether might be a better solution, a la Facebook's m.facebook.com interface.
