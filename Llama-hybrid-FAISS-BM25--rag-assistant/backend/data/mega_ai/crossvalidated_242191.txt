Backward elimination for choosing the AR order

Suppose that we are fitting an AR(p) model to the data (we have fixed the p). Treating the AR(p) model as a multiple regression, we estimate all the parameters using OLS and then use the backward elimination method to toss out the insignificant lags. I have checked a few standard time series textbooks and non of them treats the problem this way. I am new to the time series business, so I'd like to know if some thing is fundamentally wrong with this approach.
