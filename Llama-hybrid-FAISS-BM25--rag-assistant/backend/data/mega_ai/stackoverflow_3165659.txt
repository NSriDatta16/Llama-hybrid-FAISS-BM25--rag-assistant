I've only done XSLT a few times, but each time it seems like a huge maintenance nightmare. At any rate, I think you could set a variable saying what the class is, and then call a function as xsl:template match with the class as the arg. You would declare that function as xsl:template name, because you don't want to match on it automatically. Inside the function you should be able to script out those 100 values. Not sure whether this helps, but it organizes the code in a way that might.
