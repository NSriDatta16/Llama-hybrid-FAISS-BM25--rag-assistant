Conditional Expectation of Multivariate Distributions

My book states that $\mathrm{E}[X_2] = \mathrm{E}[\mathrm{E}[X_2\mid X_1]]$ and gives a weird proof and a short paragraph about how awesome this result is and how intuitive this is. I neither understand the proof nor do I understand the "intuition". Can someone give me both? The textbook proof uses some non-standard notation and weird transformations but I am hoping for a clear lucid proof.
