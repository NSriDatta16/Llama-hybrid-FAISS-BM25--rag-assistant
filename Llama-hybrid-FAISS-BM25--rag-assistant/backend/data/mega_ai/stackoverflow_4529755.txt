Embedding C++ Programs

I'm just getting into advanced C++ programming (object orientation), and I've been looking for hours on how to embed a C++ program into your average browser. I honestly have no idea how. I was thinking the same way you embed JavaScript with HTML using the script type tag. Can someone help me understand how to do this?
