The only reason looping is discouraged is that it is slow. R is designed to work on vectors at a time and has lots of functions to accomplish this. The whole apply family, as well as functions like Vectorize to help out. So the idiom is that if your using for loops you're not thinking in R, but sometimes for loops really are just appropriate. To do this in the R way of thinking, Vectorize your function, if it is not already vectorized (see the Vectorize function) then call that function with the entire column as an argument and assign that to the new column. f The apply family (apply, sapply, lapply, mapply, tapply) are also alternatives. Most native R functions are already vectorized, but be careful when passing extra arguments that are supposed to be interpreted as vectors.
