If you limit yourself to a frequentist framework for the change analysis, then study participants with only 1 observation will be eliminated. An alternative might be to switch to a Bayesian framework where individuals with only a single observed period in a multiperiod model do not represent a limitation. See chapter 13 of Gelman and Hill's book Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Modeling .
