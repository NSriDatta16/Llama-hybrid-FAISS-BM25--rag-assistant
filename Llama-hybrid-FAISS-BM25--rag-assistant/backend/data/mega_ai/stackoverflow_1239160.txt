It sounds like you're referring to comb fields, not kerning. Kerning is adjusting the spacing between characters so that letters like AV can be pushed closer together and still look good. A comb field is a field where each letter has a specific visible box that it fits into. I believe it's named a comb field because the spacing resembles the teeth of a comb. Comb fields are common on government forms and are used to encourage you to print your answer. Comb fields don't make a lot of sense for an electronic form, but sometimes the electronc form has to exactly match the print form for legal reasons. Try loading the form in LiveCycle Designer, which comes with Acrobat. If it's an XFA form (vs an AcroForms form), then you'll be able to edit the kerning in Designer.
