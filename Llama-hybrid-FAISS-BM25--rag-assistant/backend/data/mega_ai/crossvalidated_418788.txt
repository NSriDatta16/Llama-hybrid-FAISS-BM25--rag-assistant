How to Interpret output Coefficients of Linear Support Vector Regression?

I'm looking to interpret the output from my SVR model. I know that with SVM you can't directly interpret the coefficients of the model but that you first have to take a dot product With that said, how would one interpret the coefficients of a linear kernel SVR model? Hence, once I've obtained the coefficients vector, what transformation do I need to apply and how would I go about interpreting the results?
