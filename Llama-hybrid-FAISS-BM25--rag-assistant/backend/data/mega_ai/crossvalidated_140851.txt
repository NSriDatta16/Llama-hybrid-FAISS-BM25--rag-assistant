Should you decide to reduce the number of explanatory variables and be willing to work with latent variables , consider performing an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) , which usually is followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) . Of course, this is not the only approach to consider. For example, you can use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform factor analysis . PCA is a widely used method of dimensionality reduction, when one doesn't care much about latent structure of concepts , involved in a research study. Otherwise, I would recommend the EFA/CFA approach. This answer is not intended as a comprehensive one, but rather as one, illuminating some of the potential paths of further inquiry. Ultimately, it's a matter of your research problem and goals, time frame, resources and feasibility, considering all the above. I will let other, more knowledgeable, people to advise you on multicollinearity issues and interaction effects (or search this website).
