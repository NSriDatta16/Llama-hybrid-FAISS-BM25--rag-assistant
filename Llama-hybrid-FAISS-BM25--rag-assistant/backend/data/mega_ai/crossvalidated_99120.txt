There are two typical cases when you get multiple points per group (per day in your case) and want to weight for the number of values per group: the individual points are not available, only their mean and the number of values. Then you weight by the number of values (in a weighted average or a weighted regression, for example). the individual points are available. Then you simply include all the individual points - the repeated values themselves provide the 'weight' - a group with two observations will get two observations of weight, while a group with five observations will get all five providing weight. You're in the second case, so there's nothing to do - just use all your data. If you are (for example) computing an overall mean, then a straight average of all the data gives more weight to the days with more data.
