How do I compare traditional classifiers performance with my proposed method?

I want to compare my proposed method with traditional machine learning classifiers like Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) and SVM to check the classification accuracy.How do I compare different classifiers?. I want to draw a comparison between these three terms 1).Proposed method (Based on DNN) 2).Shallow neural networks 3).SVM
