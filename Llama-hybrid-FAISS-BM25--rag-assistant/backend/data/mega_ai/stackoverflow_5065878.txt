Tracing memory leak

There is a memory leak in my cocoa application and I have done everything possible to find its owner but have been unable to. The leak began a couple days ago when I implemented the GCD version of the AsyncSocket framework. I do not know if it is my own code making the leak appear or if it is the library itself. Instruments does not provide a good back trace. Only thing vague one: 0 libSystem.B.dylib calloc 1 CoreFoundation __addHandler2 2 Foundation +[__NSObserver isAnObserver:] 3 Foundation -[NSNotificationCenter removeObserver:name:object:] 4 Foundation -[NSNotificationCenter removeObserver:] 5 Foundation -[NSRunLoop(NSRunLoop) dealloc] 6 CoreFoundation CFRelease 7 CoreFoundation __CFFinalizeRunLoop 8 libSystem.B.dylib _pthread_tsd_cleanup 9 libSystem.B.dylib _pthread_exit 10 libSystem.B.dylib start_wqthread Can someone please point me in the direction needed to do more advanced tracing or reverse engineering, etc.?
