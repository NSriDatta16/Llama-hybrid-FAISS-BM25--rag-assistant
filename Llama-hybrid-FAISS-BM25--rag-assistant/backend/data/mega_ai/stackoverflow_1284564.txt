Remember to use header include guards in headers like: #ifndef header_name_h #define header_name_h ... #endif This helps you to keep to the one definition rule when multiple headers include your header. Update: I have since found that the latest versions of Visual Studio and gcc both allow: #pragma once Also, Never Ever have: using namespace ; in a header as this can cause strange ambiguity problems.
