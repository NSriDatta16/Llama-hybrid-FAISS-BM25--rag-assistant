How do I get a MessageBox like information window to appear in Java?

I'm learning Java and I have no idea how to do this. I dragged a button on the form in Netbeans, double clicked it and it created this event: @Action public void HelloClickMethod() { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "The message!", "This is supposed to be the MessageBox title."); } This is the exception the IDE brings up. Cannot find symbol. Symbol: showMessageDialog() Edit 1> Now I changed it to this: @Action public void HelloClickMethod() { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "The message!", "This is supposed to be the MessageBox title.",JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE); } However the IDE is saying I have an error in the word 'this'. "Cannot find symbol". I don't understand. Why is it so dificult and why are the errors so esoteric. :P
