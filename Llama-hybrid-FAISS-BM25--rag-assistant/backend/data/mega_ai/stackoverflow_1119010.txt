Magento core function working in remote system displaying error in another system

In catalog.xml file of frontend template folder I had blocks defined for tabs to display product tags,additional information etc.in this way: additional Additional Information catalog/product_view_attributes catalog/product/view/attributes.phtml Which was working fine in the remote system, but when i installed it in local Magento and tried to make one extra .phtml file for displaying brand image in the tab, then in product details page, the following error is displayed: Fatal error: Call to a member function setTemplate() on a non-object in C:\wamp\www\magento\app\code\core\Mage\Catalog\Block\Product\View\Tabs.php on line 60 The above file is a part of the core which I did not modify. I tried replacing all the core files but still it is not working.
