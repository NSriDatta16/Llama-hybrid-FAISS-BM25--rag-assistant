Combining single-point estimates and two-point (range) estimates

I'm looking at capital costs of different battery technologies, with the aim of conducting a meta-analysis of both the published literature and known commercial installations. It's quite common for a range to be quoted, though some authors provide a single-point estimate, and installations provide one value. My task is to provide a single-point descriptor of the population with an associated measure of uncertainty. This will be an input into later modelling work. One option is to collapse the ranges to mid-ranges and treat them as additional single-points, but it seems a shame to throw away information on spread. On the other hand, the number of samples used to produce the ranges aren't quoted, so perhaps I can't do any better. Is this the case, and if not, what methods should I consider? I'm open to both Bayesian and frequentist approaches. I appreciate it's far from ideal conditions for rigorous statistics, and there are a number of other factors working against me (sparse data, nuisance parameters, outliers) but some insights into this aspect alone would be great.
