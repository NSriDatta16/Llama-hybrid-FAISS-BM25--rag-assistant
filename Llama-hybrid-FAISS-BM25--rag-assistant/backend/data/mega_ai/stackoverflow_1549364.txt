how to use erlang lists:map function

The following is a erlang function. I don't understand how lists:map function is used here. Could someone please explain? % perform M runs with N calls to F in each run. % For each of the M runs, determine the average time per call. % Return, the average and standard deviation of these M results. time_it(F, N, M) -> G = fun() -> F(), ok end, NN = lists:seq(1, N), MM = lists:seq(1, M), T = lists:map( fun(_) -> T0 = now(), % start timer [ G() || _ Thanks. also, I don't know the proper syntax when using this function. For example, I have a dummy() function take 1 parameter. I get an error while trying to time the dummy function. moduleName:time_it(moduleName:dummy/1, 10, 100). the above would evaluate to illegal expression. Actually, now with the correct syntax, the function can be invoked correctly with: moduleName:time_it(fun moduleName:dummy/1, 10, 100). However, it will throw a exception saying invoking dummy function without passing any parameter. I think this line is the villain, [ G() || _ I have no idea how to fix it.
