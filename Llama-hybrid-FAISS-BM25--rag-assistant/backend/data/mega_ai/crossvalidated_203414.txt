I think what you described about using a "long format" for your data is perfectly reasonable. Additionally I think it is very natural to model this having a repeated measurements design; after all you are repeatedly measuring the consumption of each of your bees. Having said that there are some caveats you need to be careful with: You do not have many Subjects (6) so you cannot have anything more than rather simple random-effects structures. You appear to use Time as a factor to define a random intercept (1|Time) , this is somewhat counter-intuitive. I suspect you want to use it within a random slope per subject (Time|Subject) . Because of point 1 you will probably be unable to properly account for correlation between random factors in the context of (Time|Subject) . I would suggest using uncorrelated random slopes and intercepts (Time + 0 | Subject) . You might need to consider using MCMCglmm to have a somewhat more informed model . This will allow you to define some weak priors for your random effects variance structure. MCMCglmm fits multivariate mixed models natively.
