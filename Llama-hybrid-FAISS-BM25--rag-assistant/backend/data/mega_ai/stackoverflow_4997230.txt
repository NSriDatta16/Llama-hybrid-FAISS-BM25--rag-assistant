You cannot. What, that isn't good enough? There are a couple different ways to get around this limitation, none of which are good. First, use the standard interface definition to require a TryParse method on instances. In order to use this, of course, you have to have an instance. An example of this would be the Create method of IActivityTemplateFactory . The method doesn't need to be instance, and in fact most factories you'll find are static (whether or not that's a good thing is another question). But in order to be able to 1) locate a factory for an Activity and 2) call that method which 3) can be overridden by child types it must be defined within an interface. Second is to use Attributes. An example would be the TypeConverterAttribute . You might be able to leverage this type to do what you want, or you can create something similar that will have your TryParse method.
