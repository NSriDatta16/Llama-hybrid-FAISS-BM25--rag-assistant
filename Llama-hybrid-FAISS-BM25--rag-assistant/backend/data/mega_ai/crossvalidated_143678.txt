Your model should be written as fit as subplots are nested within site. although (1|plot) + (1|subplot) would work if the subplots are uniquely labeled (i.e. 1A,1B,1C,...,2A,2B,2C rather than A,B,C...,A,B,C). My book chapter from Fox et al. Ecological Statistics describes an example of nesting: On the other hand, in the tick example each chick occurs in only one brood, and each brood occurs in only one site: the model specification is (1 | SITE/BROOD/INDEX) , read as “chick (INDEX) nested within brood nested within site,” or equivalently (1 | SITE) + (1 | SITE:BROOD) + (1 | SITE:BROOD:INDEX) . If the broods and chicks are uniquely labeled, so that the software can detect the nesting, (1 | SITE) + (1 | BROOD) + (1 | INDEX) will also work (do not use (1 | SITE) + (1 | SITE/BROOD) + (1 | SITE/BROOD/INDEX) ; it will lead to redundant terms in the model). Other thoughts: more information on nesting and model specifications at http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq are your irrigation treatments really organized as shown in the schematic above, i.e. non-interspersed? Or is that just for convenience of graphical presentation? If the former, then you have a potentially problematic experimental design ... Since subplots are nested within sites, it would be just fine inferentially (following Murtaugh 2007 Ecology "Simplicity and complexity in ecological data analysis" ) to take the plot means and analyze the data at the plot level. For what it's worth, I think you could go even farther and aggregate to the plot level; then you could skip mixed models entirely and just do lm(y~treatment*irrigation, data=my_aggregated_data)
