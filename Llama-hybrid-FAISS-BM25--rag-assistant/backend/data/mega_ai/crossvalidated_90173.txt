The uniform prior does not move the mode. The mode of the posterior is equal to the mle in this case. The comparison is made between the posterior expectation, or mean value, and the mle. From a pragmatic perspective, the argument is a bit silly, as the two values differ by an order of $\frac {2}{N_1+N_0 } $ anyway. So the only time they are different is when you have a small sample size - in which case niether falls outside the "region of uncertainty" associated with the other.
