I'm not aware of any SCM that will do this out of the box, mainly because this is a process/worflow issue not a source control management issue. Also as other people have correctly said, discouraging regular check-ins to your depository is a bad thing and starts to undermine the point of having an SCM solution in the first place. So you're going to have do some element of 'roll your own' as only you know the exact process you want to achieve. Here's how I'd do it in perforce: 1) Every coder creates a user branch 2) All changes are checked into their user branch and never into the main branch 3) Coder requests that their code is promoted to main : i) Code is reviewed ( either manually by syncing to their user branch or through some code review tool like CodeCollaborator or Crucible ) ii) Code is marked as 'clean' 4) User then integrates the main branch down to their user branch and resolves any merge conflicts 5) Code is then integrated up to main. There are still issues to resolve with this approach i.e if between steps 4 and 5, someone else has integrated to main then step 4 will have to be done again so you might want to consider having a single integrator or having an exclusive lock on the main integration step
