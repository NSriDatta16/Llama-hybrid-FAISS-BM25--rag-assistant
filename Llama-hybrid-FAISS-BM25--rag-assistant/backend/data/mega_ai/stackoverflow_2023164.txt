Short answer: no (have a look at this previous answer for more details). You'll need an external plugin like the dashboard (actually, don't use it, see my previous answer), XRadar or Sonar to aggregate the reports. But in this area, Sonar is the clear winner (this project just rocks) and I'd recommend it without any hesitation. Check out Nemo , their public instance, pick up any project and have a look at the drill down of code coverage (for example Apache CXF ) to get an idea of what it can do. UPDATE: It appears that I missed the point of the initial question so I'm updating my answer accordingly. Basically, I now understand the question as "how to instrument an ear with cobertura" and this is indeed a totally different story. Unfortunately, while cobertura can instrument an ear, sar, zip, war, jar, I' don't think that the cobertura-maven-plugin supports this out-of-the-box and it may be a better option to use cobertura's ant task with the antrun plugin. See MCOBERTURA-86 , this thread and this discussion for more background on this (and an antrun sample). TBH, what you are trying to do is really not easy in terms of build lifecycle, packaging, reporting, etc and is going to be a tough task because of the lack of support from the cobertura plugin. I'd really think about it twice (time to invest to get the whole thing working vs the value generated) or consider spending that time (understand money) to get a clover license (which offers better support for this).
