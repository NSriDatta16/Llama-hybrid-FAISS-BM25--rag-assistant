As far as I know, there is no difference. pragma lib simply says to the linker to look for a specific library by name. Also, since the path is not specified in the pragma, the linker relies on the current lib paths for your project. Try not add any path to your linker options (by default DX SDK adds paths to any visual studio installed, directly modifying the global visual studio paths. See Tools/Options/Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories/Show Directories for Library files) Some things to check: you are indeed building for x64 your path is really pointing to the DX SDK (it is installed to Program Files(x86) if you are on x64) verify if there are not other linker warnings
