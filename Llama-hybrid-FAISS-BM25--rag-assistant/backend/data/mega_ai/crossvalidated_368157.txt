Determine AR term from PACF plot

I have the a time series data, the acf and pacf for which have been displayed below: I get that MA term is 1. But I'm confused about AR term since it is geometrically decaying from 7th lag. Do I need to transform the data again to eliminate this? PS: This data has already been differenced once.
