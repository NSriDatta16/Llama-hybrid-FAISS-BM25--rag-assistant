The three different learning paradigms The Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation (Simon Haykin) divides learning methods in these categories: Learning with a teacher: Supervised learning Learning without a teacher: Reinforcement learning / Neurodynamic programming Unsupervised learning So essentially, there are three different learning paradigms: Supervised learning , Reinforcement learning and Unsupervised Learning . Similarities and differences Reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning have the similarity that you will not need training data to begin with (no target y-values, so no "teacher" to provide the desired response). But reinforcement learning is not unsupervised, as it needs "continued interaction with the environment in order to minimize a scalar index of performance" [Haykin]. In unsupervised learning the network "develops the ability to form internal representations for encoding features of the input and thereby to create new classes automatically" [Haykin]. It has no feedback loop with the environment as reinforcement learning has; It has just the input dataset. Takeaway Reinforcement learning is not a subset of Unsupervised learning; the statement in the article is false. But they both are learning without a teacher .
