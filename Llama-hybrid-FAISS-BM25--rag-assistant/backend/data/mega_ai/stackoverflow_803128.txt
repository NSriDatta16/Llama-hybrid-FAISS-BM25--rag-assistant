There's no reason that MySql couldn't handle that kind of load without any significant issues. There are a number of other variables involved though (otherwise, it's a 'how long is a piece of string' question). Personally, I've had a number of tables in various databases that are well beyond that range. How large is each record (on average) How much RAM does the database server have - and how much is allocated to the various configurations of Mysql/InnoDB. A default configuration may only allow for a default 8MB buffer between disk and client (which might work fine for a single user) - but trying to fit a 6GB+ database through that is doomed to failure. That problem was real btw - and was causing several crashes a day of a database/website till I was brought in to trouble-shoot it. If you are likely to do a great deal more with that database, I'd recommend getting someone with a little more experience, or at least oing what you can to be able to give it some optimisations. Reading ' High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition ' is a good start, as is looking at some tools like Maatkit .
