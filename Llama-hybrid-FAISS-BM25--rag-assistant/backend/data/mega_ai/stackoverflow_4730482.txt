Java EE is a set of interfaces/annotations/etc for performing tons of different kinds of tasks commonly needed when building, well, 'Enterprise' applications. (the definition of which is its own multipage thread.) Glassfish is includes an implementation for each of the different APIs that make up JavaEE. Basically, when you use Glassfish, you can just go ahead and use anything in a 'javax ' package and it will be there for you, working. (although sometimes not the most performant or scalable implementation available...) There are several options for java web containers that don't include implementations of the entire J2EE API built in. Tomcat and Jetty are probably the two most popular and widely used. Tomcat installs and integrates right into netbeans very well. But if you find yourself wanting to use something in most javax packages, you will need to provide an implementation, include the jar files yourself, etc. -- Also, as an aside, the very, very nice Glassfish administration console (which is to me the chief motivator for using Glassfish) is done in JSF, so no, you can't really remove it :)
