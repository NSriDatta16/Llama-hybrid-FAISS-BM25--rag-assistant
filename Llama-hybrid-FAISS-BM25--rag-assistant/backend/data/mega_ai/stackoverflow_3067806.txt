(This is probably just repeating what other answers were trying to say ... However, it is worth saying this clearly .) The Java garbage collector runs automatically as required, and there is no need to start it. There is a static method ( System.gc() ) that an application can call to request that the garbage collector run "now". However: The JVM can be configured to pay no attention to this request. It is generally a bad idea to make this request because it can significantly degrade garbage collector performance. Generally speaking, the best time to run the garbage collector is when there is lots of garbage to be collected, and only the JVM knows when that is likely to be. EDIT - the cure for large garbage collection latencies is to change the JVM's garbage collector properties to select the low latency collector. Calling System.gc() is not the way to deal with this in a modern JVM.
