You did not state your goal. If the goal is estimation or prediction it is not appropriate to use a "difference to detect" but rather to solve for $N$ that will result in adequate estimation of the expected value of $Y$ given $X$ , i.e., the regression equation. Another good approach is to solve for $N$ such that you can estimate $R^2$ with a good margin of error. I discuss a few approaches in https://hbiostat.org/rms including a simple calculation based on estimating $\sigma^2$ (this usually takes about $N=70$ or greater). In the RMS book and course notes I also have a case study demonstrating that it is not appropriate to analyze HbA1c on the original scale, and that ordinal regression (semiparametric models such as the proportional hazards model) are superior. If you had to analyze HbA1c parametrically a transformation that comes close to working is to raise it to the minus 1.5 power. If you don't pay special attention you'll find that your model is not variance stabilized (i.e., you have heteroscedasticity).
