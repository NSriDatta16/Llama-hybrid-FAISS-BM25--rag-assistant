eclipse galileo not responding ubuntu 64-bit

I'm having a problem with eclipse galileo on ubuntu 64-bit system. when ever i open it the splash scree turns gray but keeps loading and then when eclipse opens it shows the secure storage password request and hangs. I dont know what could be wrong, it used to work fine before, if you have or had the same problem please tell me what to do
