Linux max server processes

I have a GNU/Linux Debian server running: apache, jboss, proftpd and postgresql (RAM: 16GB, 4 core Xeon). Max Apache process is 1200, same thing for the Jboss DB Pool. And I can have up to 400 simultaneous FTP download. Load average can raise 5 (1 most of time). What do you think about that? Is this server considered as "too loaded"? Regards,
