You can avoid making two passes over the data by accumulating the mean and mean-square cnt = 0 mean = 0 meansqr = 0 loop over array cnt++ mean += value meansqr += value*value mean /= cnt meansqr /= cnt and forming sigma = sqrt(meansqr - mean^2) A factor of cnt/(cnt-1) is often appropriate as well. BTW-- The first pass over the data in Demi and McWafflestix answers are hidden in the calls to Average . That kind of thing is certainly trivial on a small list, but if the list exceed the size of the cache, or even the working set, this gets to be a bid deal.
