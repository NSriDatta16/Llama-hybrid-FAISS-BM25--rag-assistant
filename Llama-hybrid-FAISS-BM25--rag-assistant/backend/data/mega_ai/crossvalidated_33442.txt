I would like to hear from Stephane or some other Bayesian expert on this. I would say no because it is a different approach not a generalization. In another context this has been argued here before. Don't think that just because flat priors produce results close to maximum likelihood that a Bayesian method with a flat prior is frequentist! I think that would be a false presumption that would lead you to think that by making the prior arbitrary you are generalizing to other possible priors. I don't think that way and I am pretty sure most Bayesian don't either. So some people do argue it but I don't think they should be classified as Bayesians although Stephane has pointed out the difficulty with strong classification. So strictly speaking if the word is ever then I guess it might depend on how you define Bayesian.
