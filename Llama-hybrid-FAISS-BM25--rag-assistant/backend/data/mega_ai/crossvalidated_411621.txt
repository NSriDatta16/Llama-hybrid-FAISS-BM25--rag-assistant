Binary classification with binary predictors

I have a dataset with a binary response variable and 45 binary predictors. Which possible classification algorithms can I use? And how can i perform feature selection when most methods like best subset selection are built on minimizing RSS and dimension reduction methods like PCA finds M I am currently looking at logistic regression, decision trees(RF and boosting) and SVM.
