How to quantify increasing nature of dataset

There is a call center which records the number of complaints against a service on daily basis. For example, the values below show the number of complaints in a month 01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 05,06,07,05,05,04,05,04,07,08,07,08,06,07,07,06,08,08,09,11,12,11,07,13,13,15,16,18,19,21 I am not trying to estimate anything here. By looking at the graph i can see that the overall values are increasing from right to left. I don't know much statistics other than mean, median, mode so i phrased it as "increasing nature". I want a single numeric value (e.g. standard deviation) which would let me know if it is a straight horizontal line or going downwards or going upwards from left to right. For example, suppose there is a function XYZ (which i am looking for) which receives this dataset and returns a numeric value from 0 to 100. 0 means the highly decreasing nature, 50 means straight line and 100 means highly increasing nature. If the graph is increasing and decreasing symmetrically across a horizontal line then the result would be 50 (as an average of increasing and decreasing natures). If the graph has more increasing nature then decreasing then the result would be > 50 and vice versa. Following are some sample graphs Question: How can I quantify increasing nature of this given data?
