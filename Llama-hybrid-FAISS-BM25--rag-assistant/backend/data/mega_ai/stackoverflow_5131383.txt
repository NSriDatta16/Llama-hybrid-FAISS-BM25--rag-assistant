Move UIView With Deceleration

I have a need to tap and drag a UIView on the screen with deceleration. I have written the code very nicely for moving the view with touches, but need the object to keep moving with a certain degree of inertia (once a certain acceleration threshold is met), decelerating until it stops, or meets the boundary of the screen. This is not for a game, but using some standard UIView controls. The biggest part I am grappling with is the acceleration. Any good algorithms that you have written to accomplish the same? Edit: I am using an animation block on the touchesEnded: method, but there is a noticeable delay between the time that a person lets go of their finger and the animation kicks in: [UIView transitionWithView:self duration:UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone ? 0.33f : 0.33f * 2.0f options:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseOut animations:^(void){ if (dir == 1) // Flicked left { self.center = CGPointMake(self.frame.size.width * 0.5f, self.center.y); } else { // Flicked right self.center = CGPointMake( self.superview.bounds.size.width - (self.frame.size.width * 0.5f), self.center.y); } } completion:^(BOOL finished){ // Do nothing }];
