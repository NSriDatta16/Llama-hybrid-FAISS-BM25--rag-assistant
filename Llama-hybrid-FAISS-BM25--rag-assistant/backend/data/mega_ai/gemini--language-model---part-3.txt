le announced that Gemini in Android Studio would be able to understand simple UI mockups and transform them into working Jetpack Compose code. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental was released on March 25, 2025, described by Google as its most intelligent AI model yet, featuring enhanced reasoning and coding capabilities, and a "thinking model" capable of reasoning through steps before responding, using techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, whilst maintaining native multimodality and launching with a 1 million token context window. At Google I/O 2025, Google announced significant updates to its Gemini core models. Gemini 2.5 Flash became the default model, delivering faster responses. Gemini 2.5 Pro was introduced as the most advanced Gemini model, featuring reasoning, coding capabilities, and the new Deep Think mode for complex tasks. Both 2.5 Pro and Flash support native audio output and improved security. On June 17, 2025, Google announced general availability for 2.5 Pro and Flash. They also introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite that same day, a model optimized for speed and cost-efficiency. Model versions The following table lists the main model versions of Gemini, describing the significant changes included with each version: Technical specifications As Gemini is multimodal, each context window can contain multiple forms of input. The different modes can be interleaved and do not have to be presented in a fixed order, allowing for a multimodal conversation. For example, the user might open the conversation with a mix of text, picture, video, and audio, presented in any order, and Gemini might reply with the same free ordering. Input images may be of different resolutions, while video is inputted as a sequence of images. Audio is sampled at 16 kHz and then converted into a sequence of tokens by the Universal Speech Model. Gemini's dataset is multimodal and multilingual, consisting of "web documents, books, and code, and includ[ing] image, audio, and video data". Gemini and Gemma models are decoder-only transformers, with modifications to allow efficient training and inference on TPUs. The 1.0 generation uses multi-query attention. No whitepapers were published for Gemini 2.0 and Gemini 2.5. Reception Gemini's launch was preceded by months of intense speculation and anticipation, which MIT Technology Review described as "peak AI hype". In August 2023, Dylan Patel and Daniel Nishball of research firm SemiAnalysis penned a blog post declaring that the release of Gemini would "eat the world" and outclass GPT-4, prompting OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to ridicule the duo on X (formerly Twitter). Business magnate Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, weighed in, asking, "Are the numbers wrong?" Hugh Langley of Business Insider remarked that Gemini would be a make-or-break moment for Google, writing: "If Gemini dazzles, it will help Google change the narrative that it was blindsided by Microsoft and OpenAI. If it disappoints, it will embolden critics who say Google has fallen behind." Reacting to its unveiling in December 2023, University of Washington professor emeritus Oren Etzioni predicted a "tit-for-tat arms race" between Google and OpenAI. Professor Alexei Efros of the University of California, Berkeley praised the potential of Gemini's multimodal approach, while scientist Melanie Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute called Gemini "very sophisticated". Professor Chirag Shah of the University of Washington was less impressed, likening Gemini's launch to the routineness of Apple's annual introduction of a new iPhone. Similarly, Stanford University's Percy Liang, the University of Washington's Emily Bender, and the University of Galway's Michael Madden cautioned that it was difficult to interpret benchmark scores without insight into the training data used. Writing for Fast Company, Mark Sullivan opined that Google had the opportunity to challenge the iPhone's dominant market share, believing that Apple was unlikely to have the capacity to develop
