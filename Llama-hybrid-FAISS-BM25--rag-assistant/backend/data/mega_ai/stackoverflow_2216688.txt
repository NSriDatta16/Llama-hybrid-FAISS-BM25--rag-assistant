Is there a PHP IDE that can handle Magento's code base?

Magento has a large code base (6000+ php files), uses a complex autoloading logic, and has a lot of configuration in XML. I'm looking for an IDE that can get its little brain around this code base - show me where a function is declared, where it's called, etc. Is there any IDE that can handle this beast? EDIT - Adding examples Here's an example of how to load a product the Magento way: $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($productID) Getting a helper class looks similar: $helper = Mage::getHelper('catalog/product') Additionally, the getters and setters of attributes are often assumed from the model, which may very well have been declared in an XML file somewhere, rather than in code.
