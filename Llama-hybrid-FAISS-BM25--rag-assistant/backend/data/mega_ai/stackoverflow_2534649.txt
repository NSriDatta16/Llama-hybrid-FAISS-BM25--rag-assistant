I depends on how you arrange them. A nested if is equivalent to adding an and to each of the inner ifs: if(A) { if(B) { statement1 } else if(C) { statement2 } } is equivalent to: if(A and B) { statement1 } else if(A and C) { statement2 } My advice is to strive for readability and check your logic. You may find DeMorgan's Laws useful for re-arranging your logic. Here's one that always irritates me: if(A and B) { statement1 statement2 } else if(A and C) { statement1 statement3 } else if(not A) { statement4 } vs if(A) { statement1 if(B) { statement2 } else if(C) { statement3 } } else if(not A) { statement4 } I'm just not sure which is more readable. They are logically equivalent. The first is more tabular and easier on the eye but repeats statement1; the second is more nested and a little uglier (to my eye) but does not repeat statements. Ultimately it's a judgment call because it makes no difference to the compiler.
