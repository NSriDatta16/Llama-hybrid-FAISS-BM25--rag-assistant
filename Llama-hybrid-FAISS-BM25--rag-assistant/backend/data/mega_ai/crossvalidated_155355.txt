Neural networks would work like a charm. More specifically, I would go for a convolutional neural network, as they have been proven to outperform any other classifier in image recognition competitions like ImageNet ( http://www.image-net.org/ ) the last few years, substantially outperforming SVMs in such tasks. They are able to learn features (usually much better than hand-crafted ones HoG, SIFT etc.) with location and slight transformation invariance (because of the convolutions and the pooling), which makes them a very attractive choice. Now, I would suggest writing your implementation in Torch7 ( http://torch.ch/ ), which is considered the state-of-the-art in deep learning (supported by NYU, Facebook AI and Google Deepmind). Then I would base my architecture in any of the ImageNet models ( https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/tree/master/torch7/imagenet_winners ) and probably simplify it a lot as you have only 4 classes. Another, popular alternative is Caffe where it might be easier to start with. If you want to read about Convolution Networks in Caffe this might be of your interest ( http://libccv.org/doc/doc-convnet/ ).
