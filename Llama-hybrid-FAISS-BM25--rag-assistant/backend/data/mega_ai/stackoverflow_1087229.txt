Is there a way to detach a project from CVS in Xcode?

XCode's CVS support is abysmally bad. Or maybe it's just the server in my organization. Either way, it's leading to more headaches than it's worth so I'd like to "detatch" the project as I can in Eclipse. Is there an easy way to do this or do I have to manually delete all of the CVS files?
