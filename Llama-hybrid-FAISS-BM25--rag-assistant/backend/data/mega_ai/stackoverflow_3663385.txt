On a file-based sessions system, maintain a counter somewhere which triggers a periodic check of the database for updates, something like: 100) { $banished = ... // get banishment flag from database if ($banished) { $_SESSION['loggedIn'] = FALSE; } } ?> and then decide how long you'd like a banned user to be allowed to continue poking around the site until the session data is refreshed and they get booted. Another option is an external script which runs through the session storage directory, loads each in turn, checks if the user's banned, and updates the session file as appropriate. But this would be painful on even a moderately busy system as you open/unserialize/check banishment/update/reserialize potentially thousands of session files every X minutes.
