jqgrid (3.5 anyway) doesn't seem to have an elegant built in way to do this. The best I have found so far is to add something like the following to your grid options: rowList:[10,20,30,100000000], loadComplete: function() { $("option[value=100000000]").text('All'); }, Where the 100000000 is some arbitrarily higher number than the maximum # of rows you will ever return, and the option[value=] line is so your user interface looks a little nicer. Jenky, but works for me.
