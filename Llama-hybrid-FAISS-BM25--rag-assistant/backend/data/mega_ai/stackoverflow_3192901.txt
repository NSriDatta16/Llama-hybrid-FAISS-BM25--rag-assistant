HTML5-Compatible User-Agent Strings?

I'm interested in writing a log file analyzer that can determine the percentage of users who have HTML5-Canvas support based on the user agent strings in the logs. However, having scoured some of the literature out there on the subject, it's not obvious to me what I should be looking for in the user-agent string. One simple option would just be to build a dictionary of all browsers which support HTML5-Canvas - do you know if such a table exists? If not, where would you start then?
