VS 2008 VB snippets for C#

I recently made the switch to a new job and consequently the switch from VB.NET to C#. One thing that I miss is all the snippets that are available in VB.NET. VB.NET comes with ~400 snippets and C# only comes with ~100. Also, I have noticed that the majority of VB.NET snippets are task oriented which is exceptionally helpful when you hit those tasks that you only do every now and again (e.g. DeterminetheAmountofIsolatedStorageAvailable). So, before I go through the pain of converting my favorite VB.NET snippets over to C#, does anyone know if someone has already done this and made it available for download? I've searched for this for a few days now and haven't come up with anything.
