It turns out that the conversion to VS 2010 makes the build agent have to use the .NET 4.0 version of msbuild. So I followed the steps outlined here and it worked: Building .NET 4.0 Applications Using Team Build 2008 . Keep in mind that those instructions were written during the beta and the path is now v4.0.30319. This was required even though all my projects are targeting 3.5 Basically I had to make a one line change and now everything is happy (still working on getting my build to pass but the order is good). It had nothing to do with dependencies not being preserved, simply that the way dependencies were being managed wasn't understood by msbuild 3.5
