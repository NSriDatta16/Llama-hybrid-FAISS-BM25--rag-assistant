jQuery UI Draggable/Sortable - Get reference to new item

I am using the jQuery UI Draggable/Sortable demo (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable) for the basis of my project. I need to get a reference to the that gets cloned into the sortable when the sortable receives it. I tried the sortable's receive event, but that only gives a reference to the original draggable , and not its clone.
