If you are using Maven 2, you can simply create several parent levels. The first pom.xml ( pom1 ) will define the basic properties (such as repositories for example). The second pom.xml ( pom2 ), which has pom1 as , will define the reporting information. And so on... Finally, the "real" pom.xml will inherit from the pom2 and will define its own properties. You can create as many parent levels as you want (of course, it will be harder to maintain if you have 5 parent levels). Note that Maven 3 talked about introducing the mixin concept , which will allow you to fragment your pom.xml into several files, but it looks like that is not happening now until maven 4
