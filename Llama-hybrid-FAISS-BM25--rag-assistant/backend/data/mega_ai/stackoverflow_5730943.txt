Looks like it's going to some SMTP server, which either your IIS is forwarding to or your organizations SMTP server. If it's just for development, you can use the PickUP directory feature which would let you test withtout having any SMTP setup. Good amount of information exists on google EDIT Removed google link. Some people did not like it. Though I did not mean to offend anyone, I still removed, but my intention remains to help
