Caching a reference to an element in an iframe with jquery

I am using a jquery dialog that uses an iframe to let the user know there session is about to expire. I would like to update this dialog every second with a countdown, thus I would like to cache a reference to the countdown element so we don't have to query the DOM for it each second. I have tried to do this many different ways and I can't seem to get it working. $(documnet).ready(function() { $(" ").dialog({ autoOpen: false, title: "Your session is about to expire!", modal: true, width: 400, height: 200, closeOnEscape: false, draggable: false, resizable: false, buttons: { "Yes, Keep Working": function(){ $(this).dialog("close"); }, "No, Logoff": function(){ //log user out } } }); // cache a reference to the countdown element. // these below don't cache the reference I have tried them all. var $countdown = $("#iframeDialog").contents().find("#dialog-countdown"); var $countdown = $("#dialog-countdown", window.child); var $countdown = $("#dialog-countdown", $('iframe').get(0).contentDocument); //this is where I update the #dialog-countdown every second after the reference is made. }); active_timer.html: You will be logged off in seconds. Do you want to continue your session?
