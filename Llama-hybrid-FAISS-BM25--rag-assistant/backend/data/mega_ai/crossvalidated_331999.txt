Clustering and plotting in a vector space

I have a vector-space-model. I want to cluster the embeddings (based on similarity) in this model, but I have following dilemma / confusion: Should I first cluster in the higher dimensional space and then do dimensionality reduction to get a 2D plot I can display? or first do the dimensionality reduction to a 2D space and then cluster on the 2D representations?
