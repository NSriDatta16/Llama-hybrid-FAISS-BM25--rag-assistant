There is no difference. This is because the maximum likelihood solution of the parameters of the joint problem $Y = W^T φ(x)$ with K target variables decouples to K independent regression problems, assuming a conditional distribution of the target vector to be an isotropic Gaussian of the form $p(t|φ(x),W, β) = N (t|W^T φ(x), β^{-1} I)$ . Refer to section '3.1.5 Multiple outputs' from the book 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning', Bishop for details.
