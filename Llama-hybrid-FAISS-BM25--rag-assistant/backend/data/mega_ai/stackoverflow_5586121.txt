How to organise class files in C#

I am working on a simple project and I have created several classes, interfaces, one static class and so on. What I am asking is, how to organise this files into namespaces. Is there any good practice for this or I should just follow the logic of my program. I am currently thinking that I should move the interfaces into one namespace and all the classes into another. So what can you advise me. I am really curious to find out the best way to separate my files. Have a nice day :)
