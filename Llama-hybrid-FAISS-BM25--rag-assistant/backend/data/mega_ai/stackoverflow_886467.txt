You can host Microsoft Office applications inside a control using the DSO Framer . You simply : Add a reference to DSOFramer COM dll. Right-click on your Toolbox in Visual Studio -> Choose Items -> COM Components -> DSO Gramer Control Object Drag a new DSO Framer on to your form or parent control And call framerControl.Open(@"C:\SomeDocument.doc"); - it will work out which Office application to embed. Alternatively you can use the Win32 API to embed other programs into a Panel control inside your own application.
