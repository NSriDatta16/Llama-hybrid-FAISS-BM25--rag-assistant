I found this plot and I'm curious, whether constant means "cycle", also sometimes described as "drift"? type=const would include an intercept in the model equations. I do not see how that could mean "cycle". It could be interpreted as the drift term if the data supplied to the VAR function is a multivariate time series in first differences (rather than levels). I assume most economic time series to be either constant+trend or constant? It is hard to generalize, but I guess you are right (if you mean a VAR with a constant or constant+trend, not just constant or constant+trend). But I am sure it is possible to find some examples where other options make more sense.
