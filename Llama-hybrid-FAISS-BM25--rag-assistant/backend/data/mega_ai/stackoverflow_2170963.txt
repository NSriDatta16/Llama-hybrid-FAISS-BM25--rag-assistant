can't access user control public properties

I am using VS2008 with both VB.NET and C# I have created a simple custom user control and have added some public functions to it my problem is that if I don't drag and drop the user control from the toolbox onto a winform but instead I try to create one dynamically via code - I am not able to access the public functions and properties I can't understand why there would be a difference but htere seems to be. would appreciate any help on the matter thanks
