Why is non-normality of time series not a problem for ARIMA and GARCH?

My time series is very leptokurtic and non-normal, which is of course highly common for time series data. However, I don't exactly understand why that is not a problem for ARIMA modeling and GARCH modeling? I know that stationarity is the most important condition, but why is the non-normality of the series not an issue?
