Looks like everyone already told you this-- But, surprisingly enough, each bet in Roulette has the exact same odds to payout ratio, or expected value (EV). That EV is negative (house edge). So red, black, columns, numbers -- all the same expected return, with the exception of the "sucker's bet" pentagon, which has slightly worse EV than any other bet. Your system is a combination of believing the roulette wheel has a memory (the 'hot' and 'icy' numbers graphics in Roulette wheels in Vegas are meant to entice suckers with 'systems' that don't work). It doesn't. You also throw in the Martingale system -- which goes like this. Make a bet -- if you lose, make a larger bet that covers all your losses. Play until you win one time. The problem with this is that, given you have finite money, and the house has a max bet limit (it does) --- you WILL, at some point, accomplish the unlikely but inevitable feat of losing 8 or 9 times in a row (going from one bet to the max bet) -- and losing a metric S$@! ton of money. Ultimately, the house has about a 5% edge in Roulette. That means long term, you will average a 95% return on every bet placed on the wheel. So a bet of 1000 in the long term average out to 50 lost per bet. The more bets you make, the more statistically certain this is. So any system, like the Martingale, that throws increasingly larger sums on the table, averages out to lose increasingly higher amounts overall.
