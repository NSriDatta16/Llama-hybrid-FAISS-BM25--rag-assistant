Ruby has many flaws related to its speed, but I don't hate those. It also has flaws with the community evangelism going overboard, but that doesn't really bother me. These are what I hate: Closures (blocks) have 4 different creation syntaxes, and none of them are optimal. The elegant syntax is incomplete and ambiguous with hashes, and the full syntax is ugly. The community tends to be against real documentation, favoring ‘read the code’. I find this childish and lazy. Metaprogramming abuse, particularly in libraries, makes bugs a nightmare to track down. On a related note, pervasive metaprogramming makes a comprehensive IDE difficult, if not impossible, to make. The way block passing to functions is done is silly. There is no reason blocks should be passed outside the parameter list, or have odd special syntax to access (yield). I am of the opinion that blocks should have been given a less ambiguous syntax (or hashes could have used different delimiters; perhaps <> rather than {}), and passing as parameters to methods should have been just like all other parameters. object.method(1, {|a| a.bar}, "blah") These oddities, like the block must be the last parameter passed and passing more than one block is different with longer syntax, really annoy me.
