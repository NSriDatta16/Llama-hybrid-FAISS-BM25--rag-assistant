I agree that Tcl and Lua are one of the easiest to embed in a c/c++ application. Mainly because that was a design decision from the very start. Another language that was designed for embedding is Guile. If you are interested in embedding a scripting language in your c++ application take a look at Swig . Swig can automatically create the glue code for a number of scripting languages including python which you already know. The main advantage is that it handles many different scripting languages.
