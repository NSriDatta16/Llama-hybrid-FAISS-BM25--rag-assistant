Flash video player that supports streaming m4v files

I'm looking for a Flash video player that is able to stream m4v files on all browsers. Example file: http://podcasts.cnn.net/cnn/big/podcasts/cnnnewsroom/video/2010/11/23/the.daily.11.23.cnn.m4v Unfortunately, I can't convert the format since it originates from 3rd party servers. I can't rely on HTML5 video since not all browsers support this format and the encoding it contains. I've already tried several players such as JW Player, Kaltura, Video JS, Projekktor, and more. Testing them with Firefox and IE, some of them couldn't play the m4v file at all, while others downloaded the entire file before starting to play it. If an open source solution is available, and one that has a powerful JavaScript API, that would be great. Thanks!
