How do I emulate 'include' behaviour in MATLAB?

In MATLAB I can define multiple functions in one file, with only the first defined function being visible external to that file. Alternatively, I can put each function in its own file and make them all globally visible through the path. I'm writing a menu driven application, where each menu item runs a different function. Currently, these are all in one big file, which is getting increasingly difficult to navigate. What I'd like to do is put groups of related functions into separate files. I think I can do something like this by putting all the child functions into a separate directory and then adding the directory to the path in my parent function, but this feels a bit messy and inelegant. Can anyone make a better suggestion? Note: I'm most familiar with MATLAB 2006, but I'm in the process of upgrading to MATLAB 2009.
