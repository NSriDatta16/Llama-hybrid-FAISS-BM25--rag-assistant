billcoke your best shot is to use some gdb macros which you can type in at the gdb console that can be opened in the Console/Debugger window in eclipse. you can find them here: http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/src/dbinit_stl_views-1.01.txt it wont be automatic on hover, but you have to type which is tiring.... but even in the year 2009 the eclipse CDT has not succeeded in bringing us some nice debugging features, so this is your best shot. TO RPSENG: thanks for the tip rpseng! it works nicely! unfortunately it seems my eclipse (Ganymede) gets so confused that it will not discover any more the type of pointers to instances of my own-made classes and their inheritance, so stepping though member variables of those pointers is not possible anymore. Are you working with CDT 6.0 and is it working better there?
