To me it sounds like a combination of pairwise distance and pairwise correlation calculations. I believe you should treat each store like a 12 element vector. first calculate the distances between each store and every other store using probably either the Manhattan or Euclidean distance (if you want the penalise the too far away stores sales use the latter, otherwise the Manhattan one would do). Afterwards you can calculate the correlations between the two (I would suggest spearman’s correlation as it’s non-parametric). Finally you can combine the two metrics any way you want. For instance you can first find stores that are “close enough” for your standards and then the one that correlates the most. Alternatively, you can standardise so that they are on the same scale and then take the opposite of one of the two (as you want one to be small and the other one large) and take the average of the two new metrics to calculate your final metric. Finally, you can use any custom metrics to combine both based on the project needs.
