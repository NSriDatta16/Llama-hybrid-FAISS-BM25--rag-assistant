Can someone explain to the Gini Index for a tree?

So I know what the formula for the Gini index. However, I have a few questions that I am hoping to clarify. I saw this, which tells you how to calculate the Gini index for each feature: Computing the Gini index In decision trees, I notice that there is a Gini value for each node of the tree. If we have p predictors, do we sum up each of the individual predictor's Gini index to arrive at the Gini index for the node? In the link above, we only calculate the value for each predictor, not for an entire node. Additionally, the above link implies that for quantitative variables, we still calculate a Gini index based on frequencies. Does this imply that for most quantitative predictors, the Gini index will be close to 1âˆ’1/n? Also, when we split a node into two branches, we choose the split that results in the lowest Gini index of the split. The Gini index of the split is the weighted average of the two nodes' Gini index, weighted by number of observations in each node. Is my understanding correct? Finally, can someone explain to me the intuition behind why increasing homogeneity in the nodes allows us to classify something accurately? I'm guessing the intuition is that similar observations (based on their features) should lead to similar response values. And a tree helps us group similar observations? Is that the right reasoning? Thanks!
