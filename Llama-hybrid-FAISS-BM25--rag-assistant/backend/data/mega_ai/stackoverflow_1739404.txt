Reorganizing ASP.NET MVC Folders

I'm looking to migrate web forms app to mvc. One of the organizational issues I would need to tackle is our folder structure. Currenly it's organized by functional area e.g. Application Functional Area (e.g. MyAccount) Task 1 (Manage Notifications) Task 2 (Change Payment Info) etc.. Functional Area Task 1 Task 2 etc.. which works quite nicely for our task-based app. However, from my understanding, the default organization with an MVC app is similiar to Controllers Task1Controller.cs Task2Controller.cs Views Task 1 ViewOne.aspx ViewTwo.aspx Task 2 ViewOne.aspx Models etc..... I would like to retain the layout we currently have. I'm envisioning a structure more like Application Functional Area (My Account) Task 1 Controller View 1 View 2 Task 2 Controller View 1 View 2 etc... Which roads do I need to head down to achieve this? And if I did, what kind of pain would I suffer from deviating quite drastically from the convention?
