Yes. If you are considering only one independent variable $x_{i}$ , and itâ€™s effect on $y_{i}$ , then your interpretation is sufficient. And yes, your interpretation is in the correct units. The unit increase in education should be expressed in years , while its effect on sleep should be expressed in minutes per week . I think a coefficient on education should be interpreted as units corresponding to minutes. There is no requirement in a simple linear regression context that the units of your dependent variable must correspond to the units of your independent variable. You could scale your independent variable $x_{i}$ , but it would sacrifice the interpretability of your slope coefficient. First, it is important to note that scaling the regressor affects your slope but leaves the intercept unchanged. The simple bivariate model is expressed as follows $$ Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X + \epsilon, $$ with each realization $x_{i}$ denoting an individual's years of education. To express years in minutes , you would scale (multiply) each $x_{i}$ by 525,600, which is precisely the number of minutes in a full calendar year. This does the following $$ Y = \beta_{0} + \left(\frac{\beta_{1}}{c}\right) \left(X * c\right) + \epsilon $$ where c is any arbitrary constant. Note, this will not affect your model fit or p-values. Should you scale your education variable accordingly and rerun your model, simply multiply the coefficient by the constant (i.e., 525,600) to arrive back at the slope coefficient associated with education expressed in yearly units. Graphically, the scaling of the x-axis is affected. Now, a unit (minute) increase in education results in a smaller decrease in minutes slept per week. See the following two plots below which I created with simulated data. I jittered the points to avoid overlap. The first shows weekly minutes of sleep expressed as a function of education (years). See below: The second plot scales education, which is now expressed in minutes . See below: The intercept is the same. However, the slope will change. A unit (minute) increase in education is not associated with the same change in minutes slept per week. In essence, we simply 'chopped up' education into smaller equally sized units. Note, this interpretation is a bit awkward. Be mindful we are assuming education has a constant, linear relationship with sleep. Suppose the coefficient is 5. Then, I will interpret the regression as an year increase in education should reduce sleep by 5 minutes per week. Is that the correct way to think about it? You indicated that weekly minutes of rest has a negative association with education. Thus, the coefficient on education should be $-5$ , not $5$ . Another way to think about it is the following: two individuals differing in only one year of education would result in a 5-minute negative difference in weekly rest time . In other words, more education is associated with less sleep, on average. Also, as a simple bivariate regression, such a model ignores other variables that could partly explain this relationship. In sum, you can have different units! The interpretation with education expressed in years is a bit cleaner.
