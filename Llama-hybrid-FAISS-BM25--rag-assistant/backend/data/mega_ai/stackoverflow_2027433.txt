Set Band Override in Infragistics 9.2 Winform Grid bound to IBindingList

I am brand-new to Infragistics grids and need to set an overall Band override on my grid to stop the '+' expansion indicator when there are no child rows( Override.ExpansionIndicator = ShowExpansionIndicator.CheckOnDisplay). My grid is bound to an object that implements IBindingList, so I gather that any performance hit will be minmial. My question is where/when is best to set the Override? I don't see me having much luck with DisplayLayout.Bands[n] until the bands actually exist... EDIT: At the moment I am doing it just after the data is bound - will that do?
