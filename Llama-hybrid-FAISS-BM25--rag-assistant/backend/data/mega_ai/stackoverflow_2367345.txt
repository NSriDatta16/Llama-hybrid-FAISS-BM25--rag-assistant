Yes, it's mandatory to include instance subidentifiers for any variable OIDs in the variable bindings. The paragraph is describing the general (i.e., generic) form for a variable OID, not using "in general" to mean a non-committal "well, it's usually like this, but not always". Later RFCs use more concrete wording: A variable-binding list is a simple list of variable bindings. The name of a variable is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER which is the concatenation of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the corresponding object- type together with an OBJECT IDENTIFIER fragment identifying the instance. The OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the corresponding object-type is called the OBJECT IDENTIFIER prefix of the variable. [RFC 3416, section 2.1]
