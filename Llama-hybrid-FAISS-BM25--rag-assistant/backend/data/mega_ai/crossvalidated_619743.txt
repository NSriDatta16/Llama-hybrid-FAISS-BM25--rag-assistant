Can I use the output of an MCMC algorithm as the input of an independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm?

Can I and if so, how can I, use the output of a MCMC method as the input for an independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm? Maybe this question reduces to: How can I get (independent? or at least "almost uncorrelated") samples from a distribution which I only have access to through sampling from a Markov chain which has this distribution as its unique invariant distribution. I've read about "thinning", but I'm not sure if it's appropriate. Especially since I have almost no knowledge about the target distribution and due to computational costs I don't want to perform pre-computation steps. So, any suggestions? Remark : To be clear: The problem is the following: Say my chain is $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb N_0}$ and suppose it was generated itself with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a Gaussian proposal with a small variance. When I then would successively use $X_n,X_{n+1},\ldots$ for the proposal input of the other MCMC algorithm, those proposals would be highly correlated. In my case, I would actually want that successive proposals are "far apart" from each other.
