Is my logic about comparing the 70th/90th percentile from two respective datasets correct or is there a proof to do this?

Larry and Tony work for different companies. Larry's salary is the $90th$ percentile of the salaries in his company, and Tony`s salary is the $70th$ percentile of the salaries in his company. Which of the following statements individually provide(s) sufficient additional information to conclude that Larry`s salary is higher than Tony's salary? Indicate all such statements. The average (arithmetic mean) salary in Larry's company is higher than the average salary in Tony's company The median salary in Larry's company is equal to the median salary in Tony`s company The $80th$ percentile in Larry's company is higher than the $70th$ percentile salary in Tony's company The hand-wavy logic I had was that the median is too far from the 80th/90th percentile to indicate anything. The average includes too many order statistics for us to tell about the 90th and 70th percentile which are too very possibly different statistics than any order statistic besides those two. What's a more rigorous logic to solve this problem?
