Does it make sense to combine PCA with an artificial neural network?

I have a Dataset of around 200 features. Most of them are categorical and only a few are numerical. It seems that an artificial neural network with an Autoencoder has some problems with that kind and amount of features. Therefore, I thought to use PCA to reduce the dimensions and then apply the Autoencoder afterwards. Does the combination of a PCA before neural nets makes sense as the neural nets also reduces the information in internal layers? Does anybody has experiences with such a combination? Edit: There is also an interesting answer in the stats forum .
