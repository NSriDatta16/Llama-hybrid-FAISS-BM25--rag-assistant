The first answer (paired t-tests should be used) is correct if the question is what test should be used to compare the means, however that isn't quite what the thread question asks if I understand it correctly. Independence is a rather strong assumption, it says "they don't have anything to do with each other". If they come from the same student, they are connected, even though in a certain respect they may be quite different. Technically they may be indeed (approximately) independent, but that's a strong claim to be investigated in its own right, rather than something to be assumed when picking a test for testing something else, namely whether they are on average the same. So you'd play it safer not assuming independence, even though there may not be strong dependence between them. I haven't tried to form an opinion based on the data (edit: an earlier version of the question had showed data but this seems to have been edited out in the meantime) whether there is such dependence indeed; you could compute a correlation and test the hypothesis correlation=0, but apart from the fact that correlation=0 isn't equivalent to independence but only one aspect of it, also your test would have a small power detecting dependence because of the small sample size. A different issue is whether a t-test testing equality of averages, paired or unpaired, is precisely the right thing addressing the question that is asked on the scanned document or whether that is even possible from these data; equality of averages and "students focusing on both abilities to the same degree" (which was the wording on the original scanned document that has now apparently been edited out) isn't really the same thing. (What I write here still applies to the version of the question currently visible to me, if only in sense, not literally... the beauty of responding to questions that are substantially edited while responding...)
