SVM in the classification layer of a Feedforward neural network

I want to use SVM in the classification layer of a 2 layer feedforward neural network. Need guidance from the community on how to approach this problem. This involves capturing the features from the hidden layer of the feedforward neural network and using them as inputs to the SVM. The architecture is summarized as below, $An\,\,Input\,\,Layer \longrightarrow A\,\,Hidden\,\,Layer\,\,(ReLu)\longrightarrow SVM\,\,Classification\,\,Layer$ How can one carry out the training of this setup considering the backpropagation algorithm. Please share a link if the code for this or a similar problem exists. Thank you
