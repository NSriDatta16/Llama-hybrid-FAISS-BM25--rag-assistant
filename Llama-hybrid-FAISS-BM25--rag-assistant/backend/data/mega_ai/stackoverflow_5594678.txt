Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Static arrays: perfect for lookup tables and data that doesn't change its size throughout the program execution. They get allocated on program startup, so you don't have to manage this memory in any way. A disadvantage is that you cannot resize or free a static array - it stays there until the program terminates. Dynamically growing arrays: an easy to manage data structure that can almost be a substitute for vector arrays in C++. A disadvantage is the overhead of allocating memory at runtime, but that can be alleviated if you allocate bigger chunks at once. Linked lists: take care if you are going to have a lot of elements because allocating each one separately without using a memory pool can lead to memory waste and fragmentation.
