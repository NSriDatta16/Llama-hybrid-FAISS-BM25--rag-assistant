Your computation of variance is totally incorrect. In statistical terms, variance is E(x^2) - [E(x)^2] So get rid of that second loop (I'm not even sure what you think it does) and change the first loop to: while(!File.eof()){ counter++; value = File.get(); sum += value; sumsqr += value*value; } average = sum/counter; variance = (sumsqr/counter) - (average*average); EDIT: Jerry Coffin's answer is even better as it demonstrates the issue with eof() .
