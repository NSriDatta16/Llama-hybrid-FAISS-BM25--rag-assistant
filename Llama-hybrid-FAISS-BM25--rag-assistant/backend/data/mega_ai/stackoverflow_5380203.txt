Problem naming the download file

I have some php code which is suppose to download a zip file...this code is called from a file called download_file.php (very original, i know) The relevant function is as follows : function download_clientfile() { if ($this->download_file === FALSE) { $this->log->log(sprintf("The download file was not generated."), PEAR_LOG_CRIT); return; } $fsize = filesize($this->download_file); $path_parts = pathinfo($this->download_file); $ext = strtolower($path_parts["extension"]); header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; file='.$path_parts['basename']); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header('Expires:0'); header("Cache-control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header('Pragma: public'); header('Content-Length: '.filesize($this->download_file)); ob_clean(); flush(); readfile($this->download_file); exit; } Problem : The file downloaded is the zip file that is expected, however its downloaded with the name 'download_file.php' Any suggestions on how I can get it to download by the name of the zip file. Thanks
