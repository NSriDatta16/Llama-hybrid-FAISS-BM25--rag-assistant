How to compare the variance of two time series?

I would like to answer whether two time series have the same variance. Initially, I used an F test to compare the two series variation. However, the two series appear to be skewed which would violate the normality assumption. What method can I use to compare the variance of these two time series? Year,A,B 1921,286,243 1922,282,268 1923,278,266 1924,278,284 1925,274,292 1926,270,296 1927,264,277 1928,261,276 1929,251,258 1930,254,264 1931,271,299 1932,286,303 1933,281,297 1934,284,284 1935,281,271 1936,278,259
