Does the MCMC algorithm use the likelihood function to move to a new proposal value?

I'm trying to understand how MCMC and related algorithms work for Bayesian inference. In this paper the authors use an example of a normal distribution in explaining MCMC. They state, "If the new proposal has a higher posterior value than the most recent sample, then accept the new proposal." I have two questions on this: Is this 'decision' to move based on the likelihood function? I often read about 'ugly' distributions for priors and likelihoods (e.g. here ). If a likelihood function is being use to move around, how can it do so if the distribution is ugly? My understanding is that if we want to apply a likelihood function we need the pdf as an argument. Hope you can clarify, thanks.
