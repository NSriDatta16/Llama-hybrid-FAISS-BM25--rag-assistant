I would certainly as someone coming from the Basic camp ZX81, Spectrum 48K, QB, PDS 7.1 recommend that you look at Python. It is very approachable i.e. has a syntax that one quickly can get a hang of, I had Java during my Computer Sciences education and disliked Java because I found it too quirky. Don't get me wrong I love the idea of OOP however programming needs to be fun, and speaking of easy to learn and fun there is a smashing tutorial series on Python by a guy called Bucky Roberts, referring to himself as thenewboston on youtube - The first lesson can be found on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mf0h3HphEA well actually he's made more than just one tutorial, he has 3 tutorial series regarding the subject of Python, one is basic Python just called Python Programming Tutorial, one named wxPython Programming Tutorial and the last one named Game Development Tutorial. Oh and Python can be used as OOP as well :)
