I do development and use ZFS in two environments: 1) On my Mac Pro with RAIDZ2 over four discs 2) On a backup server which is DesktopBSD (based on FreeBSD) with two disks in RAIDZ1 My overall experience is that for the first time I don't have to go around making daily backups of data as I have seen that ZFS seems to be the most reliable storage system I have ever used.
