First difference or seasonal difference in VAR/VECM

I have monthly data on house price, rental price, wage index and interest rates. I want to use VAR to produce impulse response function. Is there any reason why I should use first difference, x(t)/x(t-1) - 1 instead of e.g. x(t)/x(t-12) - 1 for montly time series?
