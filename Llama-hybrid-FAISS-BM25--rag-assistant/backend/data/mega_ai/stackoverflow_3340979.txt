Context Menu not getting minimised

I have a page that is being hosted in a window. The page has an ultragrid in which there is a context menu. When the context menu is opened, and the window is minimised using windows+m, the window gets minimized but the context menu is not getting minimized. The window gets minimised to the taskbar but the context menu is still visible. Can someone please help me out?
