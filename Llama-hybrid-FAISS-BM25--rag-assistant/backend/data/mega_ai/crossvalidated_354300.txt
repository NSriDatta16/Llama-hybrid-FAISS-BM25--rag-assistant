Definitely not. For instance, your actual sales might be Poisson distributed with an average of $\lambda=1.5^2=2.25$. In this case, your minimum RMSE point forecast is $1.5^2$ for every future time point: You can prove mathematically, that the long-run RMSE will be exactly $1.5$. However, every single point error is of course a value such as $-2.25, -1.25, -0.25, 0.75, 1.75, \dots$: All you can say is that the root mean squared error is $1.5$. Which is, admittedly, not overly useful. R code: set.seed(1) xx
