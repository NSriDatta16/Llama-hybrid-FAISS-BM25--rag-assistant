You could have the unit test call the function multiple times and make sure that the number of collisions is reasonably low. E.g. if your random result is in the range 1-1000000, call the function 100 times and record the results; then check if there are duplicates. If there are any (or more than 1 collision, depending of how afraid you are of false test failure) the test fails. Obviously not perfect, but will catch it if you random number is from Dilbert: http://www.random.org/analysis/
