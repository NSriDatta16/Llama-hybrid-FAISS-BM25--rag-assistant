Does standardization on data from different categories make them comparable?

I've time series for different costs (listed quarterly). These costs are of different types (E.g. employee salaries, outsourcing, travel claims, etc.), and each of them have their own range of values. For example, cost A has range of 300k-400k, while cost B has 1-10k. I wonder, if I want to compare costs across different categories, does standardizing each cost separately make them comparable? If yes/no, what (additional) procedures I need to make them comparable? On top of that, if I want to build a generic model to either predict future costs/detect anomaly in time series, what additional things I need to pay attention to aside from what I mentioned to make the model feasible? TIA.
