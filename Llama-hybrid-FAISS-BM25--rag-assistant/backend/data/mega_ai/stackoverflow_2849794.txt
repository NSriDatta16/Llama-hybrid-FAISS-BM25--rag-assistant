Yes, an annotation is a pin/note/icon placed on the map (MKMapView) at a specific location. MKAnnotation is the protocol your annotation object needs to implement defining its location and title. MKAnnotationView represents the appearance of the annotation. The view is requested by the MKMapView when your annotation object comes into the visible area. See MapKit Framework Reference and the sample apps MapCallouts and WeatherMap .
