Technique to remove factor structure from panel data

Let's say I have panel data (i.e. time-series data and cross-sectional). Factors drive the bulk of the data as well as some noise. Naturally I can express this factor structure using a covariance matrix - or a set of eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues. I would like to create a new panel dataset that has some particular (or all) factors removed (i.e. de-factored). What's a good way to do this in R? My preference is to use factor analysis rather than PCA.
