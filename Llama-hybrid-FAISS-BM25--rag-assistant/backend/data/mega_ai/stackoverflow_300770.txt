The best organizational advice I've ever received came from a presentation at An Event Apart. Assuming you're keeping everything in a single stylesheet, there's basically five parts to it: Reset rules (may be as simple as the * {margin: 0; padding: 0} rule, Eric Meyer's reset, or the YUI reset) Basic element styling; this is the stuff like basic typography for paragraphs, spacing for lists, etc. Universal classes; this section for me generally contains things like .error , .left (I'm only 80% semantic), etc. Universal layout/IDs; #content , #header , or whatever you've cut your page up into. Page-specific rules; if you need to modify an existing style just for one or a few pages, stick a unique ID high up (body tag is usually good) and toss your overrides at the end of the document I don't recommend using a CSS framework unless you need to mock something up in HTML fast . They're far too bloated, and I've never met one whose semantics made sense to me; it's much better practice to create your own "framework" as you figure out what code is shared by your projects over time. Reading other people's code is a whole other issue, and with that I wish you the best of luck. There's some truly horrific CSS out there.
