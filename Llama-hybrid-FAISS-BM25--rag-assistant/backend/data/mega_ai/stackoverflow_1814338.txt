If you're using the default InProc session state, it's only stored in RAM, so it can go away not only when the session times out, but also if the AppPool recycles, which can happen for a number of reasons (idle timeouts, once daily, excessive memory use, etc). In addition, session state is locked by each page, so if your app tries to do multiple accesses at once, you can run into issues. How large is your User object? If it's not too huge, you might consider storing the data in a cookie, rather than in session state. Silverlight isolated storage is another option. Otherwise, you can keep it the DB and do your own cache management. That can be much more efficient than using the Session dictionary.... I should add that if you can use the built-in Membership provider, it does simplify some of this stuff, but I'm assuming you have your reasons for not going that route--it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all type solution.
