Spring: Best way to handle long-running web-service calls with transactional DB methods?

We have a service method which does approximately the following: @Transactional public void serviceMethod(...){ for(Item i : bunchOfItems){ webServices.webServiceCall(...); dao.daoUpdateMethod(...); } } The problem is that as soon as an update occurs the DB is holding a lock on the table for the duration of the Transaction (webservice calls average 5 sec each). Any exception in a webservice call or DAO call should, of course, cause a full rollback. What's the best approach to this situation?
