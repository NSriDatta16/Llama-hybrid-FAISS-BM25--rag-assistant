Modeling repeated cross sectional clustered data

I have repeated cross sectional data from convenience samples of students nested in schools nested in districts. I have data on student-level behavioral outcomes (binary) and school-level program implementation (continuous). I have student outcome data at time points 1 and 3, and I have school implementation data at time points 1, 2, and 3. I am interested in evaluating the effect of implementation level on student outcomes, essentially for a dose-response. With this being repeated cross sections and not longitudinal data following the same students, I’m wondering what would be the best statistical approach for the research question? To my understanding, I’m between a mixed effects model and GEE, and I’m leaning towards GEE as I’m most interested in school-level average changes in outcome in response to level of implementation, but I welcome any recommendations/suggestions others with more expertise may have.
