No as you can incorporate lags of the output series and contemporary and lag structure for causal series while detecting the presence of latent deterministic structure. See http://www.autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf for a discussion of regression and time series analysis leading to a SARMAX model https://autobox.com/pdfs/SARMAX.pdf . Fitting high order polynomials is never a good idea ( for a ton of reasons !) unless you have some theory to support it as has been numerously documented on this site. The social sciences especially sociology often leads the way in erroneous methodology when time effects are involved as assumptions are either unknown/unstated or go begging for attention.
