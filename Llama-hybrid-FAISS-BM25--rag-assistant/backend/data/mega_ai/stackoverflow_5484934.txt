IMHO Its best to make fields private and final where ever possible. For unit tests however, it may be a pragmatic choice to make them package-private or access them via reflection. (Which amounts to the same thing) You can also take the approach of black-box testing which means unless you can determine what has happened via a public method, it shouldn't be tested. (Or your tests need to be more contrived)
