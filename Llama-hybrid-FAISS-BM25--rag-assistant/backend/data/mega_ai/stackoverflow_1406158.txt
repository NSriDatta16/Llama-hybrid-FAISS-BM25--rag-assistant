A genetic algorithm (despite its sexy name) is, for most purposes, an optimization technique . It primarily boils down to you having a number of variables and wanting to find the best combination of values for these variables. It just borrows techniques from natural evolution to get there. Neural networks are useful for recognizing patterns . They follow a simplistic model of the brain, and by changing a number of weights between them, attempt to predict outputs based on inputs. They are two fundamentally different entities, but sometimes the problems they are capable of solving overlap.
