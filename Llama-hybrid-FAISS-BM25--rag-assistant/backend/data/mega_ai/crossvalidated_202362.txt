textbooks/literature/resources for online learning/ time series/ sequential analysis?

I have read (the contents page of) machine learning introductory textbooks such as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective, and The Elements of Statistical Learning. But it seems there's not much about online learning and sequential data (except for HMMs and filtering algorithms). Which textbooks/literature/resource should be a good starting point to learn about online learning/ time series/ sequential analysis (assumed I have a basic understanding of machine learning)? Update I've found an open source project (together with a paper) by Facebook, prophet , which looks really nice.
