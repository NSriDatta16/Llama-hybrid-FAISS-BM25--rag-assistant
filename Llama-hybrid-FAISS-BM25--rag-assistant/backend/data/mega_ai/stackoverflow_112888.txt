CrashFinder can help you locate the place of the exception given the DLL and the address of the exception reported. You can take this code and integrate it into your application to have a stack trage automatically generated when there is an uncaught exception. This is generally performed using __try{} __except{} or with a call to SetUnhandledExceptionFilter which allows you to specify a callback to all unhandled exceptions.
