"but I am meeting with resistance because the current code works." +1 for those giving the resistance. If it really is the case that the required functionality is properly supported, and moreover there aren't any performance problems or so, then nothing is broken, and if nothing is broken, nothing needs to be fixed. I've seen too many coding yuppies screw up working systems because they thought they knew a "better" way to organize the code. If you are convinced that your way of organizing the code (your alleged "best practices") has any benefits compared to the one applied in the existing systems, demonstrate that to the business by applying it in a new project. If indeed there are noticeable benefits, then trust me, the users WILL notice. If there isn't, then you have been taught a very important lesson about the non-importance of "which way to code is the best".
