The RowStatus textual convention actually gives a fair amount of leeway to the agent in how it implements it. Thus, a manager must support both of these ways and the agent must support only one (but could support two): Consecutive PDUs: Set the row status variable to "createAndWait" Set all the columns you want set up (in one PDU or many) Set the row status variable to "active" Set the row status variable to "createAndGo" and include **all** the variables you need to set into a single PDU Unfortunately, a manager needs to be intelligent and know how to talk to agents that support one or the other. The general belief is that managers are bigger and have more room to code around issues than puny agents. Many small devices only support #2 above though.
