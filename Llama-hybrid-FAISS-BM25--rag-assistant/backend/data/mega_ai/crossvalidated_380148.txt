Logistic regression works well on binary outcomes with continuous factors. Your factors are either binary or categorical, so a decision tree may suit better. One thing that you didn't mention in your question is whether you have characteristics of the surveyed subjects. This would probably the most important variable. If the perpetrator of shooting is from the same group as the people you ask the question, you may get different results from when they're in different groups.
