SSRS Local Mode Report zero displaying as blank

I have a SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) RDLC local mode report that is populated by an object data source. However the data from the database is returned as 0 but the report is displaying blank. My datasource is a List<> of a type "ReportData" that is populated from a SQL Server query. public class ReportData { public object column1 { get; set; } public object column2 { get; set; } public object column3 { get; set; } public ReportData(object column1, object column2, object column3) { this.column1 = column1; this.column2 = column2; this.column3 = column3; } } Like this: List results = new List {}; while (dr.Read()) { results.Add(new ReportData(dr[0], dr[1], dr[2], dr[3])); } Through debugging I confirm that the List is populated with values of "0" and that they are being turned into Decimals objects (The original SQL Server field is money type). I then bind it to the ReportViewer control via: ReportViewerControl.LocalReport.DataSources["ObjectDataSource"].Value = results; And just use it normally inside the report (I added the datasource and use the "Website Data Source" panel to drag the values onto a table), as stated its not displaying "0" but just blank. I am using Visual Studio 2008 with I presume the ReportViewer 2005 control (Microsoft not giving Local Mode tablix :() and querying a SQL Server 2008 x64 Standard instance. Anyone got any clue why its not showing zeros? Phil
