This really depends on what you are doing and how you obtained these outputs. But in the end, you cannot have probabilities for the second model which do not sum to 1. A simple fix is to normalize the second model probabilities to sum to 1, and then take the average of the two models, which will ensure that the sum is still 1. a=c(0.7,0.3) b=c(0.66,0.55) b=b/sum(b) (a+b)/2 [1] 0.6227273 0.3772727 sum((a+b)/2) [1] 1
