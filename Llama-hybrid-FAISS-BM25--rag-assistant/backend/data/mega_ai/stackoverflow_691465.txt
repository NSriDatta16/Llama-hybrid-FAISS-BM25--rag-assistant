For me, simple user configuration items and user data is better to be stored in either a simple XML configuration file, a SQLLite db, or a MS SQL Server Compact db. The exact storage medium depends on the specifics of the implementation. I only use the registry for things that I need to set infrequently and that users don't need to be able to change/see. For example, I have stored encrypted license information in the registry before to avoid accidental user removal of the data.
