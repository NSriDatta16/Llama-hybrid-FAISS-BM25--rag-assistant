Isolated storage is linked to the logged in user and stored under their profile only. So with out-of-the-box NTFS ACL's in place, no other user can access these files. From MSDN : Data is stored in compartments that are isolated by the current user and by the assembly in which the code exists. Additionally, data can be isolated by domain. Roaming profiles can be used in conjunction with isolated storage so isolated stores will travel with the user's profile. So, not just any person can copy them, only the person under which' context they were created can. Is that not secure enough?
