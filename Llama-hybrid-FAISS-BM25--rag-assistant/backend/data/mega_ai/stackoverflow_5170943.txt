OOP:upcast vs direct instantiation

I'm preparing to SCJP and looks like I don't understand class cast principles. class Dog extends Animal First way of creating Dog() instance- make instance of Animal and cast it to Dog(upcast): Animal a = new Dog(); Dog d1 = (Dog)a; VS Second way of creating Dog() instance - make it directly: Dog d2 = new Dog(); what is the difference between d1 and d2 objects this case?
