Paragraph character in URL?

I just ran across this an Google App Engine article that uses that funny backwards 'P' character in some URL's (look near the top of the first code box). You know that character that your high school English teacher used to mark new paragraphs (which I've learned, thanks to Wikipedia, is called a "pilcrow"). I've never seen this in a URL. So which is it? This has a standard specific meaning which is ... This is a typo, it should be ... This is something that somebody at Google just made up. What they might mean is ... What character? I'm seeing things.
