How to write technical documentation of a web site/software for new developers?

I want to make a technical documentation of an existing web site for developers so that new developers can continue to work with it. In existing codes, little (or not at all) in-code comments or doc-strings are available (bad practice, I know). Yeah, I have seen some posts related to these. But those were not that detailed. Here are all my questions: What to include? How to organize? I mean, can you suggest some hierarchy so that new developers can easily get onto the track? What are the best practices? Can you show some samples? How can it be made easy? Some ppl suggests wiki tool but I know nothing about it, will it be useful? Can you suggest any tool with some quick starting tutorial? I have never made one. So I appreciate any kind of answer. Thanks in advance. (Links will be helpful but please give a quick and lucid summary of it)
