Here's my view rendering function. It can be used with a template like It can then be called like $data = array('title' => 'This is a title', 'paragraph' => 'This is a paragraph') $html = renderView('viewname', $data) It works by creating a local variable for each of the elements of the data array, turning on output buffering, requiring the template file, which outputs all of the html into the buffer and then clearing the buffer and returning the output. So all of the rendered html is now in a string that can be echoed. The html is just for example, it wouldn't validate. Also note that this is the only legitimate use of extract that I have ever seen.
