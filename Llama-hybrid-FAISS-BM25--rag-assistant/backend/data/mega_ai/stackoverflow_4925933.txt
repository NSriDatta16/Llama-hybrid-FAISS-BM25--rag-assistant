Welcome to SO, user525552, Relax. You can get rid of the formula entirely. Drag & drop your date field onto your report design, then right-click->format field->date and time and pick your preferred display format. Edit Based on your comment, try this formula. (I'm not convinced you actually need this formula, but this does answer your immediate question) Monthname( month( DateAdd ("m", -4, {?Pm-Command.SCHED_END_DT}) ) ,true) & "-" & right( cstr( year( DateAdd ("m", -4, {?Pm-Command.SCHED_END_DT}) ) ,0,"") ,2)
