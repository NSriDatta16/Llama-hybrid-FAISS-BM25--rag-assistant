It shouldn't. The spec says: User agents do not generally render elements that appear in the HEAD as content. See the spec But browsers can do anything they want to. Added: It's a loose area in the spec. Eg a browser could: Render the element Ignore the element Load the image from its server but not render it Or something else ... and the browser would be compliant. So see what your favorite browsers do and then use the info as you wish...
