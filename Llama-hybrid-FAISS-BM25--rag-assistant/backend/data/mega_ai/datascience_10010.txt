Speaking as a Graph/Complex Networks guy I'd recommend Networkx package in Python. This is the main library I used for my master thesis and my research during last 2 years. As long as your graph is not gigantic (millions of nodes) you can handle it using Networkx. But what you need is not only the library but a philosophy to convert your data into a graph. What is your data exactly? If you have some addresses, what would be the node and what would define an edge? This is important actually. Graph is not constructed from your addresses unless you have a definition for vertices and edges. When you convert your data into a graph Networkx provides you all fancy algorithms for everything (shortest path, community detection, statistical analysis, etc). If you provide info in the comment here I'll answer your question in details.
