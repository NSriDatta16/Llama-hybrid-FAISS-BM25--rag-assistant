One approach which takes the full pulse into consideration is principal component analysis (PCA). In your case, you could form a single signal for each particle (by stacking the 6 pulses). Now you do PCA on your whole dataset of signals to find the principal directions, after that you can project each of your signals onto those directions. As part of the PCA process, you may discard directions in which there is very low variance, leading to dimensionality reduction, although this is not your main interest here. The components of the projected signals are the new features you are looking for. Note that when you do PCA, the new features have no longer a simple meaning such as "maximum height" of "total area under the curve" because they have been obtained as projections onto uncorrelated directions which maximize the variance of your data. One final thing: the directions found in PCA are not necessarily the best directions regarding class separation, you may want to look for linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for that.
