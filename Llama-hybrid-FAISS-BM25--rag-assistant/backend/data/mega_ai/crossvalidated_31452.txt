I want to acknowledge from the beginning that I know relatively little about clustering. However, I don't see the point of the procedure you describe. If you think, for example, that first term vs. returning students might be different, why not include a covariate that indexes that? Likewise if you think another feature of the students is relevant, you can include that as well. If you are worried that the relationship between your primary predictor of interest and the success rate might differ, you could also include the interaction between that predictor and first term vs. returning, etc. Logistic regression is well equipped to address these questions via including such terms in the model. On the other hand, so long as you only cluster on these features, and do so first (without looking at the response), I don't see any problems arising. I suspect this approach would be inefficient, with each model having lower power because it is fit on only a subset of the data, but I don't think it would bias the parameters or invalidate the tests. So I suppose you could try this if you really want to. Update: My guess is that it would be best (i.e., most efficient) to fit one model with all the data. You could include some additional covariates (such as returning vs. not) beyond your primary interest, and a grouping indicator that you discovered via having run a cluster analysis beforehand. However, if the covariates that went into the cluster analysis are also made available to the logistic regression model, I'm not sure if I can see what would be gained over just including all of the covariates in the LR model without the cluster indicator. There may well be an advantage to this that I'm not familiar with, since I'm not expert in cluster analysis, but I don't know what it would be. It seems to me that the CA would not generate additional information that wasn't already there in the covariates, and thus wouldn't add anything to the LR model. You could try it; maybe I'm wrong. But my guess is that you would just burn a few extra degrees of freedom. A different approach would be to enter the cluster indicator into the LR model instead of the covariates on which it's based. I doubt this would be beneficial. The CA won't be perfect, any more than any other analysis ever is, and so moving from the original covariates to the derived cluster indicator is likely to entail some amount of information loss . (Again, I don't know that, but I strongly suspect it's true.) Again, you could try it both ways and compare as an academic exercise, although just trying a lot of stuff and settling on the outcome that looks best is frowned upon if you want to take your results seriously. I don't want to just carp on cluster analyses. There may be many benefits of them in general, and there may be a good use for them here. However, as I understand your situation, I think just building a LR model with the covariates you think might be relevant is the way to go.
