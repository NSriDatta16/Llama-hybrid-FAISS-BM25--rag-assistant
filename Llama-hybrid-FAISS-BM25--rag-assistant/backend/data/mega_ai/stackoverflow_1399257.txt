To answer the actual question in the final paragraph... :) If you call Release on a form this posts a message to the form which will result in it Free 'ing itself when it receives that message. Since the message is post ed to the message queue, it will arrive only after any/all other current messages for that form have been processed, neatly achieving exactly what you ask for I think.
