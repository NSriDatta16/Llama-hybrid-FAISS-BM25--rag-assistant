As others have mentioned, there's no guaranteed way to tell whether a given IP address is statically or dynamically allocated. You might be able to get 90% of the way there by leveraging the efforts of some of the anti-spam organizations out there -- for example, Spamhaus PBL , the "Policy Block List", is a database of IP address ranges that have been identified by the responsible ISPs as addresses that should not be direct sources of legitimate email. I suspect that the bulk of this list is going to be residential end users on dialup or consumer broadband services. This is only a heuristic -- I'm sure there are static IP blocks in the PBL, and probably plenty of dynamic IP addresses that aren't on it, but it's about as close as you're going to get without knowing each IP range owner's allocation policy.
