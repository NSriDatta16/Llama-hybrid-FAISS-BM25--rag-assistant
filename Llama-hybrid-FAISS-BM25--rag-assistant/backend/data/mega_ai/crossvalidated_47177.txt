Are probability graphic models useful for predictive modelling?

Are Probability Graphic Models (say specifically Bayesian Networks) useful for predictive modelling in terms of large data (100,000 - 1,000,000 rows) and many variables (hundreds)? Meaning, is this technique / methodology something that can be a competitor for, say random forests or some machine learning method for classification/regression?
