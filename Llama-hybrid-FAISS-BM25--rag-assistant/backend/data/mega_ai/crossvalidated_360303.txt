Computational statistics review

I'm looking for a mathematically rigorous review of key topics in computational statistics, such as numerical integration, EM algorithms, MCMC, and sampling algorithms. Are there any good lecture notes or short reviews that I could use? I'm currently going through Givens & Hoeting, but it's a massive wall of text and I'm looking for something more concise.
