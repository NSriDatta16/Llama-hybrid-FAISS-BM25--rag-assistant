How to organize an overlapping ordinal variables?

I am analyzing some data with attributes about how long it takes to commute, and it is an overlapping ordinal variable like the following: Time Number of People 1-5 minutes 10 6-10 minutes 24 less than 10 minutes 15 11-20 minutes 32 Between 10-15 minutes 3 More than 15 minutes 30 21-30 minutes 4 As you can see, the variables overlap. How can I transform it into either an ordinal or even numeric variables for further analysis?
