No, NFS doesn't do this, unfortunately. There is no provision in the protocol for the source of the copy to know anything about the destination or vice versa. Without ssh or similar access, you can't do anything other than drag every byte across the network to the client, and send it back across the network to the server, a block at a time. You might get some speed-up if you can use tar or dd or some other command where you can modify the block size. But I wouldn't bet on it.
