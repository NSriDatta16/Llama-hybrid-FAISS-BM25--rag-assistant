100 data points is a very very low number of points. I am quite surprised that the algo managed to learn something meaningful (well unless you have very obvious relationships between the features and the target). I'll suggest you look at what the logistic regression learned exactly (what coefficients are deemed significant). There is an important risk that you are overfitting on your very very small dataset. And you can't really catch that so your are just left with checking if the rationale of your model make sense. Yes, you should probably tell your boss that this is not enough data points.
