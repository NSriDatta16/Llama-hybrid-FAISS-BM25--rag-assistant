I think, you are trying to link a particular analysis logic to model architecture, however this is not how this not how cnn and most DL models work. The logic behind decreasing the filter size or the network dimensionality as a general rule, is the "distillation" of characteristics that differentiate classes. In other words a representation of those characteristics is required to be packaged into a fixed length vector.
