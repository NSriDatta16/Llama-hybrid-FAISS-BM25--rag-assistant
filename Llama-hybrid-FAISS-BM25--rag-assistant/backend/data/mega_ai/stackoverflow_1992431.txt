FYI - a feature request for this exists in the django source repository at http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/7539 . It looks like this topic is getting some attention. Hopefully it will be included in future Django releases. The ticket includes patches to Django's core to implement an "on_delete" optional parameter to models.ForeignKey(...) that lets you specify what happens when the pointed to Model is deleted, including turning off the default ON DELETE CASCADE behavior.
