How to select cut-point for making classifications table for logistic regression?

How can I select cut-points to convert predicted probabilities to predicted responses in order to make a classification table for logistic regression? Should I take different cut-points like .5, .6, .7, etc.? (If I take different values the prediction error rate varies for them.) How can I make a generalization when I am taking different cut-points and having different prediction error rates?
