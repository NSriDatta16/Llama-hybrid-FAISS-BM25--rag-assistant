Should I normalize my continuous predictors prior to the logistic regression

I am working on the logistic regression and I am unsure if I should log-transform my predictor before conducting the analysis. My predictor (continuous variable; pre-test score) is not normally distributed. However, its relationship with the logit of my outcome variable appears to be linear based on the following code (visualized by the plot). My question is 1) is this correct code to assess the relationship between the logit outcome vs predictor? and 2) If so, does the linear relationship mean that I do not need to log transform my predictor even the predictor itself is not normally distributed? lr.fit4
