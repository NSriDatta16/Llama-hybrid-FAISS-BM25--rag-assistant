Feature engineering for verb\non-verb classification

Suppose we have data of X = words, and for each word we have a label indicating whether the word is a verb or a non-verb. So, y = labels. Assuming we can build all the unigrams and bigrams of each of the words and put them in datasets 1-grams and 2-grams respectively. Any ideas for features that would you choose in order to classify each word to verb or non-verb with NB, logistic regression? Currently the features I've selected are: 1. Is the word starts\end with the 1-gram\2-gram? 2. How many times the 1-gram\2-gram appears in the word. And it seems that those features are not producing good results on test-set.
