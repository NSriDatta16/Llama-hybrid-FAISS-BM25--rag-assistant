This is a very complex topic with no clear solution. At the moment, standards testing is done with PSNR and subjective tests (like MOS ). PSNR is by no means representative of subjective quality, but it's used everywhere. SSIM is supposed to be closer to subjective tests than PSNR, but it's still not as popular as PSNR. If you're really interested in image metrics (still there's no clear choice for video metrics --- most of the time people average PSNR over frames) you can check out JND , in addition to SSIM and PSNR and this document has a few more including the ones I've mentioned.
