From Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton, Barto) : Reinforcement learning is learning what to do — how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. So roughly speaking RL is a field of machine learning that describes methods aimed to learn an optimal policy (i.e. mapping from states to actions) given an agent moving in an environment. Markov Decision Process is a formalism (a process) that allows you to define such an environment. Specifically, MDP describes a fully observable environment in RL, but in general the environment might me partially observable ( see Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP ). So RL is a set of methods that learn "how to (optimally) behave" in an environment, whereas MDP is a formal representation of such environment.
