There will likely be no difference. std::reverse_iterator is just a template shim that translates ++'s to --'s at compile time. For a vector or other contiguous storage container, a forward iterator might interact very slightly better with the cache than a reverse iterator would (unlikely you'd be able to detect it), but for a tree-based container it won't make any difference at all--there won't be any locality of reference to exploit.
