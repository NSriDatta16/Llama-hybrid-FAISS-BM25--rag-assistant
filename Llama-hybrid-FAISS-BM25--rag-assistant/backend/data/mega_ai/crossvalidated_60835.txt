In addition to @Nick's excellent answer, let me just add some practical things about the modelling of nonlinear relationships that I've come across in my work. In epidemiology, for example, we are often faced with nonlinear dose-response relationships. An example would be the relationship between number of cigarettes smoked per day and the risk of death. One common approach is to categorize the exposure, but this is suboptimal . Two relatively quite common methods to fit nonlinear relationships are fractional polynomials and splines . These three papers offer a very good introduction to both methods: First , second and third . There is also a book . These methods are very flexible to model nonlinear relationships and they are not limited to applications in epidemiology and can be applied in other frameworks. As @Nick said: nonlinear relationships are not limited to linear regression and can be used in logistic regression too (and others, of course). Just pay attention that the scale is different (logit). Regarding SPSS: SPSS doesn't seem to support fractional polynomials at the moment but Stata, R and SAS do. Splines on the other hand seem to be supported .
