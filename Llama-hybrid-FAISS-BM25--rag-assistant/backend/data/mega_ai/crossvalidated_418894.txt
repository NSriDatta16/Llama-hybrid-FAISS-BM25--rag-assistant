Interpretation of CCF plot from R

I am analyzing two time series, and when I used the ccf function, I received this output: I am pretty confused. I do not have too much experience with time series, but this looks weird to me. What exactly am I looking for in this plot? What does this tell me, and is this normal? Thanks in advance!
