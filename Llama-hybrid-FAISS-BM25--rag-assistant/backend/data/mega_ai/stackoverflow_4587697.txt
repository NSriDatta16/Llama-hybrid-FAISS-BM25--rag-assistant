Most Admin controllers can be found in the Adminhtml module at app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers If you're curious, the following article (self-link) covers how Admin controllers are configured in Magento, which should let you find anything you're looking for. The app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Controller folder contains the base Admin action controller, as well as a few other base controller classes. These classes are not controllers that URLs are routed to, but are the controllers that actual admin controllers inherit from. Magento doesn't have an autoload for classes in the controllers folder, so these base controllers are placed in a folder named Controller so that Magento's default autoloader will load them. The class name Mage_Adminhtml_Controller_Action gets translated to the path Mage/Adminhtml/Controller/Action.php
