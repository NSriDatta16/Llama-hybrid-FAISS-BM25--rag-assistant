How to trim a std::string?

I'm currently using the following code to right-trim all the std::string s in my programs: std::string s; s.erase(s.find_last_not_of(" \n\r\t")+1); It works fine, but I wonder if there are some edge-cases where it might fail? Of course, answers with elegant alternatives and also left-trim solution are welcome.
