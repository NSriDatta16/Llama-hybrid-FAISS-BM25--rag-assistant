Compare between two ways of defining CNN layers

We know that the parameter tuning of the neural network is somehow like dealing with a blackbox; there is never a unified model for every problem. To this end, I've always wondered if the following keras layers: layer = Conv2D(128, (2, 2))(layer) layer = Conv2D(128, (2, 2))(layer) are equivalent to: layer = Conv2D(256, (2, 2))(layer) in terms of prediction accuracy and which one is more likely to capture more features from input images based on your experience. Thank you.
