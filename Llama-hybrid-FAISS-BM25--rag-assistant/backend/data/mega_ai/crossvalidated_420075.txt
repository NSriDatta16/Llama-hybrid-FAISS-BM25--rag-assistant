In general, if you have a set of $m$ groups with respective sizes $n_1,...,n_m$ and means $\bar{x}_1,...,\bar{x}_m$ then the overall sample mean of all the data is: $$\bar{x} = \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{n_k}{n} \cdot \bar{x}_k \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad n = \sum_{i=1}^m n_k.$$ Thus, the overall mean is always a weighted average of the samples means of the groups. In the special case where all the groups are the same size ( $n_1 = \cdots = n_m$ ), all the weights will be the same and so the overall sample mean will be the mean of the group sample means.
