How do I pipe the Java console output to a file?

I found a bug in an application that completely freezes the JVM. The produced stacktrace would provide valuable information for the developers and I would like to retrieve it from the Java console. When the JVM crashes, the console is frozen and I cannot copy the contained text anymore. Is there way to pipe the Java console directly to a file or some other means of accessing the console output of a Java application? Update: I forgot to mention, without changing the code. I am a manual tester. Update 2: This is under Windows XP and it's actually a web start application. Piping the output of javaws jnlp-url does not work (empty file).
