SQL - Most efficient way to perform this query?

I basically have three tables, posts, images and postimages (this simply contains the ids of both the other tables and allows more than one image in each post and each image to be reused in multiple posts if necessary). I'm trying to list the titles of all the posts, along with a single, small image from each (if one exists) I can do it with the following: $sql ="SELECT * FROM posts p, images im, postimages pi WHERE AND pi.post_id = p.id AND pi.image_id = im.image_id ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 10"; But obviously, if there is more than one image, the record is displayed twice. I know I could probably do it with a subquery, but that seems horribly inefficient. Is there a more elegant way around this? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.
