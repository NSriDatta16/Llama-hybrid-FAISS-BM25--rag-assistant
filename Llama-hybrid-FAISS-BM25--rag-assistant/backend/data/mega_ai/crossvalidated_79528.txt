You don't need to bin the data to use as an explanatory variable in a logistic regression. If you need to bin it for some other reason than for the logit model (e.g. for use in a contingency table), then you can transform it first and then bin it. You could fit a separate slopes model with dummy interaction effects (that designate each income category). This allows you to treat income as continuous as well as allowing income categories to enter the model. You can test for the significance of these categories and/or the continuous income variable and see what sort of model fits best.
