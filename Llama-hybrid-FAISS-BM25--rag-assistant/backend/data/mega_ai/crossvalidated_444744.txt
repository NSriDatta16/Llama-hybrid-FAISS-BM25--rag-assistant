Computing Markov Chain Transition Rates Based On Observed Time

Problem: I'm working with some data that can be represented with states and transitions, so I would like to model it using Markov chains. Based on the data, I know how much time was spent in each state before transitioning to the next, so I would like to incorporate that time into the transition rates of my Markov chains, but I'm not entirely sure what the best way to do so is. Questions: How do we incorporate the observed transition times into our computation of the transition rates? How do we predict future events based on our transition rates? Example: Let's consider an example with three states ( S1 , S2 , S3 ) and transition probabilities ( P_1 , P_2 , P_3 , P_4 , P_5 ). Assume that we always start in S1 and end in S3 . Let's define a time step T to be 1 second. Now let's say that we observe a transition from S1 to S2 at T=3 . How do we compute the transition rate P_2 based on this observation? Proposed Approach: Here's one way I think we could compute the transition probabilities. If we start iteratively from T=0 : At T=0 , we initialize P_1 = 1/2 and P_2 = 1/2 At T=1 , we know that at T=0 , we stayed in S1 , so our probabilities are updated to P_1 = 2/3 and P_2 = 1/3 At T=2 , we know that at T=1 , we stayed in S1 , so our probabilities are updated to P_1 = 3/4 and P_2 = 1/4 At T=3 , we observe a transition to S2 , so our probabilities are updated to P_1 = 3/5 and P_2 = 2/5 So, based on our observations, we know that P_1 = 3/5 and P_2 = 2/5 . Assuming this is correct, we should be able to predict future events: Probability of transitioning to S2 from S1 at T=1 : $P(S2 | S1, T=1) = P\_2 = 2/5$ Probability of transitioning to S2 from S1 at T=2 : $P(S2 | S1, T=2) = P(S1 | S1, T=1) \cdot P\_2 = P\_1 \cdot P\_2 = 3/5 \cdot 2/5$ Probability of transitioning to S2 from S1 at T=3 : $P(S2 | S1, T=3) = P(S1 | S1, T=1) \cdot P(S1 | S1, T=2) \cdot P\_2 = P\_1 \cdot P\_1 \cdot P\_2 = 3/5 \cdot 3/5 \cdot 2/5$ Is my understanding correct, or am I missing something? Any insight and/or resources you could provide would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! [EDIT] Ignore P_5 in the diagram above. We would need to do the same sort of calculations for the transition rates P_3 and P_4 for the transition from S2 to S3 .
