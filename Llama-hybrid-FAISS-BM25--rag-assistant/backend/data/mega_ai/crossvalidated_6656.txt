Median entropy to observe evolution of system?

I am studying a dynamical system that takes as an initial condition a list. I want to analyze the evolution of Shannon's entropy in this system. I know the maximum entropy (50) and the minimum (0). Pure random conditions have almost maximum entropy, and so it is hard to analyze changes in it unless it decreases. I set up the list to have an initial value of 25 (average between maximum and minimum), so there is an equal amount to expand in either direction. Is this statistically sound? Thanks in advance.
