The Swing tutorial has sections on "How to Use Menus" and "Drag and Drop". The section on menus show how to display a popup by checking the "isPopupTrigger" of the MouseEvent. Although since JDK5 this process is easier as the setComponentPopupMenu()method has been added. The secton on DnD shows how to use the built in DnD support.
