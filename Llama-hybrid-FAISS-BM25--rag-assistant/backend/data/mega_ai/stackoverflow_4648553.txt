code splitting in app engine

I am trying to organize my code into many small JSP files. I then create a main JSP that imports many smaller jsp's. Many times the smaller JSP's will depend on a resource in the main page eg. the user. When I run this code on the local development server it runs fine because pages are created on the fly. When I try to deploy it tells me that it can't find the dependency, because it's not created in this file its in the main jsp. How do I tell a JSP that a variable is created outside of a file. I am using @ include and not jsp:include.
