Joins are generally better than inline queries - inline queries get executed for every row that is returned from the main query. That means (1) is better than (2). In 99% of the cases at least. In few cases, the distribution of data and way indexes are defined can play a role in tilting the query execution times towards 2 being more efficient, but this happens very rarely in a average database.
