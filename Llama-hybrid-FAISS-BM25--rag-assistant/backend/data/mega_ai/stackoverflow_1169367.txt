In my opinion other answers underestimate importance of ADO.Net Data Services. Though using it directly in your application brings some similarity to two tiered system , other Microsoft products such as .Net RIA Services , Windows Asure Storage Services based on it. On the contrary to the phrase in one of the answers "For simple/quick tasks, in a Intranet, and if you are not too pick with your design, it can be useful" it may be useful for public websites including websites in ASP.Net MVC. Dino Esposito describes the driving force for Ado.Net Data Services in his blog http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/archive/2008/04/21/the-quot-driving-force-quot-pattern-part-1-of-n.aspx "ADO.NET Data Services (aka, Astoria) Driving force: the need of building richly interactive Web systems. What's that in abstract: New set of tools for building a middle-tier or, better yet, the service layer on top of a middle-tier in any sort of application, including enterprise class applications. What's that in concrete: provides you with URLs to invoke from hyperlinks to bring data down to the client. Better for scenarios where a client needs a direct|partially filtered access to data. Not ideal for querying data from IE, but ideal for building a new generation of Web controls that breath AJAX. And just that."
