Does HTML5 localStorage have an expiry date?

Possible Duplicate: DOM Storage expires time If I add some data to the browser's local storage, does it expire naturally? I'm thinking of storing some data with HTML 5 local storage, but the nature of it means it would expire after a few weeks. So I'm wondering if there is a method to check if the data needs updating? Or simply update the data every few weeks.
