Maybe CodeBubble ? The essential goal of this project is to make it easier for developers to see many fragments of code (or other information) at once without having to navigate back and forth. Each of these fragments is shown in a bubble. (although Mylyn is kind of similar in its approach, but with less diagrams ;) )
