"Session" is the term used to refer to a user's time browsing a web site. It's meant to represent the time between their first arrival at a page in the site until the time they stop using the site. In practice, it's impossible to know when the user is done with the site. In most servers there's a timeout that automatically ends a session unless another page is requested by the same user. The first time a user connects some kind of session ID is created (how it's done depends on the web server software and the type of authentication/login you're using on the site). Like cookies, this usually doesn't get sent in the URL anymore because it's a security problem. Instead it's stored along with a bunch of other stuff that collectively is also referred to as the session. Session variables are like cookies - they're name-value pairs sent along with a request for a page, and returned with the page from the server - but their names are defined in a web standard. Some session variables are passed as HTTP headers . They're passed back and forth behind the scenes of every page browse so they don't show up in the browser and tell everybody something that may be private. Among them are the USER_AGENT, or type of browser requesting the page, the REFERRER or the page that linked to the page being requested, etc. Some web server software adds their own headers or transfer additional session data specific to the server software. But the standard ones are pretty well documented. Hope that helps.
