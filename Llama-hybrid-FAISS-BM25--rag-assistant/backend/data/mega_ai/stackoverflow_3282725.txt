Pruning Columns in Cassandra

I'm thinking about using Cassandra for a large data project. The data will be sourced from a traditional data warehouse. Cassandra will host the data formated in a way my application can correctly read it. I don't quite understand how I will prune the data from Cassandra. For example, I want to count the number of visits a particular ip address has made to a website in the past 24 hours. I plan on generating this data every hour and I'd like to keep 2 weeks per IP address. My Column structure looks like: 127.0.0.1: { visitorsLast24Hours: { 1279554672: 30, 1279553072: 24, etc... } } How do I remove rows from the visitorsLast24Hours column? So far, the best solution I've come up with is to: Get the column I want to work with Prune the values I no longer want to keep Delete the column from the database Re-insert the new pruned column This seems like a poor method for working with the database. I'm assuming my data sizes will balloon, based on the way storage is done in Cassandra. Is there a more efficient way of doing it? I'm currently working with phpcassa as my interface to Cassandra. Thanks!
