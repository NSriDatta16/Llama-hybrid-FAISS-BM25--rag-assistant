combining data from two different types of sensor with different reliability

I'm trying to measure distance using two types of sensors: ultrasonic and camera. I've found a way to calculate the distance using those two sensors and now I need to combine the data in the hope of outputting better measurement. How do you combine these two data knowing that one is more reliable than the other (judging from the error of measurement)? I was thinking of just using the weighted average method, but how do you find the weight for each of those sensors? Other better methods of fusing the data are also welcomed!
