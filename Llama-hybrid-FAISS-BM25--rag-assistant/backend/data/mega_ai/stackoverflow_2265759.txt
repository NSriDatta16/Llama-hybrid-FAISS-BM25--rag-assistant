How to Read the Properties of files using IpropertyStorage?

how to read the properties(Like title,author,Page count etc.,) of files using iPropertyStorage? anyone know the code in c# please post it Actually, I'm trying to programatically (using c#) read the file properties (Title, Summary, Author, Comments etc.... The stuff that shows up on the Summary tab when you see the properties of a file). FileInfo and FileSystemInfo classes expose only the standard properties (create time, mod time etc..) so i'm trying to use ipropertyStorage. any one know the solution post it will be helpful.
