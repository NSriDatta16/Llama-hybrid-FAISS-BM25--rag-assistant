If you're just trying to cache within the same run, then a local dictionary could function as a runtime cache. If you're trying to cache between application runs, it gets trickier. If this is a desktop application, just save the cached images locally in the user's application data folder. If it's an XBAP application (WPF in Browser), you'll only be able to setup a local cache in the user's Isolated Storage , due to security.
