Is SVM uses latent variables when input variables/features are superior than 3

I was wondering if SVM uses some kind of latent variables / latent space when inputs variables/features are superior than 3. In fact I know that SVM uses dimension - 1 (a curve in 2D, a plane in 3D, ...). But the fact is that I can explain 95% (variance) of my dataset with PCA on 3 dimensions and I would like to say that I can use these same features for SVM because there are meaningful with PCA, so why not with SVM ... So yeah using PCA to conclude that inputs are significant, so I can work with. Especially with a rbf kernel. (NB: I already tried to train a SVM on PCA principal components, a disaster)
