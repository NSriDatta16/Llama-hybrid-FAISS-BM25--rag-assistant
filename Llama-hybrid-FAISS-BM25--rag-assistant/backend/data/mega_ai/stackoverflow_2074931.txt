That's not exactly very good JSON above there, in the case of the Agents value the second key will override the first. You probably meant: "Agents" : [ {"name" : "Bob Barker"}, {"name" : "Mona Mayflower"} ], Then you'd access the first agent's name as homes[0]['Agents'][0]['Name'] Similarly, to get one of the values from the Listings, you'd do something akin to: homes[0]['Listings'][0]['city'] - or - homes[0].Listings[0].city The dot syntax can be used wherever there is a valid identifier, else you need to use the array syntax. As a side note, I'm not sure the structure of the data, but it's possible that you can eliminate the outer-level [] that's enclosing your whole structure in an array. Then you wouldn't need to access everything as homes[0]['Listings'] and instead simply homes['Listings'] .
