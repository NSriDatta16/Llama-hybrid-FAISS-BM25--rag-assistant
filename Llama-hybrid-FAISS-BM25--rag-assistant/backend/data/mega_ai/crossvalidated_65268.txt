Interpreting exp(b)

With respect to (binary) logistic regression and a categorical IV, State, if a given exp(b) is .08 and I'm using indicator coding such that my reference category for the variable, State, is, say, "Wyoming," how do I interpret .08? Presumably I contrast the .08 with the "mean" of Wyoming (with "mean" here being the proportionality, or number of positive instances, of Wyoming)...So if Wyoming = .06, do I multiply .08 * .06 = .0048? That doesn't quite feel right...
