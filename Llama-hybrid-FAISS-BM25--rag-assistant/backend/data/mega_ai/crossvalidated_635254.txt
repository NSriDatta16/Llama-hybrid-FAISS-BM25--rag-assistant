I will add my two cents as the two questions have very different answers, and the accepted answer only explains those very briefly. One assumption I would have to make is that all of those variables are categorical/factors, and some have many levels. The too large matrix error is coming from the fixed effects side of the model -- the four-way interaction V1*V2*V3*V4 probably identifies every observation in the data set -- check what length(unique(df$V1)) * length(unique(df$V2)) * length(unique(df$V3)) * length(unique(df$V4)) is. In the $(X'X)^{-1}$ fixed part of the regression model, you end up with the $n \times n$ matrix. A $10^4 \times 10^4$ matrix is sizeable (~800Mb) but it should not be breaking the linear algebra compute libraries. A 50K $\times$ 50K matrix is 20Gb and would stretch the memory of most laptops. There may be a version of a mixed model with sparse matrices -- the said matrix has only one non-zero off-diagonal entry in each row/column so the storage does not have to be 20Gb, it can be 1Mb... but its inverse will likely get dense. The second error comes from model identification. You are asking to estimate the effect of each variable twice, once as a fixed effect, and the second time as the random effect. Once you have taken out the fixed effect of V1 , the residuals with respect to that variable are exactly zero. The variance of the term (1|V1) is estimated to be zero, the log and the inverse of that variance that go into the likelihood blow it to infinity, and when the Hessian is numerically evaluated, the difference of several infinities produce round off errors making the result a matrix that is not positive definite. (A better syntax parser would have detected the presence of the variable as both a fixed and a random effect and would have issued a more informative warning.) My overall conclusion is that the OP is not prepared to tackle the mixed models on their own. I would suggest seeking help of an appropriate professional consulting statistician at a nearby university or online .
