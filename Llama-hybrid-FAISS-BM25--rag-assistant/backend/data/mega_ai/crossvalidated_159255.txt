Handling categorical predictors in logistic regression, linear regression and SVM

I want to know how I can handle categorical variables in logistic regression, linear regression and SVM. The categorical variable has four categories 1,2,3 and 4. However, it doesn't mean 4 is like 4 times 1. It's just a name. Why people say that for SVM I need to use four dummy binary variables encoding the category, but for linear and logistic regression, I do not need to do anything? Why is that any insights.
