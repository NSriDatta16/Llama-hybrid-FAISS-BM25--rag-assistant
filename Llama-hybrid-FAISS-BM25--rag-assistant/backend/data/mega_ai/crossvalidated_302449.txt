This is akin to the after-life dilemma: what ratio of good and bad deeds (data) is sufficient to get to heaven instead of hell (class), after one dies (filter!). Herein, death serves as the filter, leading to missing values towards a supervised learning scheme. I want to disambiguate between missing-value problem and 'biased data' problem. There is no such thing as biased data, there is such a thing as 'biased model' explaining said data, but the data itself isn't biased, it is merely missing. If the missing data is meaningfully correlated to observable data, then it is entirely possible to train an unbiased model and achieve good predictive results. If the missing data is completely uncorrelated with observable data, then its a case of 'you don't know what you don't know'. You can use neither supervised, nor unsupervised learning methods. The problem is outsides the realms of data science. Therefore, for the sake of meaningful solution, lets assume that missing data is correlated with observable data. We'll exploit said correlation. There are several data mining algorithms that attempt to solve such a problem. You can try 'Ensemble methods' like Bagging-n-Boosting or 'frequent pattern mining' algorithms like Apriori and FP-growth. You can also explore methods in Robust Statistics.
