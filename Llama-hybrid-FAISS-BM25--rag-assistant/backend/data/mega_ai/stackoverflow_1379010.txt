You "could" calculate the total with SQL (I am assuming you do not want total number of records ... the price total or whatever it is). SQL is quite good at mathematics when it gets told to do so :) No storing of total. But, as it is all run on the client machine, I think my preference would be to total using C#. Then the business rules for calculating the total are out of the DB/SQL. By that I mean if you had a complex calculation for total that reuired adding say 5% to orders below £50 and the "business" changed it to add 10% to orders below £50 it is done in your "business logic" code rather than in your storage medium (in this case SQL).
