If using Servlet API up to version 2.5 - there is no other way if you want portability - you must include the Filter in web.xml. If using Servlet API 3.0, you can use web-fragment.xml inside your jar, or @WebFilter annotation on the filter, and it will automatically be deployed (the web-app should only specify metadata-complete="false" in order to include declarations from other modules)
