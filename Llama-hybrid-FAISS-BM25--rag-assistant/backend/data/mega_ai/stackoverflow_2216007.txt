Eclipse Java EE plugin

I want an Eclipse Java EE plugin which I can install directly from Eclipse. I searched about it on Google and found some ones but couldn't figure out how to download them directly from Eclipse. One plugin I found was WTP but couldn't find the location of the WTP repository that I can enter in the Eclipse's Software Update tool. I am using Eclipse 3.4.2 (Ganymede)
