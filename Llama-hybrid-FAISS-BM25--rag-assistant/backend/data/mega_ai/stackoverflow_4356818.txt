Changing screen orientation issue: onCreate

I have an issue when changing my screen orientation. I have an activity with 2 intents that gets called by a service. When I rotate the screen, going into landscape mode, it recalls onCreate. The issue is I have a button, and TextField which gets updated through a handler), and they don't seem to react anymore. Like this is the code when I try also to add the button in the onCreate but it doesn't respond once the view is changed to landscape mode: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.call); Button endCall = (Button) findViewById(R.id.stopCall); endCall.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { /// ... } }); handleIntent(getIntent()); } How do people treat this reorientation please? Is there a way to have it not recall onCreate please or what is the most common way to treat this case please?
