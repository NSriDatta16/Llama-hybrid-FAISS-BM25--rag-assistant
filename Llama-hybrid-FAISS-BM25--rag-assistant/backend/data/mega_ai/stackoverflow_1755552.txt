Using Excel VBA to find a range

I have been given some workbooks which are formatted for the eye rather than anything functional. As such, I have quite a few column headings that look like this: A B C D E 1 'YTD 'Monthly 'YTD 'Monthly 2 Figures' Figures' Plan' Plan' 3 4 Account1 1 3 5 7 5 Account2 2 4 6 8 What I have been doing is using .Find to identify the row for 'Account 1' and then the column heading for 'Monthly Plan' , and copying that cell value in an array. However, there are several areas (such as my example above) where I cannot easily find the column E, because searching for either 'Monthly' or 'Plan' obviously gives me unreliable results. So far I have been using Do... While... Loop in order to find a cell address for 'Monthly' , then checking the cell value immediately below for the word 'Plan' , and looping using .FindNext until there is a match. This isn't very elegant - so is there a way I can search for a dummy array/range with the arrangement of words I am looking for?
