@tweakt I've considered S3 extensively as well, but I don't think it'll be satisfactory for us in the long run. We have a lot of files that must be stored securely - not through file ACL's, but through our application layer. While this can also be done through S3, we do have one bit less control over our file storage. Furthermore there will also be a major downside in forms of latency when we do file operations - both initial saves (which can be done asynchronously though), but also when we later read the files and have to perform operations on them. As for the SPOF, that's not really an issue. We do have redundant connections to our datacenter and while I do not want any SPOFs, the little downtime S3 has had is acceptable. Unlimited scalability and no need for maintenance is definitely an advantage. Regarding a hybrid approach. If we are to host directly from S3 - which would be the case unless we want to store everything locally anyways (and just use S3 as backup), the bandwidth prices are simply too steep when we add S3 + CloudFront (CloudFront would be necessary as we have clients from all around). Currently we host everything from our datacenter in Europe, and we have our own reverse squids setup in the US for a low-budget CDN functionality. While it's very domain dependent, ummutability is not an issue for us. We may replace files (that is, key X gets new content), but we will never make minor modifications to a file. All our files are blobs.
