How can I determine Gamma distribution parameters from data

I have a time series of weekly retail sales data that I would like to model for an inventory control simulation I am working on. From my research it looks like weekly retail sales like this are best modelled with a gamma distribution, but how can I calculate the shape and scale parameters from the data? *I have also read that Poisson distribution is also good to model sales, but in this due to seasonal trends the mean does not equal the variance, so it hasn't seemed to work. If anyone has insight in how poisson distribution would suit this problem better I am open to that.
