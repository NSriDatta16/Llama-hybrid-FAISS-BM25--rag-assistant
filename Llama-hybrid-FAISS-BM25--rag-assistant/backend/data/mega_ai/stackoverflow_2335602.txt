Edit (re: comments, onClipEvent shenanigans didn't work) How about trying something like this: this.createEmptyMovieClip("holder", this.getNextHighestDepth()); loadMovie("test.swf","holder"); instead of: //load swf loadMovie("test.swf","_level2"); Or, if _level2 is necessary to the structure of the app, something like this: _level2.createEmptyMovieClip("holder", _level2.getNextHighestDepth()); _level2.holder.loadMovie("test.swf"); I just tried this out with a 2-level nested load, and it maintained the click handler in the top level (while using a loadMovie w/o the holder didn't). I'm not sure if the assumptions I made match the structure of your nested SWFs, but that's my best guess at this point.
