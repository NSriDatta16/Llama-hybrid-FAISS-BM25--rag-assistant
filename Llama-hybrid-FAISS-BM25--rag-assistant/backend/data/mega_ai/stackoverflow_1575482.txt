To use the linker pragma comment, the output file must NOT be specified in the linker section of the project properties: project -> properties -> Linker -> General -> Output File Delete the entry: $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName).exe then the prama statement will work: pragma comment(linker, "/out:mycool.exe") Thanks to JC for the walkthrough Specifying a complete path is not possible http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/vcgeneral/thread/11a06ecd-dcca-4d81-8626-ba0c5a1835c1/ but the work around is: What I do is have a header file loacated somewhere near the library file, this header will include the pragma line. pragma comment(lib, FILE "../libs/mylibary.lib") if FILE is "C:\Project\SharedLibs\Xvid\latest.h" then the pragma will include "C:\Project\SharedLibs\Xvid\libs/mylibary.lib" once it has normalized the uri to remove the ..'s this will always cause the pragma to include the library with an absolute path created from the path of the accompanying header. I use this system to include a single header in a project and regardless of the relative paths between the lib and project the lib will always be included cleanly. Added: The full path can be specified as long as it is 8.3 format. This can present problems for a path like: C:\Program Files\Abyss Web Server\htdocs\ Program files is commonly Progra~1 but a folder name with a space is more tricky. In this case it becomes AbyssW~1 The \ must be escaped resulting in \ producing a working pragma of: #pragma comment(linker, "/out:C:\\Progra~1\\AbyssW~1\\htdocs\\MyApp.exe") as kibibu showed: #pragma comment(linker, "/out:\"C:\\Program Files\\Abyss Web Server\\htdocs\\MyApp.exe\"") also works
