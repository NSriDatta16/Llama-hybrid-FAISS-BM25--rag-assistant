What is the best way to create a tableA HABTM tableA relationship for a CakePHP application?

I have the need to create the functionality to allow my registered users to associate themselves with other uses and create a family. My database tables look something like this: db.persons - (Bob, Jane, Timmy, etc) id name email db.persons_persons id person__id_parent person_id_child relationtype_id db.relationtypes - (spouse, child, nephew, etc) id name With this structure, I should be able to specify that Bob is a Spouse of Jane in the persons_persons table. The record in db.persons_persons would look something like (psuedo): ID | person_parent | person_child | relationtype 1 | Bob | Jane | Spouse 2 | Bob | Timmy | Child I realize this could cause some data fragmentation since if Bob and Jane are married, then a child of one would have to be associated with the other. However that is not my question. My question is whether or not this database setup is 'most-correct' for use in a cakePHP application.
