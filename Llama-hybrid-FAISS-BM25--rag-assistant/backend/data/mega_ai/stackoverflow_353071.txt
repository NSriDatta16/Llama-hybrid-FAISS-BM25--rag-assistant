How do I get the GridView Control to use post backs for paging inside an update panel?

I have a GridView Control that for other functionality has to be inside an update panel. The site is using the Ajax Control Toolkit and the "EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks" property on the Grid is set to false. However, when I execute a paging call it is still doing it as a callback instead of a postback. How do I fix this and get the paging calls to fire as a postback?
