Which algorithm to apply for choosing the right point

Picture below shows 7 points around the origin. One of them has been selected by a human based on rules and experience and is colored red (the one in the lower left quadrant). Now we have over 1000 of these sets of points and for each set a human has selected a single point. These conditions apply to all sets: Each set has about 3 - 10 points There are no outliers Points can have positive and negative values No mistakes were made when selecting a point My question is: Does there exists a machine learning algorithm to learn from these sets and human made selections so it can automatically decide which point to select when a new set of points is given? This new set satisfies the first 3 conditions from above of course. 2 final remarks: The example I gave is just a randomly constructed example by me to support the idea about points in a plane around the origin together with a selected one. In real life there might be more structure but for now I am curious and would like to know what is possible for this case. Would variations be possible? Say it is about 2 selected points or you have circles with a given radius instead of points.
