Perform a command when a process dies

I want to execute a command when a process dies. I have a solution already, but I'm looking to see if there is a nicer way to do this as a way of further learning BASH. Here is what I have: $ ps -e | grep scp 7673 pts/1 00:01:17 scp $ while [ $( ps 7673 2>&1 >/dev/null; echo $? ) = 0 ]; do sleep 1; done; echo "Scp doesn't exist any more" It works and I've seen uglier solutions. :-) Do you have any improvements on this one or another more elegant solution?
