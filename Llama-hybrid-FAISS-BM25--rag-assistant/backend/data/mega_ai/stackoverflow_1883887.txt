You need to have have a list of pointers of type abstract. initialize all the pointers to null and construct to the correct class later. You don't need to pre-type the pointers before hand. You can just rely on the RTTI latter. If you do need to pre-type them before hand than just add an enum to Abstract for the types. This saves you memory if the inherited classes are large. But you have to maintain the enum of types yourself, not the most elegant way of doing things. If you have to initialize and pre-type them, just initialize the classes using the default constructor. But this way you are using memory when not needed. RTTI will be your friend here in this case.
