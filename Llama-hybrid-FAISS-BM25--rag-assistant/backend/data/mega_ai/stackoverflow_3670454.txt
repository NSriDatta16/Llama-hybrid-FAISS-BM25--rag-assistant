Programming an iTunes script for converting a playlist

I have a gigantic playlist (around 2000 songs) in iTunes that I would like to convert to 320 kbps MP3 (from low-quality AAC). What I want to do is convert all the songs in the playlist, delete the low-quality originals, and then re-import the songs into the playlist (as iTunes recognizes the converted songs as new songs and the deleted originals obviously do not remain). Seeing as Automator's default scripts for doing this are broken in iTunes 9, how would I write an Apple Script to handle this task? I would like to avoid the painful: doing this manually, if I can help it. Thanks.
