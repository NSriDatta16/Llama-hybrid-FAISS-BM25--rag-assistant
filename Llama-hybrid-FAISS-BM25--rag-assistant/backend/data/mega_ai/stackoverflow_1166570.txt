hosting multiple production sharepoint sites on same server

I am currently hosting a low-volume WSS 3.0 application on a virtual server for a client, and soon will be creating a few more sites for different customers. Each customer will only average around 50 users total, no more than a few at a time. Are there any issues with hosting all of these on the same virtual box? Each would be a separate web application with a separate IP address. Clients are unrelated and shouldn't have any idea that they're on the same machine. Thanks!
