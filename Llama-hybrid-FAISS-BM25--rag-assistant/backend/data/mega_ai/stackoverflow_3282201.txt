Magento upgrade via Magento Connect fails

I tried to upgrade our shopsoftware from Ver. 1.3.2.3 to 1.4.1.0 and I used the Magento Connect Manager. It loads all the files and said they has been installed, but they are not. Under “downloader/pearlib/download/” are all these files. Have I forgotten anything or is that maybe a bug in our customized shopversion? I’m searching for days and hope, someone can help me here.
