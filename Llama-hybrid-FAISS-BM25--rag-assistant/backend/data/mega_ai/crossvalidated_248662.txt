From wikipedia : "The goal of Gibbs Sampling here is to approximate the distribution of $P(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$" Notation can be found on the wiki site or from the original paper here . One "scan" of Gibbs sampling targeting the above distribution will give you draws from the following probability distributions: $P(\mathbf{Z}_{(1,1)}|\mathbf{Z}_{-(1,1)}\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$, $P(\mathbf{Z}_{(1,2)}|\mathbf{Z}_{-(1,2)}\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$, $P(\mathbf{Z}_{(1,3)}|\mathbf{Z}_{-(1,3)}\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta),\ldots, P(\mathbf{Z}_{(N,K)}|\mathbf{Z}_{-(N,K)}\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$. You can either run through them in a sequence, or you can randomly chose which of these to sample form. But you keep doing scans over and over to get a lot of samples. Whatever option you choose, you get a sequence of $\mathbf{Z}$s. $$ \mathbf{Z}^1, \mathbf{Z}^2, \mathbf{Z}^3\ldots $$ Each $\mathbf{Z}^i$ is an $N\times K$ matrix. Also, for two consecutive $\mathbf{Z}$ matrices, only one element will be different. That's because you're sampling from a distribution $P(\mathbf{Z}_{(m,n)}|\mathbf{Z}_{-(m,n)}\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$ when you go from one sample to the next. Why would you want this? Don't we want independent and identical draws from $P(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$? That way we could use the law of large numbers and central limit theorems to approximate expectations, and we would have some idea of the error. But I doubt these $\mathbf{Z}$ draws are independent. And are they even identical (are they even coming from the same distribution)? Gibbs sampling can still give you a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem. $\mathbf{Z}^1, \mathbf{Z}^2, \mathbf{Z}^3\ldots $ is a Markov Chain with stationary/invariant distribution $P(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{W};\alpha,\beta)$. That means the marginal distribution of each draw is from the distribution you're targetting (so they're identical draws). However, they are not independent. In practice this means you run the chain for longer or you subsample the chain (only take every 100th sample, say). Everything can still "work," though. For more information I would click the link underneath the question. There are some good references posted in that thread. This answer just attempts to give you the jist using the notation in common LDA references.
