By "sweet spot," I think we can assume you mean the inflection point -- the point where the growth in new users rolls over and begins to flatten out towards an asymptomtic max. There are no shortage of ways to analyze this information. One of them is as a diffusion process. Something that might help you visualize this would be not to treat it as a scatterplot but rather to plot the cumulative number of new users by day. The shape of that curve should suggest the inflection point. The basic idea is that growth is S-shaped -- slow at the beginning and the end with a rapid rise in the middle in the curve. Mathematical modeling of that process began with Gompertz in the early 19th c but there are many other, newer models. This wiki post ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function ) describes that model: Formula ${\displaystyle y(t)=a\mathrm {e} ^{-b\mathrm {e} ^{-ct}},}$ where a is an asymptote, since ${\displaystyle \lim _{t\to \infty }a\mathrm > {e} ^{-b\mathrm {e} ^{-ct}}=a\mathrm {e} ^{0}=a}$ and $b$ , $c$ are positive numbers $b$ sets the displacement along the $x$ -axis (translates the graph to the left or right) $c$ sets the growth rate ( $y$ scaling) $e$ is Euler's Number ( $e = 2.71828 \cdots$ ). (Apologies for any bad formatting) In the marketing of new products, Rogers' diffusion model is one of the most widely cited papers in any field. His model was given mathematical formulation by Frank Bass and has seen many amendments and variations over the years. Bass, F. M. (1969), “A New Product Growth Model for Consumer Durables,” Management Science , 215-227 Other models were developed in biological mathematics to describe the growth of, e.g., pea pods. Known as the Fisher-Pry transform which is described here ( here ). Fisher-Pry has been applied to the diffusion of new technology by groups such as the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller University. All of the models mentioned so far basically involve univariate analysis. Extensions to multivariate regression models have been made recently. A good resource for those more advanced models (which would facilitate introducing promotion spend as a covariate and include R code) are available from these lecture notes: http://www.unc.edu/courses/2008fall/ecol/563/001/docs/lectures/lecture27.htm Here are the contents of that website: Overview of nonlinear mixed effects models Deciding which parameters should be made random in linear mixed effects models Centering a predictor to reduce parameter correlations in linear models The kestrel data set The Gompertz model selfStart functions in R Deciding which parameters should be made random in a Gompertz mixed effects model Interpreting the parameters of the SSgompertz function
