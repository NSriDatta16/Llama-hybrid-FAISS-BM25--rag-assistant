If you can perfectly reconstruct the dummies from a candidate predictor, then the dummies and the predictor carry the same information. If the dummies encode intervals of the predictor (the most common way of discretizing continuous predictors, which is a bad idea, as discussed often here on CV, but that's not the focus), then you should be able to model the dummies perfectly with a multinomial logistic regression on the predictor: library(nnet) # encode the dummies into a single factor variable: tab$age.level We get a perfect confusion matrix. This would be convincing enough for me.
