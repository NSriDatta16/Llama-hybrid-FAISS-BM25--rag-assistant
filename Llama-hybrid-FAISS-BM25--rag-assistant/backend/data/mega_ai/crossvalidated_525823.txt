Postetior from Jeffrey prior of Normal distribtion

Context I am given a sample from normal distribution $v_i \sim N(\gamma \cdot u_i, \sigma^2)$ , $i =1,..., n$ . I need to obtain the posterior distribution using Jeffreys prior for $\gamma$ . My solution I find the Fisher Information as $J = \Bbb E(-(\ell)'')$ . If I am not mistaken $$J = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i \propto 1$$ This means that the Jeffreys prior is proportional to constant. As far as I know, posterior is proportional to product of the likelihood function and the Jeffreys prior. Since the Jeffreys prior is constant then the posterior distribution should be absolutely the same as the initial distribution that is $ N(\gamma \cdot u_i, \sigma^2)$ . However, most of the posts say that the parameters of the posterior distribution become the averages of parameters from the initial distribution. I studied many posts on stackexchange but still cannot figure it out.
