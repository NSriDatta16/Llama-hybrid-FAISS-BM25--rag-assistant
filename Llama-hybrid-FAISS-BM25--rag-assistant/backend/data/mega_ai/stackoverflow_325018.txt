A few points to take into consideration: What's the load on your website? State Server has the tendency to crash when facing a large number of concurrent hits. We're only using it in scenarios where we have a really small number of users (in the 10's, mostly backend systems). Whenever we tried using it in production for sites serving 1000's of users daily, it would crash leading to loss of session data. On one of the production environments we manage, we're using MSSQL 2005 Express to manage the sessions, the site has 10K+ users a day and 200K+ pages a day. This is a recommended approach in case session is a must and tightly coupled into your application. If you're about to user MSSQL Express as your state DB, remember that it doesn't come with SQL Server Agent meaning there's no tasks scheduler running in the background and cleaning your expired sessions. I'd recommend finding a scheduler and running the clean expired sessions stored procedure periodically. Good luck
