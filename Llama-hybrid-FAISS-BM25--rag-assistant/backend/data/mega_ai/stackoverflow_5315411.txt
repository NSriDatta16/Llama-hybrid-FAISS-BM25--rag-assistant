Migration to create different databases structures in Rails

I have 3 different organizations types and 3 different databases structures: one for each type. When org1 registers I'm creating a new database instance for org1, and when org2 registers I'm creating a new db instance, and same for org3. Now, how do I run migrations for three different db:structure from my application soon after I create a new database instance for organizations. I am creating a db instance from application by: ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql) How can I do this? Is there another approach I should be using?
