Optimize random seeking of embedded video in Flash

I have an Embedded (synchronized with timeline) clip in a flash movie. I am controlling the currentFrame of the clip by dragging a slider left to right (to simulate rotating an object). The problem is when I go forwards, motion is smooth, but if I drag to the left Flash cannot seem to efficiently play back in reverse and the motion is extremely jerky. Obviously I'm skipping frames depending upon the position of the mouse, but there is a very noticable lag when currentFrame is decreased vs. increased. Is there a way to optimize an embedded timeline clip for reverse random seeking like this? Possible solutions (untested) : Use video instead of embedded - I would expect this to make the situation worse though! Create a second reversed video for when scrolling to the left. This would probably double the file size. Any other ideas? Note: I am only changing the currentFrame of the clip on onEnterFrame to ensure I don't modify currentFrame too many times.
