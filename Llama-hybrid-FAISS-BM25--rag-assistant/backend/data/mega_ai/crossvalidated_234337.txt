PyMC3 dependencies between series elements

I want a model that includes dependencies between elements of time series. Let say we have 4 years of hourly data, with features X and labels y . I want to include an assumption "slightly similar to day before and hour before" this way: y_i ~ d1 * A * X + d2 * y_(i-1) + d3 * y_(i-24) d1 + d2 + d3 == 1 Is it possible in pymc3? preferably without python loop over data, but if it is the only way, let it be. Maybe there is a way to reformulate this and get similar result? Is it a good task for pymc3 anyway?
