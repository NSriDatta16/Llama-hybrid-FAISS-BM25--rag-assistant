How to find p(A|C) from known values for p(A|B) and p(C|B)?

Suppose, in some problem with discrete variables, I have found numerical answers for p(A|B) and p(C|B), and have already analytically derived the numerical answers for all their respective associated marginal and joint probabilities -- in other words, I also know p(A), p(B), p(C), p(A & B), and p(B & C). From here, how do I make the leap to find p(A|C)? It seems this should be a simple matter of introductory Bayesian inference -- as if I should be able to easily rearrange any of the following equations algebraically to derive P(A|C) given the values I do know: p(A|B) = p(B|A)*p(A)/p(B) = p(A & B)/p(B) p(C|B) = p(B|C)*p(C)/p(B) = p(B & C)/p(B) p(A|C) = p(C|A)*p(A)/p(C) = p(A & C)/p(C) Sorry for the basic question. I feel like I've been unproductively chasing my tail on this!
