I have the same Issue if I use ReSharper and run several UnitTests (with enabled CodeCoverage). I also assume this is a ReSharper problem. And since I disble it while I'm running Unittest the Exception never appears again. BTW - Disabling it when the exception throws (as mentioned in the comments above) doesn't help, because of disabling it while VS is running will not unload it from memory. The only way to force the unload is to tear down all AppDomains which have loaded the DLL. In a VS Package scenario this means you have to tear down the entire VS process :(
