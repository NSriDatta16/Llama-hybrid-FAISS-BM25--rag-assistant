Since it's language agnostic, I'll use C++ as a base and will hope that the advice can be extrapolated. Constructor of LogAnalyser is called before constructor of TestableAnalyser. This means that during its work TestableAnalyser is not constructed yet, thus calling virtual methods can be dangerous (they may use uninitialized data). In your case derived class wants to affect initialization of its base class. Virtual methods overriding is not the only way to do this. You can create one more constructor which accepts manager, derived classes will pass "new StubExtensionManager();".
