Using Rolling Forecast Origin Resampling in R for Neural Network Time Series

I am new to time series prediction and forecasting with neural networks and am having trouble with cross validation. I am fitting a multivariate time series. I have 236 monthly observations. I am using the caret package for this, seeing as Rob Hyndman has suggested to use rolling forecast cross validation for time series here: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5 . Caret has the function to do so but, for starters, I am having some trouble understanding the ins and outs of the trainControl documentation. What does the initialWindow mean in layman's terms? From the documentation on time slices it says the initial number of consecutive values in each training set sample. I figured, using Rob Hyndman's approach, that I would use 235 of my total 236 observations, the last observation being the "test set", thus setting initialWindow to 235. Here is the code I used: control The data has been normalized, no missing values, from Feb 1995 to Sept 2014. In summary, here are my questions I've already typed and a few more: What does the initialWindow parameter mean in layman's terms? What does the fixedWindow mean in layman's terms? How is the output of the model interpreted? More specifically, what does the "size" mean? Why could be causing NaNs in the Rsquared column? How do I obtain the outputs/predictions so I can create unscaled forecasts?
