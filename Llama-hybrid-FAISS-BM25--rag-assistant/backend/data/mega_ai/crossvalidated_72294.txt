How to remove seasonality from daily electricity demand

I want to remove seasonality from daily electricity demand (a time series). My understanding is there is weekly (high demand on Tue, Wed, and low demand on Sat, Sun) and annual seasonality (high demand on Winter and lower on Summer). I tried to build a model to forecast daily electricity demand in R, and plot my data as shown below: I tried to remove seasonality with the following: demand.xts.diff I also tried to use lag=365 and lag=366 (I am not sure what lag to use, due to the leap year issue), but none of them successfully removed seasonality. The ACF and PACF are shown below: Any advice is appreciated.
