Chances are, that Prototype will be using the $ variable, and that jQuery will be running in noConflict mode, so it will be referenced by the jQuery variable. It can get tricky, for instance: // here $ = Prototype jQuery(function($){ // here $ = jQuery }); // here $ = Prototype And in separate files: // here $ = Prototype (function($){ // here $ = jQuery; })(jQuery); // here $ = Prototype Its just really important to pay attention to your context to see which library is being referenced. Additionally, its perfectly acceptable to ask questions here if you get stumped on how to do something in jQuery that was done in Prototype.
