Ok I found some sort of hack for this. When an item is moved from #sortable1 to #sortable2, when dragged over #sortable2 there is a list item added with class .placeholder So in UI's over event I did $("#sortable2 li.placeholder").hide(); Than set it back with UI's stop event $("#sortable2 li.placeholder").show(); This is only for visuals though.. The item is still moved into #sortable2 so you need to remove() it there. To mimic copying you need to add a clone() back in #sortable2. You can get it's original index() in UI's start event and than use insertAfter(id - 1) At the moment I can only clone in UI's receive event, I would prefer in UI's over but can't get it to work..
