IMO, each record/row in table contains NULL BITMAP (2 bytes, each bit of which tells about null-ness of one/each of the column's value in this row) , so before selecting/reading real stored value this process of reading data passes this checking/reading of the corresponding bit from this NULL bit map. In case of NULL (or, in other words, "is not null" check), the reading process stops at this stage, while other selects/checks/comparison might (or might not, this depends) continue, so "is null check" cannot be slower. Even more, NULL values at the end of the row are not even stored, no storage is occupied by them. They are virtually and, sometimes, practically nothing. Though, the problem is that your TSQL examples in question and question itself are ambiguous with possible multiple interpretation and answers.
