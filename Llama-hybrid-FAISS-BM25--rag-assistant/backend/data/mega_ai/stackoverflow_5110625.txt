First of here a post which is pretty similar to this one: Should I store my images in the database or folders? Secondly a sample for storing images into database: http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=129&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 In my opinion it depends whether you choose to store images in your database or in folders. Both methods have there pros and cons. Here a short comment from asp.net forums: Should You Really Store Images in the Database? About ten years ago, I started one of the first Internet projects—an image data bank. We were supposed to deliver images of various sizes and resolution to registered users. Each image was designed as a collection of images, from the thumbnail to the highest resolution. The largest image available was about 4 MB. Each image stored in the archive took up a total of 6 MB of space. The back-end database was not running on a Microsoft platform but provided support for BLOB fields. Without much debate, we decided to store descriptions and other catalog information in the database and to store images as individual files under a well-known path. We also stored in the database enough information for the software to retrieve the file. Being designed for a relatively small number of registered users, the application never showed scalability problems and at no time did anyone on the team, or any users, complain about performance. Can this brief experience—especially an experience from a relatively old age of software and database technologies—be used as an example of the superiority of file-based storage over database storage? Certainly not, but reading between the lines of how modern DBMS systems implement BLOB fields, I've used this experience to formulate an idea about image storage and databases. In short, should you consider storing images in a database? If you need to edit the images frequently, I suggest storing the images as separate files on the server's hard drive. If the size of the images are very large (for example, hundreds of megabytes), I suggest storing the images as separate files in the file system. If your images are essentially read-only and relatively static, and if you measure the size in kilobytes, you can consider storing your images in the database.
