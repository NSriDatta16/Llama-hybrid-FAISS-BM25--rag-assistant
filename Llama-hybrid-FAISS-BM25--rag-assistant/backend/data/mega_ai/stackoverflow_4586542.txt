Limit shipping address of a group of products to certain country in Magento

I have to limit the shipping address of music and dvds to only one country in Magento. For example a client has in basket 3 books and a dvd and he selects a country other than allowed, I need a message to be shown: "You have in your basket at least one music or movie product. Distribution rights are limited only to /country/". Does anybody know a quick way to do this?
