It depends. If the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are different, then the PCA is unique. Else not. The fact that the variances of the principal components are given by λi has an important implication for the uniqueness of PCA. If two of the eigenvalues are equal, then the variance of those principal components are equal. Then, the principal components are not well-defined anymore, because we can make a rotation of those principal components without affecting their variances. This is because if p zi and zi+1 have the same variance, then linear combinations such as 1/2zi + p 1/2zi+1 and p 1/2zi − p 1/2zi+1 have the same variance as well; all the constraints (unit variance and orthogonality) are still fulfilled, so these are equally valid principal components. In fact, in linear algebra, it is well-known that the eigenvalue decomposition is uniquely defined only when the eigenvalues are all distinct.

Is PCA unique or not, that is, is there only one PCA solution. Multiple solutions may fulfill the PCA criteria. We consider the decomposition X = Y UT where U is orthogonal, Y T Y = Dm with Dm as m-dimensional diagonal matrix, and the eigenvalues of Dm are sorted increasingly.
