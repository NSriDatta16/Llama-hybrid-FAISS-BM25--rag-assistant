Most of the online/incremental SVM utilities are for linear kernels and I suppose its not as difficult as it is for non-linear kernels. Some of the notable Online/incremental SVM tools currently available: + Leon Bottous's LaSVM : It supports both linear and non-linear kernels. C++ code + Bordes's LaRank : It supports both linear and non-linear kernels. C++ code . It seems the link is broken now :-( + Gert Cauwenberghs' code incremental and decremental : supports both linear and nonlinear kernels. Matlab code . + Chris Diehl's Incremental SVM Learning : supports both linear and non-linear kernels. Matlab code. + Alistair Shilton's SVMHeavy : Only Binary classification and regression. C++ code + Francesco Parrella's OnlineSVR : Only Regression. Matlab and C++. + Pegasos : Both linear and nonlinear. C and Matlab code. A java interface . + Langford's Vowpal Wabbit : Not sure :-( + Koby Crammerâ€™s MCSVM : Both linear and non-linear. C code A more updated list can be found on my Quora answer .
