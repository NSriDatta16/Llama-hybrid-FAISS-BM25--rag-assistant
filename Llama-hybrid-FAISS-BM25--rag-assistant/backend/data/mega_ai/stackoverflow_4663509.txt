how do sites run in IE without asking for "allow scripts/activeX"?

I have tried googling this and have not come up with any good leads... I have a webpage I'm testing (it's an html document on my local machine). When loaded, IE asks if I want to allow scripts and activeX (I don't get why they are considered equally dangerous) Popular sites like cnn.com and stackoverflow.com don't ask me if I want to run scripts, they just do. How and why does this occur? Do I have to do something special to keep this from happening? (There is a prompt, but I don't want this to appear for my normal users)
