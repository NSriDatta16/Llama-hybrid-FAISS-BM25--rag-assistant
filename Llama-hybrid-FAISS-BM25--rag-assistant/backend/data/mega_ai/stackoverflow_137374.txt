You should: Promote it where you think it would be relevant (forums,mailing lists etc.). Try not to spam though - it will create a backlash. continue to provide updates as to create the appearance of an active project until more people pick it up. Find project leaders, they are the sort of contributors that encourage others to contribute as well. Blog about it and link to relevant blogs (creating ping-backs). Also leave comments at relevant blog posts. Basically, your generic Internet marketing tactics ;)
