How to check the ARIMA model by simulating innovations?

I am working on a monthly river flow time series and somebody has asked me to check my model by simulating innovations (or something like that). Can somebody help me about how can we simulate and how can check my model with that? I appreciate if you suggest a article or document in this regard. Also, if my question is wrong and this can not be done let me know so I will delete it. Thanks
