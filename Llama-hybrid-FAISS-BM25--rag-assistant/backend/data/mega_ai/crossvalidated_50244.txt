Interpreting the results of a binary logistic regression

This is a basic question. I have been handed a binary logistic regression. The model has significant terms, but the goodness of fit tests indicates the logit model is not appropriate. The author of the study indicates that the goodness of fit data does not invalidate the relationship between the dependent variable and the predictors, only the ability of the model to accurately predict outcomes. the argument is that since we were only interested in verifying a relationship and not the magnitude, the result is conclusive. I'm skeptical of this. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to say that the lack of fit does not necessarily invalidate the relationships? With a different link function, couldn't the observed and expected counts change enough to move some insignificant term to significance or vice versa?
