There is no such thing as associative array in Java. Its closest relative is a Map , which is strongly typed, however has less elegant syntax/API. This is the closest you can get based on your example: Map > arr = org.apache.commons.collections.map.LazyMap.decorate( new HashMap(), new InstantiateFactory(HashMap.class)); //$arr[0]['name'] = 'demo'; arr.get(0).put("name", "demo"); System.out.println(arr.get(0).get("name")); System.out.println(arr.get(1).get("name")); //yields null
