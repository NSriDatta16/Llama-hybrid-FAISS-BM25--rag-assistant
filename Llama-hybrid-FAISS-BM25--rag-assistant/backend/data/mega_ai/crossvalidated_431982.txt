After some discussion in the comments, I think I have the import of the question. The simple answer is that, for the significance test for the Breusch-Pagan test, the F value from the auxiliary regression doesn't need to be addressed at all. Instead, the test develops a statistic ( BP below), which, by my understanding, is chi-square distributed. So the test uses a chi-square test and reports a p-value. The following R uses the lmtest package, and uses a studentized version of the test. This is the default for the bptest function. My understanding is that this form of the test is more robust than the original version [citation needed]. if(!require(lmtest)){install.packages("lmtest")} library(lmtest) A = 1:10 B = 1:100 C = 1:1000 Value = c(A, B, C) Group = factor(c(rep("A", length(A)), rep("B", length(B)), rep("C", length(C)))) Model = lm(Value ~ Group) BPTest = bptest(Model) BPTest ### studentized Breusch-Pagan test ### ### data: Model ### BP = 120.37, df = 2, p-value I had thought the question was asking about developing a statistic analogous to an effect size statistic for the BP test. I don't have any citation, but I thought using the BP statistic divided by the sample size --- which should be equivalent to the r-squared for the auxiliary regression under some versions of the test --- might make sense. BP = BPTest$statistic n = length(residuals(Model)) rSquaredBP = BP / n names(rSquaredBP) = "rSquaredBP" rSquaredBP ### rSquaredBP ### 0.1084405 This is equivalent to the r-squared for the auxiliary regression under some versions of the test. Res = residuals(Model)^2 Model2 = lm(Res ~ Group) summary(Model2)$r.squared ### [1] 0.1084405 It appears that this matches the studentized version of the test, but not others. For example compare bptest(Model, studentize=F) .
