Hello In my android application when the user reinstall the app again i would like to delete the existing database and create a fresh new one. If by "reinstall", you mean "uninstall and reinstall", your existing database will be deleted during the uninstall process, assuming it resides in the normal database location (i.e., not on external storage). How could i know that the user is reinstalling the app You don't. How could i delete a file in raw folder? In Android? You don't. Resources cannot be modified or removed at runtime.
