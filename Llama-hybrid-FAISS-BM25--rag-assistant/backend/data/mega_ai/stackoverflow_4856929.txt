Face Recognition in OpenCV

I was trying to build a basic Face Recognition system (PCA-Eigenfaces) using OpenCV 2.2 (from Willow Garage). I understand from many of the previous posts on Face Recognition that there is no standard open source library that can provide all the face recognition for you. Instead, I would like to know if someone has used the functions(and integrated them): icvCalcCovarMatrixEx_8u32fR icvCalcEigenObjects_8u32fR icvEigenProjection_8u32fR et.al in the eigenobjects.cpp to form a face recognition system, because the functions seem to provide much of the required functionality along with cvSvd ? I am having a tough time trying to understand to do so since I am new to OpenCV.
