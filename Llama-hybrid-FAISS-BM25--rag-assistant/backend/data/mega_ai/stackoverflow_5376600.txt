There's two different questions here. HTTP cache headers can never specify that a user-agent must cache a resource, only that it must not cache a resource. So Firefox, by not caching your video, is not failing to honour the headers. However, Firefox clearly has some rules about when to cache resources. I don't know what they are, but I recommend that you don't rely on them. They are likely to depend on the platform on which Firefox is running in quite intricate ways.
