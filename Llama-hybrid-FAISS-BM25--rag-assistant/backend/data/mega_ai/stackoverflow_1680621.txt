You can drag the main layer in the same way you can drag the child layers Either, you can have a child layer accept the ccTouchMoved and then have that layer send a message to the parent. parent.position = CGPointMake(x, y) in example Or, you can have the child layers ignore the ccTouchMoved event until it's propagated to the main layer (which obviously has to be touch enabled for this to work)
