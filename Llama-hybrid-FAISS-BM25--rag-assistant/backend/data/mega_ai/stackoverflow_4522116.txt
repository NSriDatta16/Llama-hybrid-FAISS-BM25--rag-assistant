As far as I know, Youtube makes its videos inaccessible to all but the Youtube player. You'd have to rip the video, rehost it in an unprotected format or in a format you can use, and then play it through your own player. The player could then interact pretty simply with the embedding site via the ordinary AS3-Javascript interface. Tutorials on how to do this are plentiful on the Internet.
