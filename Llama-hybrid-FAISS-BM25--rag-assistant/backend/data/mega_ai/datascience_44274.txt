Metrics for presenting RNN/LSTM result

I am working on two different architectures based on the LSTM model to predict the user's next action based on the previous actions. I am wondering, what is the best way to present the result? Is it okay to present only the prediction accuracy? Or Should I use other metrics? I found a paper using top_K_accuracy whereas on a different paper I found AUC or ROC. Overall, I would like to know what is the state of the art of presenting prediction accuracy based on the LSTM model.
