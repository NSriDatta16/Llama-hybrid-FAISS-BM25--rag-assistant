The facts are Getting the column by index is a direct index into an ArrayList If the name lookup is case sensitive a hashtable lookup is performed If the name lookup is case insensitive then the list is scanned for the name and a more costly locale sensitive string comparison is performed. So definately the retrieval by index will be the most performant, but does it matter? Doing some basic (read naive) tests on my machine I found that 1,000,000 accesses to a column using the mentioned indexing mechanism take the following times Direct index - 13.3ms Case insensitive lookup - 109.11ms Case sensitive lookup - 109.24ms So depending on your scenario you can draw your conclusions.
