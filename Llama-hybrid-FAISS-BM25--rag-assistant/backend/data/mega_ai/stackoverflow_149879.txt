Tags (which include the easy-to-use JSP-like tag file mechanism) support invocation with strongly-typed, named parameters. Another incredibly useful and surprisingly often overlooked feature of JSP tags is the the JspFragment attribute type. This allows you to pass a chunk of JSP code, as a parameter, into a tag to be invoked, perhaps repeatedly. Includes lack these powerful parameterization features.
