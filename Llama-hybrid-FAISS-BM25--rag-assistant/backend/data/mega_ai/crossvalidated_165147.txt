R: linear mixed effects plus MCMC estimation

In a paper I wrote a few years ago, I wrote the following: All results were analyzed using linear mixed models effects, with Subjects and Items as random effects. I present p-values estimated from MCMC sampling. All the calculations have been done with the aid of the R statistical software, and specifically, the packages lm4e (Bates et al 2009) and languageR (Baayen 2009) One of my undergraduates has read this paper and has asked me for the specific R code I used to generate these p-values. Regrettably, I can't find the specific code in my notes anymore, and all my attempts at reproducing it have failed (including my attempts to find the tutorial pdf that I used to originally learn this particular way of doing things. Can anyone help me here?
