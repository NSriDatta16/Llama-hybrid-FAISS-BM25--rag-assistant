Why isn't my HTML5 Application Cache working?

i have my setup/code as follows (btw, i am following the nettuts quick tip ) // index.html // cache.manifest CACHE MANIFEST # version 2 index.html style.css scripts.css // httpd.conf (i tried having a local .htaccess too) AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest AddType text/cache-manifest manifest // i have this as its whats shown in the video. anyway even if i remove this it still fails. update : log from Live HTTP Headers @ pastebin http://localhost/cache.manifest GET /cache.manifest HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) FirePHP/0.4 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost/ X-Moz: offline-resource Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 04 Sep 2010 03:14:16 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.16 (Win32) PHP/5.3.3 Last-Modified: Sat, 04 Sep 2010 03:14:09 GMT Etag: "700000000238e-42-48f6670db41b9" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 66 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=94 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/cache-manifest do i see the last line? Content-Type: text/cache-manifest or the 6th Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 . i think it works now, but if i have jquery from the google cdn, it will not work on 2nd refresh, i think it tries to use local files only?
