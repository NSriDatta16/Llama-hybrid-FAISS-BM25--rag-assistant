C#: Drag drop controls on surface

Is there a way that one can make a control, such as a textbox, drag-droppable in C#? I want the user to have the ability to click and hold the control with the mouse and drag it around on its surface and drop it anywhere within that surface. Anyone has any idea how to implement this?
