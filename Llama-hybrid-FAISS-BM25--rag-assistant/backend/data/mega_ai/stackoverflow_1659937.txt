Liferay is a very powerful and popular open source portlet container implementation wich implements both JSR 168 and JSR 286 portlet standards. If offers a plugin-like deployment system. Available new portlets are listed in a marketplace like manner and can be downloaded and installed by clicking a single button. You can drag and drop them after installation on your pages and they are available immediately. By default, Liferay connects to liferay.com portlet repository and displays all portlets available there, but it is very easy to set up your own repository (e.g. corporate) and host portlets on your own. There is an online demo available and you can download and install it in just a few steps.
