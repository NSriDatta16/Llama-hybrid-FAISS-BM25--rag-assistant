It is worth pointing out that your problem of training a classifier to detect $k$ known classes and 1 "unknown" class can be split into a two-step problem. We would like a model to 1) classify a point as being "known" or "unknown" and 2) if "known", classify the point into one of $k$ classes. Since you are apparently familiar with methods to classify things into $k$ classes, your problem has been reduced to classifying points as being "known" or "unknown". This is what is commonly called novelty detection or anomaly detection . For continuous input, a popular method is one-class SVM , which, in some sense, tries to find a "soft" convex hull for the training data. Other methods for anomaly detection abound in time-series and for other types of input.
