IE7 and IE6 have a variety of problems with elements that have both float and clear on them. In IE7, using clear on an element with float only clears the float below other floats floated in the same direction . A modified version of the easyclearing fix may do the trick, but don't get your hopes up. See this page for details: New clearing method needed for IE7? . Bottom line is that you're probably not going to get this to work in IE6/7 without cheating: moving the div down in the text, embedding the divs in paragraphs, etc.
