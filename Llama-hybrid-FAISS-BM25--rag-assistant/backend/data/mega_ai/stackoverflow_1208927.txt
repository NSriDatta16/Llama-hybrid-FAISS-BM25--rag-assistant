Multiple synonym dictionary matches in full-text searching

I am trying to do full-text searching in PostgreSQL 8.3. It worked splendidly, so I added in synonym matching (e.g. 'bob' == 'robert' ) using a synonym dictionary. That works great too. However, I've noticed that it apparently only allows a word to have one synonym. That is, al cannot be albert or allen . Is this correct? Is there any way to have multiple dictionary matches in a PostgreSQL synonym dictionary? For reference, here is my sample dictionary file: bob robert bobby robert al alan al albert al allen And the SQL that creates the full text search config: CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY nickname (TEMPLATE = synonym, SYNONYMS = nickname); CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION dxp_name (COPY = simple); ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION dxp_name ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword WITH nickname, simple;
