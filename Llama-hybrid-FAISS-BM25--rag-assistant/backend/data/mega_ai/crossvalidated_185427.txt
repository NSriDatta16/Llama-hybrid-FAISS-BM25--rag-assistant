Test that score isn't predicted by chance

I have developed machine learning machinery to predict links in an undirected network. For each link I calculated corresponding score which reflect the probability that the link occurs in the network. For example, the dataset looks like: 1 2 0.43 1 3 0.98 2 4 0.05 3 6 0.02 First two numbers designate nodes of the networks and the last number is the prediction score. The prediction score is calculated as Jaccard coefficient which computes the ratio of common neighbors out of all neighbors. Two nodes, $u$ and $v$, are more likely to have a link if they have many common neighbors relative to the total number of neighbors they have. Jaccard index is defined as: $$ s(u,v) = \frac{\vert \Gamma(u) \cap \Gamma (v) \vert}{\vert \Gamma(u) \cup \Gamma (v) \vert} $$ where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ denote number of neighbors. Question: How can I assess the predictive value of particular score? How can I know that the value 0.98 between nodes 1 and 3 isn't just predicted by chance. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.
