Prevent CSS Validation for just 1 line

I have a problem practically identical to this question , but I'm looking for a different solution. Instead of turning it off globally, I'd like to just disable it for a single line. I know I have seen many examples where various techniques are used to suppress different warnings, and I am looking for one that I can put in my CSS to suppress this one. Examples of ways to suppress warnings and such #pragma warning disable 659 or [SuppressMessage("Microsoft.Usage", "CA2214:DoNotCallOverridableMethodsInConstructors", Justification = "I have a good reason.")] . The CSS I want it to be quiet about has some CSS3 stuff in it which is why it's understandably complaining: .round { border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; } So any idea how to make my Error 1 Validation (CSS 2.1): 'border-radius' is not a known CSS property name error go away? I'd rather not lose all of my CSS validations but I do want it to ignore this one "problem".
