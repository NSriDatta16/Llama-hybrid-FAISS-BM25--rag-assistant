Confidence intervals for a ratio of a log-normally distributed variable and a regression estimator

I am studying returns on advertising, here defined as [Customer LifeTime Value]/[Customer Acquisition Cost] . I have obtained values and respective CIs for both variables and now i have to combine them to form a ratio and its CIs. Customer lifetime value is an average of 10k+ observations and it is a log-normally distributed variable . The average Customer acquisition cost is obtained from a GAM regression where 'ad spend' explains changes in Signup volumes. The reciprocal of the regression coefficient 'ad spend' represents Customer acquisition cost. (The GAM regression is as follows: signups = ad spend + 's(controls)', family=nb()) Any ideas of how to obtain the CIs for the ratio? Afaik The EC Fieller method requires the variables to be normally distributed
