There are three ways I know of to do PCA: derived from an eigenvalue decomposition of the correlation matrix, the covariance matrix, or on the unscaled and uncentered data. It sounds like you are passing linalg.eig is working on the unscaled data. Anyway, that is just a guess. A better place for your question is stats.stackexchange.com . The folks on math.stackexchange.com don't use actual numbers. :)
