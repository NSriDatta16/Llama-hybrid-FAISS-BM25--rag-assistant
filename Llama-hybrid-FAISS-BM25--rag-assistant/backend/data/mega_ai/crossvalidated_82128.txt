What would a robust Bayesian model for estimating the scale of a roughly normal distribution be?

There exists a number of robust estimators of scale . A notable example is the median absolute deviation which relates to the standard deviation as $\sigma = \mathrm{MAD}\cdot1.4826$. In a Bayesian framework there exist a number of ways to robustly estimate the location of a roughly normal distribution (say a Normal contaminated by outliers), for example, one could assume the data is distributed as a t distribution or Laplace distribution. Now my question: What would a Bayesian model for measuring the scale of a roughly normal distribution in a robust way be, robust in the same sense as the MAD or similar robust estimators? As is the case with MAD, it would be neat if the Bayesian model could approach the SD of a normal distribution in the case when the distribution of the data actually is normally distributed. edit 1: A typical example of a model that is robust against contamination/outliers when assuming the data $y_i$ is roughly normal is using a t distribution like: $$y_i \sim \mathrm{t}(m, s,\nu)$$ Where $m$ is the mean, $s$ is the scale, and $\nu$ is the degree-of-freedom. With suitable priors on $m, s$ and $\nu$, $m$ will be an estimate of the mean of $y_i$ that will be robust against outliers. However, $s$ will not be a consistent estimate of the SD of $y_i$ as $s$ depends on $\nu$. For example, if $\nu$ would be fixed to 4.0 and the model above would be fitted to a huge number of samples from a $\mathrm{Norm}(\mu=0,\sigma=1)$ distribution then $s$ would be around 0.82. What I'm looking for is a model which is robust, like the t model, but for the SD instead of (or in addition to) the mean. edit 2: Here follows a coded example in R and JAGS of how the t-model mentioned above is more robust with respect to the mean. # generating some contaminated data y
