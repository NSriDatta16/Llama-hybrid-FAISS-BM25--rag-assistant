Scalability design question - master/slave databases

I just finished a database layer based on redis that offers to select between multiple databases, but I have no experience by myself on what should be common sense to do. Reliability is my biggest focus. How is writes and reads commonly organised in applications where both a slave and a master database is available? How do the big guys pull it off?
