My current project is at about 60% unit test coverage and all user stories have happy-day coverage of user stories in selenium tests, some have additional coverage. We're continually discussing this: Is there really any point of pushing unit-test coverage of increasingly absurd scenarios for much higher coverage ? The argument is that expanding selenium tests increases test coverage on things that have business value. Does the customer really care about unit test corner cases that may fail? When you get good at selenium testing, the cost of writing new tests with business value decreases. For us they're just as simple as unit tests. The run-time cost is another issue. We have a small cluster of boxes running these tests all of the time. So we tends to favour web-tests more, probably because we've gotten good at writing them and they provide undeniable business value.
