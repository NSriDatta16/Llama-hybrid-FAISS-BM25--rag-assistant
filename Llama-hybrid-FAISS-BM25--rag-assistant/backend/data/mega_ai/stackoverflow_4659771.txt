How to share POM fragments between different POMs

I am currently struggling with Maven: I have a complex project made of several nested modules and for some of those modules, I have similar configurations in the POMs. I would like to make it clean. Actually, I would like to define a "runnable-jar" common configuration and activate it in some modules. Here is the POM fragment I would like to share between several projects: maven-assembly-plugin src/main/assembly/runnable-jar-assembly.xml ${mainClass} make-runnable-jar package single In some of the POMS, I would like to be able to do something like: my.main.Class src/main/pom/runnable-jar-pom.xml I have searched for a mean to import some XML fragments into a POM, or to define a whole XML nodeset macro. For what I have found, the closest solution would be to define a profile in the parent POM and activate it in some sub modules by testing the presence of a file. See this related question . But I am facing the problem of the {basedir} property not being set correctly inherited / set. I find it very surprising to need a hack to do something so basic (=usual). How do you usually handle this in Maven ?
