iPhone SDK 3.1?

I downloaded iPhone SDK 3.1 with Xcode 3.2 for Snow Leopard from Apple, but when I go to install it, it says it's installing iPhone SDK 3.0. How can I find iPhone SDK 3.1? I can't get any apps on my phone until I upgrade my SDK because my iPhone is on 3.1. In the Organizer it says the OS installed on my phone is 3.1 (7C114) and the XCode supported iPhone OS versions are 3.0 (7A341) and the older ones. I've downloaded the package from Apple twice now, but both times the package only indicates it is installing iPhone 3.0. Is there a way to find the 3.1SDK separately? Thank you, Elisabeth
