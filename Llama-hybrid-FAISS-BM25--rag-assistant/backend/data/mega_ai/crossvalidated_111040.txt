Logistic regression: Trying to use mean logit as reference group

Question I would like to do a logistic regression where the independent variables are compared to the mean logit, rather than the logit being compared a certain reference group. Example The example below results in the logit of am==1 is being compared to carb==1 (the reference group): glm( am==1 ~ factor(carb), data = mtcars, family = binomial ) Is it possible (and does it make sense?) to compare the logit of am==1, to the mean logit, instead of comparing it to carb==1 Hope this makes sense :)
