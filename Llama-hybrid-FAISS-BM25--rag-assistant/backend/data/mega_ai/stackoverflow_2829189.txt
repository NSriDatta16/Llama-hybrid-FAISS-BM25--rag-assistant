While I understand the spirit of the question (and only the spirit), the relation between project A and project B is still unclear so I'm not sure of the best way to implement this. Here are the options. First solution: leverage transitive dependencies . There are some rules about them, but basically, if you declare a dependency on Project B in Project A, you'll get some of its dependencies transitively. Second solution: use inheritance. Third option: use another project of type pom to group the dependencies and declare a dependency on this pom.
