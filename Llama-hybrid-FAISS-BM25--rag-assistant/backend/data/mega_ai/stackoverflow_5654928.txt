This uses the shingle idea from Lattice graphics and so leverages code from package lattice to generate the intervals and then uses a loop to break the original DF into the correct subsets. I wasn't exactly sure what is meant by overlap = 1 - I presume you meant overlap by 1 sample/observation. If so, the code below does this. OverlapSplit Which gives: > OverlapSplit(DF, 2, 2) [[1]] x y 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c 4 4 d 5 5 e 6 6 a [[2]] x y 5 5 e 6 6 a 7 7 b 8 8 c 9 9 d 10 10 e > OverlapSplit(DF) [[1]] x y 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c 4 4 d 5 5 e 6 6 a 7 7 b 8 8 c 9 9 d 10 10 e > OverlapSplit(DF, 4, 1) [[1]] x y 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c [[2]] x y 3 3 c 4 4 d 5 5 e [[3]] x y 6 6 a 7 7 b 8 8 c [[4]] x y 8 8 c 9 9 d 10 10 e
