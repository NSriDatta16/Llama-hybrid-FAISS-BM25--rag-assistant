using random forest for missing data imputation in categorical variables ( in R)

I have following type of associated data. The following example step to generate associated variable. p number of variables and n is number of observations. p = 500 n = 200 mat The above data is complete, but in real dataset I have missing values (which are randomly distributed within each variables). I would like to predict them using random forest (or any other appropriate algorithms). Let's randomly put 10% missing values (the approximate number of variables) to the above data. rowind How can do this and what issues I need to think up in doing so - considering categorical variables , number of observations and variables ? Edit: As all variables are correlated and none are response (but can serve as response) while prediction. for example mat[,1] missing value prediction can be based on rest of variables, mat[,2] prediction can be based on prediction of rest of variables. So the objective here is prediction all missing values in all variables (all of them are categorical). Edit 2 I am interested in multiple imputation of this data so that I can perform other analysis that requires complete dataset without missing value.
