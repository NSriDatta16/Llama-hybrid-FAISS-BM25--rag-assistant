There are books on the topic. It is different because these are adaptive systems and so they can change themselves. While they could be stable currently, it does not mean they will not observe data that makes them unstable. See the following for examples: Guidance for the Verification and Validation of Neural Networks by Laura L. Pullum, Brian J. Taylor, Marjorie A. Darrah Independent Verification and Validation of Neural Networks - Developing Practitioner Assistance By Dr. Laura L. Pullum, Dr. Marjorie A. Darrah, and Mr. Brian J.
