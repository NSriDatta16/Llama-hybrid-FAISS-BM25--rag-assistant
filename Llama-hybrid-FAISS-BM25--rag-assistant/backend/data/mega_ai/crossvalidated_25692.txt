I can sign under what Dirk and EpiGrad said; yet there is one more thing that makes R an unique lang in its niche -- data-oriented type system. R's was especially designed for handling data, that's why it is vector-centered and has stuff like data.frames, factors, NAs and attributes. Julia's types are on the other hand numerical-performance-oriented, thus we have scalars, well defined storage modes, unions and structs. This may look benign, but everyone that has ever try to do stats with MATLAB knows that it really hurts. So, at least for me, Julia can't offer anything which I cannot fix with a few-line C chunk and kills a lot of really useful expressiveness.
