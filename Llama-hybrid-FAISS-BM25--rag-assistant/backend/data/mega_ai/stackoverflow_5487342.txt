I think that'd be ok. As long as the files aren't massive in number/size it should perform quite well. The other approach you could try if you decide you're not happy with performance, or want to maintain less code, is to use App storage, which persists data beyond app sessions. Titanium.App.setString('jsonResponse', this.responseText); Titanium.App.setInt('expires', this.responseText.expires); Then before you make your request you can check if the cache is indeed stale: var expires = Titanium.App.getInt('expires'); // Get the current time in milliseconds, etc. if(expires > current_time) { // Cache is still valid var response = Titanium.App.getString('jsonResponse'); var obj = JSON.parse(response); } else { // Cache is stale - query for new data }
