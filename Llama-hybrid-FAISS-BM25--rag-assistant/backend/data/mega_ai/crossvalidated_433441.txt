How to use an Autoencoder for anomaly detection?

I would like to use an Autoencoder for anomaly detection and I wonder how to detect them basically. This is a general question but also related to an implementation as I use time series data. That's why I think I have to use a rolling window but when I want to detect trends I think I will extend my model with a LSTM with which a rolling window makes no sense(?). Nevertheless, to detect anomalies it is common to use the reconstruction error - but how do I do that? I cut the model into halves (encoder and decoder) and use only the decoder for the reconstruction. But I have to train the model all the time, right? Atm my training data contains data of three months in hourly steps. And test data is one month.
