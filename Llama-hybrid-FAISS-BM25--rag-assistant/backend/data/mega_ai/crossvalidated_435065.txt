time series decomposition - remove seasonality

I have some time series data and I apply the decompose function in R to obtain the following output. I remove the seasonality by running the following: orig - decomp$seasonal My question is, what data should I take away from this plot? Say I have a multivariate time series problem. Say I am trying to predict Passenger demand at airport X, but I also use as input the time series passenger demand from airport Y and Z. So in order to predict X I feed in Y and Z time series also. Each airports demand has a seasonal pattern which I need to correct for. I should decompose the seasonality from all X, Y, Z airports and then in order to predict X I should give as inputs the removed seasonality from Y and Z? or should I give the model all of the decomposed components - seasonality, trend and random... Second after removing the seasonality in the plot the random part still (to me) seems to have some "information" or seasonalityâ€¦ That is, it doesn't look completely "random". What can I do here?
