java wait for dialog to be closed

i have a small program where an element is draged and dropped, when the drop is performed i open a dialog (extends Jframe) where some text should be entered. The Problem is, that i want to wait for this dialog to be closed (actually the ok button to be pressed so i can read out the data from the textfield), than analyse what the user has entered and based on that i will decide if the drop is rejected or allowed. public void drop(DropTargetDropEvent e) { try{ //popup Popup p = new Popup(); p.setParmeter("enter a new name: "); p.setVisible(true); //programm wont wait before the user has pressed ok in the popup System.out.println("value: " + p.getValue()); repaint(); } else { e.rejectDrop(); } } I hope you get the idea. Popup is a dialog extended from a JFrame. The problem is, that p.getValue() is executed before the User gets to press the ok button. I tried using a boolean variable and a loop to check if something was entered in the popup but it doesnt work, the dialog is desplayed but there is not textfield or ok button, so the only thing i can do is to kill it. I'm pretty new to gui's so i really would appreciate the help. Thanks in advance.
