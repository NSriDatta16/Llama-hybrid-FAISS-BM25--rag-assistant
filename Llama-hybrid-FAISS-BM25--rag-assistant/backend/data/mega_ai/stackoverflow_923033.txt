How to track task execution statistics using an ExecutorService?

I'm firing off tasks using an ExecutorService, dispatching tasks that need to be grouped by task-specific criteria: Task[type=a] Task[type=b] Task[type=a] ... Periodically I want to output the average length of time that each task took (grouped by type ) along with statistical information such as mean/median and standard deviation. This needs to be pretty fast, of course, and ideally should not cause the various threads to synchronize when they report statistics. What's a good architecture for doing this?
