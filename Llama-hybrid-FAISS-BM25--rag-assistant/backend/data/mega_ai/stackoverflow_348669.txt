TFS 08 - Can't find AgentService.asmx

We have a notification service running on our TFS server which automatically modifies certain work items when they are created so they are assigned to the right people and so on. Over the weekend a patch was applied to our TFS server and since then the notification service appears to be broken. When ever it runs we get an error in the Event Viewer which indicates there was a problem accessing http:// :8080/Build/v2.0/AgentService.asmx . I've looked in the folder which IIS maps Build to, and it's true, AgentService.asmx does not exist. Does anyone know where that file may get moved to?
