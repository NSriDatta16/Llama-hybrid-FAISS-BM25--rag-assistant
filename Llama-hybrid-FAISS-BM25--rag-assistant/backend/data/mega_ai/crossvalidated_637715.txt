Simple mediation analysis in PROCESS 4.2 in SPSS. The outcome variable is binary, the mediator is continuous and the IV is binary

In the first model, the IV (X) significantly predicts the mediator (M). In the second model, the mediator significantly predicts the outcome variable (Y) but the IV (X) does not predict the outcome variable (Y). In the third model, the direct effect of X on Y is non-significant. The indirect effect of X on Y is significant. EDIT EDIT In the old times of the Sobel Test, the first regression model would show a significant relationship between the IV and the outcome. Then, in the next model, when the mediator was added, it could be seen if the IV's effect decreased as a result of this and whether its effect was still significant. This would show us whether there was mediation and if it was partial or complete. PROCESS does not show this first IV and outcome relationship. PROCESS also does not compute a total effect when the outcome is binary. So I went back to the old times and ran a logistic regression for this relationship. I ran a linear regression for the IV to mediator relationship. And then I ran another logistic regression adding both the IV and the mediator as predictors of the binary outcome. Then I did a Sobel Test. However, I was told that a Sobel Test can only be done with an outcome which is continuous. I am baffled by this as I have seen a published paper which did exactly what I did above on a binary outcome.
