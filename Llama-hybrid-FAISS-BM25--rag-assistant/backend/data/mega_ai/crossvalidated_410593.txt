Write your own simulator ..there is no bias there as it is all you ! . I suggest that you inject anomalies (an example of a Gaussian Violation that needs attention ) to test the robustness of your candidate models. Take a look at Commonly used example data sets for challenging ways to create realistic data that nearly often defeats simple model-based approaches as compared to data-based approaches which evolve the model from the data.
