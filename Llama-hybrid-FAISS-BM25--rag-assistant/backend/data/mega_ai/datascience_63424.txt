This problem is known as "style transfer" , and deep learning can achieve some pretty amazing results. Here's a fantastic GitHub repo with an easy-to-use implementation of neural style transfer ( usage instructions ). I think you'll have better luck using a pre-built model like this rather than training your own. If you want to train your own, this repo might be a good starting point. It has a training script included, you'll just need a bunch of training images and a style image.
