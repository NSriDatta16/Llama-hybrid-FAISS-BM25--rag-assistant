Logistic regression for classification?

I have a dataset with most columns having Boolean values and categorical values. A sample of it is: Name Country approved political bbc.com US true True stackoverflow.com US true False Number.com US False False ... Based of values above, I would like to determine if other websites have been approved or not. My questions are: does any heat/correlation map/matrix sense with categorical variables? Would it be possible to predict if a website is approved or not (target variable), using caterogical values? Is there any other model that should be preferable? Thanks
