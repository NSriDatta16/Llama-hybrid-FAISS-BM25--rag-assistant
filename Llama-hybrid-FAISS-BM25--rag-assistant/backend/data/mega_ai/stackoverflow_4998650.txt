If a Perl hash handles your data needs, you probably don't need the overhead of a full blown SQL database. There are a lot of storage alternatives for key->value storage such as the Berkley DB and the entire "NOSQL" movement. Google those and you'll find lots of info. Perl interfaces exist in CPAN for many of these.
