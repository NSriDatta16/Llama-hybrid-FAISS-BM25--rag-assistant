right-click the sql agent job, click properties, go to notifications. Set up an operator witht he appropriate email and then select email, select the operator, and then when the job fails. click ok and you should be good to go. note that this solution will only take care of one sql server agent job (each sub plan for a maintenance plan). so you'll have to set up the notification on each part of the subplan (if you have multiple subplans). How to create an operator.
