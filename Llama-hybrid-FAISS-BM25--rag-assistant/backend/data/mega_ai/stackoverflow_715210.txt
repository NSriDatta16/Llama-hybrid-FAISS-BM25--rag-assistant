In ASP.NET: Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddDays(1)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(true); This is to say, not that an ASP Solution is the best, but rather that IIS obeys the caching directives, an may opt to cache in RAM. However, I believe you can signal IIS to cache a single file in the IIS management snap-in, if ASP/ASP.NET is not an option, by setting the content expiration 1 or more days in the future.
