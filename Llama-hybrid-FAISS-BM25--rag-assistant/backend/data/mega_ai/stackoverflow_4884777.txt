JavaScript Popup Window - Restrict resize arrows

I've created a JavaScript popup window, that pops up perfectly and as how I would like it to be. But the customer I've built it for does not want the window to be resized as in the drag resize. This also made me want to prevent the maximize and minimize buttons from appearing within the window also, Only if possible. I'm not too bothered if you cant do that. I'm more concerned with the user resize. My code is : function popUp(URL) { day = new Date(); id = day.getTime(); eval("page" + id + " = window.open(URL, '" + id + "', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=1600,height=900' );"); } Many Thanks in advance :)
