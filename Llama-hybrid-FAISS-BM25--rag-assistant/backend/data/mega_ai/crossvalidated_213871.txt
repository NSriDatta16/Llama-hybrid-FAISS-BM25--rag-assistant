Can someone confirm that the error is autocorrelated? Clearly, there are a number of statistically significant autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations. The bars that stick out of the confidence interval (the dashed line) are statistically significant for the given significance level. If so, how to find the order of $p$, $d$ and $q$? Consider your residuals to be a new time series and then refer to the methodology of identifying the orders of ARIMA model (there are plenty of threads on that here and there are also multiple online tutorials). Can I use gls to build a better model? Generalized least squares (GLS) could work if your errors follow a finite-order autoregressive process (Hayashi "Econometrics", 2000, bottom of p. 416), but GLS would be inconsistent if the error is not strictly exogenous but merely predetermined (Hayashi "Econometrics", 2000, p. 58-59 and 415-416). So using GLS in your case seems a bit risky. But you could very well try regression with ARMA errors using the function arima or auto.arima and supplying all of your regressors in the argument xreg . If you used auto.arima , you would not even have to care about the lag orders as they would be selected automatically. Of course, you should do some model diagnostics afterwards to see if the model specification is adequente in light of the data.
