(Updated.) As others have noted, if there are no other allocations in between reallocs, then no copying is needed. Also as others have noted, the risk of memory copying lessens (but also its impact of course) for very small blocks, smaller than a page. Also, if all you ever do in your test is to allocate new memory space, I am not very surprised you see little difference, since the syscalls to allocate memory are probably taking most of the time. Instead, choose your data structures depending on how you want to actually use them. A framebuffer is for instance probably best represented by a contiguous array. A linked list is probably better if you have to reorganise or sort data within the structure quickly. Then these operations will be more or less efficient depending on what you want to do. (Thanks for the comments below, I was initially confused myself about how these things work.)
