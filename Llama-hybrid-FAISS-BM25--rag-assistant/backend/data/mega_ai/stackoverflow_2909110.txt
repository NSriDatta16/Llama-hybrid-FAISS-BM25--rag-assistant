firefox, jQuery ajax calls firing twice and never triggering success or error functions

I am developing with the .NET framework, using jQuery 1.4.2 client side. When developing in Firefox version 3.6, every so often an one of the many ajax calls I make on the page will fire twice, the second will return successfully but will not trigger the success handler of the ajax call and the first never returns anything. So basically the data is all sent to the server and response is sent down but nothing happens with the response. Here is an example of the call I am making. It happens to any of the ajax calls, so there is not one particular that is causing the problem: $.ajax({ type:"POST", contentType : "application/json; charset=utf-8", data:"{}", dataType:"json", success:function(){ alert('success'); }, error:function(){ alert('error'); }, url:'/services.aspx/somemethod' }); }) From firebug, here are the headers of the first call which in firebug shows as never completely responding, meaning i see no response code and the loader gif in the firebug never goes away. Note:In firebug it usually says Response Header but for the first call this space is blank Server ASP.NET Development Server/9.0.0.0 X-AspNet-Version 2.0.50727 Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8 Connection Close Request Headers Host mydomain.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept application/json, text/javascript, */* Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8 X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest Referer http://mydomain.com/mypage.aspx Here is the header from the second request which just appear to complete in firebug (i.e response is 200): Response Header Server ASP.NET Development Server/9.0.0.0 X-AspNet-Version 2.0.50727 Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8 Connection Close Request Headers Host mydomain.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8 Referer http://mydomain.com/mypage.aspx To summarize my question, why are two requests being made and why are neither of them triggering a success or error handler in the ajax call. I have seen this article about firefox 3.5+ and preflighted requests https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control#Preflighted_requests In the article is says if a "POST" is made with any other content type than "application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain" than the request is pre-flighted. If this is the case, this should happen to all of my calls. Thanks
