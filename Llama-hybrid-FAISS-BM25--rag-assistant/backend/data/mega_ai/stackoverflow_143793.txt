How do you Serialize ScriptObjects to JSON to save in Silverlight Isolated Storage?

According to this article Silverlight 2 Beta 2 supports the DataContractJsonSerializer object. But, when I try to use it VS says "Type 'DataContractJsonSerializer' is not defined". I have a method marked as ScriptableMember that gets called from JavaScript and is passed an Object. Inside this method I need to serialize the object to a string (preferably JSON) and then save it in isolated storage. Does Silverlight 2 Beta 2 really support DataContractJsonSerializer? Or would anyone recommend a different method of saving the JavaScript created ScriptObject in the Isolated Storage?
