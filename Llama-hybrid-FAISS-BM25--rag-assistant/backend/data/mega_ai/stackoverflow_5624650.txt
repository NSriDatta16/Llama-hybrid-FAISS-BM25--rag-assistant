Every part of code that do some graphical stuff (drawing border, setting style, drag & drop management, animations, ...), should be included in the view, not the presentation model. For this kind of graphical that stuff should be executed after a property has been changed in the PM, we use the Cairngorm 3 Observer lib. Basically, it listens to some changes in the presentation model and allows you to execute a function in the View. See the documentation
