TcpClient c; //I want to check here if port is free. c = new TcpClient(ip, port); ...how can I first check if a certain port is free on my machine? I mean that it is not in use by any other application. If an application is using a port others can't use it until it becomes free. â€“ Ali You have misunderstood what's happening here. TcpClient(...) parameters are of server ip and server port you wish to connect to. The TcpClient selects a transient local port from the available pool to communicate to the server. There's no need to check for the availability of the local port as it is automatically handled by the winsock layer. In case you can't connect to the server using the above code fragment, the problem could be one or more of several. (i.e. server ip and/or port is wrong, remote server not available, etc..)
