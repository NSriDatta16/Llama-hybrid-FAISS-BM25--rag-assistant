How to train a Recurrent Neural Network for Temporal XOR?

I have coded a Elman RNN using BackPropagation Through Time. In order to check my implementation, I have chosen Temporal XOR(a sequence of binary digits with the third being the xor of previous two and the rest random). I have questions regarding how to train the model for this input. I am confused with the following strategies, Should I give input $x_i$, and ask it to predict the next number in the sequence $x_{i+1}$ and do the error backpropagation Should I give input $x_i$ ask it predict $x_{i+1}$, and $x_{i+1}$ ask it predict $x_{i+2}$ and then perform error backpropagation Should I give a sequence of $t$ inputs i.e, $x_i,\ldots,x_t$ and ask it to predict $x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{t+1}$ and then perform error backpropagation Could anyone please help me find the right training strategy? Also, if there are other sample problems like XOR for MLP, please suggest me.
