It doesnt matter if you use vmware or a real mac, as long as the xcode organizer recognizes the device when you attach it to an usb port. To deploy an application on a real device you need developer certificates from apple. (You need to pay the $99 to them to be a registered iphone developer to get them). You can then register your device at developer.apple.com and you can run applications on it which you have signed with your certificate. If the device is jailbroken it can be done without proper certificates, but I have never done that.
