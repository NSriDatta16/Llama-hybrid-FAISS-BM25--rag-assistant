Roll up, Roll up, get them while they're hot! Masters, the Google-fu is strong in this one! Can't say I wrote this (I do plan on having CMake scripts for both iPhone SQLite and Spatialite, sometime real soon), but I suggest you get yourselves over to this site , before 404: http://lionel.gueganton.free.fr/spatialite/ go download you some goodies, including pre-compiled Spatialite + extensions 2.3.1 binaries!!!. There is an SQLite-on-OSX Cmake script (originally found here ), which, with probably little work, should be re-targetable at SQLite-iPhone builds (I'll do it, just as soon as I get the time). This should allow you to use the latest SQLite version (I've read that the Apple-included version is slightly crippled). Then, supposedly, you just have to reference the new header files in a local manner, i.e. using quotes (e.g. "sqllitexxx.h") instead of using angle brackets: ( ) So, do I get those juicy points ;-) ? Cheers Big Rich
