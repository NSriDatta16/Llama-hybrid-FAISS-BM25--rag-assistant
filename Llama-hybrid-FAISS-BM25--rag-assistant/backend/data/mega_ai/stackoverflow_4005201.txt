You could use PackageManager to get the ApplicationInfo, and from there check the "flags" for FLAG_EXTERNAL_STORAGE . Here's a quick example I made to demonstrate: @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); PackageManager pm = getPackageManager(); try { PackageInfo pi = pm.getPackageInfo("com.totsp.helloworld", 0); ApplicationInfo ai = pi.applicationInfo; // this only works on API level 8 and higher (check that first) Toast .makeText( this, "Value of FLAG_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:" + ((ai.flags & ApplicationInfo.FLAG_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) == ApplicationInfo.FLAG_EXTERNAL_STORAGE), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); } catch (NameNotFoundException e) { // do something } } Still, depending on your situation (whether or not you have all the "media" up front, or the user gets/creates it as they use the app), you may want to put it on the external storage regardless. A large size internal app is frowned upon by many users (and a lot of internal media would probably make it huge).
