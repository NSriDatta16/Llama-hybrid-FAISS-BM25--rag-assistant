While it's technically possible, it's not a very friendly solution within Visual Studio. It will be fighting you the entire time. I recommend you take a look at NAnt . It's a very robust build system where you can do basically anything you need to. Our NAnt script does this on every build: Migrate the database to the latest version Generate C# entities off of the database Compile every project in our "master" solution Run all unit tests Run all integration tests Additionally, our build server leverages this and adds 1 more task, which is generating Sandcastle documentation. If you don't like XML, you might also take a look at Rake (ruby), Bake/BooBuildSystem (Boo), or Psake (PowerShell)
