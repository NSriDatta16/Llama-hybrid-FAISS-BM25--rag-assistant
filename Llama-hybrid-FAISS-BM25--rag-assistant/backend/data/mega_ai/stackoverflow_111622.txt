I do not use any prefix at all. If I run into danger of mixing up local variables or method parameters with class members, then either the method or the class is too long and benefits from splitting up . This (arguably) not only makes the code more readable and somewhat "fluent", but most importantly encourages well structured classes and methods . In the end, it thus boils down to a completely different issue than the prefix or no-prefix dillema. UPDATE: well, taste and preferences change, don't they.. I now use underscore as the prefix for member variables as it has proven to be beneficial in recognizing local and member variables in the long run. Especially new team members sometimes have hard time when the two are not easily recognizable.
