Silverlight. Fix needed. Dragging stack panel item to the right moves it underneath other items

I have stack panel with custom controls in it. I attach standard MouseDragElementBehavior to each item. When I drag to the right the item moves underneath the other items. What would be a viable solution to create better user experience - to show better visual cue - how the item moves and where is it going to be dropped.
