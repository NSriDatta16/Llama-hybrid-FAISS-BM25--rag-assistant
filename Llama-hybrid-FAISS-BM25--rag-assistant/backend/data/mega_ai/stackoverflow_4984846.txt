I couldn't find an elegant solution. Here is a jsFiddle with a working solution: http://jsfiddle.net/rcravens/pAcDE/ Given the following element: Bob Cravens I have this CSS: #elem:before{ content: ''; height: 160px; width: 136px; background: url('http://bobcravens.com/Content/images/author_thumb.png'); position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; } #elem{ background-color: red; margin: 60px 136px; } The :before is probably what you have except for the 'position: absolute' style. Then I used a margin to offset the original div. Hope this helps. Bob
