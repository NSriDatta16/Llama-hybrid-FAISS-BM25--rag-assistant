Propensity Modeling for Retail Marketing: Model Adjustments Based on Consumer Life Changes.

I built a predictive model using logistic regression for direct marking creatives. I built a “children’s” model which predicts buying behavior for those that purchase boys, girls and baby apparel. But one may have a high propensity right now to buy baby clothes but in 12 months, when ones kid is a toddler, their propensity drops for baby and increases for Girls/Boys. I’ve been trying to brainstorm ways to take into account that scenario. My question is, can anyone suggest options for adjustments to the model to based on that additional criteria?
