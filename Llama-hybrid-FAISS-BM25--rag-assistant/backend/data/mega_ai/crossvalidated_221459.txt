How to calculate average EER and ROC?

If I test a system on 3 users and I obtain FARs and FRRs for thresholds and an EER for each user, how do I obtain an average EER and plot a ROC? As I see it, I could average the 3 EERs I have obtained OR I could average the sets of FARS and FRRs and calculate a new EER on those. Also, when plotting an average ROC curve, would this take the form of averaging the sets of FARS and FRRs, or an alternate method?
