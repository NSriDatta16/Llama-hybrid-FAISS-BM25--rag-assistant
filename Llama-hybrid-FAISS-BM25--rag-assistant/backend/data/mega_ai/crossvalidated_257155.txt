I think about SEMs like this: You start with a null model, which has a bunch of degrees of freedom. Every time you estimate a parameter, you 'spend' a degree of freedom. The fewer degrees of freedom you spend (everything else being equal) the better. Every time you spend a degree of freedom, your chi-square will go down. Modification indices tell you which parameters to free - but you've freed all the parameters already, so there are no modification indices. Your model has zero degrees of freedom. You've spent all of the degrees of freedom, and your df and chi-square are zero. Your chi-square can't go down any more, and you can't spend any more df (you've got none left). Another way to say this is that your model is saturated. This model is a regression model - you could have obtained the same result doing ordinal logistic regression.
