I think the best way is not to use sortable('serialize') at all, but use jQuery to simply iterate over the sorted ids, like so: order = []; $('ul').children('li').each(function(idx, elm) { order.push(elm.id.split('_')[1]) }); $.get('ajax.php', {action: 'updateOrder', 'order[]': order}); This has an advantage over explicitly appending the serialized sortable to the URL (or a parameter) in that it doesn't include the order[] parameter at all if there are no li in the list. (When I had this problem I was using sortable(connectWith: 'ul') so it was entirely possible for a user to drag all the li from one list). In contrast appending the serialized sortable would leave an unwanted '&'.
