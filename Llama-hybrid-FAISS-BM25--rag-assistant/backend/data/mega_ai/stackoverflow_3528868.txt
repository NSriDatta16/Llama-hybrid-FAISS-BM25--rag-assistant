If each part is an UIImageView you can create your own class that subclasses it and overrid the methods: touchesBegan:withEvent: touchesMoved:withEvent: touchesEnded:withEvent: to get the touch input for each view and then send it to a controller to manage it with the information of which kind of piece has been touched. But this suppose that the UIImageViews are not overlapping, in that case only the frontmost will receive the touch. In this case you can associate a vectorial representation to each piece of item and have just one UIView intercepting all touches that checks in which particular 'shape' the point of the touch falls. (You'd have to change coordinates from the frontmost view to the single UIImageViews)
