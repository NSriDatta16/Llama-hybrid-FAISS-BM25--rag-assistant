Models for a discrete numerical response with only 5 distinct values

I have a response variable that takes on only 5 distinct values: -15, -5, 0, 5, 15. These values are obtained in a clearly categorical manner, meaning: if event A happens, then the outcome is 5, if event B happens, then the outcome is -15, etc... So the eventual response value for a certain observation isn't a result of some cumulative counting, but rather a pure assignment of a numerical value to a categorical outcome. With that being said, there's a clear ordering and a clearly defined distance between the numerical values being assigned to different categories, and that distance properly reflects the difference in their inherent values (unlike in some other cases of ordinal data, where only the order is known, but not necessarily the distance between the categories). Last note is that the marginal distribution of the response values is heavily asymmetrical here: the negative values (-5, -15) are much rarer than the non-negative ones, with 0 being the most frequent value by far, and 15 is the 2nd, and 5 is a distant 3rd: My question is: what kind of modeling approaches exist out there for such a response type? Would it be the generalized ordered logit model , where I'd focus on modeling the probabilities of each distinct value, rather than modeling the value directly? But if so, could it account for the known distances between the categories? Or maybe there might be a Bayesian approach that allows modeling an expected value of an arbitrary discrete variable with 5 numerical values (based on each category's probability and designated value)? PS : I have already tried a variety of classic linear regression techniques with a continuous response assumption, and the fit diagnostics are quite terrible, as expected. I'm attaching diagnostic plots from fitting a thin-plate spline regression with multiple predictors.
