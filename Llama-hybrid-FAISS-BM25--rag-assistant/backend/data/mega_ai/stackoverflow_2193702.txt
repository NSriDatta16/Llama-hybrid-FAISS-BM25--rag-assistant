All the above answers have good points to listen to. Hopefully this will just be in addition. The bottom line is that it takes practice. Definitely don't take on the people that think they're perfect or don't need much growth. I think I'm a pretty good programmer but I can see many, many opportunities for growth. Rely on the wisdom and experience from other programmers. Give them some good reading materials with sections that are highlighted as to how they address or impact your organization. It's much easier to "WANT" to get better if the importance of getting better is known. The support to make mistakes and grow is present and the goals are clear and attainable.
