Is it possible for one WCF session to throw an exception in another session?

if an administrator logs on to my service, he may wish to disconnect sessions which meet (or don't meet) certain requirements, be it automated or manual. throwing exceptions seems like a simple and effective solution, as all resources are released. i could use a local bool field which, if true, would disconnect this user the next time he calls any of the methods, but that doesn't seem like an elegant solution. and, it doesn't have to be throwing exception, as i've already noticed you can use OperationContext.Current.Channel.Close(), or abort, to disable access to that session. is there a "standard" way to do this in wcf?
