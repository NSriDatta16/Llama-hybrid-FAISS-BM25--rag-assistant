That sounds difficult. I don't understand why 32000 - is mysql refusing to create more databases than that? What error do you get? Seems arbitrary - maybe this is a config variable that can be changed? A few possibilities. You could run more than one mysql server , each with a different data directory. I don't think it would help, but you might look into the NDB storage engine, it can handle tablespaces which just might let you store data in multiple locations.
