I think the common practice in such a case is visually inspecting the data. Check whether you have outrageous outliers and make a qq-plot (normal probability plot). Here is an example from Wikipedia: If your variable is normal, all sample will fall almost on a straight line. In any case, with 18 samples, unless your variables are really skewed or log-normal you will most likely not be able to see a clear picture. Some people discourage from using tests of normality. You see, with enough samples, you will almost always be able to reject the null hypothesis -- even tiny deviations will show. With just a few samples, even huge deviations will not be statistically significant. As for using correlation instead of regression: I think this is the case where dependent / independent variables are very clearly defined, so regression is the correct solution.
