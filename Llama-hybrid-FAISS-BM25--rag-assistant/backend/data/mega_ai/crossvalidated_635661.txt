You've set up the problem to preserve the teams' historical win probabilities in the final result, but with $p_1 \not = 1 - p_2$ this is impossible. If two teams with such high win probabilities play a series with each other, one or both of them must do worse than their historical average. The thing to remember is that the choice of copula does not affect the margins at all. If you specify margins of Bernoulli(0.9) and Bernoulli(0.8), then you're going to get (on average) 90% and 80% wins, respectively. All the copula is going to do is determine how they get paired up. Because you chose a countermonotone copula, the losses, when they occur, will always get paired up with wins for the other team (that's why you never see a (0,0) result), but you haven't allowed enough losses for either team to avoid some wins getting paired up with other wins. More importantly, copulas aren't the right tool to use for a problem like this because you really only have a single random variable. That is, $x_1$ and $x_2$ aren't merely correlated; they are one and the same, with one of them simply in disguise. Copulas aren't meant to handle scenarios like that. It turns out that it sort of works for continuous variables, but as you can see, it falls apart for discrete variables.
