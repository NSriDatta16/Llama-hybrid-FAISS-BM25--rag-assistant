There are several ways to do this, but the one I use most is to use a routing key that is unique to the type of message. Consumers, then, bind to that exchange using a specific routing key, which causes messages to go only to those consumers.

The routing keys and exchanges are powerful tools made specifically for routing messages. You should leverage that.
