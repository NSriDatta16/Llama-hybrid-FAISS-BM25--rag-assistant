Optimum number of folds in a $k$-fold cross-validation on a logistic regression

I want to perform a $k$-fold cross-validation on a logistic regression analysis. I had initially considered the number of $k=10$ folds, as it is said to be somehow optimal. However, I am not sure $10$ is the best in my case. Maybe something $k=5$ would make more sense. This is my concrete situation: Total sample size $n=115$. Variable to predict: 35 NO vs 80 YES (target category). So, in each of the $10$ folds, there would be just about 3 NO against 8 YES. Each fold acts as a validation set of the model built using the other $115-11=104$ cases as the training set. A validation set with just $11$ cases seems a bit strange to me. So, what would be an appropriate value for $k$, in my case? In other words, what would be the minimum desirable value for the validation sample size, in a cross-validation strategy?
