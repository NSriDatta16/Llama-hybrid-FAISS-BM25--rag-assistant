Well, the periodogram after taking first differences doesn't indicate any clear periodicity. However, be aware that taking first differences amplifies high-frequency components, which should appear in the power spectrum as a quadratic trend, and in the log-power spectrum as a log-shaped trend (which is roughly compatible with what we see here). My recommendations: – First compute the periodogram without any preprocessing. – Then, remove the linear trend, but not by using first differences but by fitting a line by regression and subtracting the result from the data (there should also be a "detrend" function in R). – Use a proper spectral estimation function. I'm not familiar with R, but I'm sure it contains an implementation of Welch's modified periodogram method. Update for the updated question: The time series exhibits a dominant period of roughly 360 samples, which for a sampling rate of 1 per minute means 360 minutes. The dominant frequency should therefore be about 0.0028 min$^{-1}$. This seems to be consistent with the periodogram after subtracted trend. Try zooming into the low-frequency range to more precisely determine the peak location. Superimposed to that is a secondary oscillation of 180 samples period or 0.0056 min$^{-1}$ frequency. Analyzing your data myself I get a main peak at 0.0029 min$^{-1}$ and a secondary peak at 0.0059 min$^{-1}$ (factor 2, the first harmonic). The secondary peak is smaller by a factor of about 36, or by 16 dB. I can share my code, but I am using Matlab, not R. Btw., the frequency scale on your plots does not appear to be consistent; sometimes it goes up to 0.008, sometimes to 0.5? I think the former gives the frequency in Hz and the latter in min$^{-1}$.
