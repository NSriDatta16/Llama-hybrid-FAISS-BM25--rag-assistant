A set of NIBs seem to be an unsatisfactory answer, even when represented in XML (as a XIB), because there's no easy way to compare or merge them with any standard subversion or SCM-style tool. The encoded information is fragile and not intended to be edited by mere humans. How would changes be represented by a GUI? Would I step through each attribute of each control and visually check them? If the app's behavior is written in code, however, there is a chance that I can figure out what's going in, even if I have to keep lots of details close at hand at the same time. A proposed solution: use a top-level NIB that the main architect coded up, but then code the rest of the app explicitly. Anybody got a better idea?
