Linq to sql to get the records from parent-child tables

I have 2 tables (say parent and child table and 1 to many relation), i drag and droped these tables on .DBML (linq to sql classes). now in the code, i would be able to see the relation in classes as association. parent class has list of child objects. my question is can i write a linQ statement to featch a (single) record from parent table and all related records from child table and bind to an object. Thanks
