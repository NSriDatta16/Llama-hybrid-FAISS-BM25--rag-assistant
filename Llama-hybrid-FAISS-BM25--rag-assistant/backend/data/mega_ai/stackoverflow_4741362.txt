Trouble with nested loops and openmp

I am having trouble applying openmp to a nested loop like this: #pragma omp parallel shared(S2,nthreads,chunk) private(a,b,tid) { tid = omp_get_thread_num(); if (tid == 0) { nthreads = omp_get_num_threads(); printf("\nNumber of threads = %d\n", nthreads); } #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic,chunk) for(a=0;a When I compare the serial with the openmp version, the last one gives weird results. Even when I remove #pragma omp for, the results from openmp are not correct, do you know why or can point to a good tutorial explicit about double loops and openmp?
