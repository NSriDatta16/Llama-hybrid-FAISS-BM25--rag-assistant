Why is the first "poor"? it looks almost perfect to me, it predicts every single change perfectly! It is a so-called "shifted" forecast. If you look more closely at chart 1, you see that the prediction power is only in copying almost exactly the last seen value. That means model learned nothing better, and it treats the time series as a random walk. I guess that the problem may be in the fact you use the raw data that you feed to the neural network. These data are non-stationary which causes all the trouble.
