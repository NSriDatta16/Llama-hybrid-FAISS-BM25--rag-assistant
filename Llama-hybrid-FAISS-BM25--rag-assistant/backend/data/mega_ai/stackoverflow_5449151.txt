Custom user model breaks auth tests

Hecko out there, I’m using a custom user model that I’ve opted to call Member, which extends the default user model (pretty much as described here ). The rub is that this breaks several tests of the auth app, because the test fixture only creates standard users , not members . When I add the missing member definitions/rows to django/contrib/auth/fixtures/authtestdata.json they run again, but that’s of course no solution. Is this is a result of me doing something wrong, and how should I best go about fixing it? As a last recourse, I would just add a patch for authtestdata.json in Buildout, but perhaps there is a more elegant solution. Thanks a lot, Telofy
