I think you should reconsider how you store the base URL and the URL fragments. Storing them in a dict like you're doing now makes things quite a lot harder than it has to be. One suggestion would be to generate the full URLs before you store it in a dict, drop the 'href' part from the tuples (and the tuples), and simply use the URLs themselves as keys. Something like this: from urlparse import urljoin links = {} urlbase = 'http://reed.cs.depaul.edu/lperkovic/csc242/test2.html' links[urljoin(urlbase, 'test3.html')] = 1 This would produce a dict looking like this: >>> links {'http://reed.cs.depaul.edu/lperkovic/csc242/test3.html': 1}
