Bug/issue tracking integration with Cruise control

I am putting together a bunch of applications to create an automatic building for microsoft platform (the products I chose and the software I will build, both, runs on windows). The products I've chosen are: Code repository: SubVersion Continuous integration: CruiseControl Unit testing: NUnit Test coverage: NCover Static code analysis: FXCop Now I need to choose a bug/issue tracking system (free if possible) that can be, in some way, integrated with the previous products. What I mean by integration? Well, all these products have a file as output I want to be able to publish errors and bugs found by them into the tracking system. Do you know some product, some technique or trick that can help me to do this? Thanks in advance.
