Hm what for? 30 emails per second is nothing. I wrote a server like 10 years ago hitting about 5000 per second (to one other server taking it down in the process - custoemr wanted as fast as possible, i delivered). Get any little MTA and jst use it. No sense in writing something yourself for that low volume. Unless you hit the server with a lot of stuff at once (loading it for transfer), a small VPS should be ok. Seriously, 30 emails per second is what I sometimes send from my dialup account. THis is not even a visible volume for a decent message transfer agent. It is definitely NOT "high volume".
