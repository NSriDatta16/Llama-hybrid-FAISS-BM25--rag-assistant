Is $P(AB) = P(B \mid A) P(A)$ an error, or am I misunderstanding something?

I am currently studying the textbook In all Likelihood by Yudi Pawitan. The section Inverse probability: the Bayesians of chapter 1.4 The emergence of statistics says the following: The simplest form of the Bayes theorem for two events $A$ and $B$ is $$P(A \mid B) = \dfrac{P(AB)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid \bar{A})P(\bar{A})} \tag{1.1}$$ I don't think $P(AB) = P(B \mid A) P(A)$ is correct? Is $P(AB) = P(B \mid A) P(A)$ an error, or am I misunderstanding something?
