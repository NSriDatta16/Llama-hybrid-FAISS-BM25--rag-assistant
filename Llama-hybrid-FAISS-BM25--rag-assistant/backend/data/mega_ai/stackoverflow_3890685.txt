for loop and if loop is refusing to print a varriable outside the loop?

i am facing a problem that after i created the jQuery post, i was able to receive all the data but as a one peace, so when i began rephrasing them i succeed until the final part which was the inserting into the database, where inside the for loop and if loop i am getting the value but when i wanted to start inserting them into the database i am getting null values, below is the for loop and if loop if ($action == "insert") { $fields = explode("&",$data); foreach($fields as $field) { $field_key_value = explode("=",$field); $key = urldecode($field_key_value[0]); $value = urldecode($field_key_value[1]); $id = $row['id']; $date1 = date("d/n/Y"); foreach ($cart->get_contents() as $item) { $item_id = $item['id']; $item_name = $item['name']; $item_price = $item['price']; $item_qty = $item['qty']; $item_ids = explode("-",$item_id); for($i = 0; $i
