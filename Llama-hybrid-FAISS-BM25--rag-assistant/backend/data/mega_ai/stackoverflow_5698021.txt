I believe that it does actually work because the C++ compiler is not allowed to reorder members of a class/struct within a single access specifier - so they always have to be laid out x, y, z. This is there for backwards compatibility with C in which the compiler isn't allowed to reorder members at all. However: I would argue that it's a little bit too clever for its own good. A couple of ifs or a switch inside the operator would seem cleaner to me, although I guess it is possible that they considered it performance-critical if it's an Ogre vector so that may be why it's done this way. I don't think the packing pragma would be needed since all three members are the same size so you'd expect them to abut one another. I'm not 100% sure of that in all cases though.
