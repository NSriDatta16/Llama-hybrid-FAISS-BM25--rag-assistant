My own preference, when trying to interpret interactions in logistic regression, is to look at the predicted probabilities for each combination of categorical variables. In your case, this would be just 4 probabilities: Prefer A, control true Prefer A, control false Prefer B, control true Prefer B, control false When I have continuous variables, I usually look at the predicted value at the median, 1st and 3rd quartiles. Although this doesn't directly get at the interpretation of each coefficient, I find that it often lets me (and my clients) see what is going on in a clear way.
