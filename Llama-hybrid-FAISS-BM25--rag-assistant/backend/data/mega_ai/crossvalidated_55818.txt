It's OK to put a time term and auto-regressive terms in the same model. But, the model may not be meaningful when $\epsilon_t$ is non stationary. If the series is stationary after removing deterministic part, one can add deterministic part in the time series analysis. In your case if $y_t$ is stationary after removing the time trend, you can proceed with your model.
