I don't think there is a single best way to approach this problem. It depends on the nature of the data and what exactly you are trying to discover with your analysis. If you believe that the price varies smoothly over time, then you could just estimate a regression model for the time trend, which would automatically downweight the areas with few data points. If the shape of the curve is non-linear an additive model using splines might be suitable. For a more descriptive approach moving average or local regressions (eg loess) would also work. As you say the most recent day is the most important then an 'exponentially weighted moving average' (EWMA) might be what you want https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average . If you believe that price is geniunely more variable day to day then a random effects model could be appropriate, with for example an autoregressive correlation between the true underlying prices on each day. From this you would obtain a shrunk estimate of the price each day, with more shrinkage toward the adjacent points if there are fewer actual data points on each day. I could elaborate on any of these approaches if you can add more desciption to the question.
