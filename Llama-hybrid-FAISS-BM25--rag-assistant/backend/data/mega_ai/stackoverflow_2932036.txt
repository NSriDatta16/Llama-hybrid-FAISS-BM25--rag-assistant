From PostgreSQL Docs: Table partitioning Partitioning refers to splitting what is logically one large table into smaller physical pieces. Partitioning can provide several benefits: Query performance can be improved dramatically for certain kinds of queries. Update performance can be improved too, since each piece of the table has indexes smaller than an index on the entire data set would be. When an index no longer fits easily in memory, both read and write operations on the index take progressively more disk accesses. Bulk deletes may be accomplished by simply removing one of the partitions, if that requirement is planned into the partitioning design. DROP TABLE is far faster than a bulk DELETE, to say nothing of the ensuing VACUUM overhead. Seldom-used data can be migrated to cheaper and slower storage media.
