How to combine aggregate functions in MySQL?

I'm just learning MySQL - is there a way to combine (or nest) aggregate functions? Given a query: SELECT user, count(answer) FROM surveyValues WHERE study='a1' GROUP BY user; This will give me the number of questions answered by each user. What I really want is the average number of questions answered per user...something like: SELECT avg(count(answer)) FROM surveyValues WHERE study='a1'; What's the correct way to compute this statistic? If this is possible, is there a way to then break this statistic down for each question? (users can answer the same question multiple times). Something like: SELECT avg(count(answer)) FROM surveyValues WHERE study='a1' GROUP BY question;
