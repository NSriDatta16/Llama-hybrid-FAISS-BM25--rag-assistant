How many nodes, on average, are within the cutoff distance for a given node determines your memory requirement and tells you whether you need to page to disk. The solution taking the least memory is probably a hash table that maps a pair of nodes to a distance. Since the distance is the same each way, you only need to enter it into the hash table once for the pair -- put the two node numbers in numerical order and then combine them to form a hash key. You could use the Posix hsearch/hcreate/hdestroy functions for the hash table, although they are less than ideal.
