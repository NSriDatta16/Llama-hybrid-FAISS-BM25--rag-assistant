WPF: Slider with an event that triggers after a user drags

I am currently making an MP3 player in WPF, and I want to make a slider that will allow the user to seek to a particular position in an MP3 by sliding the slider to the left or right. I have tried using the ValueChanged event but that triggers every time it's value is changed, so if you drag it across, the event will fire multiple times, I want the event to only fire when the user has finished dragging the slider and Then get the new value . How can I achieve this? [Update] I have found this post on MSDN which basically discusses the same thing, and they came up with two "solutions"; either subclassing the Slider or invoking a DispatcherTimer in the ValueChanged event that invokes the action after a timespan. Can you come up with anything better then the two mentioned above?
