You can use any standard English language embedding. You could then classify it based on sentiment and retain the ones with negative sentiment. You would then need to extract the sentiment and also do a topic modelling to extract the topic. ' Configuring app is really a headache ' could then be broken down to: Negative Sentiment Words carrying sentiment - headache Topic - App configuring You could then try clustering based on topics and come out with the top recommendations. There are good topic modelling libraries and Attention could be used to highlight words carrying sentiment. All of this will be completely unsupervised and can be run in online mode. Also 'labelling' the data can be another approach. The 3 problems to labelling that you have highlighted can be overcome. You could label an initial set as a 1-time activity. If your labelled data is divergent enough, it should elegantly classify or segregate subsequent issues into one of the labels. In case none of the labels fit strongly then that data can be marked for manual triaging. You would pretty quickly cover most of the scenarios
