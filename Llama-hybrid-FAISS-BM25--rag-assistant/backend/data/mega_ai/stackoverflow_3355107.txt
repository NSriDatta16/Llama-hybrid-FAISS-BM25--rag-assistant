Possibly inconsistent behavior in qplot()?

I'm trying to use qplot() to plot a simple time series as one might do using plot(). The x variable is as.POSIXlt and the y is just some continuous measurement. Here is the code with some brief comments. Any help on why these data.frames behave differently would be very much appreciated. As you can see below, I can work around the problem, but I'm curious as to why is doesn't work as I would expect. A few details: platform: OS X 10.6.4 R version: R 2.11.0 Disclaimer: I realize that I could dig into the source code and figure this out myself. I've never used SO and thought that it might be a nice topic for this forum. Disclaimer (2): I'm new to ggplot2 library(ggplot2) ws.dat
