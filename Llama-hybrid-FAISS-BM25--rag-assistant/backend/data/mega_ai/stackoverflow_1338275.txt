I prefer static linking. Security is not a really big issue since hackers target applications that many users have installed on their system. So unless your application has over 1 million users, I wouldn't worry about it being exploited by hackers. I don't like dynamic linking. It just feels too fragile to me. EDIT: And if you want to make sure that your users have an up-to-date version of your application then also write an updater application that is automatically installed along with your main app. On Windows this could be implemented as a Service.
