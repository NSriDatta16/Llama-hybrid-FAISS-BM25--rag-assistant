Detect when removable storage is unmounted

I am working on an app which should detect events that happen when removable storage is unmounted or forcefully unplugged from the USB. How can I receive these events? I have seen NSWorkspace for the first possibility of smoothly unmounting the device but this class has methods like -unmountAndEjectDeviceAtPath: to unmount a device. Can someone point me to some sample code that detects unmounted volumes?
