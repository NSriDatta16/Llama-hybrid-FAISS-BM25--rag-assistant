Well, if your samples are collections of points, I would separate this in two steps: Calculate distances between inner points: choose how to calculate the distance between (1,2,3) and (2,1,3), for instance. Here, depending on the nature of your problem, you could go for something akin to the euclidean distance or if you only care about the orientation of the points, something like the cosine similarity . Summarize all the distances as a single number: depending on your problem, you could get its average, its median or some other quantity. The main idea is to reduce all the numbers to a single one.
