Setting the value to an int when clicking a button in Cocoa

Ok, i'm new to the whole GUI programming so this might be a very simple question but has proven difficult to me. I have an application with 3 buttons. Button A is the main button, it starts and stops the application. I created a class with an IBAction on it and wrote the code for that button. it works. I also have button B and C that are used to set options. I created two IBOutlets: ButtonBAction and ButtonCAction, and control dragged (in interface builder) my class to each button and selected the action. Now, the idea is that when button B is pressed an option is set, basically an int is set (on the class for button A) to 1. The same with button C. How do I do this? How do I detect that button B or C were clicked and set those ints? Thanks
