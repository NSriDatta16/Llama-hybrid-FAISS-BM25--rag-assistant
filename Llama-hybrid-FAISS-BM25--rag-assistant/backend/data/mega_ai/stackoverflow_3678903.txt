You may want to check out the opensource Forge project. It implements TLS in JavaScript and you can do neat things like store client-side certificates in local storage and use them for authentication when appropriate. http://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/master/README Something similar to what you may be trying to do is the WebID project. These two sites show a demonstration of WebID (which involves storing a client-side certificate locally and then using it to authenticate on another website). They use Forge: https://webid.digitalbazaar.com/manage/ https://payswarm.com/webid-demo/ Since these sites are for demonstration purposes only, you will need to accept their self-signed SSL certificates to view them. No real personal information is required to try out the demos.
