What's the Bayesian counterpart to Pearson product-moment correlation?

I was wondering what the counterpart to Pearson product-moment correlation would be in a Bayesian framework. Or if there are many alternatives, what would be the most convenient or conventional method. I know that I could do Bayesian linear regression analysis but then I have to assume that I have one dependent and one independent variable, which I don't do when calculating a correlation. Any suggestion for how to implement the model in BUGS/JAGS is also appreciated! Edit: My question is what a Pearson product-moment correlation in an Bayesian framework would be as opposed to a classical framework including p-values and confidence intervals of the correlation . Sometimes the transition from classical statistics to Bayesian statistics is not straight forward, for example, some Bayesian ANOVAs that are proposed actually are not analyses of variance. Correlation analysis is a really common statistical analysis but I haven't been able to find any Bayesian example implementation in, for example, JAGS or BUGS. Edit: I now found the following pdf presentation that describes using a multivariate normal distribution with a Wishart distribution as the prior on the precision to calculate the correlation coefficient. This was, sort of, the answer I was looking for.
