Guidelines for internal class member grouping

How do you group your class members inside the class? When you add a new method to a class, do you add them to where it should be alphabetically for instance? Do you use regions? I use them along with the groups created by Visual Studio's interface implementation stub generator, like: #region IEnumerable ... #endregion I use region names like "Properties", etc, but some members prove to be a little more tricky to group/organize. How do you deal with this?
