I don't really know autotools, but can't you use the maven exec plugin , that lets you execute system commands (or Java programs)? For example: org.codehaus.mojo exec-maven-plugin exec-one compile autogen -v exec exec-two compile automake -v [other arguments] exec I didn't test the pom fragment above, but it gives you some hints about how to proceed.
