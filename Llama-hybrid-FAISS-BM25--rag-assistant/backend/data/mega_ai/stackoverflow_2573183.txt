Edit: After looking at this again, I'm not really sure why you're storing the data in the body element. Keep in mind that the data() method is not a replacement for all variables-- just data that you want associated with a given element. See my example below for more on this. It should work fine. The data() method is like storing data into a variable, but that data is now conveniently associated with the element itself. You should be careful to namespace the key you use for your data, though. In your code, you're using 'storage' , but that's awfully generic and seems very susceptible to collisions with other code. I would suggest using a prefix, like: 'blah.storage' . Also, SLaks was correct-- your selector will need to be passed through jQuery. // SLaks' correction and my namespace suggestion $('body').data('blah.storage', $('#ajaxdiv').html()); // Alternative method, where #ajaxLink is the link you click to trigger // the data retrieval $('#ajaxLink').bind('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); // Notice that we're using $(this).data(), so that our cache is associated // with the link element itself. if ($(this).data('blah.cachedAjaxHtml')) { // The data was found in the cache. Use it to populate the div. $('#ajaxDiv').html($(this).data('blah.cachedAjaxHtml')); } else { // Load the data via AJAX and store it in the cache var ajaxResult = whateverYouDoToLoadIt(); $(this).data('blah.cachedAjaxHtml', ajaxResult); $('#ajaxDiv').html(ajaxResult); } }
