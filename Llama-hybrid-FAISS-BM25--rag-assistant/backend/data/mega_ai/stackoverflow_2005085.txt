I think you miss the point of programming in Assembler. An assembler program is a text file. The fragment you included in your question is text. I don't know if it's the correct text, but it must be text. During compilation the text is converted to machine code; binary if you will. If you want to define binary characters to be output by your program you will need to specify the text which represents those binary codes and will be converted by compilation into a block of bytes which the program can output. I can't tell you what the text representation would be for the binary you need, that would require a more detailed understanding of both Assembler language and your program.
