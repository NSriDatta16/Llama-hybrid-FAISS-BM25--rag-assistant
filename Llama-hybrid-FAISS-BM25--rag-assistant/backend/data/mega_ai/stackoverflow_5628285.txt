To embed fonts, don't rely on wrapping them in MovieClips in the library. They should be embedded correctly as Fonts. I have included some basic steps below for embedding fonts, then an example for your particular situation: 1 - Make the textfield Dynamic and click the Embed.. button 2 - Name the font with something meaningful (like the fonts name) and tick the character sets you will be using (usually I select caps, lowercase, numbers and punctuation). Also note the Style is 'Bold', you will need to embed a font set for each style. So if you want to use Bold and Regular, you need to embed 2 fonts. 3 - If you plan on adding textfields dynamically through ActionScript, goto the ActionScript tab and add a class for it (again, use a meaningful name) 4 - Finally click ok, and away you go. I have setup an example, using these steps, and the auto size method, you can see the results below
