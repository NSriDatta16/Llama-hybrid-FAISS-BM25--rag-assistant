Any tips of how to handle hierarchical trees in relational model?

I have a tree structure that can be n-levels deep, without restriction. That means that each node can have another n nodes. What is the best way to retrieve a tree like that without issuing thousands of queries to the database? I looked at a few other models, like flat table model, Preorder Tree Traversal Algorithm, and so. Do you guys have any tips or suggestions of how to implement a efficient tree model? My objective in the real end is to have one or two queries that would spit the whole tree for me. With enough processing i can display the tree in dot net, but that would be in client machine, so, not much of a big deal. Oh just dropping some more info here: environment: Oracle or PostgreSQL, C# and Winforms. Thanks for the attention
