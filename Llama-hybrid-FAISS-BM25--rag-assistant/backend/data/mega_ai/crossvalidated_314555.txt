I have since worked out an approach. One option is to simply take, $$\chi^2=[\vec D - \mathbb E(\vec D)]^T \Sigma^{-1}[\vec D - \mathbb{E}(\vec D)]$$ where $\vec D$ would be the measured values of $K_i$ and $\mathbb E(\vec D)$ would be the actual $K_i$ values. Then we can define a likelyhood based on $\exp(-\chi^2)$. MCMC then proceeds as usual, picking a proposal to generate $K_i$ and a prior on $K_i$.
