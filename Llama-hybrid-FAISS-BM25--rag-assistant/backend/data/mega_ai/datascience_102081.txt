Many alleged "classification" models actually predict probabilities, and then there is some decision function that maps the probability to a category. The common decision function is to take the category that has the highest probability, but you can pick any threshold. You might even choose not to use a threshold and to do direct evaluation of the probability outputs. This gives the richer interpretation that is mentioned, as it allows for, as two examples, risk estimation and calibration. Frank Harrell (Vanderbilt stat professor) has two blog posts about this that are worth reading. Damage Caused by Classification Accuracy and Other Discontinuous Improper Accuracy Scoring Rules Classification vs. Prediction The related Stack, Cross Validated (statistics), tends to talk about this topic more than Data Science. You might be interested in searching for "proper scoring rule" on there. I have several posts on the topic.
