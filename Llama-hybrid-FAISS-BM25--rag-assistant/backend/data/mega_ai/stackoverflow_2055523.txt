The backslash character is the escape character in strings in MySQL. To put a backslash in a string literal in a query you have to escape it using double backslashes. Also a string in SQL uses apostrophes as delimiter, not quotation marks. SELECT * from tableName WHERE imageFile = 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Albert Bayita\\Desktop\\MovieImages\\TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowship.jpg'; The best option is of course to use a parameterised query instead.
