I would say that Workflow presents more benefit to the organization than the developer. As developers, it does us no good to define things we can do on our own in some extraneous framework. But what if you aren't the developer, and you needed an email shot to the top level supervisor, in your example, when nobdy approves the document after so many days. If you designed an application that allowed the reordering of events, someone besides yourself could designate this flow. Granted, you would have to code things pretty generically, but it is worthwhile if your scenario requires outside people to dictate flow and who are not developers. For example, in Microsoft CRM, certain workflows contain steps to be followed. You could write your own workflow that uses the surrounding framework to create new workflows. You have no need to worry about adding your code in some hackeyed way to the system. The system knows workflows, it knows how to follow the steps, and it can execute them. There is benefit to WF, but it is limited.
