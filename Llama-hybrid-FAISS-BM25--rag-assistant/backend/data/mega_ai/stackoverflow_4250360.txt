Searching Authorize.net CIM Records

Has anyone come up with an elegant way to search data stored on Authorize.net's Customer Information Manager (CIM)? Based on their XML Guide there doesn't appear to be any search capabilities at all. That's a huge short-coming. As I understand it, the selling point for CIM is that the merchant doesn't need to store any customer information. They merely store a unique identifier for each and retrieve the data as needed. This may be great from a PCI Compliance perspective, but it's horrible from a flexibility standpoint. A simple search like "Show me all orders from Texas" suddenly becomes very complicated. How are the rest of you handling this problem?
