If you want to deploy the same job to other SQL Servers, you may also want to consider the MSX TSX setup in SQL Server. One server is a Master (MSX) that deploys jobs to all other servers and the Target servers (TSX) download and execute the job. The good part is that all the good things about SQL Server Agent (scheduling, the deployment, error logging, notification, triggering one from another, integration) etc is built in and you don't have to write it all custom for every job.
