Rating the Models

I am working with Multi variate time series Analysis using different Models in R. I used Arima , glm , H2O.gbm , randomforest and Garch Models for the same set of data. I did predictions and calculated RMSE value for each Models. I have ranked these models according to RMSE value. But i would like to provide ratings like movie ratings to these models based on their RMSE and rank value. > df df Model RMSE MAPE rank 1 arima 410770.6 0.510 1 2 glm 571215.2 0.841 3 3 H2O.gbm 501895.3 0.449 2 4 randomforest 1157233.0 1.746 4 5 Garch 1161791.0 1.840 5 Any suggestions on how to provide rating to these Models? for example, i would like to score all the models out of 10. Any method or process to provide ratings to these Models? Any help is much appreciated. Thank you. Magg
