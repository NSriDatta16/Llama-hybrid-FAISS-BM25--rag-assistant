As a rule of thumb, avoid creating huge objects on the stack. Creating an object on the stack frees you from the burden of remembering to cleanup(read delete) the object. But creating too many objects on the stack will increase the chances of stack overflow. If you use heap for the object, you get the as much memory the OS can provide, much larger than the stack, but then again you must make sure to free the memory when you are done. Also, creating too many objects too frequently in the heap will tend to fragment the memory, which in turn will affect the performance of your application.
