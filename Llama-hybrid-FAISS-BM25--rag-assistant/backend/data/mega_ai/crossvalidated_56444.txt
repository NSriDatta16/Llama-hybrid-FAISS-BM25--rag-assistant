What factors do I have to consider when deciding if creating a composite score using four t-scores is defensible psychometrically?

Edit: I've conducted an item analysis on four variables - two quizzes and two psychological attributes, namely emotional intelligence and happiness. Its a within-subject design with students as participants. They all have Cronbach's alpha above .70 or have been revised to meet that criteria. I have a scenario where a selection panel chooses to select students based on their performance in all four composite variables. It was then decided that we should calculate an average standardized t-score across the four variables. Would creating a composite score out of four t-scores be psychometrically defensible? why or why not? I've also correlated all for variables and they were all statistically significant with the lowest being .30. Is that considered decent enough? the quiz scales and attribute scales are different but if using t-scores then would they be considered standardized? thanks for any help!=D
