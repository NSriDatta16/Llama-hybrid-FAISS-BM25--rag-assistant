prediction using LSTM

i have training data from 2015-2017 and testing data of 2018. i have multiple variables my data is multivariate time series data.i want to predict 2019 data by using test data of 2018.is it possible? i am confused about Long short term memory neural networks working what is actually it will do.does my problem come under multivariate multi step forecasting? or multivariate single step forecasting?
