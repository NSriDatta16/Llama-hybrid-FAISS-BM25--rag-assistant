Architecture for microsoft azure. CSV to SQL

I'm an intern in charge of researching an azure project. At the moment i'm devising an architecture for a part of the project. The goal is to convert multiple csv files to an SQL database in the cloud. These csv's will be sent from random locations in the country and need to be processed so the database can eventually be accessed using a web service. I'm totally new to the azure scene and have been schooling myself but it's all a bit fuzzy in my head. some info: The csv's are small files but about 20.000 would be received daily yes it needs to be SQL storage because we need to aggregate the data easily. what will be in the csv and needs to be stored?? a unique key value (string) a consumption value (double) a datetime stamp (datetime/string) a quality value (int) The architecture i had in mind would be: Http requests to the cloud (does the cloud need a listener service?) A queue service that holds the csv's before they are processed The sql drive storage (direct import? or do i need some kind of worker role in between?) A web service that will get requests from an external AOS or a client application with a query for the data in the sqlDB. Am i correct in assuming this problem can be solved with standard components or do i need to implement a vm role? How would you set this up? Any input would be much appreciated because i really feel lost in the clouds :) I hope I gave a clear overview of the requirements... It's not easy explaining something you don't fully grasp yourself
