I'll assume that your meaning of "smoke test" is the same as mine -- i.e. try to blow the program up in any way you can. I learned the value of this 20+ years ago when I had just finished (or so I thought) a major piece of code for a WYSIWYG editor. I proudly showed it to my officemate (Hey Dbell!) who said, "Neat!". He immediately created a paragraph with about 1000 characters in it, copied it thousands of times, and created a document of about 32MB, deleted everything, undid it, and the program absolutely exploded. I was completely horrified and said, "You can't do that!". He grinned and said, "Why not?" Finding and fixing the problem (which turned out to be easy to replicate, once you knew what the threshold events looked like) uncovered a subtle and serious bug in memory management. Simple click-the-button testing would have never uncovered it. The modern day equivalent of this is Fuzz testing ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing ). It is not substitute for step-by-step requirements testing, but it will often expose problems that no other method will.
