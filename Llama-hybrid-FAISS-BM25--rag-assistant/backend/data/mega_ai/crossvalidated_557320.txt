Order of integration of a time series process

I am having trouble solving the order of integration of a time series process. Consider the following processes: \begin{align*} \epsilon_t &\sim i.i.d.(0,1) \\ x_t &= \alpha x_{t-1}+\epsilon_t \\ y_t &= y_{t-1}+x_t \\ z_t &= z_{t-1}+y_t \end{align*} Assume $\alpha = 0.8$ . Then, what is the order of integration of $z$ ? As in $z$ is a $I(d)$ -process, where I want to determine the order of integration $d$ .
