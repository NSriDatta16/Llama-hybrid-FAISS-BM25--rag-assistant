If it were me, I'd separate out the code that performs the data retrieval for the gridview and the Excel processing into it's own class library project. Then, with that DLL, createa console application that calls those functions. You can schedule a windows service to execute that .exe daily. With that said. To specifically answer your question. You need to create a console application and request the page using an HttpWebRequest static void Main(string[] args) { // prepare the web page you are asking for HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create("http://www.yourpage.com"); // execute the request HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse) request.GetResponse(); } Because it seems you don't need to read the response, this should be sufficient.
