Memory allocation for _M_start and _M_finish in a vector

I'm defining a vector as: vector > *v = new vector > (4); MyAlloc is allocating space for only 4 ints. Memory for _M_start, _M_finish, and _M_end_of_storage is being allocated on the heap before the memory for the 4 ints. But who is allocating this memory for _M_start, _M_finish, and _M_end_of_storage? I want to allocate this memory myself. What do I have to do?
