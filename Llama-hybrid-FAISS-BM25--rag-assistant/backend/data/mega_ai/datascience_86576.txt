SVD based method for predicting missing values in future experiments

I would like to pose my question in terms of a hypothetical example, where I have a matrix: 11 12 13...1m 21 22 23 ..2m . . . 3m . . . . . 11 n2 n3 . nm The matrix has no missing values. Each column corresponds to one experiment and each row corresponds to a particular measurement parameter ( eg: temperature @ point 1, temperature @ point 2... Pressure....) next, I conduct a New experiment, and I measure most parameters but not all n parameters. I want to estimate the missing parameter(s) in my New experiment. Is there a formula based on SVD/PCA to calculate the missing value in my New experiment based on my 'training' matrix? Are there any better machine learning / statistical methods to perform this calculation ? Thanks in advance!
