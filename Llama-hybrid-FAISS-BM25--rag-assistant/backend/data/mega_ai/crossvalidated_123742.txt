Split clustered data into calibration and validation sample (Cross validation)

I have a dataset with >800 cases ($n$) from >30 ($k$) different organisations (clustered data). The number of cases within each organisation differ (unbalanced data; e.g.: organisation 1 = 30 cases, organisation 2 = 13 cases ...). I want to randomly split the dataset into a calibration (training) and a validation (test) sample in order to cross-validate a structural equation model. However, I am unsure how I should actually do the split. In my opinion, there are two valid options: Randomly splitting the dataset neglecting the clustering into different organisations (randomly choosing participants from different organisations). Randomly splitting the dataset based on the clustering (i.e., randomly choosing $k_a = k/2$ organisations for the calibration sample and $k_b = k - k_a$ organisations for the validation sample). Option 1 has the advantage that I get two samples that have identical sample sizes ($n_a = n_b$). Option 2, on the other hand, has the advantage to take the clustered data structure into account but produces samples with different sample sizes ($n_a \neq n_b$). Is there a preferred way to split datasets in cases of clustered data structures? Ps.: I calculated intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC1 , in R with multilevel::mult.icc ) for all dependent variables. The ICC is below .1 for all variables. It can therefore be assumed that only small amounts of variance are explained due to organisational membership. PPs.: I added machine-learning as tag since cross validation is often done in this field. Edit: I reconsidered the whole problem and came up with another option: Randomly choosing ~50% of individuals out of each of the $k$ different organisations. This approach would allow to keep the original cluster structure in both subsamples and $n_a = n_b$. However, I am still quite unsure how to tackle the subsetting since I do not have a rational that guides me. I didn't not find literature yet that considers such issues.
