Any proposal can be used if you define your log-posterior properly. You just need to use some tricks to implement it and properly define the support of your posterior, see: How to find the support of the posterior distribution to apply Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm? There are tons of examples where a Gaussian proposal can be used for truncated posteriors. This is just an implementation trick. Again, you are asking a question with no general solution. Some proposals even have different performance for the same model and different data sets. Good luck.
