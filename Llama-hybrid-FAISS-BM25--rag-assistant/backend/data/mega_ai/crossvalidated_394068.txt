Can you compare average differences over time as an alternative to mixed models?

I have data that looks at the rate of crime for four countries over a three year time period. I would like to see whether the rates per 1000 people for each country are significantly different from one another over the time period. I have attempted to model this data using a variety of multilevel models (e.g. negative binomial with number of offences offset for log population size, poisson with same, normal distribution with rates as my dependent variable, and lognormal with rates as my dependent variable). In all cases, my models fail to converge or become singular fit. My data with rates looks as such df My question is, what alternatives to multilevel modelling would you use if you were interested in seeing whether the rates were significantly larger for one country vs another. Is a comparison of averages problematic (i.e. taking the mean rate over the time period and running a t-test)? alternatively, is it a problem to run multiple chi-squares at each time point looking at differences in proportion of offending for each country?
