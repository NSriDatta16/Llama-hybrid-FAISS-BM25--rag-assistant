I did something similar for my M.Sc. thesis - learning CFG rules (without probabilities) using a partial grammar and POS tagging. Please see my answer to this question for a list of references about learning PCFGs. One approach is learning lexicalized grammars, that include word information along with the node name. It is hard to answer your question without context: What would you consider a good algorithm? One that gives a good enough language model? That minimizes a statistical measure? That is efficient enough? Given Arabic's rich morphology, maybe you can add morphology to your grammar - e.g. add gender and number agreement features to it.
