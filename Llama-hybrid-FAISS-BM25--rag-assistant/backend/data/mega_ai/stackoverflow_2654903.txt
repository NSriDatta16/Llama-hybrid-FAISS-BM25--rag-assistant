File storage backend for Rails

I have a Rails application that I want to add file upload to, so that the users have access to a "resources" section where they can upload and share (although not publicly) any type of file. I know I could build a solution using paperclip and S3 for example, but to try and avoid the admin overhead of all that I'm looking at API interfaces to drop.io and box.net. Does anyone have any experience of these? I've got a basic demo working rather well to drop.io, but I was just wondering if anyone had any better ideas or experiences. Many thanks D
