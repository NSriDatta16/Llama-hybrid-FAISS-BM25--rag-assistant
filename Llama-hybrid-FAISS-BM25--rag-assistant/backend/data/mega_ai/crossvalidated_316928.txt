If you donâ€™t care about the ordered relationship of years, use a chi-square test. If further types of contact with the hospital have no order (ie no contact, had contact or uninsured) chi-square is still applicable. If you need to know the effect of advancing years on hospital contact, use logistic regression. If you have a collection of counts of contacts per year (ie 0,1,2,...), consider a count model, such as Poisson regression.
