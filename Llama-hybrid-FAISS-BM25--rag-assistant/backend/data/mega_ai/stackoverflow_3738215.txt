Are you moving the Project Collection(s) to a new server or did you just set up a new server to be used as a build agent? If it's the former, you don't need to worry about exporting the build definitions because they will move with everything else in the collection Move a Team Project Collection If it's the latter, you also don't need to export anything. You'll either update the build controller to include the new build agent you set up, or you'll update the build definition to use a new build controller (depending what new components you are adding to TFS) The build definitions are in the project collection database and you really shouldn't need to access them directly.
