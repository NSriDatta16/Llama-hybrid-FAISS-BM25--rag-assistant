Multinomial Logistic Regression Appropriate?

Suppose the outcome variable can take on 3 discrete values that are not ordinal: (e.g. 1 - weekly, 1- quarterly, and 3 - annually). If for each subject, there are multiple outcomes, would multinomial logistic regression still be favorable to use? For example, suppose the data looked like this: id outcome 1 1 1 3 2 1 2 3 . . . .
