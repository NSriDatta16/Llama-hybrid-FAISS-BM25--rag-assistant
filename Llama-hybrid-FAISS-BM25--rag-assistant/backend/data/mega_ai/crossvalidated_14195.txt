I took a crack at coding @Mike Anderson answer in R. I couldn't figure out how to do it using sapply, so I used a loop. I changed the probs slightly to get a more interesting result, and I used 'A' and 'B' to represent the states. Let me know what you think. set.seed(1234) TransitionMatrix =runif(1),'A','B') i Series [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 [38] 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 [75] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 /edit: In response to Paul's comment, here's a more elegant formulation set.seed(1234) createSeries 0) Series = random[i-1] } return(Series) } createSeries(100, matrix(c(0.9,0.7,0.1,0.3), ncol=2)) I wrote the original code when I was just learning R, so cut me a little slack. ;-) Here's how you would estimate the transition matrix, given the series: Series The order is swapped vs my original transition matrix, but it gets the right probabilities.
