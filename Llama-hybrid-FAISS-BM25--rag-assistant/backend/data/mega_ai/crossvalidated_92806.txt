Yes, there are ways to do this. People make their living doing stuff like this ;-) You are looking for causal forecasting . Look at this free online textbook on forecasting to learn about forecasting methodology. You have two key issues on your hands that you need to deal with: seasonality (or more generally, time series structure, possibly with autoregression) on the one hand, and causal effects like promotions on the other hand. Chapter 8 in the textbook above deals with the time series stuff in the context of ARIMA, while Chapter 5 deals with causal effects. Happily enough, it is possible to address both issues by calculating either so-called ARIMAX (the X stands for "external effects", i.e., ARIMA with external effects) models, or regressions with ARIMA errors. See Rob Hyndman's blog post on "The ARIMAX model muddle" for the difference. The auto.arima() function in the forecast R package will fit a regression with ARIMA errors. Let's walk through an example, where I take a standard dataset with strong trend and seasonality and add "promotions". library(forecast) AirPassengers # a built-in dataset # Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec # 1949 112 118 132 129 121 135 148 148 136 119 104 118 # 1950 115 126 141 135 125 149 170 170 158 133 114 140 # 1951 145 150 178 163 172 178 199 199 184 162 146 166 # 1952 171 180 193 181 183 218 230 242 209 191 172 194 # 1953 196 196 236 235 229 243 264 272 237 211 180 201 # 1954 204 188 235 227 234 264 302 293 259 229 203 229 # 1955 242 233 267 269 270 315 364 347 312 274 237 278 # 1956 284 277 317 313 318 374 413 405 355 306 271 306 # 1957 315 301 356 348 355 422 465 467 404 347 305 336 # 1958 340 318 362 348 363 435 491 505 404 359 310 337 # 1959 360 342 406 396 420 472 548 559 463 407 362 405 # 1960 417 391 419 461 472 535 622 606 508 461 390 432 set.seed(1) # for reproducibility promos The red dots are the promotions. By default, you'll get prediction intervals plotted in grey. You can feed multiple regressors into your model through the xreg parameter, which you should do if you have different types of promotions with different effects. Experiment a little. I would recommend looking at more fine-grained data than monthly if you have them, e.g., weekly. Especially of course if your promotions don't run for full months. You can do this separately by product, again especially if you promote specific products, or on whole categories. An alternative would be, given that you are more interested in concepts than code, to look at Exponential Smoothing and change it to suit your needs, by adding promotional components to the standard three level, season and trend components. You can do a lot more yourself with Exponential Smoothing than with trying to maximum likelihood estimate an ARIMAX model, but Smoothing can turn into a bit of a bookkeeping nightmare if you have multiple promotion types.
