Why are they asking for it all to go into SharePoint? In my experience it is because the 'ole SharePoint intranet is being great as a portal to keep everything together and findable under the one information architecture. Approach the issue from a uses perception of the application space in the organisation. So long as the application looks and feels just like part of the intranet site and the user does not have to think about how to get to it (and how to get back out), you can pretty much take any architecture decisions necessary to get the best bang for the organisations buck when it comes to implementation and maintainence. When we started thinking about the site less from SharePoint vs other stuff to the nice woolly concepts of Information Architecture, findability and usability, our decisions not to make it actually inside SharePoint, but still skin it like the Intranet became easier to sell.
