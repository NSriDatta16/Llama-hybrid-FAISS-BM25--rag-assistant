The added value of Machine Learning compared to traditional rule based methods

I would like to showcase the value of machine learning compared to traditional rule based (symbolic AI) methods. I would also like to break it down for Unsupervised, Supervised and Reinforcement learning. E.g.: Why would you perform clustering using k-means, DBSCAN etc vs asking an expert of that field (assuming there is one) to give you some segmentation rules? Why would you use a Random Forest or an XGBoost to do classification rather than again getting the rules from and predictions from an expert? Why would you use Thompson's sampling to find the next action vs "downloading" the brain of an expert? Ideally, I would like to move beyond the idea of "a lot of options/data/possibilities" for a human to take them all into account and process without adding their bias. Is there anything else that can answer this question without of course setting a competition between the expert and the machine?
