everybody and thanks for answering. I'd managed to solve this problem in an ugly way - editing packages on server, but I'd like very much more elegant solution - now I'm trying with environment variable,it seems great, but the wizard that I'm getting is different from that is given in link - and I don't know how to continue.(I'm using VStudio 2005) Besides, I tried configuration file as XML, but package run fails even on the source machine, so I'm stuck !
