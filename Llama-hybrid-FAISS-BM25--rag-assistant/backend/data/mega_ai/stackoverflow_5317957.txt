iPhone as proxy for data upload

I want to create an iPhone application that can call web services on a computer, and then upload those files over the iPhone 3g connection. Is there an elegant way to do this? I tried connecting the phone to local Wifi, but connecting to Wifi disables 3g, even though the Wifi is local network only. I assume the same problem would arise if I could network the phone with the computer via bluetooth. Any other ideas? The purpose is to go up to a special demo PC we created, pull some data off, then upload to the Internet, all within proximity of the machine. Unfortunately, it appears that I can't use one connection for pulling data, and another for pushing.
