I've been working with magento API for almost a year now and can assure you that the only ID you need to use is the order_increment_id. It is used as the main ID in the order.info call. The same is true for the invoice and shipment APIs - they also use the appropriate increment id as the main one. The order_id, which I believe is the same as entity_id, is the primary key in the sales_order table used to join all the eav tables together. It is used internally in magento, but working with the API you needn't worry about it.
