Prompt the user to install ActiveX/.Net Class Library from browser

I build a .NET Class Library project that accesses the mshtml.HTMLDocument when called (from JavaScript). Everything works ok on my machine since I changed the permissions in .NET Configuration for Trusted Sites to have Full access. But for the end users I would like Internet Explorer to prompt them just like, say, Windows Update does. I singed the assembly with a strong name and with an auto-signed certificate, and I am asserting the Unmanaged code SecurityPermission , but still no 'yellow bar' asking the user. Does anybody know how to trigger this prompting? Thanks Later edit : some more details: I am embedding the component as and it works, but does not have the security permissions. If I embed it like , the permissions to install pop-up comes up but the object fails to instantiate. Update: I made my class a COM one, implemented Safe-for-scripting, I made a MSI out of it and put it in a .CAB file. It installs, if the user has my certificate in the Trusted Roots, and it works. It doesn't work however if it is not trusted (no questions to the user, just '..has blocked the following activex from..'. Does that really mean I have to put my money into an SSL certificate?!?
