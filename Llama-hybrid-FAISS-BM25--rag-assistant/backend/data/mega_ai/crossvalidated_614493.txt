A few things I can think of here. If you're just trying to predict sales for a specific store, you can sum up each store's item sales and predict total sales. That's one way to do it. If you're trying to predict specific item sales, then you could group monthly sales by store and item on a monthly basis. In either case, you can add time series features using a package like tsfresh . This gives you a bunch of time series features for each store or store/item combo. Then you use dates for three months out or total of next three month sales as your target variable and train. This is also a problem in time series forecasting of a top down vs bottom up approach. Predict in aggregate then predict for each item or predict for each item then predict in aggregate. Here a few links to read up on those two strategies. Hope this helps. https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-hierarchical-time-series-forecasting-part-i-88a116f2e2 https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/growing-a-business/top-down-vs-bottom-up-which-financial-forecasting-model-works-for-you/
