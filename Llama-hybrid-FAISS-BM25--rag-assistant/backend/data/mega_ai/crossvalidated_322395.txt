This is sometimes called a cross-over interaction, and if you plot the data you will immediately understand why: (I generated normally distributed data according to your specified values of mean and SD) The plot clearly shows that the effect of "region" is in different directions depending on "test". Moreover, the effects not only are in different directions, but they also have the same size. Hence, if you look at the effect of "region" averaged over the two levels of "test" the difference A vs. B would disappear. So the reason why you don't find a significant main effect of "region" (or of "test") is that is not there! Edit: A main effect of "region" would indicate that there is evidence for a systematic difference between measurements taken in region A and B, regardless of the test used (test 1 vs. test 2). Plotting the same data from the above figure without considering the factor "test" makes it clear that there is no evidence for such difference in the data.
