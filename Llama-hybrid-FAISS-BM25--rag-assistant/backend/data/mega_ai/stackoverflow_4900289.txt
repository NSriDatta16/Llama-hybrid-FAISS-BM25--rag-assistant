It's hard to say exactly what the answer is without knowing more, but my first guess is that you are providing some invalid value to a UIView 's center property. There are two pieces of information missing that could help you/me find the answer. First, lines like these in the stack trace need to be symbolicated: 15 MyApp 0x00012b2c 0x1000 + 72492 16 MyApp 0x0001276a 0x1000 + 71530 Knowing what is happening in those two lines will help you track it down, and knowing what the exception that got thrown (starting at line 11 in the stack trace) contains will help further. You may be able to get this information from looking at the device's Console output in Xcode's Organizer. You can symbolicate the crash report if you have the dSYM file that was created when you built the app for AdHoc distribution. Dragging the crash report into Xcode's Organizer window will attempt to symbolicate it automatically. If that doesn't work, you can try using the symbolicatecrash script directly. It's tucked away in a path like this: /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DTDeviceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/symbolicatecrash
