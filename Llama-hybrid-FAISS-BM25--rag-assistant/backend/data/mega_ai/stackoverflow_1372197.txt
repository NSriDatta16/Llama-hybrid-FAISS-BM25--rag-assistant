jquery treeview highlighting selected item

I am using a jQuery treeview, to display an organization tree hierarchy, I display the selected organization's details on the same form by using AJAX. So the question is, how do I make the current (selected) item highlighted, does treeview support that (I tried selected, persistence etx, no luck, but I am new to jquery anyways.), or should I solve this on my own. thanks in advance
