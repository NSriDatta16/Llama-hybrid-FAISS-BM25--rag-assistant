Getting Error with .NET REMOTING C#

Here is the error I'm getting. I have a simple .Net Remoting setup. This error comes up after a few minutes of the connection being idle. Object '/7966b546_734e_410d_817a_a0e701f114f6/lfxehvbcznjzkycgbimraglb_1.rem' has been disconnected or does not exist at the server.
