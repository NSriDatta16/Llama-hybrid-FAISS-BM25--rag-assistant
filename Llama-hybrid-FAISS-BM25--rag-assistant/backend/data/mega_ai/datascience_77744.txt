A surrogate model is an approximation model for a given function. The original function is generally a black box function that we can sample from and based on the samples we can optimize our surrogate model to approximate the behaviour of the original function. A surrogate model can be a neural network, an ensemble method, a gaussian process which can be interpreted and used later for explainability.
