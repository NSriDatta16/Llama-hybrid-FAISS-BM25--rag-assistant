Are you familiar with jQuery? If so, you might consider the various table-sorting plugins out there, such as TableSorter . I don't have any use for it at the moment, but a number of shops in my organization have incorporated it. For bonus points, the documentation at that link seems pretty comprehensive. jQuery can also give you solid control over whether the is present. Hopefully someone with more experience can stop by w/ some code examples demonstrating that.
