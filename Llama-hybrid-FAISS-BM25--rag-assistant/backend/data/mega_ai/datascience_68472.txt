Is it possible to deploy a python trained machine learning model (e.g. a .pkl file) in C language?

I would like to train my machine learning using Python and libraries such as tensor flow, keras, and scikit-learn. After trained, I would like to export this trained model to a file, so far I have been using the library pickle. I feel that this is pretty standard in any ML project. However, and the point of this question, is it possible to use this trained model (e.g. a .pkl or .sav file) in C language? When I say "use", I mean passing values to the model and getting a prediction back. This is somewhat similar to TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers , however, I am not sure if this is the most appropriate and easier approach to this problem.
