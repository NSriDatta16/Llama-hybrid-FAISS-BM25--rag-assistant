Nick Cox is correct that "trends" are the subject of a plethora of metrics by technically oriented financial analysts. While these technical trend metrics may be quite intensive methodologically, they tend to be weak or lacking in statistical rigor and motivation otherwise. In other words, they are pretty simple minded heuristics. What they do confirm is that your question is more about qualitative measures of "trendiness." On this topic there are no shortage of opinions. My preference in trend analysis is to, first, answer the question of the growth rate and whether or not this growth is exponential or greater than exponential. The really interesting trends are the ones showing growth faster than exponential as these imply "bubbles" of some type. Then, over and against the growth rate, the slope or the rate of change in the predictors relative to Y , there is the acceleration in the slope or the rate of change in the rate of change. This is typically based on the slope of the second difference of Y wrt itself. Acceleration is also known as the Hessian and is considered one of the "greeks" in quantitative finance. Ron Gallant, in his 1986 Nonlinear Modeling book described as a good measure for the presence of nonlinearity in a time series. It has also been described as a measure of "success" or environmental fitness. I like it because acceleration gives you a quantification of the strength or magnitude of the force behind the first derivative or slope.
