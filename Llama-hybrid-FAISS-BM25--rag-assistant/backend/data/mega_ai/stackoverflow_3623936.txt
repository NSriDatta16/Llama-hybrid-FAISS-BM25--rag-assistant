Most modern browsers check the if-modified-since header whenever a cacheable resource is in a HTTP request. However, not all browsers support the if-modified-since header. There are three ways to "force" the browser to load a cached resource. Option 1 Create a query string with a version#. src="script.js?ver=21" . The downside is many proxy servers wont cache a resource with query strings. It also requires site-wide updating for changes. Option 2 Create a naming system for your files src="script083010.js" . However the downside to option 1 is that this as well requires site-wide updates whenever a file changes. Option 3 Perhaps the most elegant solution, simply set up the caching headers: last-modified and expires in your server. The main downside to this is users may have to recache resources because they expired yet never changed. Additionally, the last-modified header does not work well when content is being served from multiple servers. Here a few resources to check out: Yahoo Google AskApache.com
