Quickest way to execute stored procedure in c# requiring least amount of code

I'm going to grab the results in a collection of entity. I don't just need the IDataReader object. So above should be answered considering that I've large no of parameters and many columns of data is getting returned by the SP. Please provide reasons. A few might be Drag and drop on to a DBML designer and then calling it by linq to sql. That's very good. But that also generates lot of code for the DBML. Simpler is better. Getting IDataReader by doing ExecuteReader and then passing IDataReader to factory to create it's object. Good and simple. But requires lot of coding. Below is required for each column returned. int nameIndex = dataReader.GetOrdinal("Name"); if (!dataReader.IsDBNull(nameIndex)){ myObject.Name = dataReader.GetString(nameIndex); } Are there any other simpler option for this? UPDATE @Heinzi's answer simplifies the process of handling the results. Is there any better way to handle large number of parameters also?
