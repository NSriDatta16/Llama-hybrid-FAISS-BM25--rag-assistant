LINQ to SQL Classes & Datacontext are not created

Afternoon all This is driving me nuts. For no apparent reason (of course there must be one), my web project will no longer generate LINQ to SQL classes/data contexts!!! I am going about the usual routine of right clicking the project, adding new item, selected LINQ to SQL classes, then dragging over a table from Server Explorer, saving and build but no...the bloody thing won't appear!!! Does anyone know why this might be happening/what have I done wrong?
