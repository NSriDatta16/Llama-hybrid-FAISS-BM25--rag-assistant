In Jet/ACE SQL you can't place a WHERE clause or ORDER BY on a field-name alias -- you have to repeat the expression the alias is referring to. So, replace this: SELECT title, (a1_Fname + a2_Fname) AS ColumnA, (a1_Lname + a2_Lname) AS ColumnB FROM books WHERE ColumnB LIKE '#firstletter#%' ORDER BY ColumnB ...with this: SELECT title, (a1_Fname + a2_Fname) AS ColumnA, (a1_Lname + a2_Lname) AS ColumnB FROM books WHERE a1_Lname + a2_Lname LIKE '#firstletter#%' ORDER BY a1_Lname + a2_Lname If you have Access installed, I strongly encourage you to test your SQL in interactive Access, in the QBE. You would quickly have discovered that this is the case if you'd just tried it within Access.
