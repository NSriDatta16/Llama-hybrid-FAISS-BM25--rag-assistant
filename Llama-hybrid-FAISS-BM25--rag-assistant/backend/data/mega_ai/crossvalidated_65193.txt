Why is ARMA used to model a stationary process?

Under certain condition, an ARMA model is stationary. But I was wondering why an ARMA model can (always?) be used to model a stationary process in time series? Is any stationary process an ARMA process? Or, for any stationary process, is there an ARMA process s.t. they are identical a.s., or have the same law, or they are the same in some other sense? Or for any stationary process, is there a sequence of ARMA processes which converges to the stationary process in some sense? Or is there a stationary process which is not a ARMA process, or cannot be modelled as ARMA?
