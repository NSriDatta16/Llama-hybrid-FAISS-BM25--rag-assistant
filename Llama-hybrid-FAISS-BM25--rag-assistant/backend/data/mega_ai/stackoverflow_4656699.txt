You can't reliably do this without window.open() and even then you need to create the fragment on that document , rather than the current (as some browsers don't allow cross-appending elements. It would look something like this: var win = window.open("","myWindow","...options..."); var frag = win.document.createDocumentFragment(); var div = win.document.createElement("div"); div.className = "Printable"; div.innerHTML = doc.body.innerHTML; frag.appendChild(div); You can test out a demo here .
