Direct use of Threads is actually discouraged - look at the package java.util.concurrent, you'll find there ThreadPools and Futures which should be used instead. Thread.join doesn't mean that the Thread waits for others, it means your main Thread waits for one of the Thread in list to die. In this case your main Thread waits for the slowiest working Thread to finish. I don't see a problem with this approach.
