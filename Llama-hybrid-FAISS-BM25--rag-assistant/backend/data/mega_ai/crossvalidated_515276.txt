This reduces to a simple case of Buffon's Needle problem . Let $\mathcal L$ be the last segment dropped onto the plane. It determines two translations: $\sigma_{\mathcal L}$ moves the plane a distance $L$ orthogonal to $\mathcal L;$ $\tau_{\mathcal L}$ moves the plane a distance $L$ parallel to $\mathcal L.$ The union of all the translates $\sigma_{\mathcal L}^m\tau_{\mathcal L}^n\, \mathcal L$ for integers $m,n$ is a set of parallel lines $\mathbb L$ spaced by $L:$ the setting of Buffon's Needle problem. Thus, when there are an average of $\rho$ centers of mass per $L^2$ area, the rate at which the initial random segments intersect one of these parallel lines is $2\rho/\pi.$ The translates $$\mathbb{L_2} = \{\sigma_{\mathcal L}^m\tau_{\mathcal L}^{2n}\,\mathcal L \mid m, n\in \mathbb Z\}$$ (with even powers of $\tau$ ) occupy half of these lines and the omitted half are just the $\tau$ -translates of $\mathbb{L_2}.$ In this figure, $\mathbb{L_2}$ is drawn in solid gray while $\tau\,\mathbb{L_2}$ is drawn with dashes. $\mathcal L$ itself is shown in red, with the translations $\sigma$ and $\tau$ shown as vectors. Since the random line segment process is homogeneous (in location and orientation), we may view it as a process on the torus $\mathbb{Z}^2 / \sigma\tau^2.$ The problem concerns the rate at which the random line segments intersect (the image of) $\mathcal L$ in this torus. But because the chance that any line segment intersects both $\mathcal L$ and $\tau\,\mathcal L$ is zero, the rate of intersection with $\mathbb{L_2}$ is half the rate of intersection with $\mathbb{L};$ that is, it is $\rho/\pi.$
