This is happening to you because the tags in the HTML fragment you load are not run by the browser; they're run by jQuery. The fragment, in fact, has to be explicitly combed for the tags. The library (jQuery, that is) adds the tags to the document once it's dropped the rest of the HTML fragment into the element you targeted. Because of that, the normal order-obeying browser behavior really has nothing to do with the situation. (Well, they're run by the browser, ultimately, but the orchestration of it is up to jQuery, and because of the semantics of dynamically-added tags, things go back to being asynchronous.)
