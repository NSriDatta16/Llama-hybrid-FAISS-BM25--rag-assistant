s that a color histogram can be also expressed as “three luminance histograms”, each of which shows the brightness distribution of each individual red/green/blue color channel. Characteristics of a color histogram A color histogram focuses only on the proportion of the number of different types of colors, regardless of the spatial location of the colors. The values of a color histogram are from statistics. They show the statistical distribution of colors and the essential tone of an image. In general, as the color distributions of the foreground and background in an image are different, there might be a bimodal distribution in the histogram. For the luminance histogram alone, there is no perfect histogram and in general, the histogram can tell whether it is over-exposure or not, but there are times when you might think the image is over exposed by viewing the histogram; however, in reality it is not. Principles of the formation of a color histogram The formation of a color histogram is rather simple. From the definition above, we can simply count the number of pixels for each 256 scales in each of the 3 RGB channel, and plot them on 3 individual bar graphs. In general, a color histogram is based on a certain color space, such as RGB or HSV. When we compute the pixels of different colors in an image, if the color space is large, then we can first divide the color space into certain numbers of small intervals. Each of the intervals is called a bin. This process is called color quantization. Then, by counting the number of pixels in each of the bins, we get a color histogram of the image. The concrete steps of the principles can be viewed in Example 1. Examples Example 1 Given the following image of a cat (an original version and a version that has been reduced to 256 colors for easy histogram purposes), the following data represents a color histogram in the RGB color space, using four bins. Bin 0 corresponds to intensities 0–63 Bin 1 is 64–127 Bin 2 is 128–191 and Bin 3 is 192–255. Example 2 Application in camera: Nowadays, some cameras have the ability to show the 3 color histograms when we take photos. We can examine clips (spikes on either the black or white side of the scale) in each of the 3 RGB color histograms. If we find one or more clipping on a channel of the 3 RGB channels, then this would result in a loss of detail for that color. To illustrate this, consider this example: We know that each of the three R, G, B channels has a range of values from 0 to 255 (8 bit). So consider a photo that has a luminance range of 0–255. Assume the photo we take is made of 4 blocks that are adjacent to each other and we set the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of original photo to be 10, 100, 205, 245. Thus, the image looks like the topmost figure on the right. Then, we overexpose the photo a little, say, the luminance scale of each block is increased by 10. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of new photo is 20, 110, 215, 255. Then, the image looks like the second figure on the right. There is not much difference between both figures, all we can see is that the whole image becomes brighter (the contrast for each of the blocks remain the same). Now, we overexpose the original photo again, this time the luminance scale of each block is increased by 50. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of the new photo is 60, 150, 255, 255. The new image now looks like the third figure on the right. Note that the scale for the last block is 255 instead of 295, for 255 is the top scale and thus the last block has clipped. When this happens, we lose the contrast of the last 2 blocks, and thus we cannot recover the image no matter how we adjust it. To conclude, when taking photos with a camera that displays histograms, always keep the brightest tone in the image below the largest scale 255 on the histogram in order to avoid losing details.
