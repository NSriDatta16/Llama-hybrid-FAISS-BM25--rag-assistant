Let $X_i$ be the number of beans added to the bucket at run $n,$ $n=1,2,3,\ldots.$ The total number of beans in the bucket after run $n$ therefore is $Y_n= X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_n.$ Since $X_n$ has a Bernoulli $(1/64)$ distribution, $Y_n$ has a Binomial $(n,1/64)$ distribution. Let $F_n(x) = \Pr(Y_n \le x)$ be its probability function. The chance that the bucket is filled to capacity after run $n$ is $$\Pr(Y_n \ge 8) = 1 - \Pr(Y_n \le 7) = 1 - F_n(7).$$ We therefore need to find the first (smallest) $n\gt 0$ for which $$1-F_n(7) \ge 50\% = \frac{1}{2}.$$ The search for this solution can be assisted by an estimate. For instance, the distribution of $Y_n$ will be closely approximated by a Poisson $(n/64)$ distribution, whose median is close to $n/64.$ We might therefore search for solutions between $n_0 = 7(64)$ and $n_1 = 8(64).$ Indeed, $$1-F_{7(64)}(7) \lt 0.40128 \lt \frac{1}{2} \lt 1-F_{8(64)}(7)\lt 0.54814,$$ suggesting $n$ is around $(0.548 - 0.5)/(0.548-0.401) = 0.33$ of the way between $7(64)$ and $8(64),$ or approximately $491.$ Indeed, $$1 - F_{490}(7) = 0.49887 \lt \frac{1}{2} \lt 0.50114 = 1-F_{491}(7)$$ shows $n=491$ must be the answer. Let's learn more by simulating the experiment. Here's R code to run it 10,000 times, storing how many beans are needed each time: n = 8) ) A histogram of the number of runs indicate it is indeed centered close to $n=491:$ The average number of runs in this simulation was 511, ranging from 95 through 1490. It helpfully shows us how variable the required number of runs is likely to be.
