Transform log posterior probabilities for Bayesian model averaging

I have four models, each one is run with MCMC on a large number phylogenetic trees. Each resulting model has an associated log posterior probability (sum of the log likelihood and log prior). Since I need to average the models weighting by their posteriors (bayesian model averaging) I need the original posterior probabilities. How can I standardize them from 0 to 1? Should I normalize among the four model for each tree? Also consider that my log posteriors are negative and very low ( Thanks in advance
