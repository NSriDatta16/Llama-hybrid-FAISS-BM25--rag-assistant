JavaFX is perfect for an offline rich application. I'm guessing you want to hear about the javafx.io.Storage and javafx.io.Resource which allow you to store application data offline, even without that security dialog because Java will store the data in a secure sandbox. You can check out the javafxdoc on this here Mark is right that you can also use any other Java-based method to store data locally on client machines.
