Yes it makes sense, a moving average makes the curve "smoother" in the sense that it's less sensitive to short variations. This usually makes it easier to observe the general tendency. You could also try different time periods for the average, e.g. 10 days or 15 days. It looks to me like there's a moderate increase trend in your data, but the variations are important and the time window is short, so it's too early to be sure. You could apply linear regression to confirm the increase.
