ASP.Net MVC Blog content storage

I'm creating a blog in asp.net mvc for learning purpose so please no answers telling me i should use an open source blogengine. I need to understand how is the blog content going to work. So i have a table called "Blog" with a column called "Content". The "Content" will hold the blog i.e. text and images etc. Now i have the following questions: What should be the datatype of content. Is this the correct way of doing it i.e. saving the blog in a record. What are the contants of this blog i.e. is it html with rich text and image urls and how does it actually work, i.e. where are these image urls be pointing to and how will my application render it. Thanks.
