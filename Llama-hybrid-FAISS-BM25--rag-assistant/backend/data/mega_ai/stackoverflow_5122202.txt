See the answers to the closely-related question: Call a JavaScript function defined in an iframe in Chrome using the file protocol . Briefly, launching Chrome with --allow-file-access-from-files "solves" the problem insofar as the error will not be reported. Of course, since you're distributing files on a CD, you're unlikely to view this an actual solution. I recommend starring Chromium bug 47416 to encourage the developers of Chromium to bring Chrome more into line with the behavior of Gecko.
