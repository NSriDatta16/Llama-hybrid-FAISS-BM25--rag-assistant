Using the decision values of an SVM is perfectly valid, in fact this is the standard approach. Platt scaling to obtain probabilities is essentially nothing more than running your SVM decision values $f(\mathbf{z})$ through the logistic function $l(x)$ to squash them into the $[0, 1]$ range: $$ \begin{align} f(\mathbf{z})&:\ \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R} \\ l(x) &= \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\beta x)}, \ \beta > 0 \\ l(f(\mathbf{z})) = (l \circ f)(\mathbf{z})&:\ \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto [0, 1] \end{align}$$ Note that you don't need probabilities at all to compute ROC curves, all you need is a ranking of the test set. As a direct result, any strictly monotonically increasing transformation (which preserves ranks) will have no effect on resulting ROC curves. You can find more details on ROC curves in one of my papers .
