In addition to the notation using the symbol $\sigma$ , the caption to one image names this function the "sigmoid" function. From the paper, Figure 3: Bounding boxes with dimension priors and location prediction. We predict the width and height of the box as offsets from cluster centroids. We predict the center coordinates of the box relative to the location of filter application using a sigmoid function. The "sigmoid" function is one of many names for a certain function. This name is especially common in the neural networks literature; for some elaboration, see Does the function $e^x/(1+e^x)$ have a standard name?
