Split it up. Use the fixed-XML storage file solution for the database connection, encrypted with .NET's built-in encryptor functions (do not roll your own). Then, using the resultant database connection, look up your 'settings table' in the database. This way you can modify your settings without a redeploy. If your customers need to be able to change the database connection string without visual studio, just write a small Windows Forms app that is capable of generating the encrypted connection string and saving the fixed-XML storage file, and, if necessary, also can connect to DB (via that same file) and modify the Settings table as the user needs.
