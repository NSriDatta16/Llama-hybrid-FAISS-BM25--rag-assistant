This is not really a "data science" question but more of a "(Python) programming" question. You can find more comprehensive answers at stackoverflow. Other than that, if you go to the source code of SwarmPackagePy.cso (I was not able to find any documentation), you will see that it creates an instance (object) of the cso class and what you get when you print this object is the location or address of this object in the memory.
