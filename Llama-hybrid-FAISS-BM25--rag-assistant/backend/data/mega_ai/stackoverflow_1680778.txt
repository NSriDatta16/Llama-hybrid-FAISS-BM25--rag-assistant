I didn't investigate ActiveRecord simply by the fact that according to independant serveys it does not perform as fast as many other ORMs and it does not have a full Linq implementation. DataObjects.NET requires that all your entities be derived from special classes, but in exchange for this you respectable performance and goodies like in-memory storage providers and the most complete Linq implementation going. I spend the afternoon sifting through the source code of DBLinq. My opinion is that it is immature (many of Linq-To-SQL's features are simply not implemented), and I wouldn't recommend it for production systems. So then... if you're looking for a free, fast, open source, LINQ compliant ORM then DataObjects.NET is a pretty safe bet.
