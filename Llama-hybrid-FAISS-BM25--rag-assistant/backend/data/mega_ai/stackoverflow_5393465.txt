Increase typing speed?

It has recently been brought to my attention that my typing skills leave much to be desired. I've been programming a few years in college now, and typing speed has never been very important. Classes do not focus on how much code you can output, but instead how to design and implement code. Now that I have a job however, demands have changed slightly and I think it in my benefit to increase my typing skills, at least a little bit! Do you have any suggestions for effective methods to increase typing skills?
