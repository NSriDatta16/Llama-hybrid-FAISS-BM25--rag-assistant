If you're running in a single thread, then you probably won't notice much difference. Performance always depends on the implementation rather than on the API specification. With Saxon, when you reuse a Transformer, it retains the cache of documents loaded using the doc() function. That may be good or bad depending on whether the next transformation is going to access the same source documents. Generally my advice is to use a new Transformer for each transformation, but using the same Templates object, of course.
