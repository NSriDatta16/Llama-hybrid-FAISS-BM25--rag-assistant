Predicting housing pricing with less than 1000 samples

Dataset link is here at Kaggle with 724 samples . We know that area and price columns probability distribution is symmetrical by Kaggle analysis. First I tried this regression models to check their accuracy with cross validation by fiting on the dataset: lasso = make_pipeline(RobustScaler(), Lasso(alpha =0.0005, random_state=1,tol = 0.1)) ENet = make_pipeline(RobustScaler(), ElasticNet(alpha=0.0005, l1_ratio=.9, random_state=3,tol=1.5)) GBoost = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=3000, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=4, max_features='sqrt', min_samples_leaf=15, min_samples_split=10, loss='huber', random_state =5) KRR = KernelRidge(alpha=0.005, kernel='polynomial', degree=2, coef0=2.5) But the score that I got in average wasnt above 40% . Second Attempt: I tried to remove warehouse columns because all values was 1 and correlation of warehouse column with price was near 0 . Again , I've got 40% accuracy by average(on all models that applied). Third Attempt : I tried to remove parking and elevator columns too , because nearly 90% of their data was equal to 1. Again , I've got 40% accuracy by average. Question: I think I should improve my models by selecting correct parameters but I don't know what is best parameters that I must use based on this dataset . Any ideas?
