This sounds pretty cool! I think you need the function imagecolorat ( link ) to get the color value of each pixel, then create the checkboxes (after first deciding which colors you would consider 'one' and 'nought'). Good luck! And if you have more specific questions, don't hesitate to ask. EDIT: Here is an example of someone determining the average color from an image. It's not the same as what you're doing, but you should be able to use much of it. EDIT 2: This ASCII art generator may just do almost exactly what you want to do.
