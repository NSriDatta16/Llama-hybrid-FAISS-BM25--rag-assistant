Metrics for multi-class problems in R caret package for various method tags

The caret package for R provides a variety of error metrics predominantly aimed at 2-class classification models with limited error metrics. Here is a multi-class function to allow caret:::train to calculate a wide variety of error metrics for multi-class problems. This works for method tags like knn, rf and gbm with the multiClassSummary function being assigned to summaryFunction of train method in caret. Whereas most of the other method tags are not working. I tried ada, svm, bayesglm and all gave the errors as follows: (Any help to fix this greatly appreciated or is there any generic function similar to twoClassSummary that works for all multi-class predictions?). R Code below: Here's the multi-class summary function require(compiler) #Based on caret:::twoClassSummary multiClassSummary R code using caret and train #####------------------------------ada----------------------------------------------- require('ada') require('caret') require('Metrics') load(iris) ir.dat Here's the error message: Error in { : task 1 failed - "'n' must be a positive integer >= 'x'" In addition: There were 16 warnings (use warnings() to see them) > warnings() Warning messages: 1: In eval(expr, envir, enclos) : model fit failed for Fold1.Rep1: iter= 50, maxdepth=4, nu=0.1 Error in ada.default(x = structure(c(4.7, 5.4, 5, 4.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.7, : Currently this procedure can not directly handle > 2 class response
