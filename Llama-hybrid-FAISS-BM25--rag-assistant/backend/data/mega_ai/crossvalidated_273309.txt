Logistic regression has the nice feature that the odds remain the same irrespective of the base probability. So the odds $e^{\beta_\mathrm{salary}}$ (more precisely this is the multiplicative odds ratio relative to the baseline odds $e^{\beta_0}$ per unit of salary) are the same whether you consider city 1 or city 2. Conversely you can consider the odds of leaving say city 1 relative to the baseline city 0 irrespective of the salary level. (Though consider that the expected salary level may vary across cities). When interpreting odds ratios, recall that odds are strictly positive numbers with values greater than one indicating odds increase. Odds can be difficult to interpret and Gelman and Hill (2006) provide some alternative ideas on interpreting the coefficients of logistic regression in chapter 5.2. Since money and salary and their units are familiar to every adult and in business context they are a likely candidate for intervention, it is useful to normalize other regression coefficients in terms of amount of money. Formally, we are evaluating a contra-factual causal quantity: all things being equal, what is the average amount of money, needed to match the change caused by some other non-monetary factor. For instance, if the probability of leaving is higher in city 1 than in city 2, one may ask what additional amount of money is required to pay each employee in city 1 so that the probability of leaving is the same in the two cities. This is given by $(\beta_1-\beta_2)/\beta_n$ in units of salary. Similar strategy can be used to compare across factors in terms of salary costs. Just note that this quantity depends on the baseline probability of leaving, so if, say, the average salary increases for the next period this quantity won't provide an accurate prediction.
