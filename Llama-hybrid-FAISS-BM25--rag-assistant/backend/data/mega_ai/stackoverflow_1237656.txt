One solution would be to bring the incorrect input to the user's attention so they can correct it. Rounding can be too much of an assumption depending on the context. Displaying an error message next to the amount something like this: "I'm sorry, we cannot supply you with 4.6 items. Please enter a whole number." ...or something along those lines. Another solution would be to avoid displaying error messages by restricting the input field to only allow valid input. ie If you don't want 4.6 items...only allow the user to be able to type 0-9. If the user can't enter incorrect input then there is never any reason to display an error message.
