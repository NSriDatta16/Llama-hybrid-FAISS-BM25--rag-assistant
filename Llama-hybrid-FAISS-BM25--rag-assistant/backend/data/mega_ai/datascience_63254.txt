How to extract sub sentences from sentence mentioning a particular subject?

I am trying to solve an NLP problem. For a given sentence like : "The Pasta was delicious, the Pizza was average" I want to extract the sentiment attached to food items. Having built my own NER model, I am able to extract Pasta and Pizza and hence the sentences containing them. But using a sentiment analyser on the entire sentence would be wrong in this case EXPECTED OUTPUT: Pasta - Good score Pizza - Average score CURRENT OUTPUT: Pasta - Kinda Good Score Pizza - Kinda Good Score I know I am getting this output because I am considering the same sentence for getting the sentiment attached to both the subjects in hand. Is there a way to extract the sub sentence like "Pasta was good" and "Pizza was average" to associate sentence with each item instead of whole sentences which I am currently doing ?
