I have an iphone application which uses dragging of annotations on a MapView, is this possible is the iPad?

I am trying to use: (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView annotationView :(MKAnnotationView *)annotationView didChangeDragState :(MKAnnotationViewDragState)newState fromOldState :(MKAnnotationViewDragState)oldState And was getting errors when building this for the iPad, but I have since realised that it is iOS 4 specific, so it won't work on the iPad. Is there anything similar that I can use for the iPad?
