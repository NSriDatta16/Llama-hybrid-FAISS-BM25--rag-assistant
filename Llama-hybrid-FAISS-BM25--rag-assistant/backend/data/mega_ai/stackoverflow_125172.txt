I've had the unfortunate experience of debugging this IE exception many different times while implementing a WYSIWYG editor, and it always arises from accessing a property on a DOM node (such as .parentNode) or passing a DOM node to a function (such as moveToElementText) while the DOM node is not currently in the document being rendered. As you said, sometimes the DOM node is a piece of a document fragment that has been removed from the "actual" DOM being rendered by the browser, and sometimes the node has simply not been inserted yet. Either way, there are a number of properties and methods on DOM nodes that cannot be safely accessed in IE6 until the node has been properly inserted and rendered in the "actual" DOM. The real kicker is that often this manifestation of IE6's "Invalid Argument" exception cannot be protected by try/catch.
