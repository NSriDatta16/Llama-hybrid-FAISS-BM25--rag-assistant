Javadoc: line breaks without HTML-tags?

Sorry for a probable FAQ kind of question, but I just can't find the answer. As far as I remember Eclipse, a blank line in a Javadoc comment is displayed (in in-source Javadoc popups) as a line break (with extra vertical spacing). In Netbeans, however, this is not the case. Can I configure Javadoc to interpret a blank line as a line break? Additional question: Can I override default Netbeans behavior (related to this) for in-source Javadoc popups? What I'm talking about is: Source /** * Paragraph One * * Paragraph Two */ void someMethod() { } Eclipse interpretation Paragraph One Paragraph Two Netbeans interpretation Paragraph One Paragraph Two
