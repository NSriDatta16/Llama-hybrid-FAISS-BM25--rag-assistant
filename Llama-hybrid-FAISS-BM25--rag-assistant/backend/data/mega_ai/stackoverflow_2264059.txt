How to incorporate DRAG feature in wxPython

I want to incorporate DRAG feature in program where in I can drag (hand cursor) the canvas which is placed on a panel. DRAG feature will help me see a full picture if the image is out of bound on the axis or if the image is zoomed in. Currently I am using wxmpl library which is a integration of matplotlib and wxPython. but it seems like this library does not have DRAG feature. Any help in this regards is appreciated. Thanks Damodar
