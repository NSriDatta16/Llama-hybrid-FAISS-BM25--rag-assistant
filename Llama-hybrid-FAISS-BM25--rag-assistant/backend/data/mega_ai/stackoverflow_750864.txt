Given the current state of HDD art, it just does not worth the effort trying to optimize text storage mechanisms: Document (ID, Name) and DocumentRevision (ID, DocumentID, Contents) tables will do the job. the ID in DocumentRevision may also serve as a "repository"-wide revision number. If this is not the behavior you want, assign a separate VersionID to each Document Revision.
