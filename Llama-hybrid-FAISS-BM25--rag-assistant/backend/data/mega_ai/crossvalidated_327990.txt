I would say you need to lay out more details to decide in this case. If you were looking within one company with only 100 male and 100 female employees (i.e., 200 employees total) that all had exactly the same job and all other relevant samples were the same and you were only concerned whether male employees had a higher average salary than female employees, then I would say calculating the means itself would be sufficient information to make a decision, at least in the first order. The 100 male and 100 female employees are your total population and so each group's mean represents the actual average salary. Hence, you can say whether in actuality your male employees have a higher average salary, and then you could make a decision what to do with the information. In reality, in any one company it is likely that not all male and female employees are equal in all relevant variables and there may be other biases in getting the data which would require controlling for these factors and possible hypothesis testing. Now, if the you had a sample of 100 male and 100 female employees from across all industries (effectively an infinite population size), within one industry (maybe also effectively infinite population size), within one company with thousands of employees, etc., then hypothesis testing is needed. You want to know whether there is a difference in the average salaries of men and women across the population , not just the sample, in order to make a decision. This is what the hypothesis testing is trying to do by using the samples to see if there is enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.
