Hierarchical data structures (trees) are visualized with treeview controls. There are built-in treeviews in ASP.NET and WinForms but given that you are looking for features such as editing and drag & drop, you might consider a commercial product. Commercial products will make the job of adding these features easier than using built-in controls. A favourite of mine are the Telerik controls. They sell WinForms, ASP.NET (and Silverlight) versions of treeviews. Telerik grids (RadGrid) also supports nesting of rows. If your hierarchical data has a known and limited depth and, especially, a meaning to each level of depth, then using the nested rows of a RadGrid (or similar product from another vendor) would work well too.
