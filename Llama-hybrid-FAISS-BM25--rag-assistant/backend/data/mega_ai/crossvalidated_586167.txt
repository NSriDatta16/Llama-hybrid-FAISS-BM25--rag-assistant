Estimating the percentage of a specific factor being related to a condition

I am working on a medical research project where I am trying to find the associations between specific maternal factors and neonatal limb ischemia (NLI) to declare the maternal factors as "risk factors for NLI". I am trying to find a way to estimate the percentage of a specific maternal factor being associated with NLI, but I am having a hard time figuring out how to make the estimates. The data is only on NLI patients. In terms of associations between maternal factors and NLI, the factors include maternal health problems, maternal age, maternal ethnicity, previous pregnancies and births, and maternal substance use (smoking, drinking, drug use, medications). I have a bit of a background in stats, but I am not sure what the best way is to calculate the estimates. I have a lot of data of 120 patient cases from around the world retrieved from papers. I have made an Excel of all the relevant information regarding each patient. The data is not perfect since it all comes from different papers, but I've tried to make an Excel where the information is organized in a consistent manner. I have an idea of what trends seem to show within my data sample but I don't know how to validate these trends by conducting an estimate. I have tried to think of ways to do the estimate, but I am not a stats expert. I thought that clustering might be helpful here to group the data, but I'm not sure what to do with the groups and if clustering would even help develop the estimate of the percentage. I am also still learning how to cluster, so I am hesitant to go this way. Are there any suggestions for simple techniques I should employ for the estimate?
