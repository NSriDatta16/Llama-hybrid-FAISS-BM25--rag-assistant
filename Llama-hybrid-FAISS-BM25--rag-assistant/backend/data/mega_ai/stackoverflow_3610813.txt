You might want to go over this article I read not too long back, it has a really good overview of the pro's and con's of organizing your css. I'd also take a look at the bottom of the article it has some links to some more information. From the looks of things your widget styles did seem to go a little overboard with the classitis, but at least its documented, I can't count the number of times I've seen undocumented css classes.
