There is a similar question regarding the division of data sets into subsets for machine learning: What is the difference between test set and validation set? The training data set is used for the training of your machine learning model (SVM in your case). The algorithm uses the data from the training data set to learn rules for classification/prediction. The testing data set is used for testing your model on data that was not used for training. So whether the rules learned by the training data set also apply to the testing data, therefore an error rate is computed. If you have a classification model for categorical classes , then a confusion matrix is used to estimate error rates ( Simple guide to confusion matrices ). For the classification of continuous classes the RMSD is often computed. For some basic rules on how to split your data into training and testing subsets see: Is there a rule-of-thumb for how to divide a dataset into training and validation sets?
