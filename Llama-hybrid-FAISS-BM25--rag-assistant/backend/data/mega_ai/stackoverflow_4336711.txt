How to force Emma code coverage report to ignore some methods?

Some methods, such as auto-generated getters, setters, equals and toString, are trivial for test. However, if they aren't added into the testing classes, the code coverage percentage (calculated using Emma) is reduced and may crash our system build. How can I force emma to ignore these methods in the code coverage percentage? Regards, Felipe
