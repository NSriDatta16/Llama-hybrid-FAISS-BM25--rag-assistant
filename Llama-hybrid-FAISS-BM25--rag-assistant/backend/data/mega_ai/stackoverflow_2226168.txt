robots.txt file as mentioned. If that is not enough then you can: Block unknown useragents - hard to maintain, easy for a bot to forge a browser's (although most legitimate bots wont) Block unknown IP addresses - not useful for a public site Require logins Throttle user connections - tricky to tune, you will still be disclosing information. Perhaps by using a combination. Either way it is a trade off, if the public can browse to it, so can a bot. Be sure you don't block & alienate people in your attempts to block bots.
