What is the *formal* definition of separation in *binary* logistic regression?

I am trying to understand complete and quasi complete separation in the context of logistic binary regression. However, I have not found a clear source. I know the seminal paper https://www.jstor.org/stable/2336390 but the definition is a bit hard to understand as it corresponds to multinomial logistic regression. Could someone point me to a reference for these definitions on binary regression or to put them here in an answer?
