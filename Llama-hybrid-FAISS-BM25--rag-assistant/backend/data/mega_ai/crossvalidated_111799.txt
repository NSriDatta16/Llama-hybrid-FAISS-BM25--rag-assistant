The matrix $P$ is, presumably, a transition matrix for a Markov chain. For some Markov chains, a stationary distribution exists. For your example, you get \begin{equation} P^{1000}=\begin{pmatrix} 0.1&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.1\\ 0.1&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.1\\ 0.1&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.1\\ 0.1&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.1\\ 0.1&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.1\\ 0.1&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.2&0.1\\ \end{pmatrix}. \end{equation} So you can see, informally, that a stationary distribution for the Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ exists. The basic idea for MCMC methods is that the stationary distribution is chosen to be the distribution you want to sample from. An MCMC algorithm then constructs a Markov chain that has the appropriate stationary distribution. The most commonly used MCMC algorithm is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with which the Gibbs sampler is a special case you can use when the full conditional densities of the target distribution are known. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis-Hastings_algorithm gives a good explanation of how it works and how to use it.
