Statistical test for continuous predictor variable, multiple binomial response

I have a dataset with hundreds of individual trees. These individuals were from seven sites that demonstrated different rates of land cover change over time (% change in area over 30 years). I'm looking to test how the rate of land cover change influences the growth trend of trees (outcomes for each individual could be positive, negative, or neutral - these are each columns in my dataset). A reviewer suggested that logistic regression would be most appropriate for this data, but I have not been able to find a method of performing a multiple logistic regression of some sort that works for multiple binomial predictors. I could run individual logistic regressions for each outcome, however this strikes me as potentially inflating error. Does anyone have suggestions as to a test that could be used for this sort of data, or would it be best to use something like a bonferroni correction? I'm working in R, if you have any specific suggestions for resources in the R programming environment! Thanks in advance.
