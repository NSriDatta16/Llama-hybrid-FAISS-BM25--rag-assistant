The Java environment (JVM + libraries) is better for concurrency than (C)Python, but Java the language sucks. I would probably go with another language on the JVM - Jython has already been mentioned, and Clojure and Scala both have excellent support for concurrency. Clojure is particularly good - it has support for high performance persistent data structures, agents and software transactional memory. It is a dynamic language but you can give it type hints to get performance as good as Java. Watch this video on InfoQ by Richard Hickey (creator of Clojure) on the problems with traditional approaches to concurrency, and how Clojure handles it.
