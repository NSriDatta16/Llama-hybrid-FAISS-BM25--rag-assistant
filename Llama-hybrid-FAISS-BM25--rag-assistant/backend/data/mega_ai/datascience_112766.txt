Predicting children growth

I am doing a project where I am supposed to forecast future athletes' performance one, two, three, etc. years in the future. The dataset consists of athletes' scores on tests done from they were kids until their current age and some historical athletes' entire career. There are several different tests, some of the tests are dependent on each other, and I want to forecast each test. I assume this is a multivariate time series forecasting problem, but I am not sure this is the best way to go. I have read that time series forecasting requires constant mean and standard deviation, which of course is not the case. What kind of ML models are most fitting to such a problem? Hope to hear from anyone.
