You can't set variable into selector definition. Definition can contain only function name. And number of colons will show compiler how much parameters this function required. Selector for button can have one argument - pointer to event-sender button. If you want to send some data from one controller to another you should create some shared storage for that data. I use for that purpose singleton class with mutable dictionary inside it.
