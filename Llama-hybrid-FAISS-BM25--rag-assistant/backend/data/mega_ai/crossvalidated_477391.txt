Each of the three parameters - Mean (M), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Standard Deviation (σ), calculated for a set, provide some unique information about the set which the other two parameters don't. σ loosely includes the information provided by MAD, but it isn't vice versa. Hence, σ is conveniently used everywhere. M => around which number the observations are centered. But a set can have its observations quite far from the mean, on an average, as compared to another set having the same mean. In order to get that information (i.e. the average distance of observations from its mean), we move to MAD. MAD => how far each observation individually is from the mean of all observations, but it doesn't tell how the observations are arranged in relation to one another. To get that information (i.e. the average distance of the set itself from its mean, which depends upon how the observations are arranged in relation to one another), we move to σ. σ => how far the complete set is from its mean (or, how far the observations are from each other). If you want to go deeper, have a look at my article here .
