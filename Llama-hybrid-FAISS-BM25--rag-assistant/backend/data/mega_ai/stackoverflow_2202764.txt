In Java, Thread local storage can be useful in a web application where a single request is typically processed by a given Thread. Take Spring Security for instance, the security Filter will perform the authentication and then store the users credentials in a Thread local variable. This allows the actual request processing code to have access to the current users request/authentication information without having to inject anything else in to the code.
