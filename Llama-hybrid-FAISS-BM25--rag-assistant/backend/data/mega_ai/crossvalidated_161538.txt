I am far from being an expert in Graphical Models but did some reading on them, including CRFs. From what I've read, first order linear chain CRFs are attractive as the inference is efficient and luckily - many problems can be mapped in this paradigm. The problems arises when we would like to work with general graphs. One of the problems with general graphs (undirected graphical models) is that inference gets intractable. Even if it is possible to exploit structure, the partition function becomes very difficult to compute. I would like to point to the generalization of undirected graphical models - Energy Based Learning [link] from Yann LeCun. One of the attractive properties is that this partition function is not needed anymore, we are working with energy values. The beauty is that many machine learning solutions can be mapped in energy based learning framework. This tutorial link on Energy Based Learning is brilliant. Although my background in machine learning is limited, the exposition of the material and the connections to the existing methods is very well laid out. There is a software called eblearn [link] . I did not manage yet to compile it successfully but I am eager to apply it on my problems. Perhaps it can be useful in your case as well.
