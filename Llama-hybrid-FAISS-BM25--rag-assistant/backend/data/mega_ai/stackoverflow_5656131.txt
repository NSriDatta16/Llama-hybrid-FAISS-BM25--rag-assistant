Most Cassandra clients will let you directly specify multiple server addresses, and will try them in turn if one fails. I haven't used phpcassa (only pycassa) but the API docs at http://thobbs.github.com/phpcassa/api/index.html seem to suggeest that you can specify multiple servers. Round-robin is another alternative as per the previous answer.
