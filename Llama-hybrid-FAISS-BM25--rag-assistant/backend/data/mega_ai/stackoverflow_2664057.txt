Java (Android) regular expression to strip out HTML paragraph

I have an Android application which grabs some data from an external XML source. I've stripped out some HTML from one of the XML elements, but it's in the format: Some text... Some more text Some final text I want to extract the middle paragraph text, how can I do this? Would a regular expression be the best way? I don't really want to start including external HTML parsing libraries.
