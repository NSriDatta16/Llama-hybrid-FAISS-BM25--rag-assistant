Expectation of $\ln(1 + e^x)$, where $x$ is normally distributed

I need to evaluate the following integral: $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\mathrm d x \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\nu}\right) \ln(1+e^x)$$ where $\mu$ is a finite real number and $\nu > 0$ . This is just the average value of $\ln(1+e^x)$ , when $x$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\nu$ . I think this might not have a closed form solution (but see https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3423097/10063 ). Anticipating that a closed form solution might not exist, are there any suggestions on how I can evaluate this numerically?
