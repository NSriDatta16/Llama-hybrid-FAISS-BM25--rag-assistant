Why do we need XGBoost and Random Forest?

I wasn't clear on couple of concepts: XGBoost converts weak learners to strong learners. What's the advantage of doing this ? Combining many weak learners instead of just using a single tree ? Random Forest uses various sample from tree to create a tree. What's the advantage of this method instead of just using a singular tree?
