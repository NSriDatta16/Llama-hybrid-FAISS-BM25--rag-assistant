The "Bayesian" in Bayesian optimization stems from the Bayesian updating of our beliefs about the shape of the function we are optimizing. Imagine we want to minimize $f(x) \colon R^D \to R$ . We start with prior beliefs about the shape of $f$ , let's call it $\hat{f}_0$ . Then, we evaluate the target function at some point, say $x_1 \in R^D$ . Now, we have learned about the value $f(x_1)$ . With this new information, we update our beliefs about $\hat{f}_0$ via Bayes rule. We have new beliefs, $\hat{f}_1$ , and we repeat. Note that I said "we evaluate the target function at some point $x_1$ ". But the question is which point to choose? The study of various strategies of choosing these points is known as "Bayesian experimental design." Why Bayesian? Because based on the prior, $\hat{f}$ .
