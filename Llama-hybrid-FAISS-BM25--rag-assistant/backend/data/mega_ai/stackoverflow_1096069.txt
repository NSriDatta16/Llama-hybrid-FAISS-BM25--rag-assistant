UITextView touch events not firing

I have a UITextView that I want to detect a single tap for. It looks like I would be fine with simply overriding touchesEnded:withEvent and checking [[touches anyObject] tapCount] == 1 , however this event doesn't even fire. If I override the 4 events like this: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; NSLog(@"touchesBegan (tapCount:%d)", touch.tapCount); [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touches moved"); } -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; NSLog(@"touchesEnded (tapCount:%d)", touch.tapCount); [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; } -(void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touches cancelled"); } I get output like this: > touchesBegan (tapCount:1) > touchesCancelled > touchesBegan (tapCount:1) > touches moved > touches moved > touches moved > touchesCancelled It seems I never get the touchesEnded event. Any ideas?
