I don't know about other technologies, but I can talk about using Silverlight with MVVM pattern. Using MVVM pattern along with command pattern, we have been able to unit test all of our C# code. I mean barring xaml code, we have a very high code coverage for our C# code. We actually use a modified version of MVVM wherein we also use a controller. If you ensure that you have no code in code-behind files, you can simulate button click/other such UI events. This is very useful for integration tests. We have found out that our pattern of MVVM along with controller and using command pattern facilitates unit testing.
