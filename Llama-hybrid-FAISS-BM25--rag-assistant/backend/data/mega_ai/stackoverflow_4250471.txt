There's no getting around the fact that windows in Silverlight are not full-blown Windows. There are third-party window controls (i.e. Telerik) that can behave like real windows, with resize, maximize, drag, and non-modal functionality. You could set up your application to "fake" Alt-Tab with a different hotkey combination of your choice. This would work only while the parent Silverlight app has focus.
