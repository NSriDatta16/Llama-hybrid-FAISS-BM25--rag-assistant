how to make webbrowser in .net use the latest internet explorer

Hi I am using Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET in MS Visual Studio 2010 Professional and I am embedding a web page into my application using a WebBrowser object, however it seems that the WebBrowser is using some old version of the Internet Explorer and I really need it to be using the latest Internet Explorer installed on the user's computer. How to make .NET use the latest Explorer?
