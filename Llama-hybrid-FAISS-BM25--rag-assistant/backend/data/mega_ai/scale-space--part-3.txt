asurement process, one has to apply operators of non-infinitesimal size to the data. In many branches of computer science and applied mathematics, the size of the measurement operator is disregarded in the theoretical modelling of a problem. The scale-space theory on the other hand explicitly incorporates the need for a non-infinitesimal size of the image operators as an integral part of any measurement as well as any other operation that depends on a real-world measurement. There is a close link between scale-space theory and biological vision. Many scale-space operations show a high degree of similarity with receptive field profiles recorded from the mammalian retina and the first stages in the visual cortex. In these respects, the scale-space framework can be seen as a theoretically well-founded paradigm for early vision, which in addition has been thoroughly tested by algorithms and experiments. Gaussian derivatives At any scale in scale space, we can apply local derivative operators to the scale-space representation: L x m y n ( x , y ; t ) = ( ∂ x m y n L ) ( x , y ; t ) . {\displaystyle L_{x^{m}y^{n}}(x,y;t)=\left(\partial _{x^{m}y^{n}}L\right)(x,y;t).} Due to the commutative property between the derivative operator and the Gaussian smoothing operator, such scale-space derivatives can equivalently be computed by convolving the original image with Gaussian derivative operators. For this reason they are often also referred to as Gaussian derivatives: L x m y n ( ⋅ , ⋅ ; t ) = ∂ x m y n g ( ⋅ , ⋅ ; t ) ∗ f ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) . {\displaystyle L_{x^{m}y^{n}}(\cdot ,\cdot ;t)=\partial _{x^{m}y^{n}}g(\cdot ,\cdot ;\,t)*f(\cdot ,\cdot ).} The uniqueness of the Gaussian derivative operators as local operations derived from a scale-space representation can be obtained by similar axiomatic derivations as are used for deriving the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel for scale-space smoothing. Visual front end These Gaussian derivative operators can in turn be combined by linear or non-linear operators into a larger variety of different types of feature detectors, which in many cases can be well modelled by differential geometry. Specifically, invariance (or more appropriately covariance) to local geometric transformations, such as rotations or local affine transformations, can be obtained by considering differential invariants under the appropriate class of transformations or alternatively by normalizing the Gaussian derivative operators to a locally determined coordinate frame determined from e.g. a preferred orientation in the image domain, or by applying a preferred local affine transformation to a local image patch (see the article on affine shape adaptation for further details). When Gaussian derivative operators and differential invariants are used in this way as basic feature detectors at multiple scales, the uncommitted first stages of visual processing are often referred to as a visual front-end. This overall framework has been applied to a large variety of problems in computer vision, including feature detection, feature classification, image segmentation, image matching, motion estimation, computation of shape cues and object recognition. The set of Gaussian derivative operators up to a certain order is often referred to as the N-jet and constitutes a basic type of feature within the scale-space framework. Detector examples Following the idea of expressing visual operations in terms of differential invariants computed at multiple scales using Gaussian derivative operators, we can express an edge detector from the set of points that satisfy the requirement that the gradient magnitude L v = L x 2 + L y 2 {\displaystyle L_{v}={\sqrt {L_{x}^{2}+L_{y}^{2}}}} should assume a local maximum in the gradient direction ∇ L = ( L x , L y ) T . {\displaystyle \nabla L=(L_{x},L_{y})^{T}.} By working out the differential geometry, it can be shown that this differential edge detector can equivalently be expressed from the zero-crossings of the sec
