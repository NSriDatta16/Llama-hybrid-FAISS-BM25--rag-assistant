Anomaly detection for time-series is often done using an autoencoder, and using the reconstruction error as the anomaly score. This has the advantage that it can learn feature representations, which makes it able to handle more complex patterns than a GMM is able to do. The autoencoder architecture would be some variant of a Convolutional Neural Network or Recurrent Neural Network. For vibration data it can operate directly on X,Y,Z amplitudes, or on a time-frequency (spectrogram) input. Note that it is possible to also use an autoencoder only for the representation learning, and passing the encoded features to a model such as a GMM.
