Flex/Air file dragging: how to restrict filetypes?

I'm using a and getting files dragged over a component like so: var arr:Array = event.clipboard.getData(ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT) as Array; I'm not sure how to restrict what type of files can be dragged. Is there a native control for this? The help documents mention the possibility of defining completely different ClipboardFormats, but I have no idea how to do that; I could run regex on the filenames as well, but that seems overcomplicated. Wondering if there's a way like with FileReference.browse to specify specific file extensions
