In order to check word.length (and the inclusion of any other fixed effect for that matter) using anova , you need to fit your models using ML rather than REML. You can find an exposition of this matter in the book lme4: Mixed-effects Modeling with R here (Chapt.2). (So set REML=F ) Additionally the two m.null you are using actually have different degrees of freedom themselves and as you have correctly said, they encode certain modelling assumption. That too can be tested in the same manner as described above. I wouldn't believe p -values all the much in the case of LME'S cause of the dispute over their correct degrees of freedom; Try to use MCMC sampling to get some pMCMC estimates. Check Bayeen's languageR package; and specifically the function pvals.func() ; it is a wrapper around lme4 's mcmcsamp() . Finally be reasonable: check the variance of your random effect(s); if it happens to be scales of magnitude smaller than the residual variance, it is almost surely insignificant no matter it is significant no matter the p -values one might produce.
