... we know the amount of alive, and dead agents at time step t-1, and t. But we can't model how the survival function had progress between that interval What you describe is a discrete-time survival model, for which there are well defined methods of analysis. Obviously the details of the survival function within each time period can't be determined, but there is no need to resign yourself to "biased" results that depend "heavily" on assumptions if your primary interest is in the associations between predictor variables and outcome. Such survival models can be handled as binomial regressions with "long-form" "person-period" data. For each time period there is a separate row of data for each at-risk individual, specifying the time period, the individual's covariate values in place for that period, and whether or not the individual experienced the event during that period. An individual no longer at risk after a last observation time has no data rows after the last observation time, which handles right-censoring in a very straightforward way. Search this site for pages discussing discrete-time survival; this page is one of many, with some links to further reading. In particular, if you use a complementary log-log link in the binomial regression, the results are those of a "grouped proportional hazards model." You get regression coefficients for associations of covariates with outcome just as you do for a Cox proportional hazards regression in continuous time (which, as another answer notes, is seldom truly "continuous" in practice, anyway), under the same proportional hazards assumption. See this page for an outline of the approach, with a link to a detailed text on discrete-time survival models.
