xml with cdata html sections using jaxb to convert to java objects ...is it possible to render the html?

I have an xml document that I used JAXB to ultimately have struts2 display in a webpage. This document at a high level contains CDATA sections that are paragraphs that contain some HTML. The java object returned is a list of the paragraph objects whose text gets turned into strings. When I display them in the JSP I get the paragraphs outputted to the screen and they contain HTML but it is not rendered. I have found answers on here about removing HTML from java strings but nothing like this. I also don't have control over the XML document I only consume it.
