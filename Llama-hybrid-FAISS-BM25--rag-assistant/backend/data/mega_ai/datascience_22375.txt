As far as I know it's mostly about the computational aspect which was improved, so it's still a proper method to measure similarity between sequences. I recommend this as a good reference, specially section 4.3. Here is the bold part of this section: A warping path W is a set of contiguous matrix indices defining a mapping between two time series. Even if there is an exponential number of possible warping paths, the optimal path is the one that minimizes the global warping cost. DTW can be computed using dynamic programming with time complexity O(n2) [Ratanamahatana and Keogh 2004a]. However, several lower bounding measures have been introduced to speed up the computation. Keogh and Ratanamahatana [2005] introduced the notion of upper and lower envelope that represents the maximum allowed warping. Using this technique, the complexity becomes O(n). It is also possible to impose a temporal constraint on the size of the DTW warping window. It has been shown that these improve not only the speed but also the level of accuracy as it avoids the pathological matching introduced by extended warping [Ratanamahatana and Keogh 2004b]. The two most frequently used global constraints are the Sakoe-Chiba Band and the Itakura Parallelogram. Salvador and Chan [2007] introduced the FastDTW algorithm which makes a linear time computation of DTW possible by recursively projecting a warp path to a higher resolution and then refining it. A drawback of this algorithm is that it is approximate and therefore ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 45, No. 1, Article 12, Publication date: November 2012. 12:18 P. Esling and C. Agon offers no guarantee to finding the optimal solution. In addition to dynamic warping, it may sometimes be useful to allow a global scaling of time series to achieve meaningful results, a technique known as Uniform Scaling (US). Fu et al. [2008] proposed the Scaled and Warped Matching (SWM) similarity measure that makes it possible to combine the benefits of DTW with those of US. Other shape-based measures have been introduced such as the Spatial Assembling Distance (SpADe) [Chen et al. 2007b]; it is a pattern-based similarity measure. This algorithm identifies matching patterns by allowing shifting and scaling on both temporal and amplitude axes, thus being scale robust. The DISSIM [Frentzos et al. 2007] distance has been introduced to handle similarity at various sampling rates. It is de- fined as an approximation of the integral of the Euclidean distance. One of the most interesting recent proposals is based on the concept of elastic matching of time series [Latecki et al. 2005]. Latecki et al. [2007] presented an Optimal SuBsequence matching (OSB) technique that is able to automatically determine the best subsequence and warping factor for distance computation; it includes a penalty when skipping elements. Optimality is achieved through a high computational cost; however, it can be reduced by limiting the skipping range.
