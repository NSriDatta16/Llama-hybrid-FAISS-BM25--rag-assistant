Yes; it will affect the results. Logistic regression fits an MLE by minimizing an objective function which is evaluated at all the data points. If the data is unbalanced then the minimization will be unbalanced too. While your example is not extreme, you will get different answers if you re-balance. A good explanation of this and how to address it is in King and Zeng, http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0s.pdf .
