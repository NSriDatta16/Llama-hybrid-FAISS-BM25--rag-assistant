Course for Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Considering the fact that Andrew Ng played a major role in the development of LDA, I find it surprising that there is no video with him explaining it, similar to his machine learning course. Is there any good tutorial that explains both the theory and implementation of LDA like his machine learning courses?
