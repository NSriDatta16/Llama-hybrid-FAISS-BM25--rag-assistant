What you are looking for is an Interaction between your slope variable and the age variable. In R this can be done with the formula syntax, which is somewhat poorly described in the documentation of help(formula) , and maybe slightly better described in the comments of my answer here (no promises). Your formula Average ~ Event + Age + group states "Let average be linearly dependent on event, age and group". For an interaction you would use the : , * , ^ or | descriptors depending on what you want to model. For your case you likely want Average ~ Event + Age*group which is equivalent to Average ~ Event + Age + group + Age:group , letting each group having a different Intercept and slope. From a statistical point of view this is often also the most sensible, as this allows each group to have a different intercept, and most models don't have a logical reasoning for this not being the case. Alternatively if age is Nested in group, (each group is a specific age group) you could use Average ~ Event + Age|group with equivalent Average ~ Event + Age + Age:group . This basically translates to removing group dependent intercepts, and often becomes much less reasonable. For extra confusion, Age*group is also equivalent to (Age+group)^2 in R formula terms. This basically expands the parenthesis to the second order interactions while ^3 would add interactions up to the third order (2 and 3 variable interactions) Edit to accommodate comment. The OP would like to know either the average of Event grouped by group or maybe the %-change of the predicted value. In either case this can be achieved using tapply or a for loop. I will assume the data is called dat for this example. tapply: #Average of Average by event given group tapply(X = dat$Average, INDEX = dat$group, FUN = mean) #3, 0, 12, 15 #Percentage change (securely) Percentage_Change This is equivalent to using a for loop as below groups
