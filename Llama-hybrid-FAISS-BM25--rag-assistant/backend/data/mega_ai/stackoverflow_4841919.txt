You basically need to do as it asks in the exception: To ensure that the texture is not set on the graphics device, put this at the end of Draw : GraphicsDevice.Textures[0] = null; To ensure you are not drawing inside a tiling bracket, do not use SetData inside of Draw at all. Move the call to SetData into Update . Bonus info: Your out-of-memory error is because you are not releasing the unmanaged resources that Texture2D allocates (the garbage collector can't track them, so it doesn't know you're running out of memory). You need to call Dispose on the texture. However making a new texture each frame is a bad idea anyway (there's no way to avoid the performance and memory fragmentation problems it causes).
