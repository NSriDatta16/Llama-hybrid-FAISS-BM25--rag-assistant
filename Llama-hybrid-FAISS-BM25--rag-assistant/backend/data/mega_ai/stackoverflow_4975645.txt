I think you want: double averageDays = list .Skip(1) .Zip(list, (next, prev) => (double)next.Subtract(prev).Days) .Average(); Do note that this is a lossy average. Are you sure you don't want to use TotalDays instead? EDIT: The way this works is to overlay the sequence with a 'one-deferred' version of the sequence, which makes it easy to calculate consecutive deltas. Then it's just a matter of averaging the deltas up to produce the result. For comparison, a 'faithful' translation of your existing code would look like: double averageDays = Enumerable .Range(1, list.Count - 1) .Average(i => (double)list[i].Subtract(list[i - 1]).Days);
