The service should be an abstraction of the data. Whether that data is pulled from a WS, DB, etc...should be irrelevant. Each ViewModel can contain a property which will be bound to by the View. That property can be an ObservableCollection which wraps a call to the service. That data may in fact be cached via the service and only update periodically but either way it will push the data to a single point of reference for retrieval amongst the ViewModels.
