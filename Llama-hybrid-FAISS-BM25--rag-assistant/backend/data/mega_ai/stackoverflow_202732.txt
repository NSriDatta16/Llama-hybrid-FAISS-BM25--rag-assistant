I don't believe that CnnPool='Yes' was supported officially in PB 9. I'm not sure that most PB developers are all that familiar with how to deal with pools. ASP.Net's approach is simple and straight forward at least compared to my experience with some Java app servers. (Please don't start a flame war on that last sentence, I said my experience). I have written a "server" application that received PB datastores that were executed for ds.retrieve() and ds.update() and passed the data back to the client PB app. It was a way to pool. The server application would open multiple connections... I did this in PB 8 (there's a book out there somewhere). I wouldn't recomment this approach... lot's of code. In PB 11.x, there are some cool new approaches that you should consider.
