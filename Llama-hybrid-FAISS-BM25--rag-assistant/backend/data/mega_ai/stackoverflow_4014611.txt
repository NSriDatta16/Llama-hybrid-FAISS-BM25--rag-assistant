Let's face it, if security isn't owned by EVERYONE, then it will be owned by NO ONE. (I believe Ricky Bobby said that first). The issue is a cultural one. Most organizations give great lip-service to security but do a poor job implementing it simply because they don't understand it well. When you consider how simple it can be to handle the top ten security vulnerabilities , it is inexcusable not to. Because it really is easy once you 'get it'. Quick example: Your sensitive app needs to be protected against packet sniffers like Fiddler. You must Turn on SSL/TLS to protect it between the browser and the client. That's the responsibility of the UI layer you mentioned in the question. Enable the WS-* stack between the web server and your business service layer. That is the responsibility of the business service layer guy. Enable WS-Secure between the business service layer and the data layer. The data layer guy has to do that. And you need to implement a service broker or use keys in the database. Here's a link for all that. That must be done by the DBA. All of it needs to be coordinated by your manager and designed by your architect. So you see, it MUST be done throughout the group and therefore must be a cultural topic, not just another box to be checked. Hey, I feel your pain in getting this done. Props to you for raising the bar!
