ordinal logistic regression & t-test

I'm currently working on a statistics paper for practice (complete beginner here) and need to "test the hypothesis with a t-test". Unfortunately, most of my data is ordinal (because it's from WVS 6th wave), and I'm confronted with a lot of situations we didn't get to discuss in class. I figured that an ordinal logistic regression is probably what I need and after using the following commands in R (V9 is ordinal, 1 highest and 4 is the lowest, V19 is a dummy variable with 1 and 2 and V242 stands for age, which I'm trying to use as a control variable): m This is what I get: Value Std. Error t value p value V9 0.45377983 0.090965416 4.9884874 6.085389e-07 V242 -0.03070772 0.004117975 -7.4569958 8.851753e-14 V19 0.06250584 0.164261954 0.3805254 7.035555e-01 1|2 -0.08301606 0.324161077 -0.2560951 7.978774e-01 2|3 2.78367366 0.355122209 7.8386358 4.554675e-15 3|4 4.48110377 0.477055113 9.3932622 5.817009e-21 4|5 5.87434596 0.776298722 7.5671205 3.815880e-14 OR 2.5 % 97.5 % V9 1.574251 1.3182585 1.883566 V242 0.969759 0.9618787 0.977542 V19 1.064501 0.7713671 1.469292 Now, I'm not so much confused by the "value" or the OR (or at least I think I'm not) but I don't quite know what to do next (if I want to conduct a t-test?)... Also, is there anything I did, that maybe shouldn't be done? I'd be very grateful for your help and please let me know if there's anything I need to specify. Thanks so much!
