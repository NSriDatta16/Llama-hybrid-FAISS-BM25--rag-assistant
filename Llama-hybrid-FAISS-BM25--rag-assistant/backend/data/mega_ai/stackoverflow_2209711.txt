Translating mouse X & Y to 3D model coordinates

I'm building a simple 3D drag and drop interface in processing, and want to detect when the mouse rolls over an object. I would imagine that I need to do some matrix translations to the 3D model coordinates to get them into screen space and so on ... I have a simple version of this working, the problem is that when camera is moved around the scene the coordinates I get go haywire. So how do I translate the tile coordinates into screen space (since the screenX & screenY aren't working properly)? UPDATE: I eventually found two examples from the Processing site on how to do this. Thanks to villintehaspam . http://processing.org/hacks/hacks:picking
