The lightbox content isn't like another tab or window: it becomes part of the host page. In other words, it incorporates the HTML generated by contactform.aspx into the host page's document object model (DOM). Activating the lightbox adds a form to the host page that posts to the contact page: When the user submits, their browser issues a new request: a POST to contactform.aspx . That request returns the contact form 's HTML. There are several ways you might work around that: Use ajax to perform the update asynchronously. (You might even be able to do this by using an UpdatePanel in contactform.aspx , but I don't use them much anymore and haven't though that through). Convert contactform.aspx into a control (if you're using it in several places) and embed it in the host page. At the end of the contact form's submit handler, redirect to the host page with a flag that instructs the page to immediately activate the lightbox. (This has numerous issues and sounds pretty fragile ... but it's plausible.)
