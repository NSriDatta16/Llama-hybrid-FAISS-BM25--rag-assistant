Depending on what kernel you use, you cannot possibly compute $\mathbf{w}$ (the separating hyperplane in feature space ) explicitly. For the RBF kernel, for example, $\mathbf{w}$ is infinite dimensional. Instead, what you can compute is the inner product of $\mathbf{w}$ and the test instance $\mathbf{z}$ embedded in feature space $\phi(\mathbf{z})$ as follows $\langle \mathbf{w}, \phi(\mathbf{z})\rangle = \sum_{i\in SV} \alpha_i y_i K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{z})$. If your question is whether or not you can compute the decision value , you can do that as follows: $$f(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{i\in SV} \alpha_i y_i K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{z}) +b.$$ In libsvm, the sv_coef variable contains the vector $\alpha_i y_i$.
