"I'm also surprised that this kind of thing isn't in the .Net Framework itself." There is. Although not complete, elegant or performant. You can use create a generic proxy that inherits from RealProxy and perhaps takes in the object to be proxied. To get the proxy, you obtain a transparentproxy from your realproxy and cast it you your wrapee's (is that a word?) type. Now you have a proxy. All methods on the proxy can be handled in an overridden Invoke(IMessage msg) in your RealProxy. Pass them as is to your real object (wrapee) or do whatever else inbetween. Cavets: Your object to be proxied has to inherit from MarshalByRef. It is fairly slow. I wouldn't use it for often used functionality. This is all the remoting infrastructure at play here. ILgen is the better way in most cases, but there are some cases where I have had to use above said method.
