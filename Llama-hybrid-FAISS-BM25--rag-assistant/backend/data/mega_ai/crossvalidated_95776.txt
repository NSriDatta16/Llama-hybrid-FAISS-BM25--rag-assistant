Here is a video I found that would be closest to what you are looking for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3liCbRZPrZA It shows SVM being applied to 3D. It is very difficult to graphically visualize dimensions higher than 3 and would usually cause more confusion. With higher dimensions all I would use is vectors to and show significant points but this only would make sense if someone understands how it works in lower dimensions
