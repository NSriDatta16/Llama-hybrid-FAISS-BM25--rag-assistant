This warning means that the iterative routine used by LIBSVM to solve quadratic optimization problem in order to find the maximum margin hyperplane (i.e., parameters $w$ and $b$) separating your data reached the maximum number of iterations and will have to stop, while the current approximation for $w$ can be further enhanced (i.e., $w$ can be changed to make the value of the objective function more extreme). In short, that means the LIBSVM thinks it failed to find the maximum margin hyperplane, which may or may not be true. There are many reasons why this may happen, I'd suggest you to do the following: Normalize your data. Make sure your classes are more or less balanced (have similar size). If they don't, use parameter -w to assign them different weights. Try different $C$ and $\gamma$. Polynomial kernel in LIBSVM also has parameter 'coef0', as the kernel is $$\gamma \cdot u' \cdot v + \text{coeff}_0^{\text{ degree}}$$ It's a good idea to search optimal $C$ on a logarithmic scale, like you do. I think for normalized data the search range for $C$ that you suggested should be OK. A useful check: the accuracy of the classifier should not be changing much on the borders of that range and between two values of your set. If it does, extend the range or add intermediate values. Note that LIBSVM distributive for Windows should contain a Python script called grid.py, which can do parameter selection for you (based on cross validation and specified search ranges). It can also produce contour plots for the accuracy of SVM. This tool may be quite helpful.
