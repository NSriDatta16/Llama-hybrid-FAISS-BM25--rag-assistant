How to know which rules were applied to predict one sample in trained decision tree model?

I have trained Random Forest Regressor from sklearn. I am able to return text representation from each Decision Tree rule using tree.export_text (sklearn documentation here ). But it shows rules for the model trained using the whole train set, rather than rules that were applied to predict values of given sample. Of course, I can go through each rule and check if it fits to the data from my sample, but when the decision tree returns 150 rules, it becomes a really hard job. I would be grateful for any ideas! Thank you :) Answer: Using a tree attributes and code from sklearn documentation I was able to find rules that were used to predict a given sample.
