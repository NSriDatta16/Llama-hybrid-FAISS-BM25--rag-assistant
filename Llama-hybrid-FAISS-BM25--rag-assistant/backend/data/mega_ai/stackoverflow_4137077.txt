C and assembly project suggestion needed for class on low-level software

I have a class on low-level programming which requires a final project (syllabus at the end). It is basically a piece of software that puts to use all you learned. I had a few ideas, like designing my own Roguelike (should be kind of like NetHack , only single-player), but I'd like some suggestions on alternatives. It needn't be a game; it can be anything. The time frame is a month and a half, and I have other projects, etc. so it shouldn't be too time-consuming to implement. Requirements: Use, at least, four I/O devices, one of which should be the mouse or serial port Some of those devices should use interrupts, others should use polling Languages: C and Assembly (mandatorily, else there is a penalization) Implement state machines The peripherals we were lectured on were: Graphics card - Graphical mode Graphics card - Text mode Mouse Keyboard Real Time Counter On-board Speaker (via timers 0 and 2) Serial port This is the abridged syllabus: Input/Output peripherals and their operation Direct mapping in a process address space Access to peripherals in polled mode and by interrupt Processor interrupts in the IA-32 architecture and the interrupt controller. Writing interrupt service routines in Assembly and in C Study of some typical personal computer peripherals, such as keyboard, mouse, graphics card, real time clock, timer, loudspeaker and serial port. Programming in the C programming language: main differences with respect to C++ language; structured programming in C. Memory layout of a process. Function calls: mechanisms, parameter passing, storage of local variables and return values. Combined programming in C and the IA-32 processor family assembly. Creation and use of libraries. Static linking of object code. Use of software development tools: gcc, make, gdb, ar, prof, diff, patch and SVN
