As has been stated well by others the simplest answer to the original question is that "flat" priors are not realistic. Imagine doing a Bayesian power simulation relating to detecting an effect quantified by an odds ratio greater than 1.0, when the prior distribution of the log OR is flat. For the first simulated experiment we might draw an odds ratio of $10^5$ and get a Bayesian power of 1.0. Not interesting or realistic. On a separate note, people frequently state that under "flat" priors Bayesian and frequentist methods are alike. This is true only in the very special case where there is a fixed sample size and one takes only one "look" at the data--at the end of the study at the planned sample size. So we need to downplay these types of comparisons (not to mention the Bayesian interpretation of the result being drastically different from the frequentist interpretation).
