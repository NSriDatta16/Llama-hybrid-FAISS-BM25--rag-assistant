Is it possible to have a Jquery Draggable object under an other div

I'm attempting to create a template system where an uploaded jpg is then placed on a template. Test example: http://www.silverink.com/TEMP/jqueryTest/ The problem is that I want to have a mask on the top most layer but be able to click and drag the lower layer. At present I'm having to either click the area to bring it to the fore then drag or have it at the fore transparent. Any ideas or suggestions most welcome!!
