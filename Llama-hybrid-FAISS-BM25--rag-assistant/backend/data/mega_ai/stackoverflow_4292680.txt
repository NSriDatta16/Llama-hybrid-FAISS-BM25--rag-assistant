first - I believe you should be making the UL droppable instead of the DIV, otherwise you LIs will end up outside the UL (you can style the UL to fill the whole DIV, so it will still trigger the droppable part when an element is above it) $("#selected ul.sortable-list").droppable({ ...... }); second and third - you have the ELSE part where you're setting revert to false commented out... is that just for this example or did you forget the comment there? (which would be the cause why it doesn't work) } else { // $("#container li").draggable({ revert: false }); } also - have you tried Firebug to check you REALLY don't have those LIs in the selected DIV once you drag them out?
