present in 1998, however its popularity among developers grew after 2005. Cloud and artificial intelligence Nowadays, data management has transferred over from local storage to the cloud. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Salesforce and Amazon popularized the concept of internet-based services, which appealed to customers as it reduced in-house maintenance costs and increased flexibility in changing the needs of a business. With the rising prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI), it is now easier than ever to store and sort through immense sets of data. It is in this era that DMPs have experienced their rise to prominence as the astronomical amount of user data in the world can now be processed and presented to companies for marketing purposes. Data pipeline DMPs first begin by gathering raw data. This requires data collection from various sources such as webpage visits and registration forms found online. Moreover, the available data is not limited to one's computer, as mobile devices, social networks, and smart devices all act as constant sources of raw data. From a technical standpoint, JavaScript trackers and APIs are used to inform the server when the user is performing an action that should be recorded and stored. Once the DMP has collected the data, it moves on to then process and integrate all of it. It first cleans the data by filtering out any junk or missing values. Then, it utilizes machine learning algorithms to find patterns across sets of users and organize them on a broad scale. This helps create a 360 degree customer view which in turn helps to integrate first-, second-, and third-party data types into one database. Next comes the data management phase. Here, the DMP assists its clients - which are other companies seeking to leverage their user data - in creating user profiles. User profiles are segments of specific customer demographics that are intended to help visualize patterns and tendencies across an industry. They are also useful for shedding light on undiscovered market opportunities. The final step in this process is the activation stage. Once all the data has been gathered, processed, and properly organized and segmented, it is put into use in the marketplace through servers or DSPs. From here, advertisers uses other third-party services to access a DMP and provide targeted content to their intended audiences. Functionalities DMPs are used for profiling, analyzing, and targeting online customers in digital marketing. They work in the following areas: Ad targeting – creating audience segments and targeting specific users with personalized ad campaigns, such as displaying advertisements for cars to users who demonstrate interest in buying a new car. User profiling – representing real people using sets of data on user related information, such as needs, interests, and behaviors. Profiles can be created manually or through machine learning algorithms that automatically analyze and profile internet users. Look-alike modeling – identifying new clients who behave similarly to current customers for targeted ad campaigns. Business insights – discovering new insights about customers and services through data analysis, as well as supplementing existing CRM systems with additional external data, such as users’ attributes or their interactions with online products. Content and product recommendations – using DMP recommendations to develop a personalized experience for all users. Monetizing or selling data – selling DMP data to generate additional revenue. Audience enrichment – analyzing and getting to know an audience through DMP analytics to know their specific needs. Grow your customer base – discovering a new customer segment with DMP analytics and growing awareness and brand loyalty.
