Error in boxcox.default(y ~ x) : response variable must be positive

Error in boxcox.default(y ~ x) : response variable must be positive I am getting this error in R when I am performing a Box-Cox transformation on data. Why is this error happening? Here is my data . This is a time series data and I have to perform logarithmic regression of the form: $$y=a+b(\log x_1)+c(\log x_2)$$ I need to find a, b, c and then, check if any such type of relation exists or not.
