You should frame your problem as ordinal regression . Then the model would predict target value, one of the five integer values. As a result, the evaluation would not be best done with Root Mean Square Error (RSME). Chi-Square test could be applied between expected and predict counts for each of the five value levels. If you want to then add in other model types, find the ordinal analogs (ordinal SVM or ordinal decision tree). The same Chi-Square test based on counts can be applied to find the best model.
