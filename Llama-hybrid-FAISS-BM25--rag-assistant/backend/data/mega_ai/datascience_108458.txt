Dealing data imbalance without sampling techniques

I am working on a binary classification with 977 rows (77:23) with label 1 being the minority class. I tried Random forest and it seems to work well. with a recall of 60% for minority class. But I would like to increase further. Currently based on my research and discussion in the forum, am not interested in using any oversampling techniques. So, I am trying the below a) class_weight, scale_pos_weight b) F1-score as the metric c) optimizing decision threshold (and not default 0.5) Is there any other options that I have to handle class imbalance? Can you please help me on how can I improve the data balance? unfortunately, we cannot collect more data.
