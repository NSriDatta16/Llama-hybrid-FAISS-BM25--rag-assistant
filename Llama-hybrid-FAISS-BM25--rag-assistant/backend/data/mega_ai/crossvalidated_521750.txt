Admittedly, this is a VERY old post, but based on the code snippets provided by user3466398, the difference is that repeatedcv does exactly that: it repeatedly performs X-fold cross-validation on the training data, i.e. if you specify 5 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation, it will perform 10-fold cross-validation on the training data 5 times, using a different set of folds for each cross-validation. The rationale for doing this, I presume, is to allow one to have a more accurate and robust accuracy of the cross-validation testing, i.e. one can report the average CV accuracy.
