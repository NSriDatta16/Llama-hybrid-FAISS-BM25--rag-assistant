You can instantiate a class dynamically using Reflection, with Activator.CreateInstance . Activator.CreateInstance("MyAssembly", "MyType"); However I'm not entirely clear on what you're trying to do. If you already have a class called Averages, what do you need dynamically instantiated? And I'm a bit worried by what you mean that it's "tied to a class that handles everything"...
