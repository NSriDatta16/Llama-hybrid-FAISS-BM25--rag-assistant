IE doesn't pay attention to z-index in an intuitive way when it comes to positioned elements. If you move your #listform element to the end of the code (just before ) IE should render things properly. Alternatively, you can place your #listform element inside the end of your #body-wrapper (just before the .) This will place the element higher in the stack than all the items it needs to overlap. Since the width of the #body-wrapper is fixed, it should provide a stable offset calculation regardless of user window size.
