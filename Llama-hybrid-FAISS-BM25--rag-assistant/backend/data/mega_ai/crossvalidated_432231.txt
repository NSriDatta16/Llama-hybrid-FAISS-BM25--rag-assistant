Comparison of MAE and Mean to illustrate the error magnitude

I have predicted a time series with positive, zero and negative values. As error measurement I used the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In order to give the reader of my paper a better understanding whether the values of MAE are good or bad, I have considered presenting it as follows: Is it legitimate to present it this way? Or is it actually meaningless because of the negative values?
