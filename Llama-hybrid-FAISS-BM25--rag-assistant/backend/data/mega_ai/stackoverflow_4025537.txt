how can I drag nested UL's in jQuery's UI?

I have the following setup: column1 window1 link1 link2 window2 window3 link3 link4 column2 window4 column3 window5 window6 What I want with this is be able to drag links to window classes, and windows to columns. Eventually I will add a tab, windows will need to be able to dragged to tabs as well. I'm trying to this using UI. I have a sample set up at www.linkshelf.com/jQuery/index.html . The window dragging works the way I want, but when I start to drag links the layout gets all wrong. Anybody knows what I'm doing wrong here, and what I need to do to be able to drag nested UL's? If I make the columns sortable by adding $('_column').sortable(); the columns sort the way they should, but the windows and the links go bezerk...
