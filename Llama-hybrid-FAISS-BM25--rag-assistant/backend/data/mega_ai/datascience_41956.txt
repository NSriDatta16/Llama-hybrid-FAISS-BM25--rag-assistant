How to make my Neural Netwok run on GPU instead of CPU

I have installed Anaconda3 and have installed latest versions of Keras and Tensorflow. Running this command : from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib print(device_lib.list_local_devices()) I find the Notebook is running in CPU: [name: "/device:CPU:0" device_type: "CPU" memory_limit: 268435456 locality { } incarnation: 2888773992010593937 ] This is my Nvidia version: nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver Copyright (c) 2005-2018 NVIDIA Corporation Built on Sat_Aug_25_21:08:04_Central_Daylight_Time_2018 Cuda compilation tools, release 10.0, V10.0.130 running nvidia-smi, I'm getting this result: I want to make the neural network to train on GPU. Please help me in switching from CPU to GPU.
