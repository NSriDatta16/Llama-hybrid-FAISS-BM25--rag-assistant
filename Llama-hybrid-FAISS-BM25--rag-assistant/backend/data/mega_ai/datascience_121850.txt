Interpretation of best subset selection regression model for factor variables with more than 2 levels

I applied the best subset selection regression model in R from leaps package to my dat dataframe. x and y are factors with 3, and 4 levels, respectively. The result of the summary of the model is like below image. library(leaps) set.seed(123) dat summary result: I would like to have clear picture of what is going on in the results. Does anyone could help me interpret this result? It is clear that levels 2 and 3 of x variable, while not selected for best 1-varibale and 2-varibale models, have been chosen for best 3-variable model. Also, from the model coefficients I can say: Intercept 2.32 is the average value of the res for level 1 of x variable. X2 coefficient -2.41 can be interpreted as the difference in the average res between x level 2 and x level 1. X3 coefficient -2.92 can be interpreted as the difference in the average res between x level 3 and x level 1. Does this interpretation correct? It is just a hypothetical situation. My actual problem is that I have many factor variables with multiple levels, and I would like to apply best subset selection method. I just wanted to make sure I interpret the result correctly.
