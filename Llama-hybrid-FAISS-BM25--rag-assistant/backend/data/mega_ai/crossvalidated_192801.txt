PCA is a data transform tool that transforms the data to a new coordinate system. It is used to reduce dimension. For example, you can apply PCA to Fama-French's 3 factor to transform three time series into one time series. Then use OLS tech to find the $\beta$. I do not know exactly why people may use PCA before OLS to reduce dimension of the independent variables. Maybe reduced time series gives a better prediction.
