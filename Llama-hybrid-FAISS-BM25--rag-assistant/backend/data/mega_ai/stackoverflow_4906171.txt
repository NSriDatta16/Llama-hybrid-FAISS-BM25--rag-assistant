If it is always 10 digits, use char(10) with the UI to enforce the "98" prefix. To be forward looking, you could use VARCHAR(12) or even VARCHAR(20) since there is absolutely no additional storage, and you will want to enforce the country/area code from the UI in some way anyway (to 10 digits), so having some flexibility at the database layer will be worthwhile.
