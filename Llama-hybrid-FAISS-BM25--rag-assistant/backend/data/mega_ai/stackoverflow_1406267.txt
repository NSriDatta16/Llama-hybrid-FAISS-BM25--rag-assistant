I would tend to agree with @orip, scripting at least part of your workload is likely to save you time. You might consider taking a moment to ask what tasks are the most time consuming in terms of your labor and how amenable are they to automation? Scripts are especially good at collecting and summarizing data - much better then people, typically. If the performance data requires a lot of interpretation on your part, you may have problems. An advantage to scripting some of these tasks is that you can then check them in along side the source / patches / branches and you may find you benefit from organizational structure of your systems complexity rather than struggling to chase it as you do now.
