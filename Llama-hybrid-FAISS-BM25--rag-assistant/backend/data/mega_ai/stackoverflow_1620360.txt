addChild(x) = this.addChild(x), "this" is omitted. "this" is how your main windows or on flash language "stage" called. Stage is an object, usually of Sprite type. Can be MovieClip which is more advanced and probably not that useful for "stage" addChild is pretty simple, you drag to library any control you want use (like importing), let's say you drag Input, then you create an external action script file .as from which you can access this control by creating new control object and setting it's properties. Important is to make your external class to inherit from Sprite object ( which is simpler form than MovieClip object). Most of ppl who get into Flash usually fail to get events because these are quite unique to AS and maybe Javascript. If you get those you are on the right road.
