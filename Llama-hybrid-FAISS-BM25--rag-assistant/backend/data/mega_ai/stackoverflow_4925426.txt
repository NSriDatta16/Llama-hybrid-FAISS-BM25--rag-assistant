I suppose it just depends how forward-looking you want to be. Your first approach has the advantage of being very simple to implement, is very straightforward to update and utilize, and also will only increase your storage requirements very slightly, but it's also the extreme minimum in terms of the amount of information you're storing. If you go with the second approach and store a more complete history, if you need to add an "edit history" in the future, you'll already have things set up for that, and a lot of data waiting around. But if you end up never needing this data, it's a bit of a waste. Or if you want the best of both worlds, you could combine them. Keep a full edit history but also update the single-character flag in the main record. That way you don't have to do any processing of the history to find the most recent edit, just look at the flag. But if you ever do need the full history, it's available. Personally, I prefer keeping more information than I think I'll need at the time. Storage space is very cheap, and you never know when it's going to come in handy. I'd probably go even further than what you proposed, and also make it so the edit history keeps track of what they changed, and the before/after values. That can be very handy for debugging, and could be useful in the future depending on the project's exact needs.
