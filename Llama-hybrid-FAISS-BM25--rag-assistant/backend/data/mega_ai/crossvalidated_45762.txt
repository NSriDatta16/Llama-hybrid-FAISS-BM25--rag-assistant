Where can I find information for variable descriptions

I have been working in R the last few weeks and have been tinkering with forecasting/predicting values for the financial data. Is there a good place to find out what the different variables represent? Such as m in caret package, size. C, degree, sigma, and scale. For example I am trying to use the Support Vector Machines models in caret but they require some input parameters for the different types. Support Vector Machines type, package, variables svmLinear, kernlab, C svmRadial, kernlab, C, sigma svmRadialCost, kernlab, C svmPoly, kernlab, degree, scale, C I found the above in documentation regarding the SVM Models in the caret package. However, no explanation on what the variables mean.... Would there be a good place to figure out what these variables mean? Or are they already meant to be known by even novices? If so where can I find out about them? I think it would be best if I knew what these were instead of just changing them randomly.
