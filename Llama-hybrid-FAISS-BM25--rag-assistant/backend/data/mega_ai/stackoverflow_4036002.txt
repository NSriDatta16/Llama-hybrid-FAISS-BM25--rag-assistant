There's a lot that can go wrong in any environment, especially PHP. What could be the issue here is using WEBrick with Rails 3. Using an alternative like mongrel or Passenger could help narrow down this problem. You could have a situation where something that should be working is timing out, for instance, Memcache is not configured correctly, or a CURL request is being made that eventually fails. It's always handy to have a very basic view with nothing in it you can use to benchmark the baseline performance of your application. A simple controller with a single action and an empty view can do the trick here. Diagnosing the problem will be a case of adding some of your controller code to this empty action until you can trigger the problem, or stripping parts out of your views to see if that's what causes it. I usually start commenting out partials to see if one of them is causing the drag, and from there move back to the controller to pay close attention to what's getting loaded.
