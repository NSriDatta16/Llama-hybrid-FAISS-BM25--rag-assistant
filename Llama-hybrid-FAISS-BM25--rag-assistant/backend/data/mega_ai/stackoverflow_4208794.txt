Well, security can mean lots of different things. There's in transit (SSL), at rest (database and, potentially, file system encryption), and even when reviewing the information posted (XSS and others). Now, please just don't use a GET request to have data passed into your system. That isn't what GET is for, it is supposed to be used to GET a resource. Hence it's name. POST, on the other hand, well, POSTs data to your system. The simplest way is to simply accept a regular POST. Every web language and quite a few others can do this. The site should utilize SSL to make sure the data is encrypted on it's way to you. You should use parameterized queries (at the very least) to protect against SQL injection. And you should scrub the data of any non-allowable characters. Next encrypt the data prior to storage. Incidentally, go ahead and have the connection between your web server and database server encrypted. And, for the really paranoid, encrypt the entire file system the database is running on. All said and done, it shouldn't take you more than a couple hours to put this together; depending on, of course, what it takes for you to get SSL installed on your server and the facilities your server environment offers for the other items.
