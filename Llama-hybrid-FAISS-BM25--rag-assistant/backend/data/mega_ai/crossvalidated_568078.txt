Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two Markov kernels. One example where a "matrix $A$ is preferred to matrix $B$ " is when, under certain conditions, $$ A(x,C) \ge B(x,C) $$ for any $x,C$ such that $x \not\in C$ . This is a Peskun ordering , written as $A \succeq_P B$ . I think of this intuitively as " $A$ just moves around more than $B$ ." If these transition kernels correspond to MCMC samplers, and if you're able to show that $A \succeq_P B$ , then $A$ is a superior algorithm in the sense that it gives you estimators with smaller asymptotic variance, among other things. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335011 https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-probability/volume-8/issue-1/A-note-on-Metropolis-Hastings-kernels-for-general-state-spaces/10.1214/aoap/1027961031.full https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06197.pdf
