Preferred method for XML layouts: explicit attributes or styles.xml?

Currently I'm mixing explicit attributes (layout_width, height, alignment) on my various XML layouts with coded styles in styles.xml, plus outsourcing colors from colors.xml. From your experience, what's the recommended way to organize an android app's layouts?
