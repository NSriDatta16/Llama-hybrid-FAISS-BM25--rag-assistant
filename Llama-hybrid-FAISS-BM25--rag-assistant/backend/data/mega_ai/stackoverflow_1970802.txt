.gitconfig error

I edited my .gitconfig file to add support for LabView and it appears that I did something that Git doesn't exactly like. The problem is it (Git) doesn't tell me what it doesn't like. What did I do wrong? The error message doesn't help much either: "fatal: bad config file line 13 in c:/Users/Tanner/.gitconfig" [gui] recentrepo = C:/Users/Tanner/Desktop/FIRST 2010 Beta/Java/LoganRover [user] name = Tanner Smith email = tanner@notimportant.net [merge "labview"] name = LabView 3-Way Merge driver = “C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Merge\LVMerge.exe” “C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 8.6\LabVIEW.exe” %O %B %A %A recursive = binary And I'm not seeing a line 13, but usually that would mean something is wrong at the end? I don't know, Git is new to me.
