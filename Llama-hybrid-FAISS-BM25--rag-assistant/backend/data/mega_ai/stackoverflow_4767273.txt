You can keep using the same iterator after insert or erase operations. The standard says (C++03 standard, Section 23.1.2, paragraph 8): The insert members shall not affect the validity of iterators and references to the container, and the erase members shall invalidate only iterators and references to the erased elements. This is true for all associative containers ( map , set , multimap , multiset ).
