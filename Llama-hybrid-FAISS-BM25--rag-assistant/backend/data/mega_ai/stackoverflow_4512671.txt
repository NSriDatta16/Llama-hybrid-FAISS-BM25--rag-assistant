I've just checked and it seems that google ignores (or gives very low weight to) html meta keywords, like robertc and www.Flextras.com said . But since Google (like any other crawler I've heard of) have a very hard time reading non-text content (well, they're doing some analysis of images, and also read some specific Flash containers for text), they do pay attention to the ALT attribute of the image or object tags. Of course, this isn't supposed to be a list of keywords, it should be a human-readable description of the object. Another place that Google does read is the HTML description meta-tag see here
