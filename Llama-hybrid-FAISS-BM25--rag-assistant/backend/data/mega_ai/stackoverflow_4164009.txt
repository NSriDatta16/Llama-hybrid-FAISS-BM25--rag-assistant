Storing chat conversation in key->value (noSQL) database?

I am thinking about writing a quick chat application for a client to help them solve some of their communication needs. Clearly, writing a simple chat is no brainer, but the company have serious scaling needs, so it is probably a good idea to build the service on a noSQL storage from the beginning. Besides the obvious lack of transactions, which isn't one of our concerns, is it a good idea to use a noSQL storage for a chat?
