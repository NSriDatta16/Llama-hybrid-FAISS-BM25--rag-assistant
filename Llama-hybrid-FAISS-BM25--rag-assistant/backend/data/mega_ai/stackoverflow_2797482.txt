When you start dragging a window, the system enters a modal move/resize loop; it does not return to your own message loop until the drag action has finished. You are still getting WM_SIZE because it is sent directly to the window procedure, but it does not flow through your own message loop. At the beginning of such a modal drag action, the system sends WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE to your window procedure. When you release the mouse button, your application will get WM_EXITSIZEMOVE . That is probably the message you want to trigger on.
