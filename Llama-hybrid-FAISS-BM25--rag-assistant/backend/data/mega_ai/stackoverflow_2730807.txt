In short, no. However, off-screen rendering is generally fast and Qt double-buffers widgets for you. Painting to QImage or QPixmap can also be done in non-GUI threads, so you can multi thread the painting. QPixmaps also have the advantage of QPixmapCache . You could do the optimization yourself depending on how the paint commands are created. If you know all the commands at the time you start, you could use a stack of shapes and if the top of the stack is contained within the last created shape, don't draw it. However, you should profile this section of code to see if it really is gaining anything. Premature micro-optimization often leads to wasted effort. I would start with offscreen rendering (multi threaded if possible), if that really is too slow, try other steps. However, in most cases the standard paint methods will be fast enough.
