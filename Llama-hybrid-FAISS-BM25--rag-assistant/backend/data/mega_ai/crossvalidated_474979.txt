You are correct to use logistic regression to predict death in your cohort. However before fitting a model to your data, you should extensively analyze your data: Check for missing values. This is especially true for very large datasets (e.g. 50,000 individuals). Currently from the data (approximately 50,000 people), 43699 survive and 1035 die, here I see the first problem, I think there is an unbalanced distribution and I do not know how to treat it. Unbalanced distributions might be resolvable with sub-setting. You could match patients who progress with patients who don't progress based on age, sex, income, baseline characteristics, etc. Thereby you would create a smaller dataset with fewer observations but less skewed outcomes. Explore your data. You have done that partially, but you treated gender as a continuous variable. Try converting it to a factor and use scatter and transparency to avoid overlapping of points. Alternatively you could plot colored histograms. Fit your model. To give a good answer concerning which model to use and how to apply it, we need more information about your dataset and the code you have already run. Presumably logistic regression would be the right thing to do.
