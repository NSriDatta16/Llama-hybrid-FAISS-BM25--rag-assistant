Android: How to copy a SQLite database from one application to another

I have a lite version of an application that uses a SQLite database. I want to copy that database over to the full version of the application when the user installs the full version. I have written some code to perform the file copy, but the lite database file always comes up as unreadable. The file is there and I can point to it, but I can't read it to perform the copy. In the Android documentation , we read: You can save files directly on the device's internal storage. By default, files saved to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access them (nor can the user). Note the words, "by default". Is there a way that I can override that default and make the SQLite file readable by my other application? Thank you.
