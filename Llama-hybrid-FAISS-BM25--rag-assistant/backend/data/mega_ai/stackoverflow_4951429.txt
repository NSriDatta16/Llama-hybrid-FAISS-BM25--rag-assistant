How to have change debugger setting in Eclipse for a launch file

His, I have been trying to find out why starting DevMode with Debugger from Eclipse was so slow and noticed in the list of processes on my machine the following line: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_14/bin/java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,address=localhost:47248 ... Apparently the application is suspended to wait until the debugger is connected which takes about 2 minutes. I would like to set "suspend=n". Does anyone know where I could set this directive. The vm section in Eclipse launch configuration is empty and if I paste the updated debugger config there is a error telling that the values are entered twice. As I understand it, Eclipse takes this config from somewhere and inserts it automatically when I run launch configurations in debugger mode. Thanks
