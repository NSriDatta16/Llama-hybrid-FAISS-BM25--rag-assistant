How do I recover parameters from ARIMA?

Given a simulated time series test.ar I hoped to estimate the coefficients (0.8 & -0.2) using arima(test.ar, order=c(2,0,0)) However, I see nothing that looks like 0.8 or -0.2 How do I recover the constants (0.2, 0.6 &c) from the following time series? test.ma Bonus: tsts
