This is only a formative addentum to Colin HERBERT's answer which, in my opinion, is enough: Accessor method signatures should always look like public Type getProperty() . Additionally, accessors should always return a copy of the property's value, not the value itself. Mutator method signatures should always look like public void setProperty(Type value) Combining an accessor and a mutator gives you a JavaBean property. JavaBeans are not considered to be immutable by nature, but if you want to make it immutable, you should use the following signature for the mutator method: public YourJavaBean withProperty(Type value) . Note that this should always return a completely new YourJavaBean instance with copied property values.
