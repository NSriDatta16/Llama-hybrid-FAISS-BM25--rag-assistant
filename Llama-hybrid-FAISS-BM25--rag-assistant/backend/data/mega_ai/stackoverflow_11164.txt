I'd steer away from having child object containing their logical parent, it can get very messy and very recursive pretty quickly when you do that. I'd take a look at how you're intending to use the domain model before you do that sort of thing. You can easily still have the ID references in the tables and just leave them unmapped. Here are two example mappings that might nudge you in the right direction, I've had to adlib table names etc but it could possibly help. I'd probably also suggest mapping the StatusId to an enumeration. Pay attention to the way the bag effectivly maps the details table into a collection.
