Easiest way in my opinion would be to use a queue, ex Amazon SQS, and pull 8 records per minute, in a cron job running every minute. Considering it was pushed into the queue, then taken out, I am working out the math that it is an extremely cheap service. See below, 0.000002 is the rate for 2 requests. (Add and View) 8 requests per minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day. Take into account 30 days in the average month, you are still under $1. 0.000002 * 8 * 60 * 24 * 30 = $0.6912 This might not be exactly what you were looking for, but it should be a pretty simple solution. EDIT: See here, a python SQS & S3 Lib (sqs is all that you should be looking for). http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Python-Amazon/0.5
