How to split aggregated variance of one random variable into multiple random variables?

I apologize if this question is trivial, but I didn't come to a conclusion by myself. I have an aggregated forecast for a group of $n$ items, normally distributed with mean and standard deviation. $(\mu_F, \sigma_F) $ From this bulk forecast I am trying to go backwards to single item forecasts. From historical data I know, that the means of the $n$ items follow a known distribution. I can also assume independence. For simplicity let's imagin $n=3$: We know that $\mu_1+\mu_2+\mu_3=\mu_F$ and $\sqrt(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+\sigma_3^2)=\sigma_F$ We also know the means follow the following distribution: $\mu_1 = 0.2\mu_F ,$ $\mu_2=0.5\mu_F,$ $\mu_3=0.3\mu_F$ From the given information above, is it possible to assume $\sigma_1 = \sqrt(0.2)\sigma_F, \sigma_2 = \sqrt(0.5)\sigma_F, \sigma_3 = \sqrt(0.3)\sigma_F$ ? If no, what assumptions have to be made? Is there a term for splitting the variance according to the weights of the means? Are there other methods to apply instead? I am grateful for any help or further resources. Does anyone know any academic papers, where something like this is applied? edit: Maybe it helps to give some more context. I am forecasting shoe sales. I therefore do my forecasting on an aggregated set of data. I combine all sizes of the same model. After I get my results I thought I could split the mean and the standard deviation back to the size level. I want to do this according to the average size distribution for the specific category of shoes.
