First of all; if you try to adopt a "style" that's not your own, you will most likely fail. You basically just have to be yourself! (That's probably why you got promoted in the first place) That said, there are some theorems to embrace, one beeing "you can always be a better leader" ;) I guess that's part of why you posted this question. My advise is to support your co-workers, and remember that it's your job to make them as good as possible. Try to keep yourself on top of all that happens within the project and encourage communication within the team. Agile style development helps with that. Also, try to put yourself in your co-workers shoes and try to imagine what they expect and want from you. Best of luck
