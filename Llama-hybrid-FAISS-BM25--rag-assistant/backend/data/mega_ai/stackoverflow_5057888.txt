Technically it's perfectly ok to encode binary data as base64 string and include it in JSON. But, as @servermanfail noted, you might be better off with embedding links to images into JSON and downloading them in the second step. The added benefit would be size/speed of transfer, as base64 stream is 4/3 the size of the original binary stream (33% overhead). Also, in this case, you could cache images.
