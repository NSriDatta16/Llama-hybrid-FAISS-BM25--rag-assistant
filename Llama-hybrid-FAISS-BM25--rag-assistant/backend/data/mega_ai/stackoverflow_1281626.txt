The examples given so far do nothing to reduce the complexity of the task; they only trade one syntax for another (almost equally verbose) one. If you invest the time to create a fluent interface, leverage it to actually improve the expressiveness of your API instead of just jiggling syntactic sugar. Raise the level of abstraction from the default primitives (buttons, modalities,...) to templates, visual inheritance chains and behaviors. I haven't totally thought this through yet, but something along the lines of: Dialog .WithStandardColors() .WithTitleOf("ChooseSomething") .WithButtonSet () .Show(); or Dialog .UseErrorFormatting .SetTitleTo("Uh Oh") .Show()
