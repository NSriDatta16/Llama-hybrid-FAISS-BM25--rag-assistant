Stuts2 Tiles Tomcat suspected of changing UTF-8 to?

I'm having some internationalisation woes: My UTF-8 string fields are being rendered in the browser as ???? after being returned from the database. After retrieval from the database using Hibernate, the String fields are presented correctly on inspection using the eclipse debugger. However Struts2/Tiles is rendering these strings as ???? in the HTML sent to the browser. The charset directive is present in the HTML header: Perhaps I need to add something to my struts2 or tiles configurations?
