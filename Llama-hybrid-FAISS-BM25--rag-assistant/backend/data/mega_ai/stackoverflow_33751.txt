How do I add a MIME type to .htaccess?

I would like to add the following MIME type to a site run by Apache : jnlp application/x-java-jnlp-file That is the Tomcat format. I'm on a shared host, so I can only create an .htaccess file. Would someone please specify the complete contents of such a file?
