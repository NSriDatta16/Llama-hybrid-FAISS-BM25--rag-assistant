Averaging rankings of small geographical areas to find an average ranking for a larger area

I have a friend who is very intelligent with a professional background in accountancy but no formal mathematical or scientific training. He is studying for a PhD (as a mature student) looking at how the philosophy of accounting affects big science projects We have been talking about statistics. As a personal piece of work, he has been using a database of national indices of mass deprivation to show how different areas are getting more or less deprived over time. He has been grouping smaller areas together to create bigger areas. All fine so far. However, he has been averaging the rankings of the smaller areas to get an average ranking for the larger area and then comparing how the larger area's ranking varies over time This just seems wrong to me - the ranking has no direct link to a measurable value, and averaging ranks "works arithmetically", but to me doesn't seem to provide a meaningful stat. It seems obvious (dread word!) that you need to work out the values of deprivation for the larger areas and then rank them all again (as long as all larger areas are approximately equivalent) As I said, he is very intelligent and an excellent debater. His view is that statistics is only a representation of the truth, and as such he is able to select how to represent this truth Who is right? If I'm right, what arguments could I use to help him understand?
