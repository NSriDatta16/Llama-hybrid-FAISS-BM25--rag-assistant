First, I want to highly recommend the maximum entropy bootstrap (meboot). I abandoned the block bootstrap in favor of meboot, and I've been very pleased with the results. The algorithm does not use blocking in any way, it does not require stationarity, and yet it incorporates the correlation structure of the data. It's cool. Second, while I confess that I've never done a multivariate bootstrap using meboot, I believe you can recast your time series data as panel data and use the meboot.pdata.frame function to perform an essentially multivariate bootstrap.
