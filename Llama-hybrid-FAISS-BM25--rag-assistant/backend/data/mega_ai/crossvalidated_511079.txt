The concern expressed in @whuber's comment needs to be taken seriously. However, assuming you have obtained appropriate data, your question what to do when you get error messages about low expected counts can be answered quickly. Suppose you have randomly chosen subjects from 8 ethnic groups, who either report racially motivated hate crimes or not. Maybe your contingency table is as follows: MAT [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] hc 2 6 10 7 4 4 8 9 no 25 14 16 24 29 24 11 7 sum(MAT) [1] 200 If you do a chi-squared test, you will get an error message because some of the expected counts are smaller than 5. chisq.test(MAT) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: MAT X-squared = 23.265, df = 7, p-value = 0.001533 Warning message: In chisq.test(MAT) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect chisq.test(MAT)$exp [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] hc 6.75 5 6.5 7.75 8.25 7 4.75 4 no 20.25 15 19.5 23.25 24.75 21 14.25 12 In my fake data, I see only two expected counts below 5. Some statisticians would not be concerned about an inaccurate P-value as long as most of the expected counts exceed 5, but the remaining a few have values between 3 and 5. However, if you have a matrix of expected counts that is much more sparse than this one, then you need another method of analysis. One alternative method is Fisher's exact test. With a matrix as large as $2\times 8,$ you may encounter excessive running times for Fisher's test or a message about insufficient storage space. [Fisher's exact test was originally proposed for $2\times 2$ tables, but some software will compute P-values for larger matrices. This may depend on your software and how it is used on your computer.] An alternative in R is to simulate a P-value by including the parameter sim=T as an argument in the chisq.test procedure. chisq.test(MAT, sim=T) Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 2000 replicates) data: MAT X-squared = 23.265, df = NA, p-value = 0.0009995 For my data, this option works fine, giving a P-value a little smaller than the doubtful one above.
