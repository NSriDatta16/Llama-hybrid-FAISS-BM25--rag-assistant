Detect view that finger slid over in iPhone SDK

My problem involves creating a control somewhat analogous to the apple magnifying glass in text view control, where you touch for a second or so to pop up a magnifying glass and then drag your finger around to select your desired location. I created all the methods that I need for detecting a long stationary touch. Now I need to detect the UIView that my finger has slid over. I'm not exactly sure how to go about making this happen, can anyone point me in the right direction?
