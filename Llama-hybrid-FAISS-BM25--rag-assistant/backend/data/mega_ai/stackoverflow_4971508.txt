static enum Response { /*... */ }; You cannot define static enum in C++. static can only be the variable of the enum, not the type itself! Compiling your code with GCC version 4.3.4 , it gives this error: prog.cpp:7: error: a storage class can only be specified for objects and functions See yourself online at ideone: http://www.ideone.com/cI1bt I think that says it all. -- However, if you want to limit the type enum Response in it's own translation unit, then you can use unnamed namespace. Have a look at this topic: Superiority of unnamed namespace over static?
