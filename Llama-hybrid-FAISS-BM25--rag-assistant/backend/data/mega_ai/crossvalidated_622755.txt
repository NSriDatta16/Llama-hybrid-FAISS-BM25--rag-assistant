How to test a MA process with extra terms for invertibility?

I'm working on an unassessed course problem (paraphrased for brevity), Consider the time series model $$y_t=\alpha+\beta t+\epsilon_t$$ where $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise and $\alpha,\beta$ are known parameters. Show that $x_t=\nabla y_t$ is not invertible. The course notes have, Suppose $$y_t=h(B)\epsilon_t$$ where $$h(x)=1+\beta_1x+\beta_2x^2+\dots+\beta_qx^q.$$ A moving-average process $\text{MA}(q)$ is invertible iff all roots of $h(x)=0$ lie outside the unit circle. The solution booklet has, $\{x_t\}=\{\beta+\epsilon_t-\epsilon_{t-1}\}$ is not invertible as the coefficient of $\epsilon_{t-1}$ is $-1$ and does not satisfy $|-1| (alternatively $x=1$ is the only root of the MA characteristic polynomial $h(x)=1-x$ , which lies on the unit circle). But $$x_t=\beta+\epsilon_t-\epsilon_{t-1}\neq\epsilon_t-\epsilon_{t-1}=h(B)\epsilon_t.$$ What happened to the $\beta$ ? More generally, how does one use the root test with the characteristic MA polynomial when the form of the time series doesn't exactly match the form of $h(B)\epsilon_t$ ?
