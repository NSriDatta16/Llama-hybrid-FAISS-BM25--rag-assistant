If you want complete control, then you generally have to replace the browser controls completely and fake them with other elements, stylesheets and scripting. If you don't want to use a framework, then it basically comes down to DIY. That said, the whole concept have a couple of problems. Trying to get the controls to behave how the user expects (given input from clicking, double clicking, triple clicking, right clicking, dragging, arrow keys, the control key, etc, etc, etc) is hard . The controls might not look as the user expects. Personally, I'd generally try to let form controls stick to the system defaults and not try to deviate from them. Give users what they expect.
