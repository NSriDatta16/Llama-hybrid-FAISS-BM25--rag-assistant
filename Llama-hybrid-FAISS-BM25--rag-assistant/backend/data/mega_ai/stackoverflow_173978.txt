I agree with PhiLho. If you still want to try it the js code dividing your content into two columns is quite simple if the columns have fixed widths. The tricky bit is deciding where to split the content. You probably don't want to split in the middle of a word etc. You could try with the following scenario: Add two columns into your page. Put your text into the first column (this allows non js browsers to still display your content). Get the text with js (eg. from onload event). Find the next index of "." (or if you have paragraphs " ") starting from the middle. Use that index to split the text and put the first part back in the first column and so on...
