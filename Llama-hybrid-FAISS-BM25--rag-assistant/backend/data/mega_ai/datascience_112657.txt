Topic Modeling Topic modeling is a technique for taking some unstructured text and automatically extracting its common themes , it is a great way to get a bird's eye view of a large text collection. simply, it is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract " topics" that occur in a collection of documents Popular topic modeling algorithms Latent Semantic Analysis Latent Dirichlet Allocation Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Non-negative Matrix factorization Evaluating Model The final score can be calculated using the below metrics: Perplexity - This is a statistical measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. As applied to LDA, for a given value of k, you estimate the LDA model. Then given the theoretical word distributions represented by the topics, compare that to the actual topic mixtures, or distribution of words in your documents. - Lower the better. Coherence Score - Is defined as the average/median of the pairwise word-similarity scores of the words in the topic - The higher the better. Limitation of LDA (latent dirichlet allocation)
