R Script to average value over every days

I'm having an issue finding out how to calculate an average over "x" days. If I try to plot this csv file over 1 year, it's too much data to display correctly on a plot line (screenshot attached). I'm looking to average the data over every few days (maybe 2, a week, etc..) so the line graph is not so hard to read. Any advice on how I would solve this issue with R? results.csv POSTS,PROVIDER,TYPE,DATE 29337,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-01 26725,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-02 27480,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-03 31187,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-04 31488,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-05 32461,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-06 33675,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-07 38897,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-08 37122,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-09 41365,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-10 51760,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-11 50859,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-12 53765,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-13 56836,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-14 59698,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-15 52095,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-16 57154,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-17 80755,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-18 227464,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-19 394510,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-20 371303,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-21 370450,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-22 268703,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-23 267252,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-24 375712,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-25 381041,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-26 380948,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-27 373140,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-28 361874,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-29 265178,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-30 269929,FTP,BLOG,2010-01-31 R Script library(ggplot2); data Graph Image
