Remote key-value storage allowing indexes?

In our project we already have an embedded in-memory key-value storage for objects, and it is very usable, because it allows us to make indexes for it and query the storage based on it. So, if we have a collection of "Student"s, and a compound index on student.group and student.sex, then we can find all male students from group "ABC". Same for deletion and so on. Now we have to adopt our service for working in a cloud, so that there will be multiple servers, processing user requests, and they have a shared state, stored in this key-value indexed storage. We tried to adopt memcashed for our needs, and it's almost ideal -- it is fast, simple and proven solution, but it doesn't have indexes, so we can't used to search our temporary data. Is there any other way to have a remote cache, just like the memcashed, but with indexes? Thank you.
