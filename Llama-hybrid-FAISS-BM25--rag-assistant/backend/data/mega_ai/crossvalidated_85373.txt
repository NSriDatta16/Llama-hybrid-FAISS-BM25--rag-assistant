Is this a valid application for a Kalman filter?

I have 2 time series; Both the series are tracking inflation.(they have different sampling frequencies) Blue is the official CPI released by the US government. Red is an independent group's measure of inflation If I let the Blue line be the underlying system state, and the red line be the noisy input data, can I estimate the system state using the red line(and perhaps some other explanatory variables that I think are valid) I am already fitting a Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression model to this data, but I want some other models so that i can compare forecasts.
