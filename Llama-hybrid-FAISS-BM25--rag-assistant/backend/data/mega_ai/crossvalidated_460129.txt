I have a proportion DV with true 0 and 1. Which mixed modelling approach (in R) is most recommend?ed?

Hope this isn't too much of a dumb question. I've been searching for a definitive answer, and now I've got choice paralysis. I have a proportional DV (accuracy) with true 0 and 1 values averaged for each repeated measures trial during a specific 8-trial epoch. I do not have access to the original binary data per trial, 'nor do I have access to the total amount of trials to add as weights to a model. Now, I've tried three approaches, to varying levels of success. My first approach was to logit transform the DV using boot::logit, and enter this into an lmer, as follows: acc.mod1 However, this produces an error, as my logit transformation created Inf values for the 0s and 1s. Next, I tried to fit a generalised linear mixed effects model using the glmmTMB package, as follows: acc.mod2 However, I wonder whether using the binomial family is appropriate for a non-binary DV. When I change the family to 'beta' instead, which I believe is more appropriate for proportional data, it throws back the following error: Error in (function (start, objective, gradient = NULL, hessian = NULL, : gradient function must return a numeric vector of length 10 Finally, I even tried to fit a simpler beta regression model (with no random effects) using betareg: acc.mod3 ...but this gave me the following error: Error in betareg::betareg(accuracy ~ trial, data = long_behav) : invalid dependent variable, all observations must be in (0, 1) Thus, I've tried to incorporate what I've learned so far about the optimal treatments for proportional DVs, but it's all left me a bit unsure. I'm wondering if anyone more experienced with dealing with these models / DV-type could offer any insight to make my approach more robust. Thanks.
