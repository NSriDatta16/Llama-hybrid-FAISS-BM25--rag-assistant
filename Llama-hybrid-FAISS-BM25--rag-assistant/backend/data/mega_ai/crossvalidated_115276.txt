A major point of multiple imputations is to do separate analyses on each of the imputed data sets, so that you can get both pooled estimates of things like regression coefficients and an estimate of the errors in the coefficients. Averaging the imputed data sets first is not the correct use of this approach. And don't limit yourself to so few imputations; with modern computers there's no reason not to do 100 or more.
