Lists are made with the function LIST. (list 1 2 3) (list + - * /) Applying a list of symbols makes no sense: (apply (map (lambda (x) x) '(+ - * /)) '(1 2 3 4)) Would be (applying a list of functions still makes no sense): (apply (map (lambda (x) x) (list + - * /)) '(1 2 3 4)) Simplified (still wrong): (apply (list + - * /) '(1 2 3 4)) But, maybe you wanted this: (map (lambda (f) (apply f '(1 2 3 4))) (list + - * /)) In Common Lisp: (mapcar #'(lambda (f) (apply f '(1 2 3 4))) (list #'+ #'- #'* #'/)) Returns: (10 -8 24 1/24)
