Logistic Regression is a classification Algorithm of Machine Learning. With Logistic Regression, we can predict binary classification problems(0 or 1). From your snapshot of dataset as far as I saw you want to predict revenue of the Restraunt which contains real values. To predict this type problems you have to use Regression type Algorithm such that Linear Regression , Support Vector for Regression (SVR) , Decision Tree Regression , Random Forest Regression , Bayesian Ridge Regression , BayesianRidge etc.
