I spot an error in your code. The input sequence for LSTM() layers must follow this schema: ( Number of observations , Number of Timesteps , Number of input series ) When you specify the input_shape argument you drop the number of observations. Therefore it becomes: model = Sequential([ LSTM(32, input_shape = (801, 450)), Dense(6, activation='softmax') ]) model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) That's why you had an error about the number of input dimensions. One final observations: 450 input features on 801 timesteps is a lot . Consider using some dimensionality reduction technique, because that's going to be very hard computationally speaking.
