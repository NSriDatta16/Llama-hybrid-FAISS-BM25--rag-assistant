How to interact with the Panoramio API using services?

I'm writing a location base client and would love to integrate Panoramio with my client, now the problem is that I can't find a way to interact with the Panoramio using a ~REST-like service. I know they do have an API but it's mostly for embedding the content into a website and not as to interact thru me code (at least from documentation) Have any of you hacked a way thru this? I am writing the clients natively for android and iphone in case you are wondering. cheers, G.
