What if the prior not be conjugate with posterior in Bayesian learning?

I know that when the prior is conjugate with posterior then one can get an analytical representation for the posterior distribution, but what if these two are not to be conjugate? For example, I would like to use Lasso Bayesian, in which likelihood is the normal distribution and the prior is the Laplace distribution. Then I would like to know, do I still get an approximate sparse solution for the ordinary least square problem?
