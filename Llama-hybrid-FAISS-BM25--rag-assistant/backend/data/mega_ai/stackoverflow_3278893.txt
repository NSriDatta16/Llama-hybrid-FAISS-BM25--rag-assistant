I think the easiest way is to make a stored procedure CalculateAverageForUserAndType(int userid ,type NVARCHAR(10)) Put your original code inside the new procedure. Then change CalculateAverageForUser to dbo.CalculateAverageForUser(int userid) AS BEGIN EXEC CalculateAverageForUserAndType userid, NULL END This way you can slowly migrate to your new stored procedure and your old one still works.
