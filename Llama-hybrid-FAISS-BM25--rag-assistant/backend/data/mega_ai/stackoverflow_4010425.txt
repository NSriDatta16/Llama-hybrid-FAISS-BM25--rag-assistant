PHP never errors out without telling you why, it's just a matter of finding the right log. First, check your Magento exception log var/log/exception.log Second, check your PHP Error log. If you're not sure where the that, run phpinfo() from a blank file on your server and look for the error_log variable. If this isn't set, set it via the ini_set function, or by changing your php.ini file. If you leave error_log unset, PHP will send logs to the "SAPI error logger", which is a fancy way of saying your apache error log. Finally, although it won't help with all white screen cases, try turning developer mode on. There's the following line in index.php if (isset($_SERVER['MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE'])) { Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true); } So either set MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE in your .htaccess file, or just comment out the conditional. This will turn off the default error reporting and output exceptions/errors/warnings/etc to the browser.
