If you want to use a statistical test to compare a sample distribution to a hypothesis distribution, I believe you should use the Chi Square Goodness of Fit test. However, this test is sensitive to sample size. You could also just compare the histograms, as was mentioned in a comment. With such a rigorous method, it would be good to collect some qualitative data simultaneously. EDIT: without leaving the frequentist world, a multinomial logistic regression may be more effective for your needs. UCLA has a great set of instructions on how to use this method in R . If you are interested in a Bayesian approach, I would assume a uniform prior is appropriate.
