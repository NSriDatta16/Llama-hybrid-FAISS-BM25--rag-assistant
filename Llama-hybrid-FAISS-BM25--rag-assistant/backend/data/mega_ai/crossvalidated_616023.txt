So, you won't want to only use the available visits as you describe. Most work transforms the data into monotone missingness, as it is easier to work with. To do this, you would censor someone when they miss a visit for all subsequent visits. Depending on the number of intermittent missing visits, this can result in a substantial amount of missing data. So whether to use this approach depends on how many observations will be available at the final time point. A more recent proposed alternative is IPW for nonmonotonic missing / censoring. These weights are described in this paper and a more technical discussion in this paper . I know someone who is doing simulation work on this estimator but it is not published yet (can follow up once it is). In that work, they find that the UMLE works fine in most settings (i.e., you don't have to implement the Bayesian version).
