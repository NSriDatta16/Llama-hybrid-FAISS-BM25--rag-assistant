What kind of significance test should I use when the dependent variable is being measured over time?

In my experimental design, mice are given 2 small wounds on either side of their bodies. The first wound is treated with an experimental drug A, and the second with a control drug B. Over the course of 14 days, wound size is recorded every other day as a percentage of that mouse's original wound size on day 0. Averages for each day are taken and the final data set looks like this: Drug A Day Avg. Wound area % 0 100 2 72 4 47 6 35 8 30 10 27 12 24 14 22 Drug B Day Avg. Wound area % 0 100 2 80 4 70 6 65 8 63 10 54 12 48 14 45 If I perform a t-test, I would have to perform multiple unpaired t-tests for each time point between the two groups, and that would leave me with multiple p-values. Is there a specific statistical test that can tell me if two groups are significantly different over a given timeframe? Is a two way ANOVA appropriate? Thanks in advance.
