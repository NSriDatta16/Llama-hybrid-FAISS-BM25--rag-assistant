Compress data before storage on Google App Engine

I im trying to store 30 second user mp3 recordings as Blobs in my app engine data store. However, in order to enable this feature (App Engine has a 1MB limit per upload) and to keep the costs down I would like to compress the file before upload and decompress the file every time it is requested. How would you suggest I accomplish this (It can happen in the background by the way via a task queue but an efficient solution is always good) Based on my own tests and research - I see two possible approaches to accomplish this Zlib For this I need to compress a certain number of blocks at a time using a While loop. However, App Engine doesnt allow you to write to the file system. I thought about using a Temporary File to accomplish this but I havent had luck with this approach when trying to decompress the content from a Temporary File Gzip From reading around the web, it appears that the app engine url fetch function requests content gzipped already and then decompresses it. Is there a way to stop the function from decompressing the content so that I can just put it in the datastore in gzipped format and then decompress it when I need to play it back to a user on demand? Let me know how you would suggest using zlib or gzip or some other solution to accmoplish this. Thanks
