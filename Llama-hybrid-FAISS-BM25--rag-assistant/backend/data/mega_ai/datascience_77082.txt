Best NN for image pattern recognition without classifier

For images like this I'm trying to split up the cells (the different rectangles). The cells, can vary in size, brightness and so forth. I tried multiple ways using OpenCV for about 5 days, I almost got it working, but there are always edge-cases for which it fails, so I want to give it a shot using ML. I believe the best way to do so, is to find the intersection patterns, upon which I can know the boundaries of the cells using a Mask R-CNN trained over images like this: etc.. Once the position of these objects is known (the crossing point) I can create a grid to split up the cells, a 70-80% accuracy would be enough to generate the grid. Although, most of the R-CNN includes a classification layer, which I don't given I try to detect a multitude of single objects. Which type of NN should I be using for that purpose? enter image description here
