How to create a loss function to reflect different costs of misclassification errors?

I am currently reading 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning' and came across an example of a confusion matrix comparing the actual vs predicted number of people with or without cancer. The penalty/loss is due to a misclassification: If you ACTUALLY have cancer but is classified by the algorithm as "healthy", then this is extremely bad. Another misclassification is not as 'gravely' erroneous as actually being "healthy" despite having been misclassified as "having cancer" by the algorithm. My question is: For a logistic regression, how do you create/formulate a loss function that can capture the essence of penalising 'different levels of errors'?
