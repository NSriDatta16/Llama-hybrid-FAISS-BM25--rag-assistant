Volatility Modeling what's the right approach? / Time Series predictive modeling of future balance in a bank account

I'm trying to model a future balance for any time t in a list of bank accounts. I have historical balance & transactional data, and other factor data that affects the balance of an account (such as interest payments, fees, etc) that I'll try to fit in the model as well. My question is, what model/kind of model should I use to estimate a future value of the Balance variable? A GARCH/ARCH model? Would a multivariate regression be sufficient to accurately predict future values? I don't have much background experience in econometric analyses, so I would appreciate if you could just point me to the right direction and I'll research and dig deeper into it.
