Stationary Distributions of a irreducible Markov chain

I was trying to get all Stationary Distributions of the following Markov chain. Intuitively, I would say there are two resulting from splitting op the irreducible Markov chain into two reducible ones. However, I feel this is not mathematically correct. How else would I be able to find all stationary distributions? \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{3}{4} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\ \end{bmatrix}
