This is a classic use case for Bayesian optimisation, which focuses on optimising black-box functions that are expensive to sample. You would place a Gaussian process prior over your function and use the mean and variance of the posterior to iteratively pick sets of parameters to trial using what is known as an acquisition function. The spearmint library by Jasper Snoek would be a good starting point. Many of his papers and others from the Harvard group give a good overview of Bayesian optimisation.
