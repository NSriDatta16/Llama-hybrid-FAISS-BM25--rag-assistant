Model_2 is a way of adjusting for clustering of time points within ID. We're asking the model to estimate a random intercept value for each ID; conditional on this intercept, the observations for a given ID are assumed to be independent. But there's no accounting for any time effect here. As PBulls notes, we can treat Time as a fixed effect, essentially estimating a mean for each time point, assuming Time is treated as a factor. One option would be: model_3 Sometimes we estimate a linear Time slope, where Time is again included as a fixed effect, but defined as a continuous variable (eg, months from baseline). In this case, in addition to including a random ID intercept, we sometimes include a random Time slope, allowing the time slope for each ID to vary randomly around the average Time slope. This isn't what model_1 is doing, though.
