Convert a code from FORTRAN to C

I have the following FORTRAN code which I need to convert to C or C++. I already tried using f2c, but it didn't work out. It has something to do with conversion from Lambert Conformal wind vector to a True-North oriented vector. Is anyone experienced in FORTRAN who could possibly help? PARAMETER ( ROTCON_P = 0.422618 ) PARAMETER ( LON_XX_P = -95.0 ) PARAMETER ( LAT_TAN_P = 25.0 ) do j=1,ny_p do i=1,nx_p angle2 = rotcon_p*(olon(i,j)-lon_xx_p)*0.017453 sinx2 = sin(angle2) cosx2 = cos(angle2) do k=1,nzp_p ut = u(i,j,k) vt = v(i,j,k) un(i,j,k) = cosx2*ut+sinx2*vt vn(i,j,k) =-sinx2*ut+cosx2*vt end if end do end do Thanks a lot for any help or tip.
