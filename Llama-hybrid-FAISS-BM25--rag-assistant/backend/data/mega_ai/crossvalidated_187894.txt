Dimensionality reduction: RBM autoencoders vs. de-noising autoencoders

I am looking at non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques and am currently trying to understand the practical differences between different autoencoder approaches: Can somebody point me to a comparison between RBM initialised autoencoders (Hinton) vs. de-noising autoencoders for dimensionality reduction? Of course I am interesed in performace characteristics but also in more practical issues, such the reliability of finding a good solution and the computational cost of training.
