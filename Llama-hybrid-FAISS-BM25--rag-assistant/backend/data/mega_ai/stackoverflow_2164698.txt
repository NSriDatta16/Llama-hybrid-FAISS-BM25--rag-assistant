JBoss's web services stack is just an implementation of JAX-WS ( JSR 224 ). JBoss should generate the WSDL for you, usually accessible at the webservice's url with ?wsdl appended to the end. The WSDL isn't the only thing those annotations do. They also tell JBoss that your class implements one or more web services. The JavaEE tutorial has a section on Web Services with JAX-WS that explains how they work in more detail.
