Should my time series be stationary to use ARIMA model? No, the I -letter stands for the procedure part, which makes stationary time series out of your non-stationary one. This procedure is called "differencing". However, if you want to use ARMA(p, q) straightforward, then your time series BETTER be stationary. In practice, there is always some degree of uncertainty about "stationarity", since you re only observing the realisations (aka time series), and do not know the real stochastic process random variables. This uncertainty means you just approximately see it's stationary (with a test/graph/etc.), and try to apply ARMA model, or brute force the d-number, though this will give you subpar performance. ARIMA = ARMA + preliminary differencing procedure. Why we do Integration in ARIMA Exactly as stated above: to make your time series stationary. I read some where that ARIMA can handle non stationary time series, what type of non stationarity can ARIMA handle? It can handle 2 types of non-stationarity: hidden trend (linear, polynomial, seasonals, etc.), and unit roots. Differencing removes any type of polynomial trend (Mentioned + Exercise in first chapters in Brockwell, https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Forecasting-Springer-Texts-Statistics/dp/0387953515 ). The higher-degree polynomial is, the more differencing you need. If there is seasonal pattern, you have to remove it with seasonal differences (different from normal d, google SARIMA). On the other hand, differencing removes 1 unit root per application. If you have 2 unit roots, you do differencing twice. 3 unit roots - three times, etc. If you are familiar with time series notation/little theory (lag operator): In fact, ARIMA(p, d, q) model is ARMA(p, q) model with d unit roots. it can be easily seen from its formula: $(1 - \theta_1B)(1 - B)y_t = (1 + \beta_1B + \beta_2B^2)\epsilon_t$ This is ARIMA(1, 1, 2) process. In the left side the factor $(1 - B)$ is the differencing operator. However, if you just multiply it with the preceding $(1 - \theta_1B)$ , you will get $1 - (\theta_1 + 1)B + \theta_1B^2$ which you can then rewrite: $(1 - (\theta_1 + 1)B + \theta_1B^2)y_t = (1 + \beta_tB + \beta_{t-1}B^2)\epsilon_t$ But its just ARMA(p+d, q) model expression! Now you can clearly see how differencing makes TS stationary (from unit roots) - you difference the data $y_t$ with $(1 - B)$ first, and you are left with $(1 - \theta_1B)y'_t = (1 + \beta_tB + \beta_{t-1}B^2)\epsilon_t$ which is already without unit-roots. Showing any degree polynomial removal with differences is much harder, you can try exercise in Brockwell book (I just trust the author).
