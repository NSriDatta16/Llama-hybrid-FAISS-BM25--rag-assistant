In my Mvc Controls Toolkit I have a server control based on the jQuery TreView. However, I allow node editing, insertion ov new nodes, and moving sub-tree into another location by dragging it with the mouse. All changes are reflected Automatically on data structures on the server side when the view is posted. Moreover all nodes are templated and the same tree can have different type of nodes. Give a look here: http://mvccontrolstoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=TreeView
