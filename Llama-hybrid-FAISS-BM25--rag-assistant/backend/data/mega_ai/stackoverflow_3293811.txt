Also it is quite likely to loose "big" UDP packets along the way, because the wrapping IP packet might be fragmented due to MTU limitations. Each of the fragments might get lost and there is no recovery mechanism in UDP. So while the theoretical limit for UDP payload is approx. 64kB the practical limit is around 1kB.
