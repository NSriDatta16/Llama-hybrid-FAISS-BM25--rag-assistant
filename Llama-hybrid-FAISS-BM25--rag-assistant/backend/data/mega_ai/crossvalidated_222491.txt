What does the term data dependent kernel mean?

I was reading a paper that revisits (singled layered) Radial Basis Function networks . In they claim that they show that RBF methods can be recast as "certain data-dependent kernels". I was wondering what this term meant. A quick google search drove me to two research papers, one titled Data-Dependent Kernels for High-Dimensional Data Classification and another titled Learning Eigenfunctions Links Spectral Embedding and Kernel PCA . One is not to long, 6 pages, and the other (considered the "original" place Data Dependent Kernels where introduced) is 33 pages. After 10ish years I'd assume there might be a concise or simple explanation of what Data Dependent kernels mean. Is there a simple explanation of this apart from trying to parse two dense machine learning research papers?
