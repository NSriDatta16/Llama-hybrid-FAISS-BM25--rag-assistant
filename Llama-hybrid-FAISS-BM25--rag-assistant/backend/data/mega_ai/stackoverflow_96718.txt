Organizing Extension Methods

How do you organize your Extension Methods? Say if I had extensions for the object class and string class I'm tempted to separate these extension methods into classes IE: public class ObjectExtensions { ... } public class StringExtensions { ... } am I making this too complicated or does this make sense?
