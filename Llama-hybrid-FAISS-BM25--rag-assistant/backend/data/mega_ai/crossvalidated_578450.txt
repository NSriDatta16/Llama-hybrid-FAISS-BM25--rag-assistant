"NAs introduced by coercion" in One-Class SVM using R

I am trying to perform a one-class SVM on my data set for anomaly detection. I keep getting a warning that "NAs introduced by coercion", which then does not allow me to fit my one-class SVM model because I subsequently get the error "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". My data set has 18 variables (17 predictors and 1 dependent variable). Of the predictor variables, 15 of them are factors. I have a feeling that this is where the problem is coming from. My dependent variable is also a factor of 2 levels, but I don't think that should be an issue. I have read that I should be able to use factors in SVM, but the R documentation says "If the predictor variables include factors, the formula interface must be used to get a correct model matrix." I really do not understand what this means. This is the code I am using in R. library(e1071) impdata This is the structure of my data: 'data.frame': 15419 obs. of 18 variables: $ Month : Factor w/ 12 levels "Apr","Aug","Dec",... $ WeekOfMonth : Factor w/ 5 levels "1","2","3","4",... $ MonthClaimed : Factor w/ 12 levels "Apr","Aug","Dec",... $ WeekOfMonthClaimed : Factor w/ 5 levels "1","2","3","4",... $ MaritalStatus : Factor w/ 4 levels "Divorced","Married",... $ Age : int 21 34 47 65 27 20 36 32 30 42 ... $ Fault : Factor w/ 2 levels "Policy Holder",... $ VehicleCategory : Factor w/ 3 levels "Sedan","Sport",... $ Deductible : int 300 400 400 400 400 400 400 400 400 400 ... $ PastNumberOfClaims : Factor w/ 4 levels "1","2 to 4","more than 4",... $ AgeOfVehicle : Factor w/ 8 levels "2 years","3 years",... $ AgeOfPolicyHolder : Factor w/ 9 levels "16 to 17","18 to 20",... $ AddressChange.Claim: Factor w/ 5 levels "1 year","2 to 3 years",... $ BasePolicy : Factor w/ 3 levels "All Perils","Collision",.. $ Sex : Factor w/ 2 levels "Female","Male" $ Days.Policy.Claim : Factor w/ 3 levels "15 to 30","8 to 15",... $ Year : Factor w/ 3 levels "1994","1995",... $ Fraud : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes"
