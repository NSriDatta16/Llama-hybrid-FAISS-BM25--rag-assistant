Based on your description, it looks like different models have different biases. Two important questions: do you have any data imbalance problem? What kind of models you are using? Using stacking based classifier is beneficial if you have different biases. Try to use a simple stack based classifier. For your level-1 classifier, use different models (e.g. SVM-L, SVM-NL, DT, RF, ... etc). For your meta-data, use probabilities and for the meta-classifier use Random Forest. If you have a data imbalance problem using stack based classifier is a little bit more challenging.
