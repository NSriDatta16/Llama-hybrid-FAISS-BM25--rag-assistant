Here is a scientific way to find out an estimate of how high you would have to count. Make MD5 hash that is cut down to say 4 bits. Calculate that (make sure you calculate until you reach say 100 collisions so you get a good average) Then make the same thing at 8 bits (again, wait for many collisions so you can calculate an average). Do it again and again until you have averages for 4, 8, 12, 16 bits and then see if you can find a trend. Follow that trend up to 128 bits You may want to xor all 128 bits to come up with your shorter version. Taking the first or last part may not be the best test.
