It's not possible to learn $NN_{pi}$ without (at least approx.) knowing $\mathbf F$ . You can approximate the derivative of $\mathbf F$ wrt the output of the neural network, say $o$ , numerically. Then, apply back-propagation steps to the rest as usual. The numerical derivative can be calculated in various ways. One simple formula is as follows: $$\mathbf F'(o)\approx\frac{\mathbf F(o+h)-\mathbf F(o-h)}{2h}$$ you should choose $h$ small.
