You can do dynamic arrays and use realloc() when it needs to grow. If possible: Since your initial array to be (perhaps) the average length you expect Use exponential growth, so that when you do reallocate the array, you double the allocated size Of course, you could also do something more intricate, but I would recommend testing with plain reallocated arrays first.
