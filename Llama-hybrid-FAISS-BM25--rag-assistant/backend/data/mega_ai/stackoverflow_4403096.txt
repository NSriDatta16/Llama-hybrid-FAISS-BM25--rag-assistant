Have you tried doing new MakeYearTask().execute(); in onResume() instead? While not elegant you could fire a delayed thread post in on create to wait for a couple of millis. Edit: I just this error: (Caused by: android.view.ViewRoot$CalledFromWrongThreadException: Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views) are you modifying the UI from the AsyncTask? You should just build the data in doInBackground() , but update the ui in onPostExecute() .
