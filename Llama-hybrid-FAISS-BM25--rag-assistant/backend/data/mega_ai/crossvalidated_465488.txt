You're on the right track. You're estimating a linear probability model (LPM) using panel data. [I]n the past when I've done some regression analysis, when the independent variable (Y) is a log, it's possible to say that an increase in one unit of a dependent variable (X) leads to a % increase in Y. Not quite. You are confusing $X$ and $Y$ . I'm sure this was a minor oversight on your part. If you logged $Y$ , you would multiply the coefficient by 100 (e.g., $[\beta\cdot100]$ ) to obtain the percentage change in $Y$ given a one unit increase in $X$ . [S]oftware doesn't let me transform Innovate to Log_Innovate before the regression, I suppose due to the structure of the data. This is not surprising; $\text{log}_{n}(0)$ is undefined . How do I interpret the coefficient for Week? The variable "Week" enters the model as a continuous linear time index. In your setting, the time since the new policy was introduced increases the chance that Innovate = 1. This may not be reasonable. As more and more time passes, it might be less likely that a firm will innovate. A question to consider is whether the probability of "innovating" is linearly related to the time a firm is under observation. Moreover, your data within a firm is clearly truncated; in other words, the time series ends once a firm innovates. This is one of several potential substantive considerations. As for the interpretation, a weekly increment increases the probability a firm will innovate by .176. If you are partial to percentages , then you could interpret this as the probability of firm innovation being 17.6 percentage points higher each weekly increment post-policy adoption. Given the structure of your data, I would investigate the benefits of a survival model .
