If you are generating a new HTML page then you can simply embedd the data in a script tag within the page. More usually we serve up an HTML page which loads a script, that script makes a request to the server, the request returning JSON which is then processed by the script, which will adjust the displayed DOM to show the data. If you're using a framework such as Dojo then the code to do this is pretty easy, see examples such as this Separating out the retrieval of the data from the specific page tends to work out well in the long-run: you then have a data service you can reuse in many pages.
