Seems like since Rails 3.0.3, the association that you want to destroy (attachments, photos) need to be loaded. Take a look at this ticket . A quick fix, which isn't so elegant is to load your association in your update method: @post = Post.includes(:attachments).find(params[:id]) if @post.update_attributes(params[:post]) redirect_to(posts_url, :notice => 'Post updated.' else render :action => "edit" end FYI this is still necessary for Rails 3.0.4.
