A question about Django and Google Apps

Just wondering about this, is it possible to use Django with the Google Apps API's? I have a small organization that uses Google Apps Education Edition. I was thinking about making a small intranet using Django, and I would love if the first page they saw when they logged in had a few widgets with their email, calendar, maybe docs. I looked over some of the api's, and it seemed that getting the data was possible using the gdata library; but when I looked into using Django, all the search results returned pages about running Django on the app engine, nothing about Google Apps. Just looking for a little guidance, if anyone knew a page or a tutorial where someone had done this. Thanks!
