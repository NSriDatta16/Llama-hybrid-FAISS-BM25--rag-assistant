You don't need domready if the code that accesses DOM elements comes after those elements in the markup. This applies to DOM scripting in general, not just YUI. yui2-calendar is not identical to yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/calendar/calendar-min.js. The former includes some wrapping code to sandbox the Calendar API and its dependencies in the YUI 3 instance environment. If you're including the YUI 2 scripts in the (which you arguably should place at the end of the ), you don't need to use yui2-calendar. Doing so just loads the Calendar code twice. Otherwise, to leverage YUI 3's dynamic async loading, you can remove the s from the and just use('yui2-calendar'). You can get the appearance of speeding up the time to render by including the yui2-* combo in your markup after the yui-min.js seed file. Note the Loader will always fetch the css file, so you don't need to include that in the markup. You can include the css and markup of a rendered Calendar on page load, then render into the markup container. I don't think YUI 2 calendar has the notion of progressive enhancement of existing markup baked in, but I could be wrong. It should clobber the static table markup with its generated markup and vivify the UI.
