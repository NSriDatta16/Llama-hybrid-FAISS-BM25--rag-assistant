SOAP-ERROR: Encoding: Violation of encoding rules?

Guys, I'm stuck, banging my head off the desk for the past few hours. I am trying to consume a service, and I have 8 other functions that I call that are almost IDENTICAL in nature to this one, but this one, results in a 'SOAP-ERROR: Encoding: Violation of encoding rules' error. Heres the function call (wsdl omitted for security): function CanLoadProduct($data){ $client = new SoapClient('wsdl-url'); $params = array('username' => $this->username, 'password' => $this->password, 'prod' => $data['productid'], 'mdn' => $data['mdn']); try { $reply = $client->__soapCall("CanLoadProduct", $params); } catch (Exception $e) { echo 'Error: ', $e->getMessage(), "\n"; print_r($params); die(); } if( $reply['result'] == 1 ){ return TRUE; // 1 = true } else { return FALSE; } } Ok so this function, connects to a webservice, the required elements are: username, password, prod, mdn, all 4 of which I supply as part of the $params array. Username/Pass are defined earlier, and do work fine, as the other 8 functions consume the web service without any problems. The $data[] array (that I pass to the function), contains: $data['productid'] $data['mdn'] nothing else is used. I am getting SOAP-ERROR: Encoding: Violation of encoding rules for some unexplained reason, and Googling this error gets me nowhere. Anyone else run into this? Running PHP 5.2.9-2. The strange thing is this is identical to this function which works 100%: function GetPIN($productid){ $client = new SoapClient('wsdl-url'); $params = array('username' => $this->username, 'password' => $this->password, 'prod' => $productid); try { $reply = $client->__soapCall("GetPIN", $params); } catch (Exception $e) { echo 'Error: ', $e->getMessage(), "\n"; die(); } return $reply; } Here is the WSDL (should have posted this first):
