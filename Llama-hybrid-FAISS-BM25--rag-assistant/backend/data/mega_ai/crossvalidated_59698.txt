Neither the ACF nor the PACF are giving any reason to suppose an ARMA process, trend or seasonality: none of the correlations approach significance at conventional levels. Note that sixteen observations is very few to fit a time series model, so the only effects you might see would be very large ones. The residuals of the process are the differences between the observations & the fitted values from your model. If your model's good they should be white noiseâ€”uncorrelated with zero mean. You don't say what model you fit; but the residuals look a little less like white noise than your original series, so it's probably not a good one.
