grep or sed or awk + match WORD

I do the following in order to get all WORD in file but not in lines that start with "//" grep -v "//" file | grep WORD Can I get some other elegant suggestion to find all occurrences of WORD in the file except lines that begin with // ? Remark: "//" does not necessarily exist at the beginning of the line; there could be some spaces before "//". For example // WORD AA WORD // ss WORD
