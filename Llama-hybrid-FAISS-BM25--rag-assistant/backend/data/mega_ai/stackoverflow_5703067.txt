SlickGrid V2.0 Column name/id does not follow column when dragging

I have an application (using SlickGrid) where I need to get the column name or id at any time when user clicks on a cell (this pulls up a menu specific to the data in that column/cell). Grid works fine initially but if the column is moved (drag/drop), the column name/id does not follow the drop but remains mapped to it's initial column position. Has anyone else seen this and, if so, how did you fix it? Thanks
