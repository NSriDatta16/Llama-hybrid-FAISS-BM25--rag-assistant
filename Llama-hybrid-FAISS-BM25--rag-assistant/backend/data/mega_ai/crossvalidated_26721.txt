In statistics, the study of streaming data is called sequential analysis . Machine learning has the closely related concept of online learning , the difference being an emphasis on model fitting (regression), rather than hypothesis testing. From the abstract: A potential clustering with a specified number of clusters is represented by an association hypothesis. Whenever a new report arrives, a posterior distribution over all hypotheses is iteratively calculated from a prior distribution, an update model and a likelihood function. The update model is based on an association probability for clusters given the probability of false detection and a derived probability of an unobserved target. The likelihood of each hypothesis is derived from a cost value of associating the current report with its corresponding cluster according to the hypothesis. A set of hypotheses is maintained by Monte Carlo sampling. In this case, the state-space, i.e., the space of all hypotheses, is discrete with a linearly growing dimensionality over time. To lower the complexity further, hypotheses are combined if their clusters are close to each other in the observation space. Finally, for each time-step, the posterior distribution is projected into a distribution over the number of clusters. To understand the suggested paper ( Sequential clustering with particle filtering: Estimating the number of clusters from data ), you will need to familiarize yourself with Clustering algorithms . Bayesian inference . Lecture by Christopher Bishop of the PRML book Particle filters , also known as sequential Monte Carlo methods . Here are lectures by Simon Godsill , Arnaud Doucet & Nando de Freitas , and Arnaud Doucet of the Sequential Monte Carlo Methods in Practice book. There might be easier ad hoc solutions but these are useful tools so I recommend learning them anyway.
