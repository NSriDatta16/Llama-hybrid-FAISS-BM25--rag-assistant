Any good hashing algorithm will by definition NEVER yield similar hashes for similar arguments. Otherwise, it would be too easy to crack. If the hashed value of "aaaa" looks similar to "aaab", then that is a poor hash. I have racked ones like that before without too much difficulty (fun puzzle to solve!) But you never know maybe your hash algorithm is poor. An idea what it is? If you have time, you can just brute force this solution by hashing every possible word. Not elegant, but possible. Easier if you know the length of the original word as well. If it is a standard has algorithm, like MD5, you can find websites that already have large mappings of source and hash, and get the answer that way. Try http://hashcrack.com/ I used this website successfully after one of our devs left and I needed to recover a password. Cheers, Daniel
