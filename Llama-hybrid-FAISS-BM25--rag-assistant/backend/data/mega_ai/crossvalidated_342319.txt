First of all, the mean is not a good measure of location for everything. For uniform distributions, the average of Min$[X]$ and Max$[X]$ works better. For Cauchy distributions median works better, and properly trimmed mean better yet. For Pareto distributions with exponents $ Second, the confidence intervals of data can be calculated directly from that data as quantiles. That is, assuming that the plot is from observed data, I would re-sample it with replacement n-fold to establish a distribution of mean values, and then take my confidence interval from that. If the curve is not from observed data, but does have an f(x), I would randomly sample f(x) to obtain n-fold means and then establish their confidence interval. I would not use that procedure for Cauchy or other fat-tailed distributions (e.g., Pareto with small magnitude exponents), for uniform distributions or other distributions for which the mean is not a good measure of location. Confidence intervals of a location parameter would be a bit more complicated, because one has to find a proper location first. Next, if all else fails, the confidence intervals of a location parameter could be estimated from bootstrap. And, symmetric they would only exceptionally be.
