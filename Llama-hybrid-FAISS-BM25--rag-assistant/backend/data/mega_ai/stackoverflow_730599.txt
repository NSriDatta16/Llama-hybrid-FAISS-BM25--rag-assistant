I think you'll find that there's no easy way to distinguish between Email Applications opening a html email. All desktop agents use a specific rendering engine that is already built into web browsers (Thunderbird uses Gecko, earlier versions of Outlook use Internet Explorer, Mail.App uses WebKit etc) which makes them virtually indistinguishable from the browser itself. Anyway, from a programming perspective, it's not even useful to be able to tell the difference because, even if you could tell which client is being used, there's no way of taking advantage of that through a PHP script.
