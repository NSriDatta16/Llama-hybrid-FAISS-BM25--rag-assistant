Counterintuitive result for random sample

Say that you're making a political research, and you want to know how many people vote to Party A and how many vote to Party B. (There are only two choices.) You make a random survey of 10 people, and find that 1 out of your 10 votes A, while the other 9 vote B. What would you conclude is the average expected ratio of A voters in the general population? Most people's intuition would say 0.1 . But I calculated it and it came out as 0.0909090 , i.e. 1/11 . It's definitely possible I made a mistake in my calculation. Can you tell me whether my result makes sense?
