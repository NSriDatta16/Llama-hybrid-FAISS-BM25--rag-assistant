how to get clarity on whether to use logistic regression or not? Linear regression is used when you've continuos response variable (like house price) and logistic regression is used when you've categorical response variable (e.g., spam or not spam). There are many other techniques for both purposes. Now, how do I need to check for those many features whether there are having normal-distributions or not? Usually, when prediction accuracy is the objective, some (not all) assumptions of OLS can be safely ignored. By the way, OLS never assumes normally distributed predictors or response variable. It assumes normality of residuals. If your objective is to make inference, then you can check these assumptions (including normality of residuals) either by using statistical tests or diagnostic plots. If you're using R for the same, you can simply get model diagnostic plots using plot(model) function. Let me know, if you've any further query.
