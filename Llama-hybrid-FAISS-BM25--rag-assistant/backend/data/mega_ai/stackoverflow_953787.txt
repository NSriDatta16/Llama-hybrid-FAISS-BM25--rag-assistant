How do you install and use grails test coverage?

I'm trying to get the grails code coverage plugin to work based on these directions: http://www.grails.org/Test+Code+Coverage+Plugin I did: grails install-plugin code-coverage Then: grails test-app Based on that I expect to see a tests/report/cobertura directory, but I don't see anything inside my project after running "grails test-app". I've got grails 1.1 installed and created a new application. Do I need to do anything else to see these reports? Are there better instructions anywhere? Thanks
