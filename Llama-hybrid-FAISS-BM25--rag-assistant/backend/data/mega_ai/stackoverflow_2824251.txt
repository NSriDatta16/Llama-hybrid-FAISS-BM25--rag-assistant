As another poster said, running your process with nice is the way to go, but you did mention that you want to run it at a high priority, which is odd... be aware that if you're running a process at the highest priority and it's pegged, your monitoring system might not even be able to kill it, unless your monitor is at a higher priority still. Anyway.... god , as well as several other process managment tools, can easily kill a process if it's misbehaving in any of several ways.. config looks like this - you set checks at a particular interval, and then you can say "after five checks, nuke it if it's been above 98% CPU usage consistently": restart.condition(:cpu_usage) do |c| c.above = 98.percent c.times = 5 end Another, different take that you might have a look at is chpst from the runit system - it allows you to elegantly set bounds on things (but for CPU limiting, nice is still the tool I'd reach for first).
