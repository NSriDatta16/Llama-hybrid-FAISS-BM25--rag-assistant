Another approach is to go through each table and add information to mongo on a record by record basis and let Mongo do the denormalizing! For instance to add each phone number, just go through the phone number table and do a '$addToSet' for each phone number to the record. You can also do this in parallel and do tables separately. This may speed things up but may 'fragment' the mongo database more. You may want to add any required indexes before you start, otherwise adding the indexes at the end may be a large delay.
