What's the best way to synchronize the state of 2 complex object graph

I have a complex object graph to represent operation scheduling. At one point, I have to serialize the whole graph to the web UI (via XML/JSON) to let user modify the schedule using a Javascript based gantt chart component. After the user finished editing, the state of the graph in the Java/server layer have to be synchronized with the modified state. I'd like to ask about the best strategy to implement such state synchronization of complex object graph, e.g. how should the changes of the state represented so that mimicking the changes in the server side can be made easy? How would others implement this? FYI, my current technology stack: JSF+Richfaces, Seam 2.1, Hibernate 3. But I believe that the solution to this problem can be used in other technology stack too.
