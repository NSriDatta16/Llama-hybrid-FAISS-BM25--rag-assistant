TeamCity - MSBuild - SVN - AssemblyVersion - C#

I'm currently using MSBuild+Community Task's to change the AssemblyVersion, AssemblyFileVersion + more in AssemblyInfo.cs, via TeamCity and it works like a charm :). However I would like to commit the modified AssemblyInfo.cs back to the repo. How can I do that? I tried with the " SvnCommit " task from Community Tasks , but on the Agent's the source is not checked out, it appears to be Exported or copied directly from TC instead (there's no .svn folders). This is actually very cool I think and good practise, but in this case I would really like to be able to commit the updated AssemblyInfo.cs files (+maybe so autogenerated documentation) back to the repo. Anyone found a nice way of doing this? Kind Regards Garrett
