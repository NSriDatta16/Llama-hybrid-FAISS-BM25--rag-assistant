Model evaluation based on WoE: test and train set

I am training Logistic Regression model. First, I prepare the variables. I am confused with the following: Should I transform variables to the ones with WoE (Weight of Evidence) values based on the train set only and then make a corresponding transformation of the variables in the test set? For me it seems reasonable, but from what I have read people make WoE transformation based on the whole data set and then they split it to train-test sets.
