Alex (+1) has the fundamental answer: if you have categorical data the $\chi^2$ test provides a simple test of overall significance. For your data I get a p -value of 0.12, meaning that in 12% of experiments like this you would get at least this large an apparent deviation from independence even if there were no differences among age groups in conversion rates. Is that far enough from "chance" for your application? It doesn't pass the usual "significance" standard of p You might do better if you had individual ages corresponding with individual yes/no conversions. Your categorization of a continuous variable like age is generally unwise ; it implies unrealistic sudden breaks in behavior at specific ages. Modeling age smoothly as a continuous predctor, for example with a regression spline, could be done in a binomial regression model (e.g., logistic regression ). That could be more informative, allowing you to plot estimated conversion rates as a smooth function of age. If you are stuck with age categories, note that binomial regression will allow you to do analysis among specific categories; the $\chi^2$ test only looks at overall deviations from independence among all categories. For your data, expressed as Alex suggests, you could do the following in R: glm(cbind(converted,notConverted)~class,data=yourData,family=binomial(link="logit")) If you pursue this type of work further, look into binomial regression.
