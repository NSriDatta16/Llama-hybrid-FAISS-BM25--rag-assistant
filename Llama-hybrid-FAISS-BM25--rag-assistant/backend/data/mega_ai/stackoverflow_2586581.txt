The third one sounds completely impossible, without having a computer capable of reading the user's mind, and at that point it would still be an invasion of privacy. Despite their reasons, people should be free to review something based on whatever criteria they want to. I think a review based website like IMDB or yelp would do a couple of other things instead: Require the user to either rate so many items or be a member for a certain period of time before their ratings actually count for anything. Hope that the number of reviews are high enough so that a few outliers in either extreme don't affect the average. You may considering using a different algorithm than a pure average to calculate a final score - perhaps use the median instead.
