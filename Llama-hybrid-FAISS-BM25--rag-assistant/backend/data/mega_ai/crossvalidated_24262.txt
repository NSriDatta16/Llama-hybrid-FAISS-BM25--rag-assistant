This is most probably going to be achieved using simulation. Using normal priors for the log odds ratios with "almost 0" precision, estimating the logistic regression model, and computing the parameters' posterior mode gives you approximate frequentist inference. Increasing this precision can be used to represent the strength of prior information. The power of your Bayesian test will, of course, depend on both the precision and the location of the priors so be certain to state explicitly how this information is used.
