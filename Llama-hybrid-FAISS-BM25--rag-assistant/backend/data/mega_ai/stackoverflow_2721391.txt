The STL std::map can be used to build a dictionary. std::map is usually implemented as a search tree, not a hash table. That means both lookup and insertion has different perfomance characteristics than C#'s HashMap - for very large maps, average lookup will be slower, especially if the objects in the map are fragmented in memory. In the TR1 of the new c++ standard, you have std::tr1::unordered_map and std::tr1::unordered_multimap , which will usually be implemented using a hash table. If your compiler does not provide those libraries, you can use the implementation from http://www.boost.org/ . Yet another alternative is Google's sparse_hash .
