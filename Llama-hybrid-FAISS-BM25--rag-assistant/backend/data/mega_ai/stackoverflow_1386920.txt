String.prototype.slugify = function(){ return this.replace('ø','oe').replace('å','aa').replace(/\W/gi,'_').replace(/_+/g,'_'); } var x = 'sdfkjshødfjsåkdhf#@$%#$Tdkfsdfxzhfjkasd23hj4rlsdf9'; x.slugify(); Add as many rules as you'd like following the .replace('search','replace') pattern. Make sure that you finish it with .replace(/\W/gi,'_').replace(/_+/,'_') , which converts . Also ensure you serve it up in UTF-8 to accommodate the special characters like ø. An alternate version, suggested by Strager: String.prototype.slugify = function(){ var replacements = { 'ø': 'oe', 'å': 'aa' } var ret = this; for(key in replacements) ret = ret.replace(key, replacements[key]); return ret.replace(/\W/gi,'_').replace(/_+/g,'_'); } This version is certainly more flexible and maintainable. I'd use this one, though I'm keeping the previous iteration for posterity. Great idea, Strager!
