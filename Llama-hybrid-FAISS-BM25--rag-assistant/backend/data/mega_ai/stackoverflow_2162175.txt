Well, there are ways to shoot the foot but Windows Forms rarely forgets to tell you about it. Yes, there's something special about the "main thread". It runs in STA mode, a Single Threaded Apartment. It is a mode that affects COM components, the shell dialogs like OpenFileDialog and operations like Drag + Drop and the Clipboard. Threads that display a UI always must be STA. That's automatic in normal WF apps with the [STAThread] attribute on the Main() method. In your own app you have to call Thread.SetApartmentState() before you start it. And the thread is special because it pumps a message loop (Application.Run), a requirement for STA threads. By default, any Thread you start or any threadpool thread runs in MTA mode. Threadpool threads cannot be changed, they are always MTA.
