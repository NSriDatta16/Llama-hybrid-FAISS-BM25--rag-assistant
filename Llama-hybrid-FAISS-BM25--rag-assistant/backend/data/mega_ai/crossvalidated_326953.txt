Autocorrelation in returns time series and independence: consequences in regression analysis

Suppose we have a time series that shows signs of dependence between observation. For example returns. I understand that every time we want to draw a conclusion studying the sample we should have the iid property. What are the consequences of dependence in the response variable observations if we use a static model like a simple index model? $$r_t = \alpha + \beta x_t + e_t$$ Can we still make use of the model as explicative one? I have a different framework in mind that is confusing me. I use to fit a ARMA models or ARMA GARCH models to a dependent series like returns to get rid of the autocorrelation and dependence. What are instead the consequeces of autocorrelation (or dependence in general) in residuals if we use a predictive model like $$r_t = \alpha + \phi r_{t-1} + e_t$$ Can anyone make light of this? Thank you.
