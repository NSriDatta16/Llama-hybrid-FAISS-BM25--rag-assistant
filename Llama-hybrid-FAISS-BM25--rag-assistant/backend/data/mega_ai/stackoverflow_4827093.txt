Storing SQL Statements in the Database

Some developers in my company think it is a good idea to get the SQL-Statements out of the production code in to some centralised storage. So they came up with the Idea to store the SQL-Statements in the Database, so they can call data from the database like this: $result = GetData(#querynumber, parameters, ...); Is this good practice? Are there alternatives for centralised storage of the sql-Statements? Prepared statement won't work because we use multiple databases and the database name would be a variable in the sql-statement.
