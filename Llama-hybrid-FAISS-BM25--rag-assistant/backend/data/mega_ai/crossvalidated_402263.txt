One doesn't assume a transformation to minimize the errors. One examines the errors from a tentative model and thus it may be necessary to simply transform the data via Box-Cox as I answered here http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18844/when-and-why-to-take-the-log-of-a-distribution-of-numbers . Often times simple Intervention Detection remedies the apparent need for a Box-Cox transformation as was presented here http://autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog/entry/u-didnt-need-logs . Differencing is a form of a transformation that often is unwarranted while a simple de-meaning might be more applicable. See Evaluating if time series need differencing
