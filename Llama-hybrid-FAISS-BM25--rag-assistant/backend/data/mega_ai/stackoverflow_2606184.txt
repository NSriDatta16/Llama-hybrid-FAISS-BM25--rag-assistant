Pros: Large community Useful for selecting and iterating over sets of DOM nodes Eliminates some inconsistencies between browsers Makes it easy for inexperienced JavaScript developers to do relatively complex scripting tasks Cons: Regular updates that change existing behaviour Some confusing fundamental API methods (e.g. attr() method: what exactly does it do? It certainly blurs the line between attributes and properties) Encourages "chaining", which leads to code that is difficult to debug: in a long chain of jQuery method calls, there's nowhere to put logging statements, so you need a full-on debugger Short list of supported browsers A general point about general purpose libraries: they encourage developers not to attempt to understand the underlying problems that the libraries try to solve, leading to a tendency to think of the library as being magical and to use it for absolutely everything Adds 70K of JavaScript to every page where it's used when often a few bytes of non-jQuery code would do Performance is generally much slower than the equivalent (well thought-through) non-jQuery code Quality of plug-ins is very variable
