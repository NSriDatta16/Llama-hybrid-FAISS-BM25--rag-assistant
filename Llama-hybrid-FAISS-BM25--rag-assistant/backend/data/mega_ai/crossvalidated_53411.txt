Maybe it is not so much about the applications/problems you are aiming for, and its characteristics, but more about the algorithms and variants you are using. More concretely, in order to handle big data, many variants based on stochastic gradient descent of popular algorithms, like SVM, have appear which are able to handle that. Scikit offers support for some of this algorithms (SVM, kNN, kmeans, ...). I guess this nice graph can help you to quickly figure out, if scikit makes sense to you at all. Hope that helps NOTE: what follows is a reply on the comment by zelazny7 Now I understood you. What you are looking for is pandas . Take a look at the talks section. There is a presentation comparing Panda's workflow and panda's briefly. Panda lets you import data in different formats and handle bgu files through HDF5 tables integration. Besides, you can interface Scikit.
