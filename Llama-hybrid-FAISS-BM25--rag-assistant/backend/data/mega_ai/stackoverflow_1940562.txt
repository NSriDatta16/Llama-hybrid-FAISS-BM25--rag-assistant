SQL Server just marks the space of deleted rows as available, but does not reorganize the database and does not zero out the freed up space. Try to "Shrink" the database, and the deleted rows should no longer be found. Thanks, gbn, for your correction. A page is the allocation unit of the database, and shrinking a database only eliminates pages, but does not compact them. You'd have to delete all rows in a page in order to see them disappear after shrinking.
