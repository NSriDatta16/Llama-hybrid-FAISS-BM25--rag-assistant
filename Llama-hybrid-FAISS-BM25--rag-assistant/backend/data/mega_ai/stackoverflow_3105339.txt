Your current web hosting doesn't actually offer you unlimited traffic or space. If you tried to run Facebook on it, your site would either not work or they'd find an excuse to drop you. Bandwidth, servers, and storage are expensive in large quantities. Google App Engine and systems like it are suitable for massive, scalable sites. If you're fine with your current hosting, there's little reason to switch.
