VIF around 3.5 in two covariates, how shall I deal the problem?

in my multinomial logistic regression model (sample size n=290) I am adjusting the results for a group of covariates (n=8). I tested them for multicollinearity and if most of them have a VIF lower than 2, two of them have the variance inflaction factor around 3.4. I know that the safest cut-off is 2.5 but some papers report also 5 as a valid cut-point. How shall I deal with it in my case? I would like to keep these covariates as they tell me something about the model and STATA did not exclude them running the model. How likely am I going to have problems if I state that all my covariates were tested for multicollinearity and all had a VIF lower than 3.5? Many thanks edit: I added my output
