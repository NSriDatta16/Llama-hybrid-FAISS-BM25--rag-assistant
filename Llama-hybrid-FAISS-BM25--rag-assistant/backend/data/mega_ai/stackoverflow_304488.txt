RECENT Java References?

I'e been programming Java forever, but have been away from it for a while. Can anyone recommend a really good Java reference, where "really good" is defined by "Good coverage of the language, detailed coverage of recent extensions, and written for the technical reader (not a "for Dummies" sort of book)"?
