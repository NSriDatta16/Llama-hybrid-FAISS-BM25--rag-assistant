R adding infrequent date 'events' to a time series plot

I am just starting on R - and have hit a bit of a deadlock with some time series data. I have a time series (date and value) in 'zoo' format, that I want to annotate with a cross when an event occurs. The events are irregular and in a csv format (just the dates, sometimes repeated). I've managed to read in the dates etc into a format that R accepts - but i cant seem to get a means to chart the main time series with the secondary events annotated on top? Update: Sorry I missed this out earlier - below is the sort of data i am working with: price I now want to compare number of tweets (for a search term) against this, but i only have spotty data of the form: "February 28, 2010" "February 20, 2010" "February 20, 2010" "August 21, 2009" Some are repeated. So far i've managed to write up a python script to do some cleaning (i.e. a tuple of date, occurrences), but i was hoping I could just work with the raw data using R ? Many thanks
