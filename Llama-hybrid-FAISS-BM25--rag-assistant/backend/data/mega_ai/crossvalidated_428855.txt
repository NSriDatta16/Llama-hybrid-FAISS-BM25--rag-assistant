The first question is whether you really want significance testing. I'm not sure you do, but, if you do, then, sure, the results of Bayesian analysis might give more information, if you supply more information to them by choosing an informative prior. But TANSTAAFL (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch). What if your prior is wrong? From what I have read (certainly not extensive) Bayesian results with a non-informative prior wind up similar to frequentist results. Second, I'm always leery of diagrams like the one you present. They can be useful guides and they are helpful for beginners, but there are always exceptions and special cases. Third, your title question. Are there better methods than NHST? Well "better" isn't defined, but for most purposes, I'd say "yes". I once attended a lecture by Patricia Cohen who, in addition to being a statistician was the widow of Jacob Cohen. She told us that he had wanted to label the method that is usually called null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) something else instead: Statistical Hypothesis Inference Testing (acronym here). How big is the difference? How precise is our estimate of that difference? How is the variable distributed in each group? Might the difference be much larger or smaller than our estimate? Those are usually more interesting questions than "is this difference significant?"
