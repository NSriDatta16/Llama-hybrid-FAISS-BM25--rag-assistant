Since you mentioned you're new to jQuery I would at least start with the jQuery documentation and get comfortable with the basics (see jQuery Documentation ). Once you are comfortable with jQuery, using it in Script# is fairly straight-forward because Script# already includes bindings for jQuery. To get started: Make sure you're including jQuery in your HTML page or templates, as you would normally for jQuery (e.g. ). Verify your Script# project has a reference to Script.jQuery(.dll) . Within your .cs source file(s) add using jQueryApi; (for convenience). This is the namespace containing Script#'s jQuery bindings. Now you can utilize jQuery in your Script# code, in a fashion that maps fairly 1:1 to if you were using jQuery within JavaScript. The biggest difference though is in how you first create a jQuery object. In JavaScript: // selector var paragraphs = $("p"); // ad-hoc html var someHtml = $(" hello "); // existing DOM element var elementFromDom = $(document.getElementById("myDiv")); // ready callback $(function() { doSomething(); }); In Script#/C#: // selector jQueryObject paragraphs = jQuery.Select("p"); // ad-hoc html jQueryObject someHtml = jQuery.FromHtml(" hello "); // existing DOM element jQueryObject elementFromDom = jQuery.FromElement(Document.GetElementById("myDiv")); // ready callback jQuery.OnDocumentReady(delegate { DoSomething(); });
