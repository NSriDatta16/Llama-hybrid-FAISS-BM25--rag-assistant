Your machine never executes IL, it is always translated to machine code. The job of the JIT compiler. The Disassembly window shows you the result of that translation. As long as you do this with the Debug build then you can see a reasonable match between the IL and the machine code. That disappears however when the JIT optimizer is enabled, it makes a lot of optimizations that make the machine code as fast as reasonably possible. Typical is that entire methods disappear (called inlining), local variables disappear (replaced by CPU registers) and code gets re-organized. Any introductory book about the x86 assembly language will help you interpret the machine code.
