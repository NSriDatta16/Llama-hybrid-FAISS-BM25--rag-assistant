Logistic Regression with Multiple Independent Variables vs One Independent Variable

Will the estimates and odds ratios change for an independent variable if it is by itself vs if there are other independent variables? I would think that it would change since thinking of it as an equation $y=x$ (one variable) is different than $y=x+z+q$ (3 variables).
