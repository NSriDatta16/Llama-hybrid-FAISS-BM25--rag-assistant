How could a plugin PreferenceStore be accessed from other plugins?

Would somebody kindly help me about how can I access Java Editor PreferenceStore in my plugin. One way of doing this is: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.JavaPlugin.getDefault().getCombinedPreferenceStore(); But it is highly discouraged as JavaPlugin is an internal class and not API. What is the good way? I am working in Eclipse 3.6 environment.
