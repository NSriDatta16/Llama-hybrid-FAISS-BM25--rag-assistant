How can i force Tinymce to wrap all content inside paragraphs?

I initialize tinymce using forced_root_block: 'p', (this usually works fine). The problem i am facing seems to be a special case. I use Firefox. When i press ctrl+a and when all contetn is marked press one single letter (in example 'd') a closer inspection using firbug shows d If i push a second letter the editors content gets wrapped into a paragraph. I need to style the editors content using css and paragraphs, but when there is no paragraph i am not able to style the content and the user could get irritated. How can i solve this issue?
