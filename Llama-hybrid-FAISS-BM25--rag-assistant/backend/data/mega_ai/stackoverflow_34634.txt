And what's funny (and frustrating!) is that the Microsoft OS X apps (e.g. Entourage) use the Windows standards. I develop on WinXP during the day but have an iMac at home, so it's confusing enough trying to switch modes between work and home. But then I have to remember if I'm writing an e-mail in Entourage, I need to revert back to Windows mode. I can't think of any good reason why MS wouldn't follow the OS X keyboard standards...
