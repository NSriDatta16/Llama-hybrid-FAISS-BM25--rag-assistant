I second what liori said about using XULRunner. You can deploy your HTML application easily, and, more importantly, when you run into limitations of HTML 5 or its level of support in Gecko, you can work around it by using XUL APIs. (AFAIK, Firefox 3.5 doesn't support any socket APIs in HTML content, and it doesn't support offline storage in web apps, only the localStorage part).
