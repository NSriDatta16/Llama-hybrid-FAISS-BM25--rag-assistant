I don't have a copy of MatLab installed, but I think you can do some thing like this; for i=1:length(A) if (A(i)=1), B(i) = 2, B(i)=A(i) end Note, that's only convert 1's to 2's and it looks like you also want to convert 2's to 1's, so you'll need to do a little more work. There also probably a much more elegant way of doing it given you can do this sort of thing in Matlab >> A = 1:1:3 A = [1,2,3] >> B = A * 2 B = [2,4,6] There might be a swapif primitive you can use, but I haven't used Matlab in a long time, so I'm not sure the best way to do it.
