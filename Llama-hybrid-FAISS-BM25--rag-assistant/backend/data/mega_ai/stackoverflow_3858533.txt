How do you handle NULLs in a Date field through your C# code?

I am currently setting the date field to a Datetime.Now which is being done through the SQL query on the database. I do a SELECT NVL(mydatefield, sysdate) FROM myView; This is not the most elegant approach I can think of. The better practice would be to check for a NULL. I found that the DateTime class does not support the syntax that I am using for int values. What approaches have you seen being used? What's your preference? How can you make a DateTime handle null values? I don't want the DateTime.ParseExact in my front-end code to throw an exception.
