Signed Java Applet Throws Security Exception on Connect to a Webservice

I have an java applet running on tomcat 5.5. It is signed ( -selfcert). I still get an java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.lang.RuntimePermission createClassLoader) Exception, when my Applet tries to connect to a webservice (already in this line): ws_locator = new My_WebserviceLocator(ws_adress + "?wsdl", new javax.xml.namespace.QName("http://impl.webservice", "My_Webservice")); Since there are some similar questions here, an i read them: Yes, the applet is signed. I checked it with -verify. Tomcat security exception, may be, but i have added to catalina.policy: grant codeBase "file:/home/me/apache-tomcat-5.5.27/webapps/myapplet/-" { permission java.security.AllPermission; }; grant codeBase "file:/home/me/apache-tomcat-5.5.27/webapps/myapplet/applet.jar" { permission java.security.AllPermission; }; and the usual stuff like is also in there: grant codeBase "file:${java.home}/jre/lib/ext/-" { permission java.security.AllPermission; }; with no result. Ok, quick update, adding: grant{ permission java.security.AllPermission; }; to the local java.policy file fixes the problem. BUT thats not what i am looking for, the applet should run on an avarage machine, with dafault java.policy file. So it has to be fixed from within the code.
