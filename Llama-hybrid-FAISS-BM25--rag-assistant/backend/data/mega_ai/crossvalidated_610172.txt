You can apply whatever rule you want. If you can validate that it works (e.g., holdout set, bootstrap, cross validation), then this kind of stepwise regression could be competitive with other predictive modeling techniques . More typical approaches would be based on Akaike or Bayesian information criteria, however, such as what is performed in the stepAIC function in R software. Keep in mind, though, that extreme care is required to have the desired properties. Software might report values like adjusted $R^2$ and coefficient confidence intervals, but these are misleading. This is related to points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 here .
