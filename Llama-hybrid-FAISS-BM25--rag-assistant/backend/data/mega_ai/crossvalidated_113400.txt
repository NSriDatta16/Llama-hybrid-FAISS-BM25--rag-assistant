Calculate the variance explained in matrix Y by matrix X

I have two matrices corresponding to the same set of $n$ samples, with $j$ and $k$ variables, respectively ($j > 10000$, $k > 10000$). $X$ is an $n \times j$ matrix and $Y$ is an $n \times k$ matrix. I'm interested to know what proportion of the overall variance of $Y$ can be explained by $X$. The ultimate goal is to compare $X$ to a similar matrix $X'$ and see which one explais $Y$ and what overlap in the explained variance these both matrices have. My first approach was to try PLS, however I don't understand this method enough to know what I'm doing, and in any case, the implementation I tested (pls package in R) exited with an error indicating the failure to allocate half a terabyte of memory. Furthermore, I was considering a following approach (possibly this is re-inventing the wheel; also, it might be completely wrong). PCA can partition the variance in both $X$ and $Y$, such that the resulting components have variances that sum up to 1, and are orthogonal. Therefore, I could try to calculate for the first component of $PCA(Y)$, what percentage of variance is explained using $X$; in R code, I'd try set.seed(2708) data(iris) Y Then I could add these values for each component, multiplied by the fraction of variance in Y that this component holds: Yvars Does this make ANY sense? Computationally, it works as intended, i.e. the $X$es that are less predictive for $Y$ get a lower value. However, it does not work (obviously) when $n Finally, I would like to have a test or criterion to compare $X$ and $X'$.
