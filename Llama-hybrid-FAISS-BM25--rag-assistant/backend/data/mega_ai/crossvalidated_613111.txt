Understanding residual vs fit plot for mixed effect model with AR1 structure

I am running a linear mixed effects model for time series data using R-INLA. My response variable is normally distributed. The model has a random intercept, and temporal autocorrelation between data points is modelled with a first order autoregressive structure. The parameter estimates from the model match our hypotheses. However, when I check diagnostic plots for the model, the residuals vs fitted values plot has a very clear pattern. Other diagnostic plots (like the QQ plot, etc.) look fine. I’m assuming that this residual vs fitted plot is telling me that there is a non-linear relationship between my response variable and my fixed effects variables. But I am not sure how to fix this. I was wondering if you could please give me some suggestions. Here is the plot: Here is the code for the model: m_inla1 Where y is a continuous variable. Four of the covariates (x1, x2, x3, and x4) are also continuous variables. These have been standardised using the r function ‘scale’, which standardises each value by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The final covariate (x5) is a binary categorical variable that takes the value 0 or 1. The variable ‘group’ is the random intercept and has 48 levels. Thanks so much!
