R LambertW package - Gaussianize(): Why is transformation not possible? "Error in delta_Taylor(z.init) : kurtosis.y > 0 is not TRUE"

I am using the R package LambertW , specifically the function Gaussianize() . I have the following vector: > P That I want to transform: > Gaussianize(P, type="hh", method = "MLE", return.tau.mat = TRUE) However, that gives me the warning: Error in delta_Taylor(z.init) : kurtosis.y > 0 is not TRUE But that is not true, it seems (Kurtosis =4.2; see picture): > test_norm(P) $seed [1] 909198 $shapiro.wilk Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: data.test W = 0.86767, p-value = 4.829e-09 $shapiro.francia Shapiro-Francia normality test data: data.test W = 0.86613, p-value = 4.768e-08 $anderson.darling Anderson-Darling normality test data: data A = 8.1021, p-value Can anybody help?
