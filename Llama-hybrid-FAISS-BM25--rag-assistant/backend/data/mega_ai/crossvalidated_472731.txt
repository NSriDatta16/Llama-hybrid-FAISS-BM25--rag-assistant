I played with Prophet a bit. They promise big. As I understood their claim was for the framework for massive forecasting. If you have 10,000 series to forecast, there's no way to do it manually. So, let's just run the thing on all of them automatically, and maybe we'll get a decent set of forecast on average. In finance we also forecast massive numbers of series, e.g. loan loss forecasting may involve millions of loans in the portfolio. In this case we manually strat the portfolio, and manually build models for each strat then run the same model on all loans. Prophet would not need this, because it would estimate a separate model, potentially with its own variables for each loan. However, I tried Prophet on a different problem. I had just a few series, and looked at the quality of the forecast. The problem that I saw was the "change point" detection. In essence, if I understood right what it's doing then Prophet adjusts the slope if it think it encountered a change point. That was a problem for me because we sometimes have temporary deviations from the mean, could be a different regime, then things get back to old way. In other words mean reversion is quite prevalent. Prophet would not be able to say what is a true change point. However, this is not a criticism of a framework. It's just difficult generally to detect a change point automatically or manually.
