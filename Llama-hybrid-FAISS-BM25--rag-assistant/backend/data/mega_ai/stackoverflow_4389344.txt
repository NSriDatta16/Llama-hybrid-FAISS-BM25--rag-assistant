Beanshell (as Boris suggested) is a way to "execute" java source code. But it looks like, you want to "execute" fragments that can interact with the compiled classes. Your example contains variabe names. Reflection will definitly not help, because reflection targets classes ("classfiles"). You could try to define a complete class ("valid java source file"), compile it and load it (url classloader). Then you should be able to use the methods from that "live generated class". But once a class is loaded, you can't get rid of it (unload), so this will work only once (AFAIK).
