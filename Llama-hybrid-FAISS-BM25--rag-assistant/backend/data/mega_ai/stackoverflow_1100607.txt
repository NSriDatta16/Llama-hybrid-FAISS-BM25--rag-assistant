I did Oracle database design for a large organization, and we used triggers as much as we could due to the fact that we had business rules that had to be enforced when data was coming from several directions (the application's GUI, and SQL scripts used for data migration). The business rules we enforced were pretty simple (date checking, checking for existence of rows in another table, etc...). If we tried to make them to complex, we got the dreaded "mutating table" error, which basically means you're trying to inspect the table that is currently changing. So triggers can be useful in some situations, but can cause headaches. As far as indexes go, in my opinion it is -very- important to have indexes on the columns that are used for joining tables together. That's an easy way to increase performance. About the foreign keys: since the database changed hands so much, I wonder if the foreign keys could have been dropped accidentally, somewhere along the line. I used PL-SQL developer and some seemingly-innocent operations (like adding/removing a column I think, but I'm not sure) caused the foreign keys to all be deleted.
