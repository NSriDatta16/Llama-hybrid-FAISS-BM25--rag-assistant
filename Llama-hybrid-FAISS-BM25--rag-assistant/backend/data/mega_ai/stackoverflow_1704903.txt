Anyone who honestly thinks that you can arbitrarily define how many member variables a class should have has not written a lot of code or are extremely arrogant. I know it just a guideline, but honestly, if the class is well defined, conforms to the general OOP guidelines of single responsibility, and is easy to maintain, you should just spend your time solving real problems. BTW, I realize that this is not an actual answer, so let the downvoting begin. I just had to vent :) EDIT: Just did a little searching and found that this 'guideline' comes from the fact that humans have trouble remembering sequences of information with more than five or six discrete data points. Well, that's nice, and it is something to remember (especially when designing user interfaces), but in practice you cannot design your code this way. Do what makes sense and makes your life easier (maintenance considerations being part of that decision).
