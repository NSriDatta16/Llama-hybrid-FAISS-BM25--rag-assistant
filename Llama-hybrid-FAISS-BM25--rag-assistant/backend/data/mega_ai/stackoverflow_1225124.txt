Qt Model/View programming with complicated data structures

I am not a professional application developer so am probably not as familiar with the model/view design pattern as I should be. Nonetheless, I am trying to use it in a hobby app and failing miserably. The primary problem I am having is that the data I am trying to display and modify is not easily represented with an extension of QAbstractItemModel . The data I am trying to encapsulate is essentially a growable/shrinkable, mutable list of integers. Should I abandon the model/view pattern for data like this? It seems more appropriate when the "dimensions" of the data are fixed. If not, is there an example of an implementation that I could take a gander at, or a good book that I should pick up? Regards.
