One of the toughest parts about Magento is understanding the whole. Invest some time in understanding the templating and design overrides. Practicaly speaking: Create a new theme directory in your magento design director instance COPY the list.phtml into the same directory in that new design directory Make changes to your copy Specify the new theme directory in the design area of your config as an override That's what you need to do in a nut shell. Dont' just start changing the list.phtml in the Magento core...if you do, you'll regret it later :) --- Later Addition --- To achieve the layout, I would recommend putting in some sort of a "counter" that inserted some additional css class on the first and (in the case of your example) tenth item. You can also edit the layout xml files to make your list display 10 at a time (if not through the config directly Edit: count() ?> getColumnCount(); ?> first last firstItem lastItem "> getProductUrl() ?>" title=" htmlEscape($this->getImageLabel($_product, 'small_image')) ?>" class="product-image"> helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'small_image')->resize(135); ?>" width="135" height="135" alt=" htmlEscape($this->getImageLabel($_product, 'small_image')) ?>" />
