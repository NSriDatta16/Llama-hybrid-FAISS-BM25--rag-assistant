Android ObjectAnimation only started once

I use the ObjectAnimator API (android.animation.ObjectAnimator) to animate a button once it's clicked (v is the Button): ObjectAnimator animator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(v, "rotationY", 360f); animator.setDuration(5000); animator.start(); When I test this on the emulator, it works for the first click (button rotates). But when I click the button again (the fragment is not destroyed etc. after the first click), I don't see any animation on the emulator (the emulator isn't the fastest, but with 5 seconds I should see something). Do I need to destroy/close something after the first animation or what am I missing? Does anyone have a hint or can reproduce this? Thanks in advance, Martin
