While not an expert, I would give one of the more common examples of trust is if you bought hosting through a shared hoster through some vendor for $10 a month, where you don't have direct access to the machine, but get an allotted storage space. In this scenario, you get medium trust typically because the hoster wants to limit what you can do (make sure you can't delete or modify something that's not supposed to be), and don't have access to certain resources (like try to read a file outside of the folder you have permission to) and other tasks. We have full access to our machine where we host a site, and we give it full trust, it isn't a concern for us since its dedicated to our web site and not a shared resource.
