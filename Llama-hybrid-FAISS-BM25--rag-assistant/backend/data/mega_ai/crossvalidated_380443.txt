The average change interpretation when the dependent variable is in logarithm

Suppose the regression model is $\text{wage} = \beta_1x_1 + u$ . The conditional expectation function is $\operatorname{E}[\text{wage} \mid x_1] = \beta_1x_1$ . Then, we interpet $\beta_1$ as the change in $\text{wage}$ if $x_1$ changes by one unit "on average" because what is changing is the expected value of wage. Now consider the model $\text{lwage} = \beta_1x_1 + u$ . The conditional expectation function is $\operatorname{E}[\text{lwage} \mid x_1] = \beta_1x_1$ . If I do not take the expectation, it is straightforward to see that $\beta_1$ gives the percentage change in wage when $x_1$ changes by one unit. But I wonder what the change in the expected value of log entails. I somehow want to end up with the "on average" interpretation.
