Does it make sense to convert a time plot to a distribution

I'm plotting time series data where the 5th-95th percentile values overlap so it looks pretty messy. The data is based on a simulation which tracks military 96,000 military personnel purchase of clothing, which is based on a point system. What I'm plotting in the upper chart is the total points used by all personnel in each year from Year 1 (FY 17/18) to Year 7. To make the charts readable I just used the means in a plot, which looks like this: You see the mean of S8 rises from year 1 to year 2 and stays nearly constant for the next 5 years. I thought it would look better if I just plotted the data as a distribution, but I wasn't sure if this made sense given that it's no longer a time series. The chart I got looks like this: Sample Data for the line and dist charts are as follows: S8Line S8Dist
