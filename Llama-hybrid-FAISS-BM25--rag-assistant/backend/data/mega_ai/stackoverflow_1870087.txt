If you want all members of a group, try this: 1) bind to the group: DirectoryEntry theGroup = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://cn=YourGroupname,ou=SomeOU,dc=YourCompany,dc=com"); 2) Then, enumerate its members - it's the "member" property of the group's DirectoryEntry : foreach(object dn in theGroup.Properties["member"]) { Console.WriteLine(dn); } Each entry in the group's "member" property should be the full DN (distinguished name) of its members - users or other groups. Your question says you're trying to enumerate the members of a group - yet your code looks more like you're trying to enumerate everything inside an OU (organizational unit) - those two tasks are quite different! Which do you really need? You can find a Quick List for Visual Basic.NET Code Samples on the MSDN library, or you can learn more about How to do almost everything in Active Directory on CodeProject (with C# samples). Marc
