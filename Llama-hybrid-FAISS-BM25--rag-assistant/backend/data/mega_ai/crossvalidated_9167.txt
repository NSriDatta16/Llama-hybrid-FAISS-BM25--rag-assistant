I have observed the term "gold standard" in quotes more times than not, so I take it to mean something that is highly subjective. Even in the Wikipedia article some paragraphs refer to it in quotes. The OP is also referring to a "gold standard dataset" which I take it to mean a "Gold Standard" for descriminant Analysis, as in Fishers' Iris dataset being the "Gold Standard". But I am not 100% sure usage is consistant.
