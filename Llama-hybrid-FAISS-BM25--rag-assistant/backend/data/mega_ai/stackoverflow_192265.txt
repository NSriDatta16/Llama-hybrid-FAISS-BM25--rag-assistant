Binding controls to data works well in Delphi, but unfortunately only when that data resides in a TDataSet descendant. You could write a TDataSet descendant that uses an object for data storage, and it turns out that one such thing already exists. See link below... This implementation appears to only work with collections of objects (TCollection or TObjectList), not single objects. http://www.torry.net/pages.php?id=563 - search the page for for "Snap Object DataSet" I have no personal experience with this, but it would be very useful if it works and especially if it would also work with single object instances, such as a property on a data module...
