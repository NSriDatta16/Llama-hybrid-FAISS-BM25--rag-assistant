A random walk $\langle X_t\rangle$ is defined as \begin{align}X_t &:= X_{t-1} + Z_t\\ &= \sum_{j=1}^t Z_j,\tag 1\label 1\end{align} where $\langle Z_t\rangle$ is a discrete time, pure random process with mean being $\mu,$ and variance $\sigma^2.$ So, from $\eqref 1, ~\mathbb E[X_t] = \mu t; ~~\operatorname{Var}[X_t] = \sigma^2 t,$ which imply the mean and variance vary over $t.$ This certainly means random walk process $\langle X_t\rangle$ is non-stationary. Now $\nabla X_t = Z_t,$ which is definitely stationary as it is a purely random process. Cyclical variations are intuitively speaking manifestations of oscillations not having a fixed period. Stationarity means there is no systematic change in mean and variance: properties of a section should resemble that of other section. So, what the authors in the given quote clearly meant is that presence of cyclical behavior needn't imply non-stationarity. Because they, by definition, aren't of fixed length. Random walks on other hand exhibit changes in variance over time, with "sudden and unpredictable changes in direction."
