SVM classification metrics are all 1 although there are mistakes in classification

Here is a fitted LinearSVC model showing the learned separating hyperplane for my training samples: And when I use classification_report for the training samples, I get below table where all metrics are 1. precision recall f1-score support False 1.00 1.00 1.00 1760 True 1.00 1.00 1.00 3296 accuracy 1.00 5056 macro avg 1.00 1.00 1.00 5056 weighted avg 1.00 1.00 1.00 5056 Why is this the case? How can I get metrics reflecting the fact that there are misclassified samples? I also tried a logistic regression classifier, and again the metrics are all 1 from that..
