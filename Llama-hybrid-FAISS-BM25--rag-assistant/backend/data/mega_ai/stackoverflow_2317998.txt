iPhone provisioning profile renewal help

my problem is that my provisiong profile expired a few days ago. I visited the developer's portal and downloaded a new one (made it the same name and everything). I followed the instructions and installed the new one and removed the old. I can now run my app on my iPhone again :) but whenever i try to test my app on my iPhone from Xcode i get the error: provisioning profile expired. When i check in the 'Organizer' the new profile doesn't expire til 22 May and on the iPhone the profile is verified and again doesn't expire til 22 May. Did i forget to remove something from somewhere and Xcode is still seeing the old profile? Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks
