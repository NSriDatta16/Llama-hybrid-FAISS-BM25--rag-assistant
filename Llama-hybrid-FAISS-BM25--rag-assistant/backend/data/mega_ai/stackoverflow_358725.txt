You could opt for an automatic solution. I believe there're multiple options at your disposal for detecting if you're hung. One would be the use of SendMessageTimeout (also pay attention to SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG as one of the fuFlags values) from a separate thread in your app. Once you have determined the main thread is not responding you can save a dump file wherever you want. There's also a IsHungAppWindow() (user32.dll) available since w2k.
