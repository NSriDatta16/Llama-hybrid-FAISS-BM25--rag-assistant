Encoder Decoder networks with varying image sizes

Encoder Decoder Network - Computerphile : At the very beginning of this video, Michael Pound goes on to say: So it (encoder decoder network) makes no assumptions about the size of the input the number of parameters, it just adapts itself depending on the size of the input . Which for images you can imagine makes quite a lot of sense they change size quite a lot, but in most other ways it acts exactly like a normal deep network (emphasis mine) Visual representation of a convolutional encoder decoder for image segmentation: What I don't understand is the following: If the input layer is a convolutional layer, doesn't this mean that the number of input neurons are fixed? How can we feed in different image sizes to the same convolutional neural network and still get correct image segmentation?
