Installing Chrome extensions when --user-agent flag is overridden

At work I'm behind a proxy that kills traffic from Google Chrome, by detecting the User-Agent . I can get around this by overriding the --user-agent option and setting it to Safari. The problem is that I now cannot install any Chrome extensions because Google's website specifically looks for "Chrome" in the User-Agent variable. Does anyone know of a way to get around this, and trick google into installing a Chrome extension? EDIT : I tried setting U-A to "Chromium" already and that is also blocked.
