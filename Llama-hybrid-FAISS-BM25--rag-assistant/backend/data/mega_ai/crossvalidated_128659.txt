The odds ratio in that table is: (9/43)/(4/44) = 2.30 What John_w computed was a risk ratio. Now you can see that the manually computed odds ratio is exactly the same as the one produced by logistic regression. Both tests you suggested test the null-hypothesis that this odds ratio is equal to 1. The p-values should be close enough to not matter. For example doing this in Stata gives the following output: . // prepare the data . clear . input female right freq female right freq 1. 0 1 43 2. 0 0 9 3. 1 1 44 4. 1 0 4 5. end . label define female 0 "male" 1 "female" . label value female female . label variable female "respondent's sex" . . label define right 0 "left-handed" 1 "right-handed" . label value right right . label variable right "respondent's handeness" . . // tabulate . tab female right [fw=freq], lr chi2 | respondent's respondent | handeness 's sex | left-hand right-han | Total -----------+----------------------+---------- male | 9 43 | 52 female | 4 44 | 48 -----------+----------------------+---------- Total | 13 87 | 100 Pearson chi2(1) = 1.7774 Pr = 0.182 likelihood-ratio chi2(1) = 1.8250 Pr = 0.177 . . // the odds ratio: . di (9/43)/(4/44) 2.3023256 . . // logistic regression . logit right female [fw=freq], or nolog Logistic regression Number of obs = 100 LR chi2(1) = 1.82 Prob > chi2 = 0.1767 Log likelihood = -37.726174 Pseudo R2 = 0.0236 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ right | Odds Ratio Std.
