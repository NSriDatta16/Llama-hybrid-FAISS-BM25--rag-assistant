Many object oriented pundits/pandits would tend to silently say, you've got it wrong. Wrong, not because the answer is wrong but the thinking process needs to be resequenced. Let's say you are a submarine designer. You have designed the Nehru class submarine. You have the blue prints but not the submarines. On blue print of Nehru class, you have the designer's name - Sonia Gandhi. So now people could STATICally refer to Nehru->designer which yields the value "Sonia Gandhi". Now, every submarine has a captain. Since no submarine has been built yet, you cannot refer to any captain and therefore the reference Nehru->captain is not logical. Then you build 10 Nehru class submarines, each assigned a captain. Some of the submarines are the Mumbai, the Delhi, the Rafael Jacob, the Rishi Kapoor. You still cannot refer to Nehru->captain to get any of the ten captains' names. You could say Delhi->captain, Mumbai->captain or Rishi Kapoor->captain and get the respective captain's name, but there would not be any such valid reference as Nehru->captain because the Nehru reference is a class design and not a ship. However, you could refer to Delhi->designer or Mumbai->designer or Rafael Jacob->designer which will yield "Sonia Gandhi" just as Nehru->designer would. There, got it?
