Using LuaDoc with extensions other than .lua

I am currently developing lua scripts for a new application which requires the extension to be xx_lua . I have luadoc working fine for .lua extensions and I know I could simply rename the files to the lua extension create the documents and rename them back, but personally I would prefer a more elegant solution. Is is possible to get luadoc to look at other extensions. I have tried calling luadoc_start *.xx_lua but that results with no output even when there are plenty of files in the path with that extension.
