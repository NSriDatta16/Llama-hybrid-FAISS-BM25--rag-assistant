Post/Redirect/Get in Webkit causes a full page reload

It seems that in Webkit-based browsers (Chrome and Safari) when a Post/Redirect/Get is performed on the server, the entire page (html + images + css, etc.) is redownloaded. It appears the same as if you reloaded the page. There's been a question (and somewhat of a solution) posted in the Google Chrome Help: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=72bf3773f7e66d68&hl=en Does anyone have a more elegant way of doing this? I'm working with ASP.NET MVC and would prefer to not write a custom Redirect result that returns Javascript or the actual page based on the UserAgent. Should I just hope and wait that Webkit will change its behavior?
