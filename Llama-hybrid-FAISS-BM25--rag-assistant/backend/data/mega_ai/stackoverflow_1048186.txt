The question would be easier to answer if we understood why you would want to do this? For JavaFX the answer is both yes and no, depending on what it is you want to achieve. JavaFX compiles to Java classes and in theory you can call the compiled JavaFX classes from any JVM language that can call Java classes. However, this isn't as simple as it sounds because some of the stunts they are pulling to implement the JavaFX language features make the implemented classes quite complex and the name mangling is not defined and subject to change. Any solution written this way would be very fragile. However, much of the JavaFX functionality is based on pure Java libraries such as JMC (Java Media Components) for the media support and the scenegraph project ( https://scenegraph.dev.java.net/ ) for the 2D scenegraph. These projects are written in Java and are much easier to call from Java and other JVM based languages. I don't have any experience of Flex but as far as I know, you are stuck with MXML and ActionScript.
