Custom error function for randomForest R package

I am a R beginner. Is there a way to specify custom error function with Random Forests in R? For example, say my training data is ,,, so on and my error for any given set needs to normalize the weights and then calculate the mean of absolute error. So my error for each data point is (predicted-actual)*normalized_weight . I don't know how to specify this with the randomForest function. I could do something like randomForest(value*weight~.,...) -- but this doesn't normalize the weight. Any one has any idea?
