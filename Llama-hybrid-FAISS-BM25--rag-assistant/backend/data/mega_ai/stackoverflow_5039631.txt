In a drap and drop between explorer and your app, how to know your app directory?

I have a little command line app tool xyz.exe that accepts a filename f as argument and then will call a program abc.exe that lives in the same folder as xyz.exe with some data as argument plus f . The ideia would be to drag and drop some file from windows explorer into my program so it calls abc.exe with the proper parameters. When I say to drop into my program, I mean to drop the file into abc.exe , so it runs it with the filename as argument. The problem is that I need a way to know in which folder abc.exe is. I know it will be the same folder as xyz.exe , but it seems that in drag and drop operations Environment.CurrentDirectory will show up some windows folder instead of the folder where abc.exe / xyz.exe reside. How can I solve this?
