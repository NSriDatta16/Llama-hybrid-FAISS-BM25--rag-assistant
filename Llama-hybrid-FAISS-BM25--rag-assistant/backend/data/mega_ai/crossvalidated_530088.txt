What is the consequence of misspecification in logistic regression

In linear regression, the Ramsey RESET test can be used to test if the model is misspecified. The Gauss-Markov theorem allows us to understand the consequences of misspecification in linear regression. However, what will happen if a logistic regression is misspecified? The principle of Ramsey test may also be applied to logistic regression as suggested in the paper: A regression error specification test (RESET) for generalized linear models Suppose the test result indicates the logistic regression is misspecified, what would be the impact or consequences?
