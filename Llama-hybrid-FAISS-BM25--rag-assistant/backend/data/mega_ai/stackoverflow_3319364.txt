Memory and hard drive speed are the most important things. If you compile frequently, more memory should mean more files are accessed from the cache rather than from the file. Writing time is generally HD dependent, and compiling Java usually means writing a lot of separate files. The file system that you use can have a huge impact here, so can defragmenting your disk. If memory and HD are not bottlenecks, then the number of cores in your CPU might matter, if your environment is smart enough to make us of them (IMHO most environments do a poor job here). Also, as with teapots and boiling water, a compiler that is being watched takes longer to compile.
