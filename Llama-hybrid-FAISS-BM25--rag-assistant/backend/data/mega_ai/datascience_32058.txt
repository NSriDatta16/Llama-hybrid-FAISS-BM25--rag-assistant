Classification of Colors using Machine Learning from an Array of Pixels

From a very high level of possible machine learning methodologies, what method of classification would be good to identify objects or situations based on the color sensor pixel array (i.e., 16x16 array) being fed into Python? For example, if I want to identify certain fruits based on the shape and color detected in the array: banana is curved and yellow apple is circle and red orange is circle and orange If I am reading in a constant stream of data in this array form, are there any similar machine learning and classification applications that might be best suited for this type of application?
