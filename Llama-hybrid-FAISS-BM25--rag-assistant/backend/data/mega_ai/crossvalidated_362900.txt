I suggest to use the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test for logistic regression which is implemented in the ResourceSelection library with the hoslem.test function. See: thestatsgeek.com/2014/02/16/ - Marco Sandri But as @kjetilbhalvorsen points out below, Frank Harrell disagrees : The Hosmer-Lemeshow test is to some extent obsolete because it requires arbitrary binning of predicted probabilities and does not possess excellent power to detect lack of calibration. It also does not fully penalize for extreme overfitting of the model. Better methods are available such as Hosmer, D. W.; Hosmer, T.; le Cessie, S. & Lemeshow, S. A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model. Statistics in Medicine , 1997, 16 , 965-980 Their new measure is implemented in the R rms package.
