Port LAMP application to EC2

Any good resource on how to port a LAMP stack to Ec2? Mainly I'm concerned about storage, the MySQL part. The existing app works agains a single store. Do I need to port all my storage to S3? Will the EC2 instances be able to share a single MySQL database? Alternatively I can partition my data and have a single database for each EC2 image, but I still need a global user account database for authentication and if the data is partitioned the requests have to be routed to the proper image. Not sure how this is achieved in EC2. To wrap up: where should I start?
