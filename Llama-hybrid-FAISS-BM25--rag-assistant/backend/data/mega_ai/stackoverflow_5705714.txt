Use remap function of codeigniter. The second segment of the URI typically determines which function in the controller gets called. CodeIgniter permits you to override this behavior through the use of the _remap(). What you can do is this: IN the controller the make the function _remap(){} Now, in the remap function use the URL segment to get the fragments of your URL. If the query is such: http://mysite.com/phones/samsung/model_name/ Your remap should find the segments "samsung" , "phones" and "model_name" .. run a query to get the details (coresponding ids etc) and then voila you have a dynamic running system.
