Thanks for the help, but I managed to find own solution and I think it works even better than my original idea. You can go back to the page and see it in action, but if you're curious, here's what I did. I basically just added... .load { background-image: url('img/ajax-loader2.gif'); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: bottom right; } #printout { border: 1px black dotted; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left; padding: 10px; height: 100px; width: 400px; } And then... $("button").click(function () { var v = $("select").attr("value"); --> $("#printout").addClass("load"); $("#printout").removeClass(); And I think the end result is elegant and unobtrusive. Maybe a few more lines than some of the other solutions mentioned, but this can be applied to many more situations with minimal adjustment.
