Is there a G-test equivalent for continuous variables?

The G-test is similar to the chi-square test for goodness of fit. It is proportional to the kl-divergence . I am wondering if there is a similar test that is applicable to continuous variables. Since there is a continuous version of kl-divergence, so I imagine there could be something of this sort. I'm also guessing the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test wouldn't be the answer, since it focuses on goodness of fit based on max distance of the CDF, while kl-divergence is a metric that relies an averaging.
