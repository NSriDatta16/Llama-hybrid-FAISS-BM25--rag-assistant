Cochran's Q test is a generalization of the McNemar test when outcomes are binary, as they seem to be in your case (positive/negative infection assessment by either PCR or bacterial culture). Whether that's a wise choice in this circumstance is a separate question. That might tell you whether there are any differences but it won't provide much more information. It also would tend to ignore systematic differences between tonsil and quinsy , which are of a different nature than a simple difference between test results on the same type of sample. I suspect that a mixed logistic regression model would be more informative. For each combination of sample type and test you would have a separate data row, having 0/1 as the test result along with annotations for sample type, test type, and an ID for the clinical case. Fixed effects would be sample type, test type, and their interaction. A random intercept for ID would account for the within-patient correlations.
