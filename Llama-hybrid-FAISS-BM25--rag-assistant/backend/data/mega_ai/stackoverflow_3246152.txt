TDD also helps you get awesome test coverage and kinda forces you to build well structured, separated code => Good testability. If you build a system 100% TDD you will have tests on everything meaning your system will be alot safer to changes and the possibility of implementing bugs in the future will be way smaller. Takes longer to develop, but in the long run provides a better result.
