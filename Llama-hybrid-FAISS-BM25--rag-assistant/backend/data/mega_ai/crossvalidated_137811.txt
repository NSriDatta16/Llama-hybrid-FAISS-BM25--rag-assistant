You have to ask yourself what this “probability of dying in plane crash” represents and how it applies to your problem (or not). Look at it this way: If you never fly at all, your chances to die in a plane crash are going to be much lower (but not nil, cf. El Al Flight 1862 or Air France Flight 4590 ). If you fly every day for most of your life, your chances to die in a plane crash are obviously higher than if you don't. It seems to me that there is plausible model of how plane crash deaths happen that make them completely unrelated to being in an airplane. Consequently, I would guess that this 1 in 10,000 figure does not quite mean what you think it means. Maybe it's an average based on comparing deaths in plane crash to other causes of death or it's a reasonable estimate of the risk based on a typical “flying profile” in your country but it can't possibly be exactly the same for people with widely different plane-taking behaviour. The difference between one flight and two flights might be tiny and your scenario also invites thinking about the difference between one flight (one take-off/one landing) and time spent in the air but if you do accept that people who never fly have a lower risk of dying in a plane crash than people who fly constantly, you can't assume than the probably of dying in a plane crash in completely independent from the number of flights you take.
