RNN, binary classification with very different performance for each class

I am currently using an RNN for an underlying binary classification problem (0,1). When I look at the results I have one big question, why is the out of sample accuracy for class "1" much better than the accuracy for class "0"? I identify class 1 in almost 90% of the cases correctly, while class 0 is correctly classified in only 10-20% of the cases. Does anybody have an idea what induces this problem and maybe how to solve it?
