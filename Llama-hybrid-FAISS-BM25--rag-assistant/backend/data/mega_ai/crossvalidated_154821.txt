If you know the times of the events to a precision about 100 times that of the average interval or greater, it is possible to use event interval analysis to examine changes in rate. In such an analysis, the intervals between events are used as the primary data, and a uniform distribution of events is the typical null hypothesis. While this has previously been used for event sequences of much lower frequency, the method should be applicable. See Lemon, J. (2014) The analysis of event rates using intervals. The Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 10(1): 68-76.
