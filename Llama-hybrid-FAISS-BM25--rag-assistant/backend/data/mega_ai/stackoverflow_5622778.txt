I think your best bet would be to try and leverage a browser component, given that's how Slideshare is designed to operate. Check out the DJ Native Swing Project which gives access to embeddable browser components (IE or Mozilla), Flash player and other goodies. With this library, I'd probably use its JWebBrowser component to display the Slideshare widget that way. Although could try using the Flashplayer component too.
