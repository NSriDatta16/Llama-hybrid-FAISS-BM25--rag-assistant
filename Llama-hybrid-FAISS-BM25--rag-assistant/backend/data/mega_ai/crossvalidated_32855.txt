delete the leading zeroes as they can inflate the autocorrelation function a visual suggest possibly a level shift and then a slight upward trend a few anomalies , maybe just one , (pulses) no apparent seasonal structure. An ARIMA model would be good just as long as the reflections above were considered. If you want to post the data , I will be more specific as to the applicability of ARIMA. The 114 values you posted are quite different from your original plot. The actual-fit-forecast is . The acf of the original series shows little structure . The "best model" contains no ARIMA structure but evidences a few unusual data points and three distinct means or GROUPS [1-32 ; 33-69 ; 70-114 ] with outliers . What we have here are three arima models of the form (0,0,0)(0,0,0) with three different means or regimes XBAR1=8.0 ; XBAR2=14.826 and XBAR3=10.8572. One could consider this single-dimension cluster analysis (see Univariate clustering of time series )
