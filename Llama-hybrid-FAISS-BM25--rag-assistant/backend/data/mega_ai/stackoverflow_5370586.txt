Can't pop up complete text

var text = $(this).text(); alert(text); Afterdata = " "+ " " + " " + " " $(this).parent().html(Afterdata); //$(".inputtext").val(text); What is here is a fragment of my code, the var text is the data that is retrieved from the span, say text = "how you doing" . Basically what my code is doing is that after I click on the span text field, it transforms into a input text field along with two buttons as shown above, where the text field keeps the text from the span, ("how you doing"). It is supposed to display a input box that is pre-filled with "how you doing" but it only fills with "how" without the following "you doing" part. The weird thing is that the alert function display "how you doing" successfully and commented bottoms line displays "how you doing" as well. However, the weirdest one is that my another function works like a charm: var text = $(this).text(); $(this).parent().html(" "+text+" " + " "); which is the same idea. The only difference is that the substituted part in the later one is in span instead of the value of input. see the difference? I have no clue; any help?
