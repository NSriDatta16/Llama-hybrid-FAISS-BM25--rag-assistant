Choice of levels of categorical independent variable in logistic regression

I would like to perform logistic regression with few categorical variables. I started from fitting univariable models, just to check the relationship of independent variables in the absence of other variables. One of my variables (let's denote it as X1) has 18 levels, so I end up with 18 coefficients (1 intercept and 17 adjustments to reference level). Most of coefficients (12) is statistically significant based on Wald test, however the remaining 6 isn't. Important thing is that X1 could be easily split to 2 variables based on definition of the levels. Now I wonder if I should think about the choice of levels. Basically my question is - does different choice of levels could add predictive power? Does grouping/splitting these levels which coefficients are not statistically significant is valid operation?
