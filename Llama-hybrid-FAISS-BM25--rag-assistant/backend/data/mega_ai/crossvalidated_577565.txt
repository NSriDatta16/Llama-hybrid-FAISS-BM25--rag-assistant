A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph with no cycle. Hence, there is at least one node that has no parent. Let's first assume that there is only one such root node. Begin at that node - as it has no parents, we can sample directly from its marginal probability distribution. Then, use that sample to compute the distributions of its children - we can do this because we're able to condition on the value of the sample. Generate a sample from these distributions, and keep traversing in a breadth-first manner until all nodes have been sampled from once. The vector of samples you have obtained from each node is a sample from the Bayesian network. Now, consider the case where there are multiple root nodes - in this case all you need to do is follow the sampling process described above but taking care to sample from all root nodes, and only moving down to sample from their children when all parents have been sampled from.
