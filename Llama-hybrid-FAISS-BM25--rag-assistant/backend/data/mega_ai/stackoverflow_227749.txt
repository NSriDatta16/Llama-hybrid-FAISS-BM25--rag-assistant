If you're using ASP.NET why not cache the PDF. Your cache can be stored in the database if you like or left in memory for as long as you may need it first. The enterprise library implements this for you in the caching application block and it's remarkably simple to use. If you cache the object, create a storage in the database using the block and then load it when you need it you won't have to worry about re-creating it.
