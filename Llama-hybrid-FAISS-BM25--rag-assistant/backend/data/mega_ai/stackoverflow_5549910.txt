Ò‰ works I have found the following order best suite to take a decision for commercial or free one, to fit your needs (most of the following does auto startup + extra features): Order show more features on top: BitRock: see features i would really use this one, because it does all cross platform + Jnlp + Prerequisite Tanukio: enter link description here IzPack Advancedinstaller: features (optional) Jnlp web start: example (this should become future way of installing) Please note that, prerequisite is not mentioned, most of there feature list, which is very important to have in all of them, because many case we use third party libraries/dependencies, so the best question would be to know if they support it or not.
