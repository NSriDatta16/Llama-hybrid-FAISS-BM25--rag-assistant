What does it mean to "Capture the mouse" in WPF?

On System.Windows.UIElement there is a CaptureMouse() and a paired ReleaseMouseCapture() method. In this WPF DragDrop sample they call CaptureMouse on MouseDown and release it on MouseUp. The documentation in MSDN is about as useless as it comes - "CaptureMouse -> Captures the mouse." In my head before trying it I assumed that it somehow locked the mouse inside the UIElement bounds, but that's clearly not the case when I try it. From experimenting, it seems to have something to do with responding to events when the mouse is outside of the UIElement, but not wanting to be a cargo cult programmer I don't want to just use it because the example does, I'd like an authoritative description of what it means.
