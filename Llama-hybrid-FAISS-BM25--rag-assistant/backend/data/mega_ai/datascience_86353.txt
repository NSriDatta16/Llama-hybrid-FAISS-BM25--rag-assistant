After training and saving a model can we give more information as input?

Suppose my data is a time series with multiple features such as wind, temperature, holidays, etc.. and I'm predicting a target variable Y. After I go through the whole process of splitting data into training and test and after having good predictions/forecasts I save my model. Can I now give extra information as input to my model? If I want to predict tomorrow's Y values and I know the wind and temperature forecasts (from weather services) for tomorrow, can't I use them to get a better prediction for tomorrow?
