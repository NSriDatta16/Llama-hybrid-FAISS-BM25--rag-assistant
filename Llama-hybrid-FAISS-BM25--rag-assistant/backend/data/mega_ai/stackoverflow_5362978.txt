C++ Benchmark tool

I have some application, which makes database requests. I guess it doesn't actually matter, what kind of the database I am using, but let's say it's a simple SQLite -driven database. Now, this application runs as a service and does some amount of requests per minute (this number might actually be huge). I'm willing to benchmark the queries to retrieve their number, maximal / minimal / average running time for some period and I wish to design my own tool for this (obviously, there are some, but I need my own for some appropriate reasons :). So - could you advice an approach for this task? I guess there are several possible cases: 1) I have access to the application source code. Here, obviously, I want to make some sort of cross-application integration, probably using pipes. Could you advice something about how this should be done and (if there is one) any other possible solution? 2) I don't have sources. So, is this even possible to perform some neat injection from my application to benchmark the other one? I hope there is a way, maybe hacky, whatever. Thanks a lot.
