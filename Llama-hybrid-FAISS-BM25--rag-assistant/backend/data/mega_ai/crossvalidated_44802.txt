The intercept is rarely of interest. One way the results you describe could happen is if the groups are, on average, different on the covariates. For example, you say the mean of group C was lower then E, but E was lower on the intercept. I don't have SPSS but here is R code that does this for a simplified case with one IV: set.seed(12646) group with multiple IVs, the differences could be more subtle, but the principle is the same.
