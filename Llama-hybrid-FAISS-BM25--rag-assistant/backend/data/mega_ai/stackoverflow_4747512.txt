Besides the std::map solution offered by others here (O(log n)), there's the approach of a hash map (implemented as boost::unordered_map or std::unordered_map in C++0x, supported by modern compilers). It would give you O(1) lookup on average , which often is faster than a tree-based std::map . Try for yourself.
