Inference can be the goal of an unsupervised learning method or a semi-supervised learning method or even more of a reinforcement learning method?

I am new to machine learning, and I am reading a pair of machine learning books. These references talk about 2 different learning approaches: Prediction and inference, I understand the difference between both of them in supervised learning. Nevertheless, I do not know if inference can be the goal of unsupervised learning algorithms. Whether the answer is yes or not, can you please explain me a bit more about the answer and give me examples? Many thanks for your time and considerations.
