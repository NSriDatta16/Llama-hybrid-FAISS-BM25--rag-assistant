Large data set, need PROPER way to calculate averages

I'm working on an excel sheet with 26k lines and need to calculate average costs per KG. I'm not sure which method of calculation to use as each is giving me different results. For example: (Col A) (Col B) (Col C) (Col D) Line Weight Cost Cost per KG ==== ===== ===== ========= 1 12 30 2.5 2 39 51 1.308 3 29 40 1.379 Do I calculate the average cost per KG by taking the average of Column D? Method A: Avg(Column D) = 1.729 OR simply divide the total cost by the total weight? Method B: Sum(Column C) / Sum(Column B) = 1.513 Without going into too much detail, my data set is giving me 7.451 (Method A), and 0.132 (Method B). HUGE difference. Which method of calculation is correct?
