How to turn linear regression into logistical regression

I followed these articles to implement logistic regression. I'm confused however because after training the model and getting the weights for my variables I don't now how to use the one-hot vector to turn this into confidence scores for the different classes. I've got the formula: y' = x1W1 + x2W2 + x3W3 + b I've got values for all Ws and b. I've got my one-hot vector: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]] How do I combine all this into confidence for each class?
