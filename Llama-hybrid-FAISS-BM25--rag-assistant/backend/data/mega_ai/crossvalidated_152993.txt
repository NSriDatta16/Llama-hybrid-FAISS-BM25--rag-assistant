Regression discontinuity design with multiple cutoffs

When we have an RD with multiple cutoffs, and we pool all observations and estimate the treatment effect across cutoffs, what does the pooled estimate identify? I have found one paper using a RDD with multiple cutoffs. Litschig and Morrison (2013) write: "Pooling requires the treatment intensity to be of comparable magnitude in order to interpret the size of estimated impacts. [Footnote: Treatment effects need not be the same across cutoffs. If treatment effects are heterogeneous, the pooled estimates identify an average treatment effect across cutoffs.]" I'm looking for something more formal about what the pooled estimate of the treatment effect is. Even another paper with a longer or more formal discussion of the pooled estimate would be useful. Reference: Litschig, Stephan, and Kevin M. Morrison. "The impact of intergovernmental transfers on education outcomes and poverty reduction." American Economic Journal: Applied Economics 5.4 (2013): 206-240.
