No. Obviously, of course, the types of the output pairs for map and the input pairs of reduce must be identical, since one is being passed into the other. It's quite possible, however, that you might have a reduce task that output a different type than the map pairs that came in - for instance, if the map task counted words in a document, but the reduce task calculated an average word frequency. In that case map would be emitting integers but reduce would be emitting floating point numbers.
