In Scott Hanselman's podcast, "The Art of Unit Testing with Roy Osherove," Scott says that he tends to write positive tests when he is building the application using TDD, and negative tests after the code is written to improve code coverage. Roy Osherove says that negative tests in the beginning do not add value; you can't go to your boss and say, "Hey look, here's all of the things that the code will NOT do!" As to a list of possible negative tests, I think that list is unbounded, i.e. that list is of infinite size, and I don't think any negative condition is any better or worse than any other negative condition.
