Are there any less costly alternatives to Amazon's Relational Database Services (RDS)?

I have the following requirement. I have with me a database containing the contact and address details of at least 2000 members of my school alumni organization. We want to store all that information in a relation model so that This data can be created and edited on demand. This data is always backed up and should be simple to restore in case the master copy becomes unusable. All sensitive personal information residing in this database is guaranteed to be available only to authorized users. This database won't be online in the first 6 months. It will become online only after a website is built on top of it. I am not a DBA and I don't want to spend time doing things like backups. I thought Amazon's RDS with it's automatic backup facility was the perfect solution for our needs. The only problem is that being a voluntary organization we cannot spare the monthly $100 to $150 fees this service demands. So my question is, are there any less costlier alternatives to Amazon's RDS?
