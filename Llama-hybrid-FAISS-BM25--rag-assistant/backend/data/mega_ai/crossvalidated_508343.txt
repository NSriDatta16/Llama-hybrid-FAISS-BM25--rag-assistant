The more complex CNN model seems to face with the underfitting during training

I have confused about this problem for a long time. I am using CNN model to do a regression problem. When I use some simple model with fewer parameters, the training loss would decrease. But When I use some more complex model, the training loss will remain at a higher value and not change. I think the model should face with underfitting, but I think the more complex model should be more powerful to learn from data and the training loss should be lower, the figure below is my simple model architecture and its loss curve: Then the images below is the architecture for a more complex model and its loss curve:
