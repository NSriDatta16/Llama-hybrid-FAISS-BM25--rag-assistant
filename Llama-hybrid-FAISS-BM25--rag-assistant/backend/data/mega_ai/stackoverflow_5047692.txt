Detection of userAgents that do/do not support Unity3d Plugin

The unity3d web player plugin is supported by Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Mozilla, Netscape, and Camino on Windows or OSX. Via JavaScript, what is the best method for determining whether a users configuration is supported, so I can alert them with the appropriate message? Is there a plugin out there that might support this case well? I'm looking for an easier solution than combing through the properties manually and testing on different devices myself. Thanks in advance!
