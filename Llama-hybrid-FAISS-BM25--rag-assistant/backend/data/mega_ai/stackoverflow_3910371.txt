There is no need to use some 3rd party libraries to organize memcached "cluster". http://ru.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addserver.php Just use this function to add several servers into the pool and after that data will be stored and distributed over those servers. The server for storing/retrieving the data for the specific key will be selected according to consistent key distribution option. So in this case you don't need to worry about "how to go about making sure that memcache on all the servers have the same information for sessions"
