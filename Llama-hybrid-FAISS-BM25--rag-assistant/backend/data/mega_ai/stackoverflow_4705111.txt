In the simplest terms, SQLite is a public-domain software package that provides a relational database management system, or RDBMS. Relational database systems are used to store user-defined records in large tables. In addition to data storage and management, a database engine can process complex query commands that combine data from multiple tables to generate reports and data summaries. Other popular RDBMS products include Oracle Database, IBM’s DB2, and Microsoft’s SQL Server on the commercial side, with MySQL and PostgreSQL being popular open source products. The “Lite” in SQLite does not refer to its capabilities. Rather, SQLite is lightweight when it comes to setup complexity, administrative overhead, and resource usage.
