Model/explain a time series as a function of other time series - R

I have six time series, all made of daily historical data. All of them cover the same period and the same days, they are all about 2700 days long. I want to explain one of the time series as a function of the other five, every day; i.e. for each day "i" I'd like to obtain a functional relationship of this sort: ts1_i = f(ts2_i, ts3_i, ts4_i, ts5_i, ts6_i) I am not sure what method or approach is more adequate for doing so, and if I should use machine learning techniques (I am new on it). As a starting point, I have performed PCA analysis on the entire data set of six time series, and rank correlation tests for each pairs. (PS: I use R, it would be great to have suggestions about R functions and packages)
