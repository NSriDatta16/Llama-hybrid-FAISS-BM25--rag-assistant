i found the solution myself :o) If you do profiling in Flex Builder, essentially flex builder loads a ProfilerAgent.swf as a preload swf. this does not work however, when you start an html page, because then the html page initiates the swf and the ProfilerAgent.swf is not loaded. What you can do though is, you load the ProfilerAgent.swf in your app by yourself. Simply load it with the Loader (loading it in the main application domain) and addChild() it to your main stage. With doing so, profiling works even within an html page.
