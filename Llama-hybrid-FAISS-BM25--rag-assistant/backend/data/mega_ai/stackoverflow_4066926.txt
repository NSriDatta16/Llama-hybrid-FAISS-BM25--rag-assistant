This is possible if you plan on distributing an installer to package and configure everything for you. The major challenge is with the installer, you will have to deploy and start cassini as a service. You are going to have to configure IIS + make sure its even installed. Setup the app that hosts your WCF, etc. But other than that, if you get that done, your good to go with a silverlight desktop app. Now my question. Why do all this? Why not use a silverlight IsolatedStorage database engine like one from here .
