saving/loading settings in a SenchaTouch/PhoneGap -App with localStorage and display them in a form

How you should save/load settings in an app when you want to use the localStorage? Let's say we just want to save a username and a password. Currently I know two options: using a model with store and proxy. This seems to be a bit too "big" as you only want to store one object. But you have the advantage to easily use this.load() in the settings FormPanel. using the Phonegap or the 'plain' localStorage. Then you have to use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse but you store only one object and its easier to load it (after a page refresh I run into some trouble using the store and proxy). But you can't use this.load as you need to load a model. Maybe you need to "cast" the settingsObject from the localStorage to a model and load this one!? Which approach is better or is there even another, better approach to save/load settings and display them in a form?
