How to Change All Sql Columns of One DataType into Another

I have a database ( Sql Server 2005 ) where there are dozens of tables , each of which has a number of columns (on average 10-20) with datatype set to nvarchar(max) . This is absolutely killing performance (some of these columns are being used for joins and some of the tables have 100K+ rows). I would like to change all of these columns to be varchar(250) . What would be the best way to automate this? (I could use Management Studio , or I could create a utility to perform this through an ASP.net website that has access to the db, whichever is easier).
