If all the apps are on the same virtual server, consider placing the shared assembly in the GAC. This allows you to diverge versions should the need arise, and keeps everything in the same place as a bonus. Downsides: this assembly runs with full trust and you should use policy and CAS to ensure there are no elevation of trust leverage points for external untrusted assemblies. You'll also need to learn about the [AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers] attribute. As for the other choices, COM+, meh, a bit heavyweight. Good for transactional stuff. Web services, not so good for data heavy services, but if done right, can be fairly maintainable. The more it's shared, the better the pay off.
