In general, no. Consider a function $f[x]$ applied to some data $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$, where $n$ is the size of the mini-batch. Let $g[x]=f'[x]$ be the derivative of $f$. Then the average derivative over the data is $\langle{g}\rangle=\frac{1}{n}\sum_ig[x_i]$, while the derivative evaluated at the average data is $g[\langle{x}\rangle]$, where $\langle{x}\rangle=\frac{1}{n}\sum_ix_i$. The two expressions are equal only if $g[x]=f'[x]$ is a linear map $$g[a_1x_1+a_2x_2]=a_1g[x_1]+a_2g[x_2]$$ This will only be true in the special case where $f[x]$ is a quadratic form $$f[x]=\tfrac{1}{2}x^TAx \implies \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}=Ax$$ for some matrix $A$ that does not depend on $x$.
