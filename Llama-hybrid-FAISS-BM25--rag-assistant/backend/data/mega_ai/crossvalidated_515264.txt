Test for null hypothesis: the rank of each variable is uniformly distributed

Assume the following situation: I have $N$ samples of $k$ continuos variables, $$x_n = (x^n_1,...,x^n_k).$$ I do not trust whether I can combine the continuos variables across samples, but I want to use their ranks at least. As an example for clarity, consider the situation where each $x^n_i$ corresponds to the score that student $i$ in a class obtains on the $n$ -th maths-test of a year. These tests are all written by different teachers with different methods, so the scores might come from different distributions, and we decide against summing them up. However, we could assume that the rank of the students in every tests always are samples of the true but unknown class/population distribution of the ranks. Thus, I order the values from lowest to highest, to obtain $N$ samples of ranks $$r^n = (r^n_1,...,r^n_k)$$ which are supposed to be i.i.d. samples from $$R = (R_1,...,R_k).$$ Now I thought about computing the average, normalized rank, $$\overline{r}_i=\frac{1}{N} \sum_n \frac{r_i^n}{k}$$ If I could assume that the $R_i$ are independent, uniform $R_i \sim Uniform(\{1,...,k\})$ , then I could assess the p-value of the $\overline{r}_i$ by refering to the distribution of the sum of $N$ i.i.d. uniform discrete variables, whatever that may be. But the assumption of independence does not hold in the beginning, since every rank can only be given once. So, how do I test for every $\overline{r}_i$ if it is bigger than expected under the nullhypothesis? Or any other ideas how to tackle my question?
