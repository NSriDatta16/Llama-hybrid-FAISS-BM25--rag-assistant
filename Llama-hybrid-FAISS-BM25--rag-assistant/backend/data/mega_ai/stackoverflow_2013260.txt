Yes. This assumes that the text in the raw file is already XML. You start with the DocumentBuilderFactory to get a DocumentBuilder , and then you can use its parse() method to turn an input stream into a Document , which is an internal XML representation. If the raw file contains something other than XML, you'll want to scan it somehow (your own code here) and use the stuff you find to build up from an empty Document . I then usually use a Transformer from a TransformerFactory to convert the Document into XML text in a file, but there may be a simpler way.
