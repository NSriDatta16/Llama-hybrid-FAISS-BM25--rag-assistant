Yes. There are 2 options for encoding order: One Hot Encoding : Useful when we want to treat distinct values of OrderID as features. Since order ID does not mean anything. This encoding is not recommended. Simple Numerical Encoding like 1,2 ,3 : This will remove any meaning in orderID. But we are not concerned about that. So this method is suitable. Now, problem comes in selecting model. The order ID has association with other features such as item category. For eg: If there are 4 shoes in same order_id, then chances of return are high. You can not use logistic classification model here: features should not be correlated features should be linearly related to independent variable Classifiers that do not have above limitations are : Decision Tree, Random Forest. Start with Decision Tree with Pruning and then to RF. We can discuss modelling part later.
