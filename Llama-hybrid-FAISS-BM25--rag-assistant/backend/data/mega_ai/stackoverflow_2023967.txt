Upcasting is always free and safe. That means you don't need to use a protected dynamic_cast. A static_cast would be the proper way to do this, although a c-style cast will work as well. In reality you should be able to do away with the second AddObject function because if you passed a pointer to a Mobile object into the DrawableObject function it would call the proper function without needing any casting. Unless you are planning on putting specialized functionality in the overloaded function I wouldn't write it.
