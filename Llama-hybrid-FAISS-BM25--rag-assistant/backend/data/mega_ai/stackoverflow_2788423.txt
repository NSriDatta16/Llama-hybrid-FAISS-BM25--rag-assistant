How to generate thread dump java on out of memory error? Your question can be simplified into: how to generate a thread dump and: how to catch an out of memory error (don't pay attention to naysayer here, they're missing the bigger picture, see my comment) So it's actually quite easy, you could do it like this: install a default uncaught exception handler upon catching an uncaught exception, check if you have an OutOfMemoryError if you have an OutOfMemoryError, generate yourself a full thread dump and either ask the user to send it to you by email or offer to send it automatically Bonus: it works fine on 1.5 too :) Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler( new Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler() { public void uncaughtException( final Thread t, final Throwable e ) { ... } You may want to look into this: e.getMessage(); and this: Thread.getAllStackTraces(); I'm doing this all the time in an app that is shipped on hundreds of different 1.5 and 1.6 JVM (on different OSes).
