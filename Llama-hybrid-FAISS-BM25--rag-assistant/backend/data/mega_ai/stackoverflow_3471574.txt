Your first regexp: ^[a-zñA-ZÑ_0-9-.]{6}[a-zñA-ZÑ_0-9-.]*$ says that 0-9.- is allowed, while the second one says 0-9.- is not allowed. Why not just change the first one to: ^[a-zñA-ZÑ_]{6}[a-zñA-ZÑ_]*$ and even simpler: ^[a-zñA-ZÑ_]{6,}$ since both parts are equal [Edit - code sample] Alan's answer is probably the most elegant, but you could also achieve it like this: bool flag = false; Match m = Regex.Match(alias, "(? ^[a-zñA-ZÑ_0-9-.]{6,}$)|(? [^0-9.-])"); if (m.Groups["main"].Success && m.Groups["char"].Success) { flag = true; }; That said, it's often better to break up a regular expression into several parts imo. It makes it more readable, and each expression does one thing. As long as you're not executing the expression a million times a second the overhead of running several Regexp's is minuscule.
