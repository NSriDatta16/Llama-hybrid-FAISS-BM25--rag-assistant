I think you are plotting validation accuracy versus The number of steps. as step increases accuracy increases but at the end of the epoch the average accuracy is written which is less than the last step accuracy. That's why you will see a sharp decline in accuracy after each epoch but at the start of next epoch the accuracy will again go high. there seems to be over fitting as training and validation accuracy are different so you can try to use regularisation parameter this will increase validation accuracy plot training loss vs number of examples to check if you should increase the number of training examples
