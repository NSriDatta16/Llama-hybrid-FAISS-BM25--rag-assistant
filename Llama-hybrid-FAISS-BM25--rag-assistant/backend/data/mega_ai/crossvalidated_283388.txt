Predict temperature (daily or hourly) - which model?

I have a good dataset of hourly and daily temperature and would like to predict future temperature based on this data with R. I thought about fitting a time series model to it and use it afterwards for predicting. Any idea which would be suitable? As temperature has saisonality, I guess Holt-Winter would perform well. ARIMA doesnt include saisonality and thus wouldnt fit the data well. But what about SARIMA? Don't have any profound knowledge about SARIMA though... If you have any other suggestions besides the ones above, please let me know. Thank you Rochus
