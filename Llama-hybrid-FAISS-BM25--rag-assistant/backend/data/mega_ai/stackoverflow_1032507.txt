Here are some thoughts on the benefits of having diverse experience in the field of programming: Each language and technology offers an opportunity to learn a different approach to problem solving. Having different problem solving techniques in your toolset is an invaluable way to stay relevant in a constantly changing field. Learning a new technology or language helps keep your mind sharp - it forces you to organize different yet similar domains of knowledge in your mind and helps keep your brain active. A diverse background is more appealing to employers because it implies that you are a motivated individual who pursues excellence in his or her field. If your background only demonstrates experience with one narrow technology, it can imply that you only like to work in your comfort zone, or worse, are inflexible in learning new skills. Different languages and technologies fit different problems differently. 'If all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail' , is the old adage. Knowing multiple technologies allows you to select the best one for the problem at hand. It broadens the group of people you can interact with and communicate with in your field - 'speaking the language' , to steal a phrase, makes it easier for you to work with individuals who specialize in other technologies. For instance, a good understanding of SQL and database architecture makes it easier to interact with and understand the concerns of DBAs. It's fun . Personally, I find learning new concepts in my field a fun way to improve myself as a person. I like to learn.
