need help with classes for multilingual UI

I'm new to OOD so I have a question about the use of classes for creating multilingual UI. I would like to create a class that is available to all forms in my app so i could change UI language whenever I want. The basic idea is in keeping language resources in xml files and creating data bindings for all controls so the Text property is changed whenever i load a new language resource file. I ended up creating bindings for all controls on app's main form and when the form loads binding source's datasource class reads strings from fields of a language-storage class. Everything is ok with this until i want to change UI language of all other forms simultaneously. Data binding for static classes doesn't seem to work or i'm just too stupid to use it. .NET 3.5, C#, VS2008 Express
