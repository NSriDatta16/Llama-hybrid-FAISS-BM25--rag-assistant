how to control popup with ruby on rails, mouse roll-over

I have an application where user can see a list of cells. For each cell the user can see two images of the cell as popup menu. The problem is that all images are downloaded when a list is selected and that makes my page very slow. I would like that the image is downloaded only if mouse is rolled-over the link. For information: Iâ€™m using DOM popup kit link text Here the main page and link to popup menu " class="popup_link" Popup.modal = true> 'cell_popup' %> Here a partial for cell images " class="popup popup_draghandle" style="display:none"> Raw Repaired 'jpegfile', :controller => 'neuronviewer',:morph_id => raw_morph.morphologyid)%>" alt="" width="200" height="200"/> 'jpegfile', :controller => 'neuronviewer', :morph_id => repaired_morph.morphologyid)%>" alt="" width="200" height="200"/> Anyone have any idea to do that?
