Rails deployment from a windows machine

I'm a rails novice and just finished my first rails app(as far as I can tell). Now I'm at the deployment stage and find myself utterly confused--especially because I'm deploying from a windows machine. I bought the pragmatic book on deployment and it seems a little out of date since they're recommending subversion instead of Git. What would be the easiest deployment method these days for someone doomed to use windows? Are there any good up-to-date tutorials on deployment from Windows?
