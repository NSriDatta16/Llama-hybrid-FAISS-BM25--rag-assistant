I'm not a Mac developer, so I may be off the mark here, but I doubt Mac OS X provides a method specifically to get the average color of the screen. What you could do is take a screenshot and resize it down to one pixel using Core Image , which should efficiently (using hardware acceleration where available) calculate the average.
