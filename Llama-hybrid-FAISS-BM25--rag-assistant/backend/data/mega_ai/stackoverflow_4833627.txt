you can save your images as static Bitmap objects in an extension of Application class, and referencing it from manifest: manifest.xml YourApp.java public class YourApp extends Application{ public static BitMap[] myImages = new BitMap[someSize]; YourActivity.java in somewhere.. YourApp.myImages[position]= myImage; I think it can work. But use this only if your images are small and few ones. The right thing is to save them in the disk, I prefer to use the internal storage against the sd card, take a look of this http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal
