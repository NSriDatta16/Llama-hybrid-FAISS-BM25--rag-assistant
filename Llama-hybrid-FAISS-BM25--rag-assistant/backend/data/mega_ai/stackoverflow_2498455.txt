C and C++ are different languages, and with different styles of programming. You better not to mix them. ( Where C and C++ differ ) If you are trying to use C++, then: Use std::string instead of char* or char[]. int to_dec(string value, int starting_base); string from_dec(int value, int ending_base); No any mallocs, use new/delete. But actually C++ manages memory automatically. The memory is freed as soon as variable is out of scope (unless you are dealing with pointers). And pointers are the last thing you need to deal with. We don't need here any lookup tables, just a magic string. string hex = "0123456789ABCDEF";//The index of the letter is its decimal value. A is 10, F is 15. //usage char c = 'B'; int value = hex.find( c );//works only with uppercase; The refactored to_dec can be like that. int to_dec(string value, int starting_base) { string hex = "0123456789ABCDEF"; int result = 0; for (int power = 0; power And there is a more elegant algorithm to convert from base 10 to any other See there for example. You have the opportunity to code it yourself :)
