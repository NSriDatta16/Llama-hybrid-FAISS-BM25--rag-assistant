It is hard to improve on the great advice already given but I want to give it a try. I don't have specific points to raise or articles to suggest but if you need more help on the pros and cons of the Cox model and alternatives I have two gret books to suggest (sorry if you are already very familiar with them). 1. Applied Survival Analysis 2e by Hosmer, Lemeshow and May (2008) Wiley. I just attended a short course by Susanne May based on this book. It has really good coverage of survival methods, parametric, nonparametric and the semiparametric Cox model and includes some fairly new material on variable selection in Cox regression. It is very applications oriented and includes real examples with heavy use of the data from the Worchester Heart Attack Study. it covers extensions of the Cox model and handling missing data. 2. Modeling Survival Data: Extending the Cox Model by Therneau and Grambsch (2000) Springer-Verlag. This is all about the Cox model and its extensions but is a little less current. A second edition is about to come out I think (if it hasn't already).
