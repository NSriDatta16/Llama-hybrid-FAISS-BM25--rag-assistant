Choosing an algorithm with normalized data(Classification)

I am having a dataset which all the features are from 0 to 1(real numbers) and the output is 0 or 1(integer numbers). Example: var1 var2 var3 output 0.01 0.1 0.7 1 0.01 0.1 0.7 1 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 0.2 0.4 0.4 0 0.4 0.1 0.9 1 Which classification algorithm is recommended when the variables are 'normalized' from 0 to 1? Does SVM or logistic regression 'react' good in these types of data? I have noticed that most of the people that are using SVM,NN or logistic regression when making feature scaling they use stardadization( (value-mean)/std ) ). Is there a reason not to rescale the values between from 0 to 1?
