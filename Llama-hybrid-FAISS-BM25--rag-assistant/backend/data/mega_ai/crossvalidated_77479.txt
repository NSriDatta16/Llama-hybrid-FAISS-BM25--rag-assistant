Genetic algorithms were used to lower the prime gap to 4680 in the recent Zhang twin primes proof breakthrough and associated Polymath project . The bound has been lowered by other methods but it shows some potential for machine learning approaches in this or related areas. they can be used to devise/optimize effective "combs" or basically sieves for analyzing/screening smallest-possible prime gaps. Together and Alone, Closing the Prime Gap (Erica Klarreich, Quanta magazine, 19 November 2013): The team eventually came up with the Polymath project’s record-holder — a 632-tooth comb whose width is 4,680 — using a genetic algorithm that “mates” admissible combs with each other to produce new, potentially better combs.
