It would be helpful if you could be even, more specific about intended applications. I would look into books about mathematical tools for social science, should be a big overlap. One forthcoming book (don't know when it will be published) is: Greenacre, M. and Nenadić, O. (2015): “Mathematical Tools for Social Scientists: An Introduction to R” but you could write the first author, which (offtopic!) even has a nice youtube channel for statistical songs: https://www.youtube.com/user/StatisticalSongs Other ideas would be to look for econometrics or time series books, there are recommendations on this site: Econometrics textbooks? Some books which are used to teach mathematics to economics students could be useful: Sydsæter, K., Hammond, P. and Strom, A. (2012): “Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis”, 4th ed., Pearson. Sydsæter, K., Hammond, P., Seierstad, A. and Strom, A. (2008): “Further Mathematics for Economic Analysis”, 2nd ed., Pearson.
