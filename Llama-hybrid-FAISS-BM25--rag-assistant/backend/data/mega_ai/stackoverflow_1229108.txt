If you are using client storage on linux, then the registry is out of the question since its use on *nix is not supported in ColdFusion. Your only other options are a database or cookies. Cookies will have limitations depending on the browser the user is using, if the user has cookies enabled or disabled, as well as security implications depending on what you are using the client storage for. The database will most likely be the most efficient solution for client storage and scale out to clusters if high load is your concern.
