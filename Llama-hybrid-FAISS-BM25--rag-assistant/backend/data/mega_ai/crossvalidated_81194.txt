nonlinear dependence in autocorrelation lagged scatterplot

In lagged scatter Plot we have such a diagramm: if we have an organized curvature in the pattern of dots, that means, nonlinear dependence between time seprated. my question is now: in which time series do we have nonlinear dependence? which properties should have these time series?
