I suspect that this answer has something to do with it. To quote from dirkgently 's answer, quoting the GCC manual: Note that the alignment of any given struct or union type is required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of the struct or union in question. According to that rule, once you've added an 8-byte double, the compiler has to arrange everything on 8-byte multiples. You can override that with #pragma pack(), of course, although it will be less efficient if you end up with an 8-byte member on something other than an 8-byte boundary.
