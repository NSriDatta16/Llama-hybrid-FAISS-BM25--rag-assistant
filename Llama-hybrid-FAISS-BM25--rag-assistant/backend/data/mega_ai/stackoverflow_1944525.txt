I created a new Wpf project. Added a new UserControl (UserControl1) with a custom dependency property called Foo. Then I opened Blend and added an instance of UserControl1 to Window1. I right clicked on UserControl1 and said EditTemplate | Edit a Copy. This created a copy of my user control template in the Window.Resources. From within this new template I went up to the Triggers panel and clicked the button to add a new property trigger. Right away Blend defaulted to selecting my property in the "Activated When" section. alt text http://blog.BradCunningham.net/Images/ForumImages/CustomDPInBlend.png You can grab my little sample app from here: http://blog.BradCunningham.net/SourceCode/ForumSamples/CustomDPInBlend.zip
