It is the use of a for-each to call templates that is discouraged, not the widespread use of for-each , per se. Even the Muenchian method of grouping relies on xsl:key constructs with xsl:for-each loops. The idea of writing good XSLT is that the structure of your XML should dictate what templates are matched and then applied. Therefore, whenever possible, use apply-templates to select the nodes, rather than applying a select using for-each .
