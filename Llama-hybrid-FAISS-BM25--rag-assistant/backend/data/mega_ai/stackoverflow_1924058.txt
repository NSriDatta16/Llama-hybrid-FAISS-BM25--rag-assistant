Another ASP.net AJAX SYS Undefined Error

Im at my wits end here. I have an ASP.net 2.0 Web Project Developed in VS 2008. The problem occurs on my dev XP system and our Windows 2000 and 2008 servers. The project uses AJAX 1 and references System.Web.Extensions 1.0.61025.0 and AJAXControlTookKit 1.0.10618.0. I am trying to use the ScriptManager and maybe the ToolKitScriptManager control to help with embedding javascript files. Before I get to trying to embed, I have to get rid of the dreaded SYS undefined javascript error. Actually, if I use the ScriptManager to include javascript files using the Path attribute it works. The SYS error is still there, but javascript files are included on the generated page and they work. Right now I am working with a blank page that only includes some test text. This page is wrapped in a MasterPage that includes an empty ScriptManager. When I debug this page I get an error on Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager (see generated HTML below). I have uninstalled and reinstalled AJAX, copied the System.Web.Extensions to my bin, checked my web.config settings at least 50 times&and have been to so many search results pages, forums, and blogs that my head is spinning. I know its probably something simple I am overlooking. My abbreviated code is below, can someone help me think through this and catch what I am missing. Thanks Web.config … … … … --> --> --> --> MasterPage … … Content ASPX Page Hello from TestMaster.aspx Generated HTML Untitled Page // // Hello from TestMaster.aspx //
