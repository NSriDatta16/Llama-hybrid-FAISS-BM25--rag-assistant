How to define the input channel of a CNN model in Pytorch?

In pytorch, we use: nn.conv2d(input_channel, output_channel, kernel_size) in order to define the convolutional layers. I understand that if the input is an image which has size $\text{width} \times \text{height} \times 3$ we would set the input_channel = 3 . I am confused, however, what if I have a data set that has dimension: $3 \times 3 \times 30$ or $30 \times 4 \times 5$ ? Which number should I use to define the input_channel for these? Thanks in advance.
