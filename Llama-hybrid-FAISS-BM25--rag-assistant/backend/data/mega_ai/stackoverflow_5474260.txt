Jslint: too strict? difference between == and ===

Possible Duplicate: Javascript === vs == : Does it matter which “equal” operator I use? when i checked my code with JSLINT, it was full of errors...it works perfectly even in Ie6 but for some reason because i'm not an elegant coder i got more than 100 errors... so i'd like to learn how to code better, error free... but when i used some suggestions JSLINT gave me like was to replace == with ===, well i did, and nothing was working... so my question is: do we have to follow literally all the JSLINT suggestions?
