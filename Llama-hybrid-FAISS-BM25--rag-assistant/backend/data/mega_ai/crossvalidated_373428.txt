How to represent your data ( Feature Engineering ). It depends on your assumptions (and domain knowledge ): more words result in higher EC difference of 3rd and 4th word in sentence are inversely proportional to EC the actual first 5 entries in vector matter (if less than 5 entries fill with 0's) they all need different representations of your data. The position of a WTE value can be as important as the length of a vector/sentence or the mean and standard deviation ( or some combination ). If WTE depends on single words only, not word-combinations, then \begin{array} {|l|l|} \hline WTE & EC\\ \hline & 0 \\ \hline & 2 \\ \hline \end{array} could be transformed to \begin{array} {|l|l|} \hline WTE & EC\\ \hline 45 & 0 \\ 1.32 & 0 \\ 8.2 & 2 \\ 459.5 & 2 \\ 45.3 & 2 \\ 12.7 & 2 \\ 102.1 & 2 \\ 4.0 & 2 \\ \hline \end{array} to start with.
