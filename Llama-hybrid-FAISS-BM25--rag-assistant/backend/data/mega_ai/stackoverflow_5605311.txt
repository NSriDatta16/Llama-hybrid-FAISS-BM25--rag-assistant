After some investigation, we've identified this as an issue the ReflectionOnlyLoad API under the 4.0 CLR. The CodeConfig assembly scanning works under the 2.0 CLR but evidently despite no apparent changes in the ReflectionOnlyLoad API between .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 there seem to be behavioral differences in the way ReflectionOnlyLoad handles dependent assemblies (or, more accurately, the way that we are programmatically resolving types for the ReflectionOnlyLoad API under .NET 4.0). The Spring.NET team is working now on a quick updated release of CodeConfig (1.0.1) that should properly address this issue and permit its successful use under .NET 4.0. Thanks for bringing it to our attention!
