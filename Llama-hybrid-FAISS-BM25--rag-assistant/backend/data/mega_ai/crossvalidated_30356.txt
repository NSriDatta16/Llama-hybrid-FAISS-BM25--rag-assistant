The signs of the eigenvectors are essentially arbitrary; if a colleague were to run the same analyses on the same data but on a different computer it would not be surprising to see one or both eigenvectors (your PC1a , & PC2a ) to have different signs. Computing the PCA using the same data on the same computer but via different software packages can also have the same effect. As such you can quite happily change the sign of the eigenvectors without altering the PCA.
