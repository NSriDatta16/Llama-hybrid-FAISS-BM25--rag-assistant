How much is the network - determing network overhead in SQL Server

We have a dev server running C# and talking to SQL server on the same machine. We have another server running the same code and talking to SQL server on another machine. A job does 60,000 reads (that is it calls a stored procedure 60,000 times - each read returns one row). The job runs in 1/40th of the time on the first server compared to it running on the second server. We're already looking at the 'internal' differences between the two SQL Servers (fragmentation, tempdb, memory etc) but what's a good way to determine how much slower the second config is simply because it has to go over the network ? [rather confusingly I found a 'SQL Server Ping' tool but it doesn't actually attempt any timing measurement which, as far as I can see, is what we need]
