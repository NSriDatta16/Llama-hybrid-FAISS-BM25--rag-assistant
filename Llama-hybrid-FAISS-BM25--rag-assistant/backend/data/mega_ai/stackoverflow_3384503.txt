Your results don't sound typical. We have a million-line codebase, and although we did have speed problems with 5.1's test runner (as a result of which we've downgraded back to 5.0), we haven't had any problems like what you're describing. What sort of project are you writing? R# 5.1 had several fixes for ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC, and I think there were performance fixes in there too (I didn't pay too much attention since we don't do Web development). If you don't mind a slow test runner and you're doing Web development, try upgrading. Otherwise, I would suggest that you either write up the issues you're seeing in ReSharper's bug tracker , or contact ReSharper support via their " Problem Using ReSharper " contact form. They might be able to be of assistance, and in the case of the slowdowns they might be able to walk you through getting a profile so they can see what's wrong.
