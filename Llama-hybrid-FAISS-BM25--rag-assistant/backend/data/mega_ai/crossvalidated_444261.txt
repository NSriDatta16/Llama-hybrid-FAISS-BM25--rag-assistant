Variable selection in logistic regression model

I'm working on a logistic regression model, I have 417 independent variables to try, but running a model with all of them is too much (for Rstudio), what would be a good criteria to discard some variables beforehand? Thanks for your answers! The aim of this work is to develop a predictive model to detect which costumers are more likely to become uncollectible accounts in a utility company.
