I would prefer to post my comments below as a comment but this would not be enough. These are questions rather than an answer (simlarly to @gung I don't feel strong enough on the topic). I am under the impression that MCMCglmm does not implement a "true" Bayesian glmm. The true Bayesian model is described in section 2 of this paper . Similarly to the frequentist model, one has $g(E(y \mid u)) = X\beta + Zu$ and there is a prior required on the dispersion parameter $\phi_1$ in addition to the fixed parameters $\beta$ and the "G" variance of the random effect $u$. But according to this MCMCglmm vignette , the model implemented in MCMCglmm is given by $g(E(y \mid u,e)) = X\beta + Zu + e$ , and it does not involve the dispersion parameter $\phi_1$. It is not similar to the classical frequentist model. Therefore I would be not surprised that there is no analogue of $\sigma_e$ with glmer. Please apologize for these rough comments, I just took a quick look about that.
