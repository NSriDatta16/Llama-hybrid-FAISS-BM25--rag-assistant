The answer to your question depeneds on the distribution of failure times. You say that $A$ fails twice a year. Is it exactly twice a year, or on average? Is it more likely to fail at some specific part of the year? I will give a simple example for illustration. Let us assume that $T_A$ is the failure time of $A$, and that $T_A$ is distributed uniformly over $[0,1]$ (this interval will represent the year). This means, that the probability of $T_A$ being in some specific time interval is the proportion of this time interval out of the entire interval. For example, the probability of $T_A\in(1/2,3/4)$ is 1/4. Let $T_O$ be defined similarly with regards to O, and suppose that $T_A$ and $T_O$ are independent. We assume further that the down time is (deterministiclly) a proportion of $d$ out of the entire time interval. To calculate the probability that both of them are down at the same time, you need to use $T_A$ and $T_O$'s mutual density , which (since they are independent) is uniform over the unit square $B=[0,1]\times [0,1]\in \mathbb{R}^2$. Now, the probability that you want, is the total area of the set $\{(x,y)\in B:\ |x-y| There is a lot of information here that you might not be familiar with, and is taught on probability introductory course. Anyway, hope this helps
