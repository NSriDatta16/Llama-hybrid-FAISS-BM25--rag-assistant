Scroll to a particular element w/ jQuery

I have a long list of nested divs. I am passing the ID of a particular element (actually a paragraph element) on the querystring and opening its div and parent onload. However, the list is so long, sometimes the element that opens is hidden below the bottom of the window. How do I automatically scroll the user's browser window so that the displayed element is at the top of the screen? You probably don't need this, but for the record... my list looks like this: stuff stuff stuff ... stuff stuff stuff
