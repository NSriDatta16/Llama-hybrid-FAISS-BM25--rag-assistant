crystal reports in asp.net (i have a .rpt file)

so i have a .rpt file and want to display the crystal report in a web form. i dragged the report viewer onto my web form and set its CrystalReportSource at design time. when i brows to the page it asks me to enter a sql password and has the SQL server name and user already filled in. how can i set the DB connection in the code behind and have the page display the report without prompting for a SQL password? should i just generate a dataset and databind the crystal report viewer to the rpt file and to my data set?
