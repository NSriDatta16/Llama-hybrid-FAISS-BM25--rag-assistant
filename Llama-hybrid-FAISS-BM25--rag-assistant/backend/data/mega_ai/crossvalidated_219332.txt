Principal component analysis result

I'm trying to understand the result of PCA, thought you can help me to understand better. us.pca1 Here I see the standard deviation for the variables Murder, Assault, UrbanPop and Rape are 83, 14, 6 and 2 respectively. But when I use the scale=T option I'm getting different SD. us.pca2 From the Help, I know that scale=T is used, so that variables should be scaled to have unit variance before the analysis takes place. But does this actually means??? By the way, if I want to calculate SD in usual way, I'm getting different result. sd(USArrests$Murder) [1] 4.35551 Can someone help me what are these three different SD indicates! Another question regarding the actual result in $roration matrix. us.pca2$rotation PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 Murder -0.5358995 0.4181809 -0.3412327 0.64922780 Assault -0.5831836 0.1879856 -0.2681484 -0.74340748 UrbanPop -0.2781909 -0.8728062 -0.3780158 0.13387773 Rape -0.5434321 -0.1673186 0.8177779 0.08902432 Are these Eigenvalues or some percentage? What should I conclude from this result? Any help or link for further reading will be appreciated.
