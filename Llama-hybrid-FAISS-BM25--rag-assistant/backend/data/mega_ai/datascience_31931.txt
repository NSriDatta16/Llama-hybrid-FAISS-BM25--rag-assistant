Are there cyclic decision trees?

Usual decision trees are directed acyclic graphs. Are there generalizations of decision trees that contain cycles analogously to recurrent neural networks? If such trees exist, can they be applied to sequences of variable length? I could not find information about such trees. Or their existence is impossible of infeasible?
