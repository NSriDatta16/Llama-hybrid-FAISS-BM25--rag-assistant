I would still go with Deep Neural Networks because they perform very well for segmentation tasks. The only thing that you have to be sure about is that you select the perfect patch size and your DNN should be deep enough to learn all the features.I myself have been doing research on image segmentation at the start I was having lots of issues in segmentation using deep learning but once I got all the parameters right then everything went well.
