It will work, but the strange propensity of some authors for doing bit-masking before bit-shifting always puzzled me. In my opinion, a much more elegant approach would be the one that does the shift first msw = (temp >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF; lsw = temp & 0xFFFFFFFF; at least because it uses the same "magic" bit-mask constant every time. Now, if your target type is unsigned and already has the desired bit-width, masking becomes completely unnecesary msw = temp >> 32; lsw = temp;
