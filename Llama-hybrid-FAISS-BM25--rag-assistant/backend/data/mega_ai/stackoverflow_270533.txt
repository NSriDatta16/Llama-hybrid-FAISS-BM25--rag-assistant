Embedding .Net Runtime

Am I able to embed the .net runtime so that .net is not required on the host operating system? I was looking at doing this with Mono by looking here: http://mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono but seems to allude to using external modules to accomplish this. My goal is to have one single executable with no installed .net runtime. I do not know how this would be configured in my application to compile the native code, link the mono runtime- as well as compile the C# code and link that as well?
