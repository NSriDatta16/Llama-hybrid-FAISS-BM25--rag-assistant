You need to set these files as content (as you have) so that they get copied to the bin folder. Then open up the project properties page, select the "Publish" Tab and click "Application Files...". You should now see a list of files related to your project and value indicating how they should be published. More than likely your files have been marked as data and would be destined for your ClickOnce applications data folder not the bin folder. Either change your code to use the ClickOnce data folder (there are helper methods) or make sure that "Include" is selected and not "Data File". Alternatively if the files are never expected to change on the client application you could consider embedding your files into your dll as a resource.
