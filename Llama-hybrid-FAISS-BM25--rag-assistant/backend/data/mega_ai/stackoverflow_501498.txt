Work within the (hostile) rules and give up, quit and find somewhere more enlightened or try to change the organization, your choice. If you decide to try and change things don't go against IT alone, that will just make you the "trouble maker" and you will never get anywhere, try to get support from your boss and other developers - if you can't get support then you may be better off looking for a new job.
