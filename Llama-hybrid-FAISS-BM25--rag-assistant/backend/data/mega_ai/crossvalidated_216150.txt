Depends on whether you accept other built-in functions which are not specifically for AR processes, but help a lot with generating one. So, firstly use Matlab's randn function to get a vector of normally distributed i.i.d. random values (with zero mean and unit variance): e = randn(1000, 1); Then filter this signal with an all-pole filter to get the desired AR process: x = filter(1, [1 a], e); Here the first 1 corresponds to the filter having no zeros, or in other words not having the moving average part (see ARMA process for more info). [1 a] is the vector of filter coefficients specifying the poles (for order of 3, we would have e.g. a = [1 2 3]; ).
