AurioTouch is the right example to look at. Unfortunately the code is just terrible. Make sure that you only use it to get to know the concepts behind working with the RemoteIO audio unit. The actual drawing of the waveform is happening right in the renderProc callback which is called by CoreAudio when PCM data becomes available. Look at PerformThru() in aurioTouchAppDelegate.mm:197... further down, in line 237 SInt8 *data_ptr = (SInt8 *)(ioData->mBuffers[0].mData); ... that's where the actual PCM data is accessed. This is the data you would need to analyze in order to get peak/average power of the signal.
