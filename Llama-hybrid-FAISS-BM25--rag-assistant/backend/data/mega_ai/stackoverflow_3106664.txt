How to persist a change in a DBML

I have a table of users called Users And a view called UsersActive that filters out deactivated users. When I create my DBML, I drag the Users table in, then I change the property on the table to point to UsersActive. This works well, until the DBML gets re-created. Does anyone know how to fix this? I've tried overriding the [Table(Name="dbo.Users")] attribute in a partial class but get the error: Duplicate 'Table' attribute Does anyone know how to go about this? Thanks in advance! -Ev
