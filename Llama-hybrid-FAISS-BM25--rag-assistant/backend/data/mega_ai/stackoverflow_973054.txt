TreeView in GridView

I know there must be a way to do this, and perhaps someone has already done it. I googled like crazy but found nothing at all. Anyway, what I want to do is have a TreeView in the first column of a GridView using WPF, which can expand and collapse and that will show/hide the row it belongs to, pretty much something like this (the demo is for ASP.NET, I want to be able to do the same in WPF): DevExpress demo In our company we bought Infragistics controls, but it doesn't have a built in solution, we're trying to avoid spending a lot of time coding this solution. Thank you!
