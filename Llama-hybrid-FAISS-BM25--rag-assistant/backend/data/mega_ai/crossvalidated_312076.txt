No. And the reasoning why doesn't have anything to do with limits or approximations. If you take an ARMA(4,1) model, the only way it could be an ARMA(3) model is if its AR polynomial had a root in common with its MA polynomial. If there was a common root, you could divide both sides of the model by it, and both $p$ and $q$ would reduce by $1$. Most of the definitions that I've seen restrict this behavior. For example, in " Intro to Time Series and Forecasting ," their definition is $\{X_t\}$ is an ARMA(p,q) process if $\{X_t\}$ is stationary and if for every $t$, $$ X_t - \phi_1 X_{t-1} - \cdots - \phi_p X_{t-p} = Z_t + \theta_1 Z_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_q Z_{t-q}, $$ where $\{Z_t\} \sim \text{WN}(0,\sigma^2)$ and the polynomials $(1 - \phi_1 z - \cdots - \phi_p z^p)$ and $(1 + \theta_1z + \cdots + \theta_q z^q)$ have no common factors. Say, to the contrary, that your model had $z_1 = z_{1,\phi} = z_{1,\theta}$ as a common root. Then \begin{align*} \frac{\phi(z)}{\theta(z)}&= \frac{\phi_p(z-z_{1,\phi})(z-z_{2,\phi})\cdots(z-z_{p,\phi})}{\theta_q(z-z_{1,\theta})\cdots(z-z_{q,\theta})}\\ &= \frac{\phi_p(z-z_{2,\phi})\cdots(z-z_{p,\phi})}{\theta_q(z-z_{2,\theta})\cdots(z-z_{q,\theta})}. \end{align*} You could write down your larger model, divide both sides by the common factor, and the result would be a smaller model. And in your specific question, you are asking about the situation where $p=4$ and $q=1$.
