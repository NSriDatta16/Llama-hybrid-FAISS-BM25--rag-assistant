I don't have full understanding of it, but I suspect it's because wrapfigure is itself a wrapper around figure float environment. I think I found a solution/workaround here: http://texblog.net/latex-archive/plaintex/expandafter/ I think this code gets what you want: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{wrapfig} \raggedright \expandafter\def\expandafter\wrapfigure\expandafter{\wrapfigure{o}{2in}\large\raggedright} \begin{document} chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken \begin{wrapfigure} CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN \end{wrapfigure} chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken \end{document} The code as used above redefines 'wrapfigure' to have different use, which may not be what you want. You can create new commands for the begin{env} and end{env} which leave 'wrapfigure' itself unaltered, like this: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{wrapfig} \raggedright \newcommand{\myfigstart}{\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{2in}\large\raggedright} \newcommand{\myfigend}{\end{wrapfigure}} \begin{document} chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken \myfigstart CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN \myfigend chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken \end{document}
