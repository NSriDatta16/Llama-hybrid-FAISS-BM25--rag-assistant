How to add a Facebook "Like" button with full functionality?

I'm trying to add a Facebook "Like" button and I'm using a free extension for it but it's giving me an error as they are not compatible with Magento version 1.5. I'm trying to do it manually but a little help which I found was to get a Facebook developer code and paste in static URL etc. ...but I didn't understand that. So can you kindly tell me how to do what I want? From where do I get which code and where to paste please?
