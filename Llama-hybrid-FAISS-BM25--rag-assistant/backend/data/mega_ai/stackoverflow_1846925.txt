I was interested in the answer to this question & came to it via a search for gperf . I tried gperf, but it was very slow on a large input file and thus did not seem suitable. I tried cmph but I wasn't happy with it. It requires building a file which is then loaded into the C program at run time. Further, the program is so fragile (crashes with "segmentation fault" on any kind of mistaken input) that I did not trust it. A further Google search led me to this page , and onward to mph . I downloaded mph and found it is very nice. It has an optional program to generate a C file, called "emitc", and using it like mph output.c worked almost instantly (a few seconds with a dictionary of about 200,000 words) and created a working C file which compiles with no problems. My tests also indicate that it works. I haven't tested the performance of the hashing algorithm yet though.
