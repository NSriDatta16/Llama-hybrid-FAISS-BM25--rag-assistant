I agree that the geometry vocabulary is in conflict. Think of train tracks instead: Two trains which are on parallel tracks can run independently and simultaneously with little or no interaction. These trains run concurrently, in parallel. The basic usage difficulty is that "concurrent" can mean "at the same time" (with the trains or code) or "at the same place" (with the geometric lines). For many practical purposes (trains, thread resources) these two notions are directly in conflict. Natural language is supposed to be silly, ambiguous, and confusing. But we're programmers. We can take refuge in the clarity, simplicity, and elegance of our formal programming languages. Like perl.
