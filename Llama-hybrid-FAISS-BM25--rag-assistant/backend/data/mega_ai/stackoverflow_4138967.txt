Full disclosure: I am on the team that develops this feature. Unfortunately, this information is not present in the code coverage file. When a binary is instrumented, we insert special probes to tell us that it exists and to detect when each code block is executed. We do not save the list of DLLs in the target process, so we only know about instrumented DLLs that get executed (just being instrumented is not enough). The easiest workaround is what you mentioned in your question. Thanks for your feedback, though, we will take it into consideration. Sorry for the difficulty here.
