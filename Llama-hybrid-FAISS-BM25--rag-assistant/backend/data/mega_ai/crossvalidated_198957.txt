You are correct in your observation that merely looking at the size of the estimated coefficient $|\hat{\beta_j}|$ is not very meaningful for the reason mentioned. But a simple adjustment is to multiply the coefficient estimate by the estimated standard deviation of the predictor $|\hat{\beta_j}| \hat{\sigma}_j$ and use this as a measure of importance. This is sometimes called a standardized beta coefficient and in logistic regression it represents the change in the estimated log odds of success caused by a one standard deviation change in $x_j$. One issue with this is that it breaks down when you're no longer dealing with numeric predictors. Regarding your last point, of course it's possible that a variable might contribute a lot to the estimated log odds while not actually affecting the "true" log odds much, but I don't think this needs to be too much of a concern if we have any confidence in the procedure that produced the estimates.
