I assume that by 'label' you mean the correct classification/value of the dependent variable. It appears you are asking if you add the correct classification as an independent variable, will this cause the model to make an association with your rare event and other independent variables, that will persist after you remove the label. Definitely not, using any type of machine learning algorithm I have heard of, or can think of. A common way of dealing with rare outcomes is with over-sampling and cost adjustments.
