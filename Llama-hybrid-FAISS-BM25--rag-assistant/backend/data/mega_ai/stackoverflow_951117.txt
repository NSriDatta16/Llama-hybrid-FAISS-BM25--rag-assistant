This is an interesting issue. I don't think you can get rid of the bad '.:format' appended to the end if you do a basic map.resources . If you want periods in the names, you are not in accordance with the usual rails styles, and I think a custom route might be in order if you absolutely NEED the '.' in the URL. However, maybe you should consider changing your definition of to_param . What would you think about using the following? def to_param domain_name.sub('.','_dot_') end I think, if you're using this to manage customer websites, it's a fairly elegant way to generate nice (and SEO friendly) URLs like /websites/asd_dot_com/dns_records/new /websites/asd_dot_com/
