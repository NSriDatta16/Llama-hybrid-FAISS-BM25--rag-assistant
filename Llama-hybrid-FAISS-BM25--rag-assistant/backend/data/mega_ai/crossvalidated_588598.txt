Training data from real hardware

I am working on machine learning model. The target is to learn the behavior of a black box which has a couple of inputs and one output signal. I have generated some training data by applying different input signals to black box however I am facing an issue, i.e., for a given set of input values the black box does not generate output signal of fixed value. Instead, the value of output signal varies a little. It is like adding a little variability to the output signal. My question is how shall I use my generated training data to model the black box behavior? Ideally, I would like to develop a NN model that for a given set of input signal values estimates the mean value of output signal as well as the min/max range.
