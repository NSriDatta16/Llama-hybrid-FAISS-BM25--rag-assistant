To add to @mkt 's answer, which does capture all the most critical mathematical aspects, a few observations: The intercept CI spans from -70 to -33. Assuming that body fat is a percentage, then this means that the baseline amount of fat in the cohort is very variable. If the distribution of BodyFat is left or right tailed then the mean will be skewed relative to the median. This would influence inference of the coefficients Any effect sizes smaller than the mean effect size across variables will have negative coefficients because they provide less effect than the other variables. See the point about standardisation below. the weight is the only coefficient that has CI that do not cross 0, this may reflects inadequate pre-processing rather than anything meaningful at this stage. There is no evidence of any use of height/length to normalise the variables, despite most having a strong relationship with height (tall people/long organisms compared to short people/organisms of the same relative build will have higher weight, larger chest, bigger abdomen, wider hips, thicker thighs and biceps). This could account for a high proportion of the covariance highlighted by @mkt. Correlation between inputs leads to unstable coefficient estimation (the model has no way of knowing the causality). Data reduction (e.g. PCA, PLS) or shrinkage methods (LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net) could improve the orthogonality of the inputs into the model and improve interpret-ability. Gender also usually influences the covariance of the listed independent variables and so should be included as a factor for a more complete inference. Do you standardise the variables? I don't see that in your code. The variables appear to be on different scales which would also make interpretation of coefficients more difficult.
