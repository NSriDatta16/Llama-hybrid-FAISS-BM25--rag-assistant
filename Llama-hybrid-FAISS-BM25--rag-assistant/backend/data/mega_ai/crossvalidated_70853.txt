Okay, the following explains most of the PCA report. So I am a step closer to digging down into the data. I found this website: Interpreting Results from PCA Which states: The principal component variables are defined as linear combinations of the original variables X1,...,Xk,...,Xm. The Extracted Eigenvectors table provides coefficients for equations below. Yk = Ck1X1 + Ck2X2 + ... + CkmXm where Yk is the k-th principal component k C's are the coefficients in table Just need to work out now if possible and how to create a "Score Plot" and "Loading Plot" given the above information.
