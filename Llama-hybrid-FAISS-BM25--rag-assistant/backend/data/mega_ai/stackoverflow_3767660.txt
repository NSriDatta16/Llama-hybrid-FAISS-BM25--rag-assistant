WCF Transport security weakness

On 2nd edition of "Programming WCF Services" By Lowy, ch 10, page 512. Lowy said about Transport security: Its main downside is that it can only guarantee transfer security point-point, meaning when the client connects directly to the service. Having multiple intermediaries between the client and the service renders Transport security questionable, as those intermediaries may not be secure. Consequently, Transport security is typically used only by intranet applications. HTTPS is one of Transport security options, How previous paragraph applies to HTTPS ?!!, HTTPS encrypts every thing all the way from start to end points. Also every e-commerce application in the world is using HTTPS, how you can limit it to intranet applications!! Thanks
