Magento - Show Custom Attributes in Grouped Product table

I need to find a way to show the value of a custom attribute in place of the "Product Name" shown in the image below. (source: magentocommerce.com ) I'm working with /app/design/frontend/default/defaultx/template/catalog/product/view/type/grouped.php The code below doesn't work(the custom attribute is yearmade): htmlEscape($_item->getYearmade()) ?> Any help would be appreciated. EDIT: So the answer turned out to be quite simple. You see what I failed to mention above was that there was indeed output... but that it was just a number (eg: 52). Turns out this was the ID for that custom attribute value (It was a Dropdown type of custom attribute). So in summary This works for custom attributes of type text: echo $this->htmlEscape($_item->getYearmade()) But for all other types of custom attribute (I think), the following should be used: echo $this->htmlEscape($_item->getAttributeText('yearmade')) I would not have discovered this without the most excellent answer provided by Alan Storm, below. Thank you sir.
