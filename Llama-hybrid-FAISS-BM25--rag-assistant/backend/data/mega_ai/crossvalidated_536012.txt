I encountered the same issue, and was trying to search an answer in related articles. The Burnham & Anderson 2002 (Model Selection and Multimodel Inference - A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach Second Edition) book actually used three approaches to derive these empirical numbers. As stated in Chapter 4.5 in this book, one approach (which is easiest to understand), is let $\Delta_p = AIC_{best} - AIC_{min}$ be a random variable with a sampling distribution. They have done Monte Carlo simulation studies on this variable, and the sampling distribution of this $\Delta_p$ has substantial stability and the 95th percentile of the sampling distribution of $\Delta_p$ is generally much less than 10, and in fact generally less than 7 (often closer to 4 in simple situations), as long as when observations are independent, sample sizes are large, and models are nested. $\Delta_p > 10$ is way beyond the 95th percentile, and is thus highly unlikely to be the Kullback-Leibler best model. In addition, they actually argued against using 2 as a rule of thumb in their Burnham, Anderson, and Huyvaert et al., 2011 paper. They said $\Delta$ in the 2-7 range have some support and should rarely be dismissed.
