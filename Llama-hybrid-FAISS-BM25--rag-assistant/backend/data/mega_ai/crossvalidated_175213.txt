Correlation among data - suggestions

I would like to have your help for (simple) correlation problems. I've data about the measurement of some substances in the organs of animals (more than 20 samples).My data are obtained by different sources (journal articles, report, etc) I need to check the presence of the correlation among different data. For example: " Calcium content in a x organ " - " calcium content in bones" or with ratios between two organs " Size of the liver " - " Calcium in bones/Calcium in a x organ ratios " Could I use the Pearson method to check the correlation in both examples ?
