Django restapi passing parameter to read()

In the test example http://django-rest-interface.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/django_restapi_tests/examples/custom_urls.py on line 19 to they parse the request.path to get the poll_id. This looks very fragile to me. If the url changes then this line breaks. I have attempted to pass in the poll_id but this did not work. So my question is how do I use the poll_id (or any other value) gathered from the url?
