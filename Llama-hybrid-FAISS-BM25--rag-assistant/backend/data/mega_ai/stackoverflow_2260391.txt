What is the actual meaning of separation of content and presentation?

What is the actual meaning of separation of content and presentation? Is it just mean to avoid inline css? Does it mean that the design should be able to manipulated without changing the HTML? Can we really make any change in design from CSS only? If we want to change the size of images then we will have to go to in HTML code If we wan to add one more line break in paragraph then again we will have to go to in HTML code If we want to add one more separator at some place then again we will have to go to in HTML code Which X/HTML tag we should avoid to use to keep separation of content and presentation? Is separation of content and presentation also helpful for accessibility/screen reader users? ... and for programmer/developer/designer?
