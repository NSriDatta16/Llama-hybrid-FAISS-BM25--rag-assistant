Regression with text data

My goal is to create a regression model with text data where encoded text predicts a value, (news headlines, or article summaries, predicting number of clicks). The y is very left-skewed (few articles having very many clicks and most articles having few clicks). My models so far are not able to predict anything and I'm wondering whether I should keep trying. Having read a few papers with similar scenarios, you rarely see text predicting a value, in one paper the authors said that would be too difficult a task and created categories for their y to do ordinal regression.The most often seen case is logistic regression where text predicts spam/not spam, positive/negative sentiment, is it really too difficult to get a reasonable model from text where your y is not binary?
