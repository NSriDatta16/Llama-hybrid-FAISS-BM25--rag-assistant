Testing the significance of interaction terms with multcomp::glht()

I am estimating an ordinal logistic regression under the assumption of proportional odds with the ordinal::clm() function. As a RE see this model from the "housing" dataset ( MASS::housing ): clm(Sat~Type*Cont + Freq, data = housing, link = "probit") %>% S formula: Sat ~ Type * Cont + Freq data: housing Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) TypeApartment -0.14387 0.54335 -0.265 0.791 TypeAtrium 0.20043 0.55593 0.361 0.718 TypeTerrace 0.18246 0.55120 0.331 0.741 ContHigh 0.05598 0.53598 0.104 0.917 Freq 0.01360 0.01116 1.219 0.223 TypeApartment:ContHigh -0.25287 0.78178 -0.323 0.746 TypeAtrium:ContHigh -0.17201 0.76610 -0.225 0.822 TypeTerrace:ContHigh -0.18917 0.76667 -0.247 0.805 Threshold coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Low|Medium -0.1130 0.4645 -0.243 Medium|High 0.7590 0.4693 1.617 If I want to test if the main effect and the interaction term are (simultaneously!) significant I used the glht function where I test the hypothesis that (bold for matrices or vectors) $\boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \boldsymbol{K} = \boldsymbol{m}$ . So If I'd like to test if living in an apartment (main effect) plus the interaction of living in an apartment and having high contact is significantly different from zero it would be $(0; 0; 1; 0; 0; 0; 0; 1; 0;0 )\cdot \boldsymbol{\beta} = (0;0;...;0)$ . (Assuming the two thresholds as intercepts and thus the first two estimates). Is it right to test: glht(mod, linfct = c("TypeApartment +TypeApartment:ContHigh =0")) %>% summary() Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses Fit: clm(formula = Sat ~ Type * Cont + Freq, data = housing, link = "probit") Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) TypeApartment + TypeApartment:ContHigh == 0 -0.3967 0.6270 -0.633 0.527 (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method) or do I have to use: glht(mod, linfct = c("TypeApartment= 0", "TypeApartment:ContHigh =0")) %>% summary() Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses Fit: clm(formula = Sat ~ Type * Cont + Freq, data = housing, link = "probit") Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) TypeApartment == 0 -0.1439 0.5434 -0.265 0.946 TypeApartment:ContHigh == 0 -0.2529 0.7818 -0.323 0.921 (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method) Thanks a lot in advance I hope I posed the question right and understandable :-) If you have other options to test if a main effect and an interaction term are significant go ahead and tell me (and the others). Thanks, Luise
