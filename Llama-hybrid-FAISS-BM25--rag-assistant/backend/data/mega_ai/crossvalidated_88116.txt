I'm not sure why you are doing things this way. It seems to me that the first algorithm found initially 2 clusters (from where you chose one to be clustered by the 2nd algorithm). Why don't you cluster the whole data set with both algorithms and compare the clusterings? Its very difficult to compare one cluster vs 3 clusters on the same data set. To have one clusters makes little sense, and one should reasonably expect the output of the K-Means criterion to be much smaller when you have 3 clusters (so you can't use this for comparison). Now what's the silhouette of the 2nd algorithm generating 3 clusters? is it in average closer >=0.5? if not the meaning of this clustering is debatable.
