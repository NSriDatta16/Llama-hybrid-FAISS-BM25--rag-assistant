The concept for which you are searching is meta-regression. I do not use the software you mention so I cannot tell you how to do it but meta-regression is widely available in standard software like R or Stata. Having said that you do have an inferential issue here as the regression will be an ecological one. You are not able with what you have to see the effect of age as you would need individual ages for that. What you are studying is the effect of being enrolled in a study with average age less than 5. This is not the same as being under 5 yourself. Whether such an analysis would answer your scientific question is a matter for you after further examination of information about the age distributions in the studies.
