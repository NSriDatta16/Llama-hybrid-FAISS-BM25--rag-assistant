In the neural network context, the phenomenon of saturation refers to the state in which a neuron predominantly outputs values close to the asymptotic ends of the bounded activation function. Measuring Saturation in Neural Networks (2015) So, saturation refers to behaviour of a neuron in a neural network after a given period of training/for a given range of input, and only neurons with bounded limits are susceptible to saturation (and by extension, such functions are sometimes referred to as 'saturating' even if in a particular instance they have not 'saturated'). Saturating functions include: Type Examples Limited as x approaches infinity and minus infinity Sigmoid, tanh Limited only in one direction $\max(x,c)$ Non saturating functions include: Type Examples Unbounded functions identity, $\sinh$ , $abs$ Periodic functions sin, cos So in your example, a "non-saturating nonlinearity" means a "non-linear function with no limit as x approaches infinity".
