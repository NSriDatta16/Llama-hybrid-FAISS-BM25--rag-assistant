No, generating stuff you don't need and then removing it is inelegant at best, hackish, and will likely contribute to lowering the quality (including reliability, security etc.) of your code. Refactor your factsheet page code to generate a header, but use a self-contained class/widget to generate the actual factsheet content. Then just instanciate and use that same class/widget on the other page as well.
