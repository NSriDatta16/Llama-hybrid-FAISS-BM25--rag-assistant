DLM representation of ARIMA models

I am working through example 3.2.6 in 'Dynamic linear models with R' by Petris. I have download the USA GDP data located here: http://definetti.uark.edu/dlm/ The example starts by estimating the unknown parameters. See the code below: library(fpp) library(forecast) library(dlm) # 1. read in data from Petris' website gdp_ My questions are: Do I need to fit an arima model to the data first and work out p,d and q? (I can easily do this with auto.arima). I don't understand how I am meant to know what goes into the dlmModARMA part of the code above i.e. setting ar, ma and sigma2 I don't fully understand how I would change the content of buildGap if I wanted to look at a different time series (let's assume it's ARIMA i.e. also trend + ARMA) This was the ONLY example I could find of a combined model (with dlmModPoly and dlmModARMA). I'm also really new to this and struggling massively, so any simple explanations would be much appreciated. Thanks!
