I don't see how he could have done a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing just two numbers (traffic from October vs August) - are you sure about that? Or did I understand that wrong? However, I agree with him that you don't have "all the data". What you want to test here is not the number of people that did happen to visit your site in each month, but an underlying number that reflects the expected monthly average number of visitors. In a given month, the actual number of visitors is somewhat random and follows a distribution around this mean value. The question is: if the traffic was different this month, how likely is it that this was due to chance alone, rather than due to a fundamental change in the traffic we're attracting? The less likely the change in traffic is to be explained by chance, the more significant it is.
