I assume you are trying to conduct Bayesian linear regression using a conjugate prior. The calculations are explained in the wikipedia entry Bayesian linear regression . The only difference is that you are working with the precision $\beta$ instead of the variance $\sigma^2$, which are equivalent up to a change of variable.
