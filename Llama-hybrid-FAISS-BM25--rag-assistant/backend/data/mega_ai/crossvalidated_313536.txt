In your example, the test does not tell us the risk of disease. It makes a decision. It is either a true positive, true negative, false positive, or false negative. The doctor, in trying to explain the test, would tell the patient that the results were a false positive. The patient, not having died from the disease, is a living testament to the imperfection of that diagnosis. Diagnostic tests are unconcerned with ascribing a single event probability risk. In medicine, we differentiate between diagnostic tests and risk predictions . Risk predictions use a patient's risk profile to construct an time-interval based risk prediction given you are at-risk for disease at that time. For instance, the Gail model predicts 5 year breast cancer risk in a woman who is free of breast cancer and has both of her breasts (no mastectomy; no breast tissue=no cancer risk). Age, menopausal status, family history, and other risk factors are reported. The model gives a percentage breast cancer risk. This percentage is used to counsel the patient and advise preventative options. A Bayesian interpretation of 5 year breast cancer risk is readily accepted. A frequentist relies on the concept of potential outcomes. These are like counterfactual inference. We presume women who are otherwise similar in their risk profile pose a type of superpopulation whose frequency of 5 year breast cancer incidence is concordant with the risk prediction.
