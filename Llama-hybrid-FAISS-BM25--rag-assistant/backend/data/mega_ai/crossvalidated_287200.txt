The coefficient of gender means: If I sample two data points from my population, and observe that they have the same age, but different genders, then I expect that, on average, the difference in cholesterol I will observe is -0.57. The coefficient of age means: If I sample two data points from my population, and observe that they have the same gender, but one is exactly one year older than another, then I expect that, on average, the difference in cholesterol I will observe is 0.4. These interpretations are contingent on the regression being a good fit to the data. I.e., if the actual relationship between age and cholesterol is non-linear (i.e. quadratic, exponential, or something more exotic) then taking these interpretations at face value is not advisable.
