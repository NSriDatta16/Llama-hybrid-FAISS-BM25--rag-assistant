From what I remember, the GAE datastore automatically groups your entities based on their hierarchy. For example, if you have a concept of a User, and you make all of your other object types (email messages, contacts, etc.) have User as a parent relationship, the GAE datastore considers all of those things to be part of the same group. If data related to a particular user seems to be getting pulled from a particular location a lot, Google can automatically move their data to a farm nearer that location to optimize data retrieval speeds. The difficulty is that this means you have to either have all of your entities be tied to a main parent entity, or you have to avoid doing transactions across objects that are tied to different parent entities. Sometimes this isn't a big deal: moving a contact from one user account to another is not the sort of thing you'd expect to have happen as an atomic transaction in Gmail. Other times it can be a real drag.
