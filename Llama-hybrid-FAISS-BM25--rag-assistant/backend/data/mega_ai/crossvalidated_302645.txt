Au contraire , you have a fairly complex time series which can't be (easily) solved with simple tools. Your data set suggests a change in the error variance at period 93 . This is confirmed visually visually (if you look real close ) as the series is highly autocorrelated lag 1. Analysis suggests a change in the model error variance at on around period 93 .. There are three time trends in addition to a first order differencing and an ma(1) . . The residual plot suggests near randomness except for a possible level shift in the time range 78-96 which is confirmed by the residual acf culminating in a very reasonable upwards trending forecast . The interesting thing to me there are no anomalies(pulses) that need remedying. I used AUTOBOX ( my tool of choice which i have helped to develop ) . To find out what is wrong with the models you have tried , look at the residuals to assess thoroughness or the effectiveness of the equation to separate signal and noise. The actual/fit and forecast is here . Note that the AUTOBOX forecast is quite similar to your HW forecast without the false seasonal component (model injected).
