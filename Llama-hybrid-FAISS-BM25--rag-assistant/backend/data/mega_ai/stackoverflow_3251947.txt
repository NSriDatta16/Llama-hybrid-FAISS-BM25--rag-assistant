How to get certain numbers?

I have a column in Excel which is exported from a SQL database. The columns read like this: 'Payment Funds: (654321) Company charged Public - Payment of transfer. Charged from account xyz to abc (into autopac agent).' The reference number: 654321, account: xyz and abc; comment: (into autopac agent) - are different for all the records for that column. How would I go about obtaining the reference numbers only for all the records?
