I'd first answer Gennady Shumakher's comment - "What is currently your system's bottle neck you are considering as not scalable?". Once you know that, then you can approach it specifically, then the whole application as you need to. One interesting study is Twitter. It began with only small numbers of requests, but has quickly grown into a heavily used platform, with world-wide traffic. This may be useful. Also interesting might be this blog on scalability .
