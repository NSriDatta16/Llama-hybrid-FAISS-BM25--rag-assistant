Dump WebRequest transmissions for debugging purposes?

My application is performing numerous HttpWebRequest s, and some of them fail occasionally. I would like to dump the bytes leaving my PC whenever I perform a request as well as the bytes arriving as a response. Is it possible to do this from within my code easily? I'd only like to use something like Wireshark as a last resort if no other method is available, as I'd like such dumping to be available on the clients' machines without having to install WinPcap and stuff.
