Fantasy sports incentivize players to think with statistical intuition. For example, every week in fantasy football you must choose which players to start based on, e.g.: that player's career stats, the trend in the time series of that player's stats, the team he is going up against, weather, injuries, and many more. According to http://www.fsta.org/ , 32 million people in the US and Canada now play some type of fantasy sport! I know that it was one of the major reasons I developed an interest in statistics.
