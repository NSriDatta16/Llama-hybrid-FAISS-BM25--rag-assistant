Welcome to CV. The simple answer to this question is "maybe". Presumably, you want to know how to do this and when it can be done. For that, your question is much too broad. First, you list four different methods that have different purposes and apply in different cases. This should be four different questions. (I would really only think of PCA as a pure 'data reduction' technique. Random forest is a prediction method, lasso is a variable selection method and factor analysis is a way of finding latent variables). In addition, you'll have to tell us a lot more about the study design.
