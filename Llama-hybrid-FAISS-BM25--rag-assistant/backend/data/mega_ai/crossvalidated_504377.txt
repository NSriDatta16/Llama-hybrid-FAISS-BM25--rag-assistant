Limiting behaviour of Markov Chains

Is the following "vague" statement correct, and if so are there a good reference out there which formally work this out? For a given initial distribution $\vec{x}$ , any finite space, discrete time Markov chain described by the transition matrix $P$ will in the limit of many iterations $n$ either converge to a fixed distribution $\lim_{n \to \infty} P^{n} \vec{x}$ (which may depend on the choice of initial distribution $\vec{x}$ itself). or exhibit periodic behaviour with some period $d>1$ . With periodic behaviour we mean that the state of the Markov chain "jumps" between $d$ different limiting distributions given by $\{ \lim_{n \to \infty} P^{dn} \vec{x}, \lim_{n \to \infty} P^{dn+1} \vec{x}, ..., \lim_{n \to \infty} P^{dn+(d-1)} \vec{x}\}$ . I have read through some material of Markov chains, but I never encountered such an explicit statement. Also, does a similar statement hold for general space, discrete time Markov chains?
