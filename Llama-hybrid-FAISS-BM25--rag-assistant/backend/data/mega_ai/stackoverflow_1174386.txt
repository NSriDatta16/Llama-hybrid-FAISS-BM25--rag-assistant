Pressing the left mouse button simulates clicking down the screen... the simulator (and also an actual Storm device, I think) won't fire TouchGesture events while you're clicking down on the screen. What you want to do is hold down the right mouse button and drag, since the right mouse button simulates a screen tap, without click. This way, you should be able to get TouchGestures to fire. It's a little hard to do a gesture on the simulator, you kinda have to move fast, but if you use the right mouse button you should be able to do it.
