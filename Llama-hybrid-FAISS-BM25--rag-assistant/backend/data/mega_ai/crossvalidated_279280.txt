Multinomial logistic algebraic explanation

I'm trying to understand the explanation of how multinomial logistic regression works from the point of view of a set of independent binary regressions. The wikipedia page seems to provide a fairly good explanation. However, I'm stuck on an algebra step that I can't seem to get. Namely, how do we go from 1-sum product of p(y = k) and e^coef to the next step? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression I realize it may be an easy solution that I'm just missing.
