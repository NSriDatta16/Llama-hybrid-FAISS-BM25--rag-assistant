Haar prior for von Mises distribution

Ok, Let me tell you that this is the very first time that I have no idea with the question below. I can not find a solution or anything that will lead me to it. I say this to prevent comments "what did you do?". I apologize in advance. This is one of the questions in Peter M. Lee's Bayesian Statistics: An Introduction book, it is Exercises section of Chapter 3. How can I find a Haar prior for a location parameter on the circle (such as $\mu$ in the case of von Mises's distribution).
