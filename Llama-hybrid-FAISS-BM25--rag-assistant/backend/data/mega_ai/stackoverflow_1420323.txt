CTRL + R is part of the formatting shortcut keys in office, it right justifies the selected text or current paragraph. As this function is probably used more than search and replace it makes sense to give it CTRL + R The MS UX guidelines (not that they stick to it themselves) has a keyboard section where they indicate that you should use the Windows OS shortcut keys to map to similar functions - so CTRL + H it is.
