First, bear in mind that in the emulator you can't detect 'real' Bluetooth devices without a third-party JSR-82 library such as Bluecove (it's a desktop implementation for Java Bluetooth). But when you deploy to a JSR-82 capable phone, it should work. But otherwise, it's easy with JSR-82! You can use the DiscoveryAgent class. LocalDevice local = LocalDevice.getLocalDevice(); DiscoveryAgent agent = local.getDiscoveryAgent(); boolean complete = agent.startInquiry(DiscoveryAgent.GIAC, new DiscoveryListener() { public void deviceDiscovered(RemoteDevice device, DeviceClass cod) { System.out.println("Discovered: " + device.getFriendlyName()); } }); while(!complete) { // wait until discovery completes before continuing } Instead of printing the discovered devices as above, you could always put them into the Hashtable or Vector. The deviceDiscovered() method gets called everytime a device is discovered whilst the inquiry is running, and the inquiry usually returns in a decent time (a matter of 10s of seconds).
