The product $z_t$ is not a Markov Chain (MC). Assume we know that $z_{t_0} = 0$ at some time $t_0$, meaning that $x_{t_0}=0$ or $y_{t_0}=0$. Then the past values $\{z_{u};\,u t_0\}$ in contradiction with the Markov property. Indeed, let $s_t := [x_t, \,y_t]$; so that $s_t$ is a MC taking the $4$ values written here as $00$, $01$, $10$ and $11$. At time $t_0$, only the first $3$ states are possible since the product is $0$. Let $t_0-W$ be the random time of the latest state change for $z_t$, which was $z: \,1 \rightarrow 0$. If $W$ is small, then most probably $s_{t_0}$ is $01$ or $10$, but not $00$: only one change of state occured during the interval $(t_0-W, \,t_0)$. This in turn tells us that the next transition $0 \rightarrow 1$ will occur more quickly than if a large value $W$ had been obtained. Here is a more formal derivation. For a fixed $t$ and a small $h > 0$ we have $$ \mathrm{Pr}\{z_{t-h} = 1\,\vert \,s_{t} = 00\} = o(h), \qquad \mathrm{Pr}\{z_{t-h} = 1\,\,\vert \, s_{t} = 01\} = \lambda h + o(h) $$ with $\lambda >0$. Indeed, the first probability involves two transitions of $s_t$. Using Bayes formula $$ \mathrm{Pr}\{s_{t} = 00 \,\vert\, z_{t-h} = 1, \, z_{t}=0\} = \frac{\mathrm{Pr}\{ z_{t-h} = 1 \,\vert \,s_{t} = 00\} \, \mathrm{Pr}\{ s_{t} = 00\, \vert \, z_{t} = 0\}}{ \mathrm{Pr}\{ z_{t-h} = 1 \,\vert \, z_{t} = 0 \} }. $$ The numerator of the fraction is $o(h)$, while its denominator is easily found to be $\nu h + o(h)$ for some $\nu >0$, so the probability is $o(h)$. By contrast $$ \mathrm{Pr}\{s_{t} = 01 \,\vert\, z_{t-h} = 1, \, z_{t}=0\} = \rho h + o(h) $$ for some $\rho > 0$. Thus conditional on $\{z_{t-h} = 1, \, z_{t}=0\}$ the event $\{s_{t} = 01\}$ is much more probable than $\{s_{t} = 00\}$ for small $h$, as claimed. Here $z_t$ follows a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with hidden state $s_t$ and simply results from grouping $3$ possible states of $s_t$ as one $z_t=0$. More generally, grouping states of a MC $s_t$ will result in a HMM process but not a MC.
