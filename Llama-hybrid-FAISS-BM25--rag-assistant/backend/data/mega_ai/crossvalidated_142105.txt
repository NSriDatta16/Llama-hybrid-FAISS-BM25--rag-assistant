From your data, Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) = 3/(3+276) = 1% Specificity = TN/(TN+FP) = 2716/(2716+2) = 99% Your classifier does a good job predicting who does not buy bikes (it is specific). However it cannot predict who will buy bikes (it is not sensitive). I am assuming that the goal was to predict who would buy (perhaps the company would like to send them a promotion). In that regards, the model was not useful. Edit 1 Previously I explained why the business man would be correct to cast serious doubts about your model. However, you should vary the independent parameter (threshold for logit) of your Logistic Regression. First plot the ROC curve, and observe how trading away specificity can gain you sensitivity.
