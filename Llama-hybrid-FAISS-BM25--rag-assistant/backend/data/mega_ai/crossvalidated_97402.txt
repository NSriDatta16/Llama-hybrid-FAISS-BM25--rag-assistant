GEE estimates the average population effects. Random intercept models estimate the variability of these effects. If $\alpha_j=\gamma_0+\eta_j$, $\eta_j\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\alpha)$, random intercept models estimate both $\gamma_0$ (which is the average population intercept and, in normal linear models, is equal to the one estimated by GEE) and $\sigma^2_\alpha$. If the intercept is modeled by second-level predictors, e.g. $\alpha_j=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 w_j+\eta_j$, a random intercept model can estimate how the intercepts vary at the individual level, i.d. according to economic, demographic, familiar etc. factors, to the 'group' to which a specific individual belongs.
