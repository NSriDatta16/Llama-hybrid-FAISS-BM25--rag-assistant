How can I calculate when a text corpus is representative of a language?

I am collecting and analyzing articles and other publications for building a text corpus. I'd like to know how to calculate when my text corpus is representative of a field. That is, how many texts, and how long they should be. I'd like to cover 99% of all researchers. And I will also use the corpus to obtain a list of concepts in the field (things like "cori cycle", TCA, or metabolomics). It would also be reassuring if I had covered 99% of them. Neither will I be using it only to program a categorization algorithm, nor will its main use be a machine learning application. I expect to use it to extract some detailed information. For example, I'd like to produce a list of companies or researchers in a field, and would like to know what are my chances of having skipped some of them. It is about a biochemistry subfield, but I assume a solution can be generalized to all types of texts. Intuitively, I was thinking that maybe I should just stop collecting texts after I couldn't extract any new item from n texts. But how big should this n be?
