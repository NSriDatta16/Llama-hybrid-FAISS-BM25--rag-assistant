Exercise 2.2 of The Elements of Statistical Learning

The text book first generates some 2-class data via: which gives: and then it asks: I try to solve this by first modelling this with this graphical model: where $c$ is the label, $h\,(1\le h \le 10)$ is the index of the selected mean $m_h^c$, and $x$ is the data point. This will give $$ \begin{align*} \Pr(x\mid m_h^c) =& \mathcal{N}(m_h^c,\mathbf{I}/5)\\ \Pr(m_h^c\mid h,c=\mathrm{blue}) =& \mathcal{N}((1,0)^T,\mathbf{I})\\ \Pr(m_h^c\mid h,c=\mathrm{orange}) =& \mathcal{N}((0,1)^T,\mathbf{I})\\ \Pr(h) =& \frac{1}{10}\\ \Pr(c) =& \frac{1}{2} \end{align*} $$ On the other hand, the boundary is $\{x:\Pr(c=\mathrm{blue}\mid x)=\Pr(c=\mathrm{orange}\mid x)\}$. With Bayesian rule, we have $$ \begin{align*} \Pr(c\mid x) =& \frac{\Pr(x\mid c)\Pr(c)}{\sum_c\Pr(x\mid c)\Pr(c)}\\ \Pr(x\mid c) =& \sum_h\int_{m_h^c}\Pr(h)\Pr(m_h^c\mid h,c)\Pr(x\mid m_h^c) \end{align*} $$ But later I found that the problem setting is symmetric so this may yield $x=y$ as the boundary. If the problem is asking the boundary when $m_h^c$ are conditioned, the equation will include $40$ parameters which I think it's unlikely to be the purpose of the exercise. So am I misunderstanding anything? Thank you.
