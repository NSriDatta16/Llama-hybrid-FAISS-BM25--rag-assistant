to get full use of closures, i suggest you wrap your main function in another function that initiates the "ran" flag : function initRun(){ var ran = ran || false; return function(arguments){ if(ran) { console.log("can't run any more!"); return; } ran = true; console.log("i'm running!"); /* your logic here */ } } var run = initRun(); then you can test it by calling your function in whatever way you want : run(); run.call(); run.apply(); it successfully runs only once, no matter the calling method used. The mini-downside is that you need an extra function that wraps your initial "run" function, but i think it's more reliable and elegant than to use a global flag that keeps track of your function calls
