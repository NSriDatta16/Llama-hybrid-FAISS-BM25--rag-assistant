I agree it's a tricky situation. These are just a few thoughts. Whether to average d effect sizes: If you're not interested in subscales, then my first choice would be to take the average effect size for the subscales in a given study. That assumes that all subscales are equally relevant to your research question. If some scales are more relevant, then I might just use those subscales. If you are interested in differences between subscales, then it makes sense to include the effect size for each subscale coded for type. Standard error of d effect sizes: Presumably you are using a formula to calculate the standard error of d based on the value of d and the group sample sizes. Adapting this formula , we get $$se(d) = \sqrt{\left( \frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1+n_2-2)}\right) \left(\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1+n_2-2} \right)}, $$ where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes of the two groups being compared and $d$ is Cohen's $d$. I imagine you could apply such a formula to calculate the standard error to the average d value for the subscales.
