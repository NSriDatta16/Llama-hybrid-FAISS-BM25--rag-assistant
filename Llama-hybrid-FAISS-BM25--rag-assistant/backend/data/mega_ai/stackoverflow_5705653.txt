What techniques are there for preventing multiple submissions to a competition?

The Project We have a competition coded in PHP, with CodeIgniter. The form has validation on email addresses and mobile numbers. The page itself is hosted inside an iframe on a different domain (it's an agency-client relationship). The Problem We get users with 1000s of entries. We know they are fake because: They use the same mobile number - assumedly they figure out a mobile number that passes the validation and then use that every time. The email addresses are all on weird domains, with some of the domains repeated multiple times. However, the IP addresses are unique, the entries are spread over a few days, the domains themselves have MX records, the user-agents look normal. The client doesn't want to do anything which could result in fewer entries. The Question What are the pros and cons of methods like Captcha? What UI and code patterns have you used that worked? One method I read is to allow entries that are suspicious, so that spammers entries are accepted, but their data has a 'suspicious' flag against it, which is then checked manually. What data can I check to see whether it is suspicious?
