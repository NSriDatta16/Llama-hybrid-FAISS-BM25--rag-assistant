jquery strange behaviour when toggling (hiding/showing) droppable panels

I have several draggable/hideable boxes based on the code posted here: http://webdeveloperplus.com/jquery/saving-state-for-collapsible-drag-drop-panels/ I also have an area with a list of blocks which I can drag into any one of these boxes, and then sort them. This works fine. It's only when I start toggling these boxes, or moving their positions, that things start going weird. Example 1 Let's say I have 3 boxes stacked vertically: Box1 Box2 Box3 Block can be dragged into (and sorted) ok. If I then move Box2 above Box1 so the order is now: Box2 Box1 Box3 I can't drag anything into Box2. I don't get any errors in Firebug. Just nothing happens. Example 2 If I have the same order of boxes above (Box1, Box2, Box3) and I 'hide' the contents of Box2, I cannot drag anything into Box3. If I then 'show' Box2 again, I can drag into Box3 but not Box2... If I have the following boxes set up and I hide Box3, I cannot drag anything into Box4 & Box5. If I then show Box3, the only box I cannot drag into is Box3: Box1 Box2 Box3 Box4 Box5 Any ideas off the top of your head? I'm using the usual draggable & sortable functions (not droppable as for some reason using droppable with sortable was firing the droppable event twice - a strangeness noted by another user on this forum). I must point out that when you launch this code only one box is loaded, and you click a button to create new boxes. This is a function which builds the new box, and sets it up as a draggable/sortable area. Cheers :) --UPDATE------------------------- I have created a simplified view, using the majority of 'webdeveloperplus' code (huge kudos to this chap). It's available here: jsfiddle.net/gD94w/4 (I am loving this jsfiddle site by the way!). You should be able to replicate my problem (drag 'items' into the blue areas). Any ideas I'd love to know! Thanks.
