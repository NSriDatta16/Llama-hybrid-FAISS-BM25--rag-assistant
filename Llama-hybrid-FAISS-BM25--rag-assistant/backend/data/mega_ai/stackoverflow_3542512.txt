You just need a weighted average of A and B. C(t) = A * (1-t) + B * t or, in 2-D Cx = Ax * (1-t) + Bx * t Cy = Ay * (1-t) + By * t When t=0, you get A. When t=1, you get B. When t=.25, you a point 25% of the way from A to B etc So, to divide the line into k equal parts, make a loop and find C, for t=0/k, t=1/k, t=2/k, ... , t=k/k
