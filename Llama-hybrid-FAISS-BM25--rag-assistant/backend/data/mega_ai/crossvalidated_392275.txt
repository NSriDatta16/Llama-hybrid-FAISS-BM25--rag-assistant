Bayes Rule Bayesian Risk and Decision

Good day, When attempting this problem I came across some difficulties. A humanitarian charity wishes to classify a village as being at either high or low risk of flooding. The following historical data on the number of weeks between successive floods is collected: $$Y_1 = 2.65, Y_2 = 3.07$$ Let $\theta$ denote the risk status of the village. If $\theta$ =0 then the village is low risk and the $Y_i$ are independent from an $Exp(0.5)$ distribution. If $\theta= 1$ then the village is high risk and the $Y_i$ are independent from an $Exp(1)$ distribution. Both scenarios are considered equally likely prior to collecting the historical data. Let action $a_0$ correspond to classifying the village as low risk, and action $a_1$ as high risk. Assume the losses from misclassication are $L(a_0, \theta = 1) = 5, L(a_1, \theta = 0) = 1, L(a_0, \theta = 0) = 0, L(a1, \theta = 1) = 0$ Find the risk associated with both actions, and hence state how the village should be classied. So, from this I get that the prior would simply be $p(\theta = 0) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(\theta = 1) = \frac{1}{2}$ . The loss matrix is \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline a_i&\theta=0&\theta=1 \\ \hline a_0&0 & 5\\ \hline a_1&1 &0\\ \hline \end{array} The question also says that $Y|\theta=0$ follows a $Exp(0.5)$ distribution and $Y|\theta=1$ follows a $Exp(1)$ . I am not quite sure where to go from here as when I tried finding $p(y)$ to use in Bayes Rule, I get a different answer to the solutions (the solutions do not explain how to get the answer).
