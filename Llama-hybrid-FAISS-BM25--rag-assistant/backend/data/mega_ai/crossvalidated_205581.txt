Late answer related to my question here ( Can we make Random Forest 100% interpretable by fixing the seed? ): Let $z_1$ be the seed in the creation of boostrapped training set, and $z_2 $ be the seed in the selection of feature's subset (for simplification, I only list 2 kinds of seeds here). From $z_1$, $m$ boostrapped training sets are created: $D_1(z_1)$, $D_2(z_1)$, $D_3(z_1)$, ..., $D_m(z_1)$. From those traning sets, $m$ corresponding decision trees are created, and tuned via cross-validation: $T_1(z_1,z_2)$, $T_2(z_1,z_2)$, $T_3(z_1,z_2)$,..., $T_m(z_1,z_2)$. Let's denote predictions from the ${j^\text{th}}_{(j=1,2,...,m)}$ tree for an individual $x_i$ (from training or testing set, whatever) as $\hat{f}^j(x_i)_{(i \le n, j \le m)}$. Hence the final predictions by the ensemble trees are: $$\hat{F}(x_i) = > \frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{j=1}^m \hat{f}^j(x_i)$$ Once the model is validated, and is stable (meaning $\hat{F}(x_i)$ doesn't depend strongly on the pair $(z_1,z_2)$). I start to create every possible combinations of my features , which give me a very big set ($x'_i$). Applying my forest on each $x'_i$ gives me the corresponding predictions: $$x'_1 \rightarrow \hat{F}(x'_1) \text{ - which is fixed > thanks to $(z_1, z_2)$}$$ $$x'_2 \rightarrow \hat{F}(x'_2) \text{ - > which is fixed thanks to $(z_1, z_2)$}$$ $$x'_3 \rightarrow > \hat{F}(x'_3) \text{ - which is fixed thanks to $(z_1, z_2)$}$$ $$x'_4 > \rightarrow \hat{F}(x'_4) \text{ - which is fixed thanks to $(z_1, > z_2)$}$$ $$....$$ The latter can be easily represented in form of a single (huge) tree . For example: $x'_1$: (Age = 18, sex = M, ...), $x'_2$ = (Age = 18, sex = F, ...), ... could be regrouped to create a leaf. This works also for every ensemble methods based on aggregation of trees.
