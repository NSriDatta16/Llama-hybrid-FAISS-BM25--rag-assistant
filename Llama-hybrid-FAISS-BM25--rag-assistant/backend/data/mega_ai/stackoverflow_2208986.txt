SQL Server ETL process transaction logs

is it ok to set recovery mode simple in a staging db for an ETL process... The customer is not even doing a regular backup! So what's the point in keeping the transaction logs... I propose to organize a daily backup after the bulk import and that's it... Anything against this plan? Also the transaction logs were at 80gb after 3 weeks... cheers
