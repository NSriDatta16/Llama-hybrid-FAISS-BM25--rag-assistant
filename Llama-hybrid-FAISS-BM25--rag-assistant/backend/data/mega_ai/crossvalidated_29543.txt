There are several ways in which you can 'train' a neural network. Personally, I prefer the genetic algorithm approach - each individual represents a set of weights, with the fitness function being the performance of the neural network. The performance of the neural network in terms of time series analysis could be the mean squared error of the predictions against the targets. One common method in time series prediction with neural networks is to use the % change from specific intervals over a 'lookback' period.
