Please see the first page of https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Notes/svm-lecture-prep.pdf for a more formal answer. aka, the 2 problems are "equivalent" in the sense that the minimizer and the minimum of the first problem is the minimizer of the second, and vice versa. Replacing $g(x)$ in the doc with $1-y_i(w^T x_i +b) $ will answer your question. To prove it in both directions: The second problem in the doc -> the first problem in the doc Suppose we have $(x^\star, \xi^\star)$ as the minimizer of the second problem in the doc. Then $\xi^\star=g(x^\star)$ (because otherwise the objective function can get a smaller value by setting $\xi$ smaller). Due to being a minimizer, we have " $\forall x, \forall \xi, f(x)+\xi \ge f(x^\star)+g(x^\star)$ ". By setting $\xi=g(x)$ as a special case, we have " $\forall x, f(x)+g(x) \ge f(x^\star)+g(x^\star)$ ", which shows it's also the minimum of the first problem. QED. The first problem -> the second problem Suppose we have $x^\star$ as the minimizer of the first problem in the doc. Therefore $x^\star$ minimizes " $f(x)+\xi, s.t. \xi=g(x)$ ". Therefore $x^\star$ minimizes " $f(x)+\xi, s.t. \xi \ge g(x)$ " (because when this problem attains minimum, $\xi$ must be equal to $g(x)$ ; which means it degrades to the above problem). This problem is exactly the second problem in the doc. QED.
