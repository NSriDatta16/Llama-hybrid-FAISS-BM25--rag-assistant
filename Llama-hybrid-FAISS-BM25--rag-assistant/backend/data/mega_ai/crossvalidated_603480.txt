The transform leads to a cumulative distribution function that is non-differentiable in the point where you split the transformation. The density function will have a jump discontinuity in that point. Possibly there are ways to still have the density defined in a way (e.g. use the directional continuity of the cumulative distribution function or an average as you did) but the discontinuity remains. Below you see an example when we perform such transformation on the normal distribution
