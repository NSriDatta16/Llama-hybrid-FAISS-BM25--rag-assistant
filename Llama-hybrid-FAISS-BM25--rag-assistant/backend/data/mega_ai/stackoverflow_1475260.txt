Return only available items in Ruby on Rails

I've created a method that allows me to return all of the Books. I'd like to limit the books returned to those that are not not loaned. What do I need to add to available_books to ensure only unloaned books are returned. Can I leverage my preexisting loaned? method? class Book :book_loans, :source => :person def loaned? book_loans.exists?(:return_date => nil) end def self.available_books @books = find(:all, :order => "title") end end
