In my opinion, it depends on what you expect to be the most informative covariate or feature in your prediction model. As you said, the concentration of curves may be informative, so I suggest to build several models to understand which information about the concentration is informative and then compare the AUC or the accuracy of the models. The models can be build extracting different parameters from the curves (e.g. kurtosis, area under the curve, some frequency parameters, curve slope) that catch the differences in the different curve trends and then training a model (e.g. Logistic Regression, SVM, LDA) using these features. If you have enough data you can build a deep model that extracts these features directly from the curve you have recorded, but I don't think is this the case. Hope this helps.
