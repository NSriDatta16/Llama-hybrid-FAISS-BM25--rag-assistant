Terminology: unconditional heteroskedasticity

I have seen mentions of both un conditional and conditional heteroskedasticity. The latter is fine with me but I am struggling to uderstand the former. It appears I am not the only one to question un conditional heteroskedasticity. A recent comment by @whuber reads: Heteroscedasticity literally means "different amounts of scatter." It applies purely descriptively to data, for instance, where one subgroup of data may have a strikingly different spread than another (disjoint) subgroup. It may apply to time series (where it is a particular kind of failure of weak second order stationarity). But the general sense of it is that scatter varies, meaning it depends on something, and in that respect the adjective "unconditional" looks like an oxymoron. In some contexts the contrast between un conditional and conditional heteroskedasticity seems to lie in the size of the conditioning set. E.g. in a time series context, un conditional heteroskedasticity seems to be heteroskedasticity that is not conditioned on any variable in the model but rather the time index (so it actually appears to be conditional despite the name). Meanwhile, conditional heteroskedasticity conditions on some variable in the model. Could someone who feels comfortable with the term of un conditional heteroskedasticity explain it?
