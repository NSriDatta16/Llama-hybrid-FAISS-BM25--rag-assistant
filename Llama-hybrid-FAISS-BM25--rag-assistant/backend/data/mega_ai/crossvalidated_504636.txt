Finding most likely permutation

[Hoping that this is the right Stackexchange site; inspired from a true story seen at work] Joe has a measuring instrument and $n$ objects to be measured (say, a scale and $n$ weights). He measures each one, obtaining a list of measurements $X=\left[x_1 \dots,x_n\right] \in\mathbb R^n$ . Later on, he sends me the objects. I want to find the correspondence between each object and its respective measured value $x_i$ , but Joe forgot to number the objects or to sort them in any way that allows me to find which one is the $i$ -th object. I therefore measure them again with a similar instrument, obtaining a list of values $Y=\left[y_1 \dots,y_n\right] \in\mathbb R^n$ . If our instruments were perfectly accurate, then $Y$ would be a permutation of $X$ . However, our instruments are not perfect; while they both have perfect trueness , they have imperfect precision . In other words, if we measure the same object many times, the average value of the repeated measurements tends to the true value, but the results have (known) standard deviations $\sigma_J$ and $\sigma_I$ (for Joe's instrument and for mine, respectively). Therefore, the values in $X$ will in general be different from the values in $Y$ . In the limiting case where all values are distinct from each other (that is, $\displaystyle\min_{x_i,x_j\in X}\{|x_i-x_j|\}\gg\sigma_J$ and similarly $\displaystyle\min_{y_i,y_j\in Y}\{|y_i-y_j|\}\gg\sigma_I$ ), finding the correct permutation (that is, the correspondence between a value in $X$ and the corresponding value in $Y$ ) is trivial. When this is not the case, however, how would one go to find the most likely permutation from $X$ to $Y$ from the data available? Bonus questions: does the answer change if I no longer assume perfect trueness? Is the case $\sigma_J=\sigma_I$ easier? EDIT Forgot to ask: how do I compute the probability of a given permutation, that is, the probability that it is the correct one among the space of $n!$ possible permutations? Is there a simple (preferably closed-form) expression for the probability of the optimal permutation (which appears to be the one corresponding to sorting both vectors, see whuber's solution below - at least if the errors are normally distributed)? EDIT 2 Per Aksakal observation (see comments to the question): assume that all true weights are strictly distinct (the measurements , both for me and for Joe, can be non-distinct values due to measurement error).
