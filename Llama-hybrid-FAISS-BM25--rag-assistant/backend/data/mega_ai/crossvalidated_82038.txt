Can I use Mean values of Likert responses instead of factor scores in case of skewed values?

I have five-point Likert scale responses (1-most imp, 5-least imp) for 14 items that I want to convert them into 5 factors with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). I already have designed which item should go into what factor, so I can't use exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Once I get the factor scores, I will use them in a logistic regression. I have the problem of skewed responses as well, with more people responding for certain facilities to be more important in their neighborhood. My question is, shall I go for CFA, or shall I just calculate the mean value for the item responses within each amenity (e.g., Public transportation-bus, metro) and use these mean values in the logistic regression? Also, for CFA, can I use SPSS adding only the items that will be in that factor by forcing it to extract only one factor? If so, which method should I use - PC, ULS, GLS, ML, PAF?
