Statistical test to verify if a population has a average of k times another

Consider the situation where there are 2 positive distributions with unknown expected values $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ , We have samples $S_1 = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ and $S_2 = \{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}$ . We would like to use a statistical test under the null hypothesis: $\mu_1 = k \times \mu_2$ . Do you know what kind of test should we use?
