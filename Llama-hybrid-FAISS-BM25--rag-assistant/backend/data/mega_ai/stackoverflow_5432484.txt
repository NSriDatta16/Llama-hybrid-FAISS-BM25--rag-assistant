Modify content of DataTemplate in code for a Grid control

I have the following Xaml for a grid and I want to be able to modify the value of the Content in code. I want to depending on the condition, not display the "[+]". How do I do that. Also how do i trigger an event to make the change. I am using an Infragistic XamGrid but I think it will apply to other grids too.
