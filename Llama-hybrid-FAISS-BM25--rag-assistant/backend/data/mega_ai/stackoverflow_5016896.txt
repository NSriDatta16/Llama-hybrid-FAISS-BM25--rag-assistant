Best way to store real world "events" in a DB?

I'm building a system which will collect data about an industrial process, which is externally controlled. Those datas will be used to build usage statistics for various components of the system. Simplified example: there's a heater that is turned on and off, and I get notified when it happens. I need to log this, and based on these data be able to answer questions like "How long has the heater been on last month?" What I came up with is to create a table in which I insert a line each time a state change happens, include a timestamp. However, it seems to me that it will require quite a lot of after-processing, eg to answer the example question above. I see no way to extract this kind of answer with just SQL. Question: is there a better suited, more effective "storage pattern" that what I describe here? Thanks.
