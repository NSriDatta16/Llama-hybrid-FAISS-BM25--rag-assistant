What does the overall process do, what is the purpose of the operation being performed? I would assume that executing the process results in data modification within the database. Is this the case? If this is the case, then each time you run the process, the data begin considered is different and so different execution plan production is a possibility and so too are differing execution times. Assuming that modification to the database data is occuring then you should also investigate: Updating relevant database statistics between each process run. Reviewing the level of index fragmentation between each process run and determine if defragmentation could prove benificial.
