Logistic regression refers to the same thing in both fields. It seems like Mahout does some things by default that make its implementation of logistic a little more than just logistic. First, Mahout seems to be regularizing the coefficients. If its doing this by default, I would also expect it to be standardizing (scaling and centering) the inputs. Passing it a value of lambda=0 should prevent regularization, but you still have to make sure that the inputs are not being standardized. If you want to do regularized GLM in R check out the glmnet package .
