What is the best way to ban/block users with Devise for Rails?

I'm using Devise for authentication in my rails app and I'd like to be able to block certain accounts and prevent users from reregistering with a blocked email. I'm just not sure what the best way is to go about it. My first thought was to override the sessions and registrations controllers to check the model for a user with a blocked bit, but I have a feeling there might be a more elegant way.
