here are a few thoughts: Sticking with SQL Azure: you can have another table, PointsTotals. Every time you add a row to your UserPoints table, also increment the TotalPoints value for a given UserId in PointsTotals (or insert a new row if they don't have a row to increment). Now you always have totals computed for each UserId. Going with Azure Table Storage: Create a UserPoints table, with Partition Key being userId. This keeps all of a user's points rows together, where you'd easily be able to sum them. And... you can borrow the idea from suggestion #1, creating a separate PointsTotals table, with PartitionKey being UserId and RowKey probably being the total points.
