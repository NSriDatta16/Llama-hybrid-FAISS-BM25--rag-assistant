Time series could be applied for sales in various different fields. Here a quite extended view. There is the ones you've mentionned: What sales trends there are across time. What products customers will purchase at what time (day/week/month/year seasonality). Customer segmentation across time. And also other ones: Sales predictions based on stock markets correlations (raw materials,etc.). Sales predictions based on other events such as weather, celebration day, virus, scarcity and scarcity threats, inflation, etc. (can be found in news data source like twitter) Correlation study between items in space or in time (ex: sales of a product A could lead later to sales of a product B). If available: Current customer profiles/population studies to make marketing predictions. Historical demographic data to evaluate changes and trends (purchasing power, beliefs,etc.) Items organisation. Some sales can be improved by puting related items next to each other (ex: sun glasses and ice cream).
