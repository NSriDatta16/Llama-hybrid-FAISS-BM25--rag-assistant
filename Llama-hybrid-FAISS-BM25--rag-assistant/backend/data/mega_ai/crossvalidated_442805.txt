Weighted logistic regression is used when you have an imbalanced dataset. Let's understand with an example. Let's assume you have a dataset with patient details and you need to predict whether patient has cancer or not. Such datasets are generally imbalanced. If you have 10,000 data points who is having cancer and 1,000,000 data points don't have cancer. So, your approach may be like: Sample 10,000 data points having cancer (100 % of patients having cancer) Sample 1,00,000 data points don't have cancer (10 % of patients don't have cancer) Now you give weight=10 for data points don't have cancer so that, effect of 1,00,000 sampled data points is same as 1,000,000 data points. This is one of techniques that you can use when you have imbalanced dataset.
