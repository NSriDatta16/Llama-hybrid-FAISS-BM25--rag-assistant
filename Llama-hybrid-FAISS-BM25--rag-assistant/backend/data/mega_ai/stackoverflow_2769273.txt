How do I ensure GUI responsiveness when using OpenCL on the display GPU?

In my relatively short time learning OpenCL I frequently see my application cause the operating system UI to become significantly less responsive (several seconds for a window to respond to a drag for example). I have encountered this problem on Windows Vista and Mac OS X both with NVidia GPUs. What can I do when using OpenCL on the same GPU as the display to ensure that my application does not significantly degrade the UI responsiveness like this? Also, can this be done without taking needless performance losses within my application? (Ie, if the user is not doing some UI intensive task then I would not expect my application to run any slower than it does now.) I understand that any answers will be very platform specific (where platform includes OS/GPU/driver combo).
