Tinyint vs Bit?

I don't want to touch-off a religious war here, but there seem to be two schools of thoughts in how to represent boolean values in a database. Some say bit is the appropriate data type, while others argue tinyint is better. The only differences I'm aware of are these: bit : storage size is 1 bit, possible values are 0 or 1 tinyint : storage size is 1 byte, possible values are 0-255 Which data type is better when you need to represent boolean values? Is tinyint worth the extra overhead "just in case" you need to values > 1?
