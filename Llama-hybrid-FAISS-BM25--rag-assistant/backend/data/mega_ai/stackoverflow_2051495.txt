Any best practices or tools for Ivy repositories?

we use Gradle for building Java projects and at the moment we have Ivy repositories to store third-party artifacts and also to publish our own artifacts into (repo is build using Gant scripts and the Ivy ANT tasks). but repo management is basic. Gradle is able to work with a maven repo as well, so switching to a Maven artifact manager like Archiva or Nexus is an option, but perhaps unnecessary. do you know any tools or best practices than can help us in building and maintaining Ivy repos? just to be clear: we have already read the tutorials and more and understand how to do it, but it's still basic to maintain.
