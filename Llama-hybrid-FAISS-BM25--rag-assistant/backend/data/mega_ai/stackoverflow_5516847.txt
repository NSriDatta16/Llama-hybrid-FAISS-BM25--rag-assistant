You have to sign you sis file with a valid certificate in order to install it. I assume that you use QT Creator IDE. It self-signs sis files by default. Self-signing can be used for the set of basic capabilities which include only: ReadUserData WriteUserData NetworkServices LocalServices UserEnvironment If you really need your application to use ReadDeviceData WriteDeviceData Location you must sign your sis file with a developer certificate. This is how you can get your certificate. You have several options here: If you have a Publisher ID you can get a certificate at symbiansigned.com . To get a Publisher ID for 1 year will cost you $200 and to apply you must represent a registered organization. Individual developers can not apply for a Publisher ID. Sign your sis file with Open Signed Online . It's free and anyone can use it. But you will have to go there and sign your sis each time you rebuild your application. For a mere â‚¬1 you can become an Ovi Publisher . Registration is available for both companies and individual developers. After you register Ovi will provide you a developer certificate for up to 5 IMEI numbers of your test devices. Hope this was helpful. Good luck!
