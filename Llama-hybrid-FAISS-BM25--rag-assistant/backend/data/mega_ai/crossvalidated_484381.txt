The term prior (as well as posterior ) is usually reserved for distributions defined in a Bayesian framework on objects that are not considered as random variables by other inferential approaches, namely parameters . Latent variable models are most often defined outside the Bayesian/non-Bayesian dichotomy and the distribution of the latent variable generally depends on parameters, so is also conditional on the realisation of these parameters in a Bayesian framework. Since it is a matter of terminology, there is no true or false (or right or wrong) to call a marginal distribution a prior, but this may prove confusing to Bayesians and non-Bayesians alike.
