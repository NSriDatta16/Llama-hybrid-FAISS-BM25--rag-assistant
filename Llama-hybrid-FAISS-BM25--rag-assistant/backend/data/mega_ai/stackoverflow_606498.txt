You may also wish to read this article (select the .pdf file), which discusses Design Patterns in dynamic object oriented languages (i.e. Python). To quote the page: This paper explores how the patterns from the "Gang of Four", or "GOF" book, as it is often called, appear when similar problems are addressed using a dynamic, higher-order, object-oriented programming language. Some of the patterns disappear -- that is, they are supported directly by language features, some patterns are simpler or have a different focus, and some are essentially unchanged.
