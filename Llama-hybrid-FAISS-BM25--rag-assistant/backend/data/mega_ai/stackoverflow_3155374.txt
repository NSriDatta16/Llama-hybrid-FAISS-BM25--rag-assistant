Efficient use of NSNumberFormatter related to NSString Categories

I'm writing an NSString category that requires an NSNumberFormatter. I'm stuck between initing and releasing one every time my category is used to print a string in a certain way or initing the formatter in my app and passing it through. The NSNumberFormatter has a couple of config calls run on it first to make it work just right and repeating that in various places in my app just seems wrong. And though I could create one formatter in the main app delegate and let anyone grab it when using one of my category additions, I think that's more of a hack than an elegant solution. So, does creating and destroying an NSNumberFormatter in an NSString Category's convenience method sound good enough? Cheers, Craig
