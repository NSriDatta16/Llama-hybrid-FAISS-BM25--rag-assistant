One way to solve this is to fragment your program into two parts. One part as a windows service and the one as a user app. You can set the service to run as a Network Service, Local Service or Local System depending the level of access you need. Anything that needs administrator privileges will be performed by the Windows service. The user app can be responsible for showing the user interface and other similar things. You need to have some kind of IPC (Inter process communication) between your applications to facilitate this as well.
