Proof that covariance of RV and group average is less than variance of RV

I have a random variable $X_i$ and a group of $N_j$ other random variables that includes $X_i$ . Let's just call this group $J$ . There are no distributional assumptions made on these RVs (other than having finite first and second moments). With $\bar{X}_J$ denoting the arithmetic average of all $X_k$ with $k \in J$ , how can I prove that $Cov(X_i, \bar{X}_J) \leq Var(X_i)$ ? That is, $\bar{X}_J = \frac{1}{N_j}\sum_{k\in J}X_k.$ To be clear, $X_i$ is one of these random variables in group $J$ .
