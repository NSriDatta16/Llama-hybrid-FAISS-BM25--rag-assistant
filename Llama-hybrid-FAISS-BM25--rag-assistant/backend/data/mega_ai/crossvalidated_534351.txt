Is this a multiple time series problem and suggestions to solve it

I'm fairly new to machine learning and especially so to neural network, but I'm assigned to experiment with a machine learning problem and I could really need some help... What we are doing is we are going to analyze the wear metal elements in lube oil, and basically trying to predict the level of each elements in the future for anomalies detection. After some research, I assume this is one of the multiple time series problems since elements gradient within lubricating oil could have some inherent connections and therefore, I tried DeepAR but didn't worked quite well. I'm wondering if I am going about it the right way? Or is there any more mature algorithm and model(not necessarily neuron network) I can try out to solve this?(Considering different plant, different types of oil, etc, and DeepAR does support categorical and numeric features) The second question is, let's say I do end up using DeepAR as my solution, since the factory exchange their oil occationally, Does this mean I need to train the model every time oil gets renewed? Don't want to train the data with the metal elements dropping due to manual exchange of oil. Please provide me with some advices. To elaborate a bit more say the first observation is And the second observation is Now with DeepAR I would be able to do this and hopefully forecast elements level for each sensor? Big thanks to any help in advance.
