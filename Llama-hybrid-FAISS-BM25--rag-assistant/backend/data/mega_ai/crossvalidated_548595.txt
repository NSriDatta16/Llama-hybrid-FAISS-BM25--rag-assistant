High RMSE and High MAE in Autoencoder Regression

I have been developing a simple autoencoder model using PyTorch by which I am training the reconstructed output to be the same and input and also do regression on the hidden layer to predict a single integer value, at the same time. I have been using 5 fold cross-validation method to evaluate the quality of the training process. As a result, I am obtaining a high RMSE and equally high MAE scores in both the training and validation phase. Could anybody guide me on how to further diagnose this problem? I have checked my model architecture for its correctness, and it is valid.
