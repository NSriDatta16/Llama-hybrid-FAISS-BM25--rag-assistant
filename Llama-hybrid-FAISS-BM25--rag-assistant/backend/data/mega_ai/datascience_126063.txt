Not inherently faster: Gaussian kernels are not inherently faster than linear kernels. The efficiency of a kernel depends on various factors, including the specific problem and implementation. Implicit dimensionality reduction: Gaussian kernels can implicitly perform dimensionality reduction, making them efficient in some cases by mapping data to a higher-dimensional space without explicitly transforming the data. Kernel trick: Gaussian kernels use the kernel trick, which can save computational resources by operating in the feature space without explicitly calculating transformed feature vectors. Sparse support vectors: In some scenarios, Gaussian kernels result in a sparse set of support vectors, leading to faster prediction times during testing.
