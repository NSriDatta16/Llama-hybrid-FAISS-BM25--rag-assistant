The original book on Design patterns ( Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by the Gang of Four) predates Java. The examples in there are in C++ and Smalltalk. Design patterns are applicable to many object-oriented programming languages; maybe it's just that in Java they are usually so ubiquitous that you need them to solve anything non-trivial. However, some design patterns are solved by language features (you don't need to explicitly implement an Observer Pattern in C#, for example). Others aren't even applicable to Java, as they need multiple class inheritance.
