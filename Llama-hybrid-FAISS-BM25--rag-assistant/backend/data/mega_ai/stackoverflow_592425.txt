I am a big believer in continuous-integration and automated builds. We have a rule in our shop that we never, ever, ever provide deliverables to a customer that were not produced by a fully automated, zero or one step build (that means that it took no more than 1 mouse click by a human to baseline, build, package, and release the thing.) These fully automated, one-step builds work by recognizing when a change is made to your source code control system, and automatically triggering the "build script." For C#, I can recommend both CruiseControl.NET and Hudson . I can also recommend the Pragmatic Project Automation series of books. Variants of this title should be available for both Java and .NET. There are lots of prewritten build servers out there that can help you automate this.
