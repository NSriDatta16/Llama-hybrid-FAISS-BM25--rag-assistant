Because array[6][0:5] is the string. You should convert it to the integer before looking at the KFCFzip list. for line in text: array= line.strip().split(",") print(array[6][0:5]) if int(array[6][0:5]) in KFCFzip: print("yes") Another problem with this solution is the performance. range creates a list of elements so you are going to compare every "suspected" ZIP code with every possible zip code. Time complexity for this algorithm is O(n*m) where n = len(KFCFzip) and m - number of lines in the file. Better way is to create a list of ranges like: KFCFzip = [[93201,93399], [93529,93535], [93601,93899], [95301,95399]] for line in text: array= line.strip().split(",") zip = int(array[6][0:5])) print(zip) found = False for r in KFCFzip: if zip >= r[0] and zip in this case you can dramatically increase the performance. For instance using your data you would have 197+5+297+97 = 596 elements, so for each line you would have to make 596/2 = 298 comparisons in average. But using my algorithms you'll have only 8/2 = 4 comparisons, which ~ 75 times less (read faster).
