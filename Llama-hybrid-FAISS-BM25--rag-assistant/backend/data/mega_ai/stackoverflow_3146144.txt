css positioning of an info-note on the top of an icon

i have a simple question. for a website, i want to create an "info note" that appears by hovering a link, as facebook does when hovering some thumbnails you know? here is the thing i have for the moment, so you can see the bug i have : alt text http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/1571/notes.gif so the only problem is : the small "info note" stay on the left of my div. the goal is that this small note appears well-placed, over the right icon... :/ do javascript is required to do this ? or can we do it with css only (and in this case, what's wrong with my code? :/) for information, here is the html code for this : J'aime ! images/temp/heart.png" alt="" /> and the css : .infohover { display: none; position: relative; float: left; margin-top: -30px; margin-left: -4px; opacity: 0.9; background: url(' images/temp/infohover_arrow.gif') 8px 24px no-repeat; } .infohover_in { display: block; padding: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff; border-radius: 3px; } ps: don't pay attention to the "not perfect written" code, i write it quickly for the test, to see if i can do it or no... will clean it later :-) thanks a lot for your help and ideas ! have a nice day !
