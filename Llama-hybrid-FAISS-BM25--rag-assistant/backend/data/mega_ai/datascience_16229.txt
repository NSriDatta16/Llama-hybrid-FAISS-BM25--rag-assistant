Get Gate Activation of GRU-Cells in TensorFlow

I implemented a standard RNN in Tensorflow (0.12) using the classes tf.python.ops.rnn_cell.GRUCell tf.nn.dynamic_rnn I am interested in the gates and which values they take during. Unfortunately the function dynamic_rnn doesn't support this and just gives the 'output' and 'state' (The final hidden state). In the code of the GRUCell the gates are called 'r' and 'u' for reset and update. Is there a clever way to save the values of the gates over time or do I have to write my own GRU cell? Thanks!
