Ant is used, as any build tool is, to automate the repetitive tasks of building your code. Rather than run javac each time by hand you put a command into an Ant script and then when you run ant it will run javac for you. My typical build process with ant goes something like this: run javac on the source run javac on the tets run the cobertura instrumentation on the source (this is for code coverage) jar up the classes from the source jar up the cobertura instrumented classes jar up the unit test classes run checkstyle, pmd, findbugs on the source to find warnings run the unit tests via cobertura to get code coverage of them So that is 8 steps that I have done on each build that I can do simply by running "ant".
