What value of ANOVA F-Value is significant

I'm using ANOVA F-Value from Scikit-learn ( link ) to find importance of features in a machine learning task. I have numeric feature and binary classification. I'm also filtering the features whose p-value is > 0.05, but I don't know what value for the ANOVA F-Value is good enough?
