How to convert night image to day image?

I have set of night images which I will be using for self driving. But I want to convert those images into day images. I have developed algorithm based on day image but it is not good for night images , so I want to convert night images to day images then feed into the network. As far as I have explored image colourization techniques of grey scale image ( converting night image to black and white and then coloring it) Ã nd night to day style transfer using GANs. Is it possible to achieve the goal with the above two mentioned techniques or you can also suggest any other way. Example link. :- https://goo.gl/images/kTwnHB
