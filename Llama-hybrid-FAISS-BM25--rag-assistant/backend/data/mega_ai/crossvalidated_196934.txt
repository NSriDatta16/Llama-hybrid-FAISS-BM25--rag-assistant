Fixed-length time series difference measurement

I have a very specific case of time series comparison. Suppose we have two time series $T_c$ and $T_s$, both of them $512$ discrete points in size. Both of them have been sampled at the same frequency and basically are representations of the same data source, before ($T_c$) and after ($T_s$) some specific treatment. Currently, I am using the following list of measurements in evaluating the differences between $T_c$ and $T_s$: Discrete values of the measured quantity at specific ordinates; Maximum and minimum values of the measured quantity; RMSE and absolute difference in specific ordinate regions; Derivative maximum and averaged values; Cross-correlation function value; The questions are: What could be a more generic approach to measurement of the effect of the aforementioned treatment on the data source? Following from the nature of the data it represents, $T_c$ has a distinctive shape (e.g., regions of positive and negative slope). How can I use this knowledge? What could be a more specific approach to measurement of the effect of the treatment, considering the known properties of the $T_c$ series?
