Maximum of averages

I'm supposed to get every departments average wage and only show the department with the highest average wage. I figured out this query, but it doesn't work. Anyone got some ideas? SELECT department, max(avg(wage)) FROM employees GROUP BY department; I get this error: ERROR at line 1: ORA-00937: not a single-group group function
