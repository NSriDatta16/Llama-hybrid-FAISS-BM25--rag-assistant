Confusion matrix - one class with zero values

I'm applying the Random Forest classifier on a dataset with 645 records and 12 features (selected by KBest method). This dataset contains a class with 4 possible values (1..4). When I plot the confusion matrix I've got this My point is about class 2. As you noted, the learned model didn't work for this class. Initially, the size could be a problem, but class 2 has a similar size the class 2 I checked the mean values for each feature but I didn't find anything anormal between class 2 and the others. Someone has an idea of the reasons the model sounds too bad to only class 2?
