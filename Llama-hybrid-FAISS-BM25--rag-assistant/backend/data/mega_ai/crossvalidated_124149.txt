Which test to use when t-test is not apropriate?

I have two groups, male and female teachers. I want to see if there is a statistically significant difference in mean pay. There are 48 male teachers, which is enough to use a t-test. However, there are only 23 female teachers, and further, the distribution of female pay is right skewed. What are my options for a test? Could I: resample female teacher pay to get 48 values, then do a t-test? select only 23 male teachers, then shuffle the pay values to create a null randomization distribution and then compare the mean difference to look for statistical signifigance? some other method?
