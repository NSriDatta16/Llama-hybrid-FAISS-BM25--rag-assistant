This is clearly a bug, and it reproduces in today's build of C# 4.0. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. Odds are good that this issue will not make the bar for fixing before the final release; at this late stage we are taking only very high-priority fixes that we have confidence will not destabilize the release. What's more likely is that a fix will make it into a future service release; but of course, no promises.
