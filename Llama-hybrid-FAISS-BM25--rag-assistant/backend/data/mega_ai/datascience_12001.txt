How to fix inconsistent (variable spelling) categorical data and "fill in" missing data

I am a newbie data science engr. My first challenge is to (1) normalize inconsistent values in categorical features and (2) fill any missing information. To describe inconsistency lets say we have a country field and there can be multiple entries for USA . e.g. USA , United States of America , US , US-50 , United States , America , etc. How do I normalize all these entries and just say USA for all entries. I can think of some set of full text search rules to match against using lucene or something. Is there any specific technical term for this problem?
