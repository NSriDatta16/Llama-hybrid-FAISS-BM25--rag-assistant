I think I found the answer to my question: Frequency basically means the number of time units with one period of a time series. So for instance, for the call center data, the period is 169 because the measurements are taken every 5 mins between 7am and 9:05pm, which means 169 samples within one day. Similarly, for the pattern that repeats weekly, the frequency becomes 169*5, because the data repeats every 169*5 time units.
