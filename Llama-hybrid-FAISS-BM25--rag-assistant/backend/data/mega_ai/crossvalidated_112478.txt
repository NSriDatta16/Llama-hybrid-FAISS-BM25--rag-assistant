Normalization isn't always necessary. We use it with certain methods (such as Principal Component Analysis) because otherwise, the values that have a larger scale will be given an increased weight. Here's a discussion of why normalization is necessary within the PCA context -- the same basic argument applies to other techniques that are sensitive to scale: Why do we need to normalize data before analysis It would depend on what your intention was with the normalization, and what type of analysis you intended to do. Feature scaling is a pretty common normalization technique, and what I usually default to unless there is a reason to attempt another technique. You can read about other normalization techniques here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics) .
