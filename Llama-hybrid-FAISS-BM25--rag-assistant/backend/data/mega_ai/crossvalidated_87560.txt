Structural equation model: Bootstrap, Bayesian statistic or rescaling binary data to deal with small sample size?

I’m trying to solve a SEM. Mi model includes 4 latent variables and 11 observed variables. My data is binary. Question 1: I just have 47 observations and in the literature a sample size over 150-200 is recommended. I understand that bootstrapping or Bayesian statistic may be used to deal with small sample sizes. Am I right? I’m using the R package lavaan that has implemented bootstrap, but as my data is binary I’m not sure if I can use bootstrap. For binary data it is recommended to use diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS). Question 2: If I can’t use bootstrap because my data is binary, what if I rescale my data? There are methods to rescale categorical and ordinal data based on correlational aspects of data . Variance covariance and correlation matrices may be calculated with these methods. Is it a reasonable solution? Question 3 : Regarding a Bayesian approach, is it a good approach?
