How to determine a good value for --load-average using gnu Make?

In Make this flag exists: -l [load], --load-average[=load] Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are others jobs running and the load average is at least load (a floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous load limit. Do you have a good strategy for what value to use for the load limit ? It seems to differ a lot between my machines.
