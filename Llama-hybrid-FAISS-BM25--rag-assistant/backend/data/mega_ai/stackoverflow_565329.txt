I've used the very pragmatic approach discussed by Oren Eini (aka Ayende Rahien) in his blogspots Dealing with time in tests . There is a static class like this: public static class SystemTime { public static Func Now = () => DateTime.Now; } Your code becomes: Entity.LastChange = SystemTime.Now(); And your test would become: SystemTime.Now = () => new DateTime(2000,1,1); repository.ResetFailures(failedMsgs); SystemTime.Now = () => new DateTime(2000,1,2); var msgs = repository.GetAllReadyMessages(); Assert.AreEqual(2, msgs.Length);
