Feature expansion (multiplication) - What to do with higher correlations?

If I have a set of features $\left \{x_1,x_2,x_3 \right \}$ and I expand the feature set by multiplying all the features to have the following: $\left \{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_1\times x_2,x_2\times x_3,x_1\times x_3 \right \}$ . Now, I find that two of my features $\left \{x_1\times x_2, x_2\times x_3 \right\}$ are highly correlated ( $>0.85$ spearman/pearson). What should I do? Note that originally $x_1, x_2$ and $x_3$ are not correlated at all ( $ ) And I am training Logistic Regression/SVM with these features, so correlation matters. Thanks
