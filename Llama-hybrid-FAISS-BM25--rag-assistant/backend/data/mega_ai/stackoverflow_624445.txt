You could use Markov Chains to generate words that sounds like English(or any other language you want) but they are not actual words. The question of easy to remember is really subjective, so I don't think you can write an algorithm like this that will be good for everyone. And why use short passwords on web sites/computer applications instead of pass phrases? They are easy to remember but hard to crack.
