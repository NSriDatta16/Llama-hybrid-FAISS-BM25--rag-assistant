search criteria difference between Like vs Contains() in oracle

I created a table with two columns.I inserted two rows. id name 1 narsi reddy 2 narei sia one is simply number type and another one is CLOB type.So i decided to use indexing on that. I queried on that by using contains. query: select * from emp where contains(name,'%a%e%')>0 2 narei sia I expected 2 would come,but not. But if i give same with like it's given what i wanted. query: select * from emp where name like '%a%e%' ID NAME 1 (CLOB) narsi reddy 2 (CLOB) narei sia 2 rows selected finally i understood that like is searching whole document or paragraph but contains is looking in words. so how can i get required output?
