Consider something like this, instead: I believe that'll work. (Although I haven't tested it; I've only just begun with MVC and don't have the toolset here at the office.) EDIT: I apparently missed the actual question ... :) Microsoft does provide an output method, but didn't provide a syntax like the one you describe. The output method is Response.Write() . I can't answer this directly (I believe you'll need to check with Scott Hanselmann over at MS :)), but I think they didn't want to complicate scripting by adding yet-another-language for us to learn; I think they wanted to leverage the languages (C#, VB, etc.) which developers already knew. EDIT #2: I placed the following in a comment, and in retrospect (for completeness), it should be part of the answer. If you head over to the Learn MVC site on ASP.NET , in the view tutorial (that's the link), you'll see the following paragraph: Since you call Response.Write() so often, Microsoft provides you with a shortcut for calling the Response.Write() method. The view in Listing 3 uses the delimiters and %> as a shortcut for calling Response.Write() . Essentially, is the accepted shortcut for Response.Write , and you therefore can use the full Response.Write method anywhere you'd use .
