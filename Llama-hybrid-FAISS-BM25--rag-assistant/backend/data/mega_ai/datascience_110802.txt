Hard time finding literature on feature clustering using Principal Component Analysis

Im new to StackExchange, so i am sorry if this is not the right way to ask a question on StackExhange. For my thesis I wish to propose a methode for future research on using PCA to cluster features (feature clustering) and then apply per-cluster PCA. I got the idea from this paper: this paper . But I have a hard time finding literature about PCA being used to cluster variables (not reduce variables). I could imagine that it is not ideal to use PCA to cluster variables but i still would like to propose the method. Do any of you know any literature, articles, books etc.
