I tried both Polarion and vss2svn about a year ago. We had many years of code in VSS, and I found that after all of the configuration and testing that I was not entirely satisfied with the results, the process was long and fragile, and in the end, decided to just start with a clean import of the latest code. There have been a few times over the last year where I went looking for old history, but not really that much. Another plus of starting fresh is that your new SVN repository will be very fast!
