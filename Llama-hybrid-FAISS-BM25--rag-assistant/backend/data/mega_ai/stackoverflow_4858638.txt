So I fixed the issue by approaching it a different way. Now I make sure to never set a KeepTogether property to true for paragraphs or tables. Then, when I want a Paragraph that contains child paragraphs and PdfPTable s, I add it to a one column, one cell, PdfPTable with its KeepTogether flag set to true . So that works perfectly, just a little dirty.
