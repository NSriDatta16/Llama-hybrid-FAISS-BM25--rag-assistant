Localize main menu in C#

Good night, Today I learned about localization in C# and now I need to fully localize my application's main menu. The question is whether there is any way to localize it automatically? Currently, I set at design time each MenuItem 's Text property to be a given string in the resource file and use recursion on MenuItems , but this doesn't sound elegant at all... Is there any better way? Thank you very much.
