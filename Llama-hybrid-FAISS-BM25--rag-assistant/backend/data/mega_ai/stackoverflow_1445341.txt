Elegant way to structure models into subfolders without creating submodules

I have numerous models in my app/models folder. I'd like to clean this folder up a little bit. Move models that belong to each other in subfolders. The problem is that by convention the model class is namespaced into an according module. E.g. app/models/blog/post.rb app/models/blog/comment.rb app/models/user.rb so that: app/models/blog/post.rb class Post and not class Blog::Post
