You definitely don't want to use the ThreadPool for this purpose. ThreadPool threads are not meant to be used for long-running tasks ("infinite" counts as long-running), since that would obviously tie up resources meant to be shared. For your application, it would probably be better to create one thread ( not from the ThreadPool) and in that thread execute your while loop, inside of which you iterate through your Agents collection and perform the processing for each one. In the while loop you should also use a Thread.Sleep call so you don't max out the processor (there are better ways of executing code periodically, but Thread.Sleep will work for your purposes). Finally, you need to include some way for the while loop to exit when your program terminates. Update: Finally finally, multi-threading does not automatically speed up slow-running code. Nine women can't make a baby in one month.
