Using skewness and kurtosis functions in image matching

I am using the skewness and kurtosis functions for image color Histogram in image retrieval system as a statistical color features then using these features to compare between two images to retrieve the similarity images....but I get 'NaN' value in some results which is causes an error in image retrieval process: S=double(imread('im.jpg'); R=S(:,:,1)/64; R1=floor(R); G=S(:,:,2)/64; G1=floor(G); B=S(:,:,3)/64; B1=floor(B); [rr cc c]=size(R1); ImageHist = zeros(4,4,4); for row = 1 :rr for col = 1:cc ImageHist(R1(row,col)+1, G1(row,col)+1,B1(row,col)+1 )= ImageHist(R1(row,col)+1, G1(row,col)+1,B1(row,col)+1)+1; end end ImageHist = ImageHist/(rr*cc); then I compute the Kurtosis as: QKurColHis = kurtosis(ImageHist); I make the same thing to second function (skewness) It is suitable to use this function to the color histogram to extract color feature? then using it in image retrieval? if it is OK, how can I correct this Error, how can I remove the NaN values from my mat.file? I want to use these function as image features in matching between color images... any one please could help me to solve this problem?
