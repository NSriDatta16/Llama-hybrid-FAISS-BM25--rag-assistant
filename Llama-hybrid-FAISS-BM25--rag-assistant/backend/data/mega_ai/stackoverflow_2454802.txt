Check out: http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?NSWindow I found the following information: How can I change the color of the text in the title bar? Is there an NSWindowTitleBar?? I can't seem to find anything on Google about this. -- JasonTerhorst NSTitledFrame?(private) has _drawTitleStringIn:withColor: You can override this method. CocoaMovieTheater? ( http://www.zathras.de/ ) includes private headers of window frame classes. -- Afunishi Note that I took down MovieTheatre? ages ago, but since this page seems to be leading so many people to my site, I put up the class that I used to do custom window colors separately. Find it at http://www.zathras.de/angelweb/sourcecode.htm#UKCustomWindowFrame . Oh, and Afunishi, please don't directly link into the archives on my web site, link to the sourcecode page that contains a description for each of them. Thanks! -- UliKusterer However, the use of or overriding of private methods is strongly discouraged. Apple might change these at any time and your application will cease to function(!) correctly. Your other option is to take care of all of the title bar drawing yourself, but this isn't easy. I would suggest coming up with an alternative design and filing a bug report at http://bugreport.apple.com requesting the feature, making sure to explain in great detail why it is important to you.
