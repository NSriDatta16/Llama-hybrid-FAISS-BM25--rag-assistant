Smoothing Small Data Set With Second Order Quadratic Curve

I'm doing some specific signal analysis, and I am in need of a method that would smooth out a given bell-shaped distribution curve. A running average approach isn't producing the results I desire. I want to keep the min/max, and general shape of my fitted curve intact, but resolve the inconsistencies in sampling. In short: if given a set of data that models a simple quadratic curve, what statistical smoothing method would you recommend? If possible, please reference an implementation, library, or framework. Thanks SO! Edit : Some helpful data (A possible signal graph) The dark colored quadratic is my "fitted" curve of the light colored connected data points. The sample @ -44 (approx.), is a problem in my graph (i.e. a potential sample inconsistency). I need this curve to "fit" the distribution better, and overcome the values that do not trend accordingly. Hope this helps!
