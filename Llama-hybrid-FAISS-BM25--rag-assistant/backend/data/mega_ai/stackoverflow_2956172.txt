If you go to shell.appspot.com and run the following code: from google.appengine.api import urlfetch url = 'http://www.showhttprequest.com/' result = urlfetch.fetch(url) print result.content You will see that (as of sometime near the end of 2009) AppEngine now puts the appid into the user-agent header. So your user-agent ends up looking like: AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine; appid: shell)
