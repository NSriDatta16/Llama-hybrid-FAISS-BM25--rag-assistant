You should modify the RootViewController.xib. Add a UIView to the xib and then drag the existing table view into that view. Also, be sure to set the view connection of the "File's Owner" to point to your new view instead of the tableview. You can then customize the size and location of the tableview as a subview of the main view for the ViewController.
