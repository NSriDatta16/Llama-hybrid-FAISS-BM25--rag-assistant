By ?anovaBF() , you can check the model $y=\mu+X_1\theta_1+...+X_p\theta_p+\epsilon$ , where $\mu$ is the grand mean, theta’s are the vectors of main-effect and interaction effects, $X$ ’s are corresponding design matrix, and epsilon is the error term. Hence, in your case, mcmc samples returned by posterior(anovaBF()) are the estimates for the grand mean and condition effects (which explain why the figure is negative). The condition effects sum to zero. Then, the posterior samples are the grand mean plus each condition effect.
