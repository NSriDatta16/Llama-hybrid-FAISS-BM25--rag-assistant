To get a true two column layout, you need the height of the paragraphs (not the characters in it). The problem here: The only way to get the height is to wait for the browser to layout the page unless you specify the width of every element. Otherwise, the user would see an ugly flicker. So I suggest to try this: Use a multi column layout which most browser support. If the browser is not IE For IE 7 and lower, set a fixed width for all elements. Wait for the browser to layout the page (it should be enough to run this code in body.onload or from a script tag at the end of the page). Put all elements into a div with the id "col1". Use JavaScript to find the element at half the height of the the div "col1". ( see here ) If this element is a heading, skip one element. Move the next element (and all beyond) into the div "col2". That should give you a longer col1 and a shorter col2. If moving doesn't work, insert an invisible character after you identified the split point, get col1.innerHtml, split it at the split char and use the resulting two strings as innerHtml for col1 and col2. If that flickers a lot, try to hide col1 and col2 while your script runs (display='None').
