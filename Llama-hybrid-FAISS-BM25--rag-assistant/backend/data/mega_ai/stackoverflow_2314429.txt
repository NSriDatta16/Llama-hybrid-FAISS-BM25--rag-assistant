I recently did a thing at work where you defined the a method using a lambda, which the internal object then took the name of. You could use strings as well, or pass in a MethodInfo but the first one isn't really type safe (and typos are a big risk), and the latter is not very elegant. Basically I had a method like this (this is not the exact method, it is a bit more advanced): public void SetRequest(Request req, Expression >> methodSelector); The key here is the "Expression" thing, this lets you "select" a method like this: SetRequest(req, service => service.SomeMethodTakingLongReturningStuffs); Method selector is made into a expression tree which you can then fetch different bits of data from. I don't recall exactly what the resulting tree looks like, it also depends on how your lambdas look.
