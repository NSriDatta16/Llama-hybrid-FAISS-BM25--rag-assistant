How to scale texture2d in XNA with window resizing

I'm developing an UI for a project for school, and I've tried similar methods to scaling my texture as listed here, but here is the issue: Our project is developed at 1440 x 900, so I've made my own images that fit that screen resolution. When we have to demo our project in class, the projector can only render up to 1024 x 768, thus, many things on the screen goes missing. I have added window resizing capabilities, and I'm doing my scaling like this. I have my own class called "button" which has a texture 2d, and a Vector2 position contruscted by Button(Texture2d img, float width, float height). My idea is to set the position of the image to a scalable % of the window width and height, so I'm attempting to set the position of the img to a number between 0-1 and then multiply by the window width and height to keep everything scaled properly. (this code is not the proper syntax, i'm just trying to convey the point) Button button = new Button(texture, .01, .01 ); int height = graphicsdevice.viewport.height * button.position.Y; int width = graphicsdevice.viewport.width * button.position.X; Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0,0,width, height); sprite.being() sprite.draw (button.img, rect, color.white); sprite.end it doesn't end up scaling anything when i go to draw it and resize the window by dragging the mouse around. if i hard code in a different bufferheight and bufferwidth to begin with, the image stays around the same size regardless of resolution, except that the smaller the resolution is, the more pixelated the image looks. what is the best way to design my program to allow for dynamic texture2d scaling?
