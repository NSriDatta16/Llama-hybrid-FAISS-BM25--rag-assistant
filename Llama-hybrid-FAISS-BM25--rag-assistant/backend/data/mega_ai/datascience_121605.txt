LLM powered chat bot enhanced by NER

I have been reading on the capabilities of LLM based conversational agents and have been wondering if there is even possibility for any further enhancement with the addition of NER to such system. If so, in which case could a conversational agents powered by an LLM like say Dolly 2.0 be enhanced by NER?
