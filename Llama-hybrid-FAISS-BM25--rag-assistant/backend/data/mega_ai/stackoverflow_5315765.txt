Ensure a single instance of Telerik Window per page/request

I have an EditorTemplate that is repeated on a page. This EditorTemplate creates a Telerik Window (see code below). How do I ensure that only one instance of the PostalLookupWindow Window is created for a given page/request? I want to re-use this Window for all the EditorTemplates. I have tried using ViewData and TempData to store temporary values indicating that the control has been created before but was unsuccessful. I cannot put the Window creation in the controls's parent as the EditorTemplate is re-used in multiple pages. Html.Telerik().Window() .Name("PostalLookupWindow") .Title("Postal Code Selection") .Height(430) .Width(700) .Modal(true) .Draggable(true) .Scrollable(false) .LoadContentFrom(Url.Action("Index","PostalCode", null, Request.Url.Scheme)) .Visible(false).Render();
