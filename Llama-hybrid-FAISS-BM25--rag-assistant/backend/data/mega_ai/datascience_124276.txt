I guess I can answer this question well as I have been studying the intensive mathematics required for ML. People often tend to ignore the maths required for Machine Learning and directly jump to the coding part. Here are few of my suggestions in the preference order: The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop Pattern Classification by David G. Stork, Peter E. Hart, and Richard O. Duda You can easily find the PDFs for these books online as well, or you can prefer buying them. My top recommendation would be ESL and then PRML ESL is a book which is often read by research scholars and you will need a great understanding of maths(linear algebra, optimization, and statistics) to understand the book well, otherwise, it might feel a little overwhelming. Also, I am attaching a link to my Machine Learning Notes I made these while studying Maths in Machine Learning. These might be helpful :D
