You would want to clean your data before training a classifier. To give you a rough and abstract look on ML, think of your classifiers as a giant mathematical matrix. You want to use the classifiers to give you information on the data you have. But in order to do that, you would want to clean, parse or even encode your data to a format that the ML would be able to understand and one where you can gain the most knowledge from the data. I can't think of any case where you would want to clean data with a classifier. You could use dimensionality reduction but that is not exactly data cleaning. Hope that answers your question
