Scrum is focused on how to manage a project, particularly with respect to planning and estimation. XP (Extreme Programming) is focused on technical excellence and quality within the project, and keeping the cost of change low. Think of each of them as a toolbox, where one toolbox doesn't build a house. Scrum relies on a low cost of change in order for its measurements of velocity and its estimation off the back of them to be accurate - but it doesn't actually provide the methods for this to work. XP has most of Scrum contained within its practices, though some Scrum techniques like breaking stories into tasks can be useful for teams who are learning. Even together, you may find that they don't provide quite enough tools for adaptive planning, large-scale organisational change, cultural change, good recruitment practices, and the many other inputs to an Agile team which often get left out of methodologies. I'd aim for a combination of Scrum with XP, and you might like to look into Lean, Kanban, BDD and Feature Injection while you're at it - there are some useful tools there too. As for starting, here are my two core practices: Try to deliver some software (showcase or release every couple of weeks) Work out why that was hard and what to do about it (retrospectives). Good luck!
