Designing a web based game that would run in a browser - Where should I start?

I would like to design a web based game preferably in Python ( using Django maybe) though I'm open to any language other than Java/Flash/ActionScript. The idea I have in mind is more about data models than graphics and will leverage social networking sites. I would like to extend it with a mobile web interface in the future. Please give your invaluable suggestions and recommend some resources with which I can get started.
