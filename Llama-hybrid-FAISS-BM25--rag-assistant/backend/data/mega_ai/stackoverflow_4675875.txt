Because the WebService instance is created and discarded on a per-call basis. If you want to share state between multiple web service calls, then use a static field. But beware that you need to worry about the same kind of issues you would when dealing with any other multi-threaded code. Two calls could be in progress at the same time so you need to use locks where appropriate. Also worth mentioning is that IIS can and will terminate your application domain for any reason at any time so you shouldn't rely on the fact that the field will hang around indefinitely. If you need it to persist then use a database or other persistent storage.
