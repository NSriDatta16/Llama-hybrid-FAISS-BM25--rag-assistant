GLM: Logistic Regression Fitted Probabilities Numerically 0 or 1 occurred for non-linearly separable data

I have data that I don't believe is linearly separable. See below; X = 761, 700, 3488, 555, 2784, 1336, 380 Y = 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0 My belief is that because of the first two observations I shouldn't have linearly separable data. The error arises when I run: glm(Y~X,family=binomial(link='logit'),data=data) THanks in advance!
