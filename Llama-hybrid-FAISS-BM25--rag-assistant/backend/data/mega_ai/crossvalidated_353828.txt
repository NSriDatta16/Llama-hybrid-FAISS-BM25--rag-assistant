Normalize probability distribution by variance of each class

I have several topics that I will collect language data for. Using Mturk I will ask responders to write sentences for each topic. The sentences will be used to train a language model. Language models work best when their training data is representative of the data they will be used to evaluate. I have found that the topics are not equally common in real life so I will give Mturk questions to responders in a distribution that aligns with the probability distribution of topics. I have determined that the number of ngrams (unique word pairs) in the topics vary greatly and would like to update the probability distribution of my topics to account for each topic's ngram count. My approach is to take the product of each topic's ngram count and its distribution: | Topic | Distribution (%) | Ngram Count | Product | |---------|------------------|-------------|---------| | Weather | 50 | 100 | 5000 | | Sports | 25 | 70 | 1750 | | Music | 25 | 20 | 500 | I then find the probability distribution of the Product column and use that as my "normalized" distribution. Where the normalized distribution for Weather is 5000/sum(Product) . | Topic | Distribution (%) | Ngram Count | Product | Normalized | |---------|------------------|-------------|---------|------------| | Weather | 50 | 100 | 5000 | .69 | | Sports | 25 | 70 | 1750 | .24 | | Music | 25 | 20 | 500 | .07 | Is this correct?
