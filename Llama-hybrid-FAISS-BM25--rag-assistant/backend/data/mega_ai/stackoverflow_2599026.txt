This crash log is not symbolicated. iPhone app Crash logs are useless without being symbolicated. This is because during a release build of an iPhone app, all the debug symbols are stripped from the binary and stored into a .dSYM (debug symbols) file. In order to symbolicate a crash log, the .app file AND its corresponding .dSYM file need to be locatable on the computer (via spotlight). Once this is the case, the crash log can be dragged into Xcode's Organiser window into the Crash Reports section. Symbolication should happen during the import of the crash log. If the .app and .dSYM files for this build were not saved, there is no way you can symbolicate this crash report and it will not help you.
