Search Google POI (maps.google.com)

when you go to maps.google.com and search for "cupcakes" for example, you get the results displayed on a map, and on the left there is a list of results. I want the user of my application (iPhone and Web) to be able to enter a search term, then it searches on google and provides a list (much like the list on the left in maps.google.com), the user can then select a location from the list. The list would need to be in XML format or something similar that can be parsed on the iPhone. It needs to include the Name of the location, a description (if provided) and its address/coordinates. Is this possible, and if so, how can it be done?
