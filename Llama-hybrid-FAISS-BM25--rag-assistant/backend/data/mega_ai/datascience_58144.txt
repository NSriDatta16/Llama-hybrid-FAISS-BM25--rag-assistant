Time Series and Statistical Learning methods differences

I am trying to understand the Time Series and Forecasting methods. I have this basic theoretical question about this: Why "Time Series" is NOT included on the Contents of, for example, the book "The Elements of Statistical Learning" Tibshirani - Hastie or so many others similar books? There are a lot of specific books for Time Series, but isn't it an Statistical Learning method?
