When the SVM will be a better option to using than CNN

I want to use a dataset with five features related to three classes ( normal, UDP, and SYN) to detect the DDoS attack, In this idea, which algorithm should be used ( ML with SVM or DL with CNN) and when will SVM be a better option to use than CNN? Thanks in advance.
