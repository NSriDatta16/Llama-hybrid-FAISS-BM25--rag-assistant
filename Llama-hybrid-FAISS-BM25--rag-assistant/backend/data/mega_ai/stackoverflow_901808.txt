The above function actually expect a click from user, to call draggable again. Instead you need to do it after postback. Rule here, should be, to register all images with draggable function, after placing the images on page. Edit: In your case clicking button just triggers the function to fetch the images. Those images should be placed on page, before you make them draggables. You can register the created object with draggables, immediately after the statements where you place & apply ".drag" cssclass to those object/images at runtime.
