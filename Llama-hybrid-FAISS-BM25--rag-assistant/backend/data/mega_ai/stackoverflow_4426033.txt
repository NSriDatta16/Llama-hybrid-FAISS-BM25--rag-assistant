No, there's no convention for organization of functions and classes. However, there are some basic guidelines that will make your source flow better and make more sense to readers: Document. Whatever you do, make sure that the uses (and in some cases, implementation) of classes and functions is described in plain english) Group together things that are alike. Two functions that perform similar functions? Put them together. Use common sense. If a class extends another, the base class should come first. If a function takes an instance of a class you defined, make sure the class definition comes first. For examples on how this is done, look no further than the Python standard library. The source files from some of the modules should give you an idea how source is organized in Python.
