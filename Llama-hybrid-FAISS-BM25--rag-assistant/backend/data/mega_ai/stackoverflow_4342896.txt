Although I asked this question I will add what I know about Certificates as this is something I have worked with - though if my understanding is imperfect, I'd be happy to be corrected. An X.509 certificate consists of a Public Key and a Private Key and issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (you can self-sign a certificate , this limits the usefulness of the certificate to trusted sources only). The CA will charge a fee for the certificate, and it will expire after a period of time. The Public Key does not need to be protected and is given to the server. The Private Key is kept private and is used by the client. Messages encrypted by the Private Key can be decrypted by the Public Key. A request from a client has a digital signature embedded in the SOAP. This is generated using the Private Key. When the server receives the request, it uses the Public Key to read the signature. If the signature can be read, then the request is considered genuine. Within Active Directory, there is a mechanism whereby an X.509 certificate can be mapped to a user account, so you can impersonate a user with a certain permission set based on the X.509 authentication. The benefits of X.509, are: that it can be used across domains; and that the Private Key can be securely stored in the client's Certificate Store. So there is no .config file containing credentials. Failure to control the distribution and storage of a Private Key is akin to writing a username/password on a post-it note and sticking it on your monitor.
