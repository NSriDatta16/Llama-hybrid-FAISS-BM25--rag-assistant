However, if I dont have the javaee api dependency in my webapp module it won't compile. At the moment my source code is POJO with no metadata. Web Apps (and Java EE modules in general) most of time need a compile time dependency on Java EE APIs like the Servlet API, etc that will be provided at runtime by the container. When using Maven, such dependencies are declared with a provided scope . For example: javax javaee-api 6.0 provided In your case, since you mention a compilation problem, I'm tempted to say that your webapp module is really missing a dependency on some API that should be declared as mentioned above. What is unclear is how this relates to the question title. Maybe providing the relevant part of your POMs and the exact error would help to get a more precise answer.
