You can use the following object model: Organization -id -name -description -productLines ( collection object consisting of products) -orgcontacts ( collection object consisting of contacts) -addresses (of type Address, can be a collection depends on business rule) Contact -id -name -type (Business, personal, etc) -parentID (null if no reference) -adresses (Address or collection) ProductLine -id -name -prLineContacts ( collection object consisting of contacts) You can build on this basic model that I can think of. Do you have a data schema? if so, you should decide where to start. Some people like 1-1 mapping between their object and data model and some want to design their data schema based on performance and then have another abstraction mapping between objects and database.
