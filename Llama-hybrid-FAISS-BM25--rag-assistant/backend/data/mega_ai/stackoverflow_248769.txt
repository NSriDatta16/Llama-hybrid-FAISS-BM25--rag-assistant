PHP IDE--Want to sync local storage with FTP

I currently use Notepad++ for most of my development. I have been checking out other, more full-featured options and would like to switch (I'm in particular a fan of Aptana so far) but there is one thing about Notepad++ that I really like and I haven't been able to get so far. My current workflow is something like this: Workflow (I tried to embed this image and it showed up in previews but not in the post, sorry) Workflow http://evanalyze.com/images/workflow.jpg The process is this: Download file from web server Make edits in NP++ Save (this automatically saves a local copy in my default directory, which is also the folder I have setup using Subversion with Tourtise SVN) When I want to commit a change to SVN, go through the local folder that has an up to date copy What I can't figure out how to do with Aptana is automatically store a local copy of a file I download from my server, edit and save back to the server. Is there some way to do this? If so, that would solve my problem immediately. Other options would be a suggestion for a better way to manage the relationship between my server, my editor and my SVN repository. I know Aptana can access my SVN repository too. Is there an easy way to commit changes from within Aptana when I want to (which means I could take Tourtise out of the equation I guess)? Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks.
