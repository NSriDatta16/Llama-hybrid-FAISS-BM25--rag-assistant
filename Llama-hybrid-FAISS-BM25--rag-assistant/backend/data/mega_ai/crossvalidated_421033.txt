Calculating percentile over time

I have a time series data and I want to calculate p90 percentile. Because there's a huge amount of data I need to split my calculations somehow. I was thinking that maybe could calculate the percentile of every day data and then , using that, calculate every month, and then using months, the whole year but ¿Is this calculation method correct? I think is not, in fact to solve the problem exactly I should use all the data to calculate the year percentile, and every time I get a new data I should recalculate ¿Do you know how to solve/approximate this problem? This problem is different from continuous P2 approach because I'm not only interested in the final percentile I want the daily, the monthly, trimestral an anual. For example, if I use P2, when I get the January percentile and continue the calculation with February it is not possible to get the isolated February data isn't? I will get the January-February. It will be great to work somehow with monthly percentiles (for example) to get the annual one.
