Unclear points on projection type and selection of distance metric in feature extraction for a set of scenarios

The following is an example from a book (An Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by P. Fieguth, page 85) on feature extraction and selection. Please consider the following figure. I have the following questions: Q1- Why in Scenario IV will the applicable distance metric in 3D be "very non-Euclidean"? The points in Scenario IV are also in a 3D space for which an Euclidian distance metric is valid in my opinion. Q2-Why will feature projection to 2D be linear for Scenario 1? Q3- Why is there only one meaningful feature direction for Scenario 1?
