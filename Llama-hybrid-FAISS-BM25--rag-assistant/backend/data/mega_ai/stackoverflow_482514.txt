I would suggest you have a look at VistaDB . It'll do exactly what you're looking for with the additional benefit over SQLCE and SQLite that it supports views, stored procedures and triggers. As a matter of fact it supports writing of procedures and triggers in TSQL as well as .NET so you can leverage your SQL Server AND your .NET knowledge.
