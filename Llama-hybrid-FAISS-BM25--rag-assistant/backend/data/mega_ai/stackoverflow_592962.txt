To store metadata in database has some advantages but main problem with database is that metadata are not directly connected to your data. It is more robust if metada stay with data - like special file in the directory or something like that. Some filesystems offer special functionality that can be used for metadata - like NTFS Alternate streams . Unfortunately, this can be used for metadata storage in special cases only, because those streams can be easily lost when copying data to storage system that does not support it. I believe that linux filesystems have also similar storage mechanism. Anyway, most common solutions are : separate hidden file(s) (per directory) that hold metadata some application use special hidden directory with metadata (like subversion, cvs etc). or database (of various kinds) for all application specific metada - this database can be used also for caching purposes in most cases IMO there is no general purpose solution. I would choose storage of metadata in hidden file (robustness) with use of the database for fast access and caching.
