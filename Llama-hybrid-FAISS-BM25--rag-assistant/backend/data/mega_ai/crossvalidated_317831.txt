This problem might be well-suited to hierarchical linear modelling, such that satisfaction is nested in activities. The way you describe your data, it might be organized in a "wide format:" Participant Satisfaction on Activity X Satisfaction on Activity Y ... Satisfaction on Activity j 1 1x 1y ... 1j 2 2x 2y ... 2j ... ... ... ... ... i ix iy ... ij The first step is to reformat your data into a "long format:" Participant Activity Satisfaction 1 x 1x 1 y 1y . . . . . . . . . 1 j 1j 2 x 2x 2 y 2y . . . . . . . . . 2 j 2j . . . . . . . . . i j ij In this format, missing data is less of a problem. With $overall$ as your outcome variable, $participant$ indexed as $i$, and $activity$ indexed as $j$, the hierarchical linear model would be: $Level 1:$ $overall=\beta_0+\beta_1(satisfaction_{ij})+e_{ij}$ $Level 2:$ $\beta_0=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}(activity_j)+U_0$ $\beta_1=\gamma_{10}+\gamma_{11}(activity_j)+U_1$ And the mixed model would be: $overall=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}(activity_j)+\gamma_{10}+\gamma_{11}(activity_j)(satisfaction_{ij})+e_{ij}+U_0+U_1$. For more information on this type of model, see Raudenbush & Bryk (2002).
