snmp agent libraries for C/C++?

I have to implement a performance statistics MIB for a linux based device and I am looking for a good agent development library. I came across net-snmp and agent++ libraries. I am looking for easier to understand and robust library. Which is the best library if usability and robustness is main criteria?
