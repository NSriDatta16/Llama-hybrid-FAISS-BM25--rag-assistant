One way to do this would be to query the command log in the collection database. Note: it's generally recommended not to query the database directly, since the schema is not documented/supported and could change in a future release. select * from tbl_Command with (nolock) where useragent LIKE 'Team Foundation (witadmin.exe%' A ' exportwitd ' command will show up as Command = ' GetMetadata '. But that is also the same command that Visual Studio makes when you connect to TFS, so you'll need to filter on the user agent. A ' importwitd ' command will show up as Command = ' Update '
