I agree with jspcal, you should be able to load quite a lot of javascript with no problems. The javascript engines in all the modern browsers are a lot faster than they were a few years ago. The initial load will be the biggest issue. If possible I'd suggest lazy loading scripts that aren't needed for the page to render. Also, Steve Souders has a lot of great material about improving page load times, such as this article, which gives several techniques for loading scripts without blocking. http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/27/loading-scripts-without-blocking/ If you're really concerned about performance then I would take a look at your target audience. If you think you'll have a relatively high number of IE6 users then test it out in IE6-- on an older machine if possible. IE Tester is great for this.
