Loading multiple images in sequence on iPad

I'm working on an application that talks home to a server and retrieves some data with image URL's embedded in it. I want to display those images on the view, and am getting them like so: UIImageView *ivAvatar = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageWithData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:self.avatarUrl]]]]; [self.view addSubview:ivAvatar]; [ivAvatar release]; However, whenever data is retrieved (for example, on startup of the application), there is a delay between the retrieval of the data and the user being able to interact with the application due to the blocking nature of dataWithContentsofURL . What is the proper way to do "Asynchronous" downloading of images? I need the UI to be responsive and load all other data that is retrieved, but load the images while allowing the UI to be responsive. Any suggestions?
