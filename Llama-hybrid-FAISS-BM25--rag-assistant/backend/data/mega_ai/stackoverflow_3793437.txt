You can do that in O(1): keep a queue of the last 50 entries. When you add an entry and the queue is shorter 50 elements, just update the total and the count. If it is longer than 50 elements, update the total and the count as well. Pseudocode: add(double x) { total += x; addToQueue(x); if (queueSize > 50) { total -= removeLastFromQueue(); } else { count++; } } double getAverage() { return total / count; }
