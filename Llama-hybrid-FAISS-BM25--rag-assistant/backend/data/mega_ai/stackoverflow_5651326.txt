Convert from HTML to WordprocessingML

I have a rich textbox that saves its data as HTML. Basically just paragraph tags and simple formatting. I need to stick this text (with formatting) into a document that I am creating in wordprocessingML format. I was thinking of using an XSLT to convert, but that's about as far as I've got. Quick google search isn't turning up too much in the form of examples or something free that I don't have to buy. Any ideas?
