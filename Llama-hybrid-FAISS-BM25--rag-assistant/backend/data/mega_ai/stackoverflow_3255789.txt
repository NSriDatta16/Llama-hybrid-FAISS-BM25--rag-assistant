There is only one way - ADO.NET for SQL Server. More particular, the Connection and Reader objects in there. Now, you may say there are things like Entity Framework - but interesting enough they are ABOVE the real access layer, using both access elements named before. Even DataSets are a higher layer (the data is read through a DataReader). So what is the most used database access method nowadays? I bet it STILL is datasets. The amount of uneducated following the drag and drop principle is IMHO still the majority, and this approach in visual studio leads to Datasets. Professionals use an ORM of sorts. Entity Framework is pretty pushed now by people who mostly do not really know what an ORM can do it programmed properly. Right now my best bet is still NHibernate for a high quality layer.
