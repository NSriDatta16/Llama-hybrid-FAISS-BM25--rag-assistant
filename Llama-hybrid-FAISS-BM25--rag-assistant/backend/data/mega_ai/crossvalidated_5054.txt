Is there a mathematical model that distinguishes between volatility and trend?

Say we are studying Twitter hashtags over time. We monitor how popular they are day to day. Some hashtags may be volatile (i.e. "lunch", "Celtics", "Friday"). Their popularity rises and falls frequently. Some hashtags may be in the process of becoming unpopular (i.e. "Gulf oil spill", "Transformers 2", "Christine O'Donnell"). Is there a mathematical model that can distinguish between a hashtag that has temporarily fallen in popularity but is likely to go up in popularity later and a hashtag that is sinking and likely to stay sunk in popularity? thanks
