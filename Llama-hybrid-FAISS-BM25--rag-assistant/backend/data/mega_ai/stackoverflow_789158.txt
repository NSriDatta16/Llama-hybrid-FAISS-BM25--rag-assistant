The #pragma directive is a special pre-processor directive that allows the C pre-processor a way to pretty much create "portable" extensions. Basically, when another pre-processor sees a pragma directive that it doesn't understand, it's supposed to ignore it. In this case, #pragma mark is meant to aid in documentation. When you add those lines to your source file, Xcode will break up your source code in its jump-to pull-down menu that you can use to jump to specific areas in your code (like function definitions or constant definitions). If you add #pragma mark - , Xcode will add a horizontal separator to the pull-down menu as well.
