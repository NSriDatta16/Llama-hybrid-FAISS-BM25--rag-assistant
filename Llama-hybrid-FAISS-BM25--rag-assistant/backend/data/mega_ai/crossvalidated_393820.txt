Out of the $X_t=j$ unsampled units at time $t$ , the number that are still unsampled at time $t+1$ follows a hypergeometric distribution with parameters $N$ , $N-M$ and $i$ . The transition probabilities of this Markov chain are thus given by $$ p_{ij}=P(X_{t+1}=j|X_t=i)=\frac{{i \choose j}{N-i \choose N-M-j}}{{N \choose N-M}}. $$ Let $k_i$ denote the expected remaining time until all units are sampled given that the current state $X_t=i$ . We then have $k_0=0$ and, from the law of total expectation, $$ k_i = 1 + \sum_{j=0}^i p_{ij} k_j. $$ The following R code solves these equations and computes $k_1,k_2,\dots,k_{10}$ for for $M=2$ and $N=10$ . expectation expectation(2,10) [1] 5.000000 7.352941 8.933824 10.117647 11.065126 11.854557 12.531270 [8] 13.123362 13.649689 14.123362
