I am getting (slightly) different results each time I run the glmmadmb function from glmmADMB, and I don't understand why

Background: We are investigating the effects of two environmental variables, temperature and evapotranspiration, on annual infection rates in mosquitoes. We want to identify the months with conditions that most influence mosquito infection. We have mosquito infection rates for 17 grids of ~ 12X12 km each, along with temperature and EVP, averaged for each month, from the years 2006-2020. We have centered the monthly temperature and EVP across years for each month. Since our outcome variable has a large number of zeroes, we built a hierarchical model with a negative binomial distribution and the zero-inflation argument set to TRUE. We are using the glmmADMB package in R. We are trying to identify the model with the smallest AICc score from all models with 4 predictors. The final goal is to build an ensemble model which takes into account the models that fulfill certain criteria, with weights calculated based on the AICc. The code below shows the approach we took: # Functions to build the models: suppressPackageStartupMessages({ library(lubridate) library(data.table) library(sf) library(raster) library(stringr) library(tidyverse) library(glmmADMB) library(glmulti) library(MASS) library(lme4) library(parallel) }) admb_fun $coef) t[,varnames := row.names(out$ coef)] t[,aicc := aicc(admb.model)] setnames(t, old = "Pr(>|z|)", new = "pval") return(t) } glmm_wts The link to the data file CV_NLDAS_analysis_1_8.csv is here cv_nldas_1_8 My problem is, each time I run this function, I get a slightly different result for cv_nldas8_glmm_ninom , and I am not able to understand why this would happen. The differing results mean that different models have the lowest AICc each time I run it, so when we try to construct weights each time based on the minimum AICc, we get different weights, and end up selecting different models. I am not sure if this a result of an issue in the data, my code, the package, or my working environment; if it is either of these, how do I solve it? Are there other possibilities?
