Taken from the link you've given: HipHop for PHP isn't technically a compiler itself. Rather it is a source code transformer. HipHop programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it. You'll have to replace the g++ compiler for one that runs on windows like mingw .
