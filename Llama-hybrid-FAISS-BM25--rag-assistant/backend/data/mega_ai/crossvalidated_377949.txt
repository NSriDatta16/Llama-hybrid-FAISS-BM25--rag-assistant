One thing that comes to my mind is PCA regression . Another thing that I myself like to use for strictly exploratory purposes (and which is frowned upon by serious people, because it amounts to data dredging) is do the reverse: test the regression of first $N$ interesting components on the variables of interest (aridity, area) and see which components have the highest $r^2$ . You can then plot $r^2$ versus component number and see "how far back" your variables of interest are. However in most of my applications, the variables of interest are truly independent, and the variables which go into PCA are dependent. For example, a variable of interest can be "sex", and the PCA variables are measurements of transcripts in blood which are dependent on sex, but not the other way round, therefore I regression of PCA components over the variables of interest is somewhat justified. If I understand your problem correctly, your situation is reverse: the variables you use for coloring are the dependent variables, and the geological indices which you insare the independent variables. However, the tools recommended in this response may be of use. Code example in R: ## simulate a PCA set.seed(321) x $x ~ x) ms r.squared) } r2 This last bit gives us an idea about whether the observed r² values are significant. But note that this is not proper significance testing, this is just an exploratory heuristic. Below is the result; on the left, the code run as above; on the right, the same code, but data is now cbind(yy, yy, zz) (no x involved): The right plot shows what happens if you don't have any PC which can be explained by the independent variables. As you can see on the left plot, we have "interesting" components 2 and 3. If we plot these components coloring by the value of x, we get: library(tagcloud) # for smoothPalette library(pca3d) # for pca2d pal So, how does that all help you? Well, you were asking for a number that tells you that one independent variable, area, is "random" (which I take to mean: not influencing the dependent variables that go into the PCA), while the other, aridity, is not. However, you can't be sure that, for example, aridity can explain the variance in components 1 and 2, while area can explain the variance in components 3 and 4. The calculations above allow you to: visually identify the components which can be explained by the independent variables; calculate the fraction of the variance of the given component (r²) which can be explained by the independent variable; get a rough idea (again, exploratory mode only) whether this fraction is unlikely to have arisen by chance.
