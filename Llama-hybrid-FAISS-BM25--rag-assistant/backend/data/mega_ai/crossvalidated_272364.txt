Frequentist vs. Bayesian updates for Binomial Process

I was exposed to bayes in college, but it's been some time. I'm trying to confirm some ideas about Bayesian vs. Frequentist updates, but I can't seem to get the right jargon to search Google. The following is a simple example of what I'm looking for. Obviously, I'd appreciate confirmation of the assumptions, but technical names for anything I describe would be even more helpful (so I know how to find "next steps"). Given a binomial process that generates A or B. After 100 draws, we have 36 Bs. Assumption 1: A Frequentist and Bayesian process conclude the same p(B) If assumption 1 is wrong (or depends on a prior not sufficiently specified), let's assume that that both agree on p(B) and draw the next value. Assumption 2: Bayesian processes can be used (perhaps trivially) to update this belief Assumption 3: The Frequentist and Bayesian would conclude the same p(B) after the draw Following from Assumption 3, Assumption 4: Since p(B) for the frequentist is well-specified, we can back into a specific formula for the Likelihood Ratio used by the Bayesian Assumption 5: The formula for Likelihood Ration includes the sample size For example, what terminology would I use to find this formula?
