Classification techniques on histograms

I have sets of different histograms that I wish to apply on them some classification techniques (e.g., PCA, LDA (linear discriminant analysis)) in order to cluster them. Therefore, what are the common and advised methods? Furthermore, where can I find good tutorial and explanations about the advised methods as I am a beginner in this field?
