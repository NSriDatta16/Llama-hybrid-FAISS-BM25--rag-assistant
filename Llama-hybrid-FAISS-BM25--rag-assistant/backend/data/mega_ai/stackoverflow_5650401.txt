Create a new view controller, but don't check the box for UITableViewController subclass. In IB, drag a uiTableView onto the view and make it start about 44 pixels below the Nav Bar. Then drag buttons into that space. Declare your IBOutlet variables in your .h file, and hook them up. For the second part of your question: have the button call an IBAction, and have that method call [myTableView reloadData];
