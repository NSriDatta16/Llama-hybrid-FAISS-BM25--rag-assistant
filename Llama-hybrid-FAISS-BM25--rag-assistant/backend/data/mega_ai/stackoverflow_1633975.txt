Algorithm to move messages from inbox to junk folder

I wonder how sites like yahoomail or gmail move the messages, which we click as spam into the spam folder. As far as I concerned Bayesian analysis algorithm checks the messages, if it is spam based on content, or some other probability. But what algorithm do these sites(yahoomail or gmail) use to migrate the message from one folder to another dynamically?
