The SD line is a didactical and visual aid to help seeing the relation for the slope of the regular regression line. $$\text {slope regression } = r_{xy} \, \frac {\sigma_y}{\sigma_x} = r_{xy} \, \text {slope SD line} $$ The SD line shows how x and y are varying and this can give a more or less steep or flat line depending on the ratio $ \frac {\sigma_y}{\sigma_x}$ . The regression line will be always with a smaller slope than the SD line(You might relate this to regression to the mean ). By how much smaller will depend on the correlation. The SD line will help to see and get this view/interpretation of the regression line. The higher $R^2$ the more the model explains the variance in the data, and the closer the regression line will be to the SD line. The image below may illustrate how that SD line helps/works. For data with $\sigma_x = \sigma_y = 1$ but with different correlations the SD line and the regression line are drawn. Note that the regression line is closer to te SD line for larger correlations (but still always with a smaller slope). # random data set.seed(1) x Similar descriptions http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/regeff.htm https://books.google.ch/books?id=fW_9BV5Wpf8C&pg=PA18 Statistical Models: Theory and Practice by David A.
