Calculate odds ratios for continuous variables

I am at the univariable stage of my analysis, and I am looking at significance of individual variables/predictors. I've tested each predictor for significance by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum for continuous variables (not using t-test because data are not necessarily normal) and chi-square for discrete variables. However, in addition to p-values, I also need to calculate odds ratios (and 95%CI for the OR) for each predictor. I was able to calculate ORs for the discrete variables using the (a d)/(c b) shortcut with a simple 2x2 table. But I cannot find instructions for how to calculate univariable ORs for the continuous variables . Should I run a separate logistic regression for each of the variables, where the independent variable is the continuous predictor and the dependent variable is my 0/1 outcome? Any help is appreciated!
