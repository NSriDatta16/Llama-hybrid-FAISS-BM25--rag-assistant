The easiest way is probably just straight CSS, though it creates a bit extra markup for you to write. JQuery would end up making the same amount of extra markup, though, with extra overhead, and would fail without JS support. h1.dropcaps div{ float:left; } h1.dropcaps div:first-letter { font-size : 300%; font-weight : bold; } Your text here UPDATE: It turns out :first-letter does not work inside an inline element in some browsers. The trick to fix this is to put them in divs, and float the divs. I have revised my markup. http://jsfiddle.net/MBZaw/
