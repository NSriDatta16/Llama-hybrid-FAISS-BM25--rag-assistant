Ruby sha512 password retrieval in php

(Updated due to some confusion over my question) We use this method to generate a digested_password, which is saved to our database for later lookup. When we authenticate a user to our application, this method is again ran against their input and if the digested_password output matches the digested_password we saved in the database we authenticate them. I need to reproduce this function in PHP for another application that shares the database. def self.hash_password( password, salt ) salted_password = password.insert 4, salt digested_password = Digest::SHA512.hexdigest("#{salted_password}") return digested_password end I really have no experience with Ruby so please forgive my lack of understanding. Thanks!
