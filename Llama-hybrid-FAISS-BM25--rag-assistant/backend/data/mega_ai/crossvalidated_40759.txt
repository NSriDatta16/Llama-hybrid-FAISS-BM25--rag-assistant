The expression would return a column vector. The value at position $i$ in the vector is the index for the node $j^*$ which minimizes the W function with respect to that particular node $i$, by comparing the W values for all possible $j$. In other words, if we are sitting on node $i$ and want to know on average which node $j$ we will go to next, the optimum according to the W function is $j^*$.
