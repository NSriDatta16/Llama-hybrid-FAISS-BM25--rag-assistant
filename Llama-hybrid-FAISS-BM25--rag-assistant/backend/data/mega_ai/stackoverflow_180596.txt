I know many people using SQL Express for production and it works well, the biggest limiting factor is the absence of SQL Agent for automated backups. To automate backups you have to either take a VM image (if on a VPS) or use windows scheduler or some other technology. The only other major limiting factor is the ram limitation, but for a small site I have not really noticed that being too much of an actual issue.
