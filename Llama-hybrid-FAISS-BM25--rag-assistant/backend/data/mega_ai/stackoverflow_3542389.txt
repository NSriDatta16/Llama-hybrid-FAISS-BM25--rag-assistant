try changing ul#galnav { list-style-type:none; } to ul#galnav { list-style:none } that should do it :) EDIT addition after comments: my testing found this issue just using IE8 in IE7 Browser mode (via developer tools). I'm not sure what version this acts as... right so just changing the list style won't work because IE7 isn't actually applying the styles to that ul on load. It appeared to work because I edited a style (any style) of the ul after load. However, you'd have to wait until all the images were finished loading which is tricky. In my other answer I mention how it works if you have an empty style tag. I've been fiddling for ages now and this isn't the only thing that hasn't broken. try this and see if it works for you: $(document).ready(function() { if ($.browser.msie && navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Trident')== -1){ $('head').append(' '); } $('#gallery').galleria(); }); That's about as dirty a fix as you could want! :)
