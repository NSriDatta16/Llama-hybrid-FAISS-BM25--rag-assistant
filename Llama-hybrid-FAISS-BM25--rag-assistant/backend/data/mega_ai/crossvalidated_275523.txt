grouping variables with several groups to a binary variable, any problems with this?

I am running a logistic regression of marital status on education, age, income, religion, gender, race, MSA, hours worked. I have many categorical variables, such as religion importance or race that I group to a binary variable: Instead of having: Blacks, Hispanics and Others, I just have Blacks and Others. And for religion importance, that had initially a ranking of not important at all to very important (5 levels), I reduce the variable into religious or not religious. I have a fair amount of respondents (6k) that is why I think I shouldn't worry. Does anyone see any problem with this other than losing variation?
