Here below you will find some suggestions, each one depending on the purpose and on the prior knowledge of the users. Just show the actual data and let the user pick up from there Plot the actual number of visits per period (day or month), instead of the cumulated data, and use line as an encoding mark. In terms of granularity, you can continue to stick with the multiple approach, one for each zoom level, or alternatively, one for each aggregation measure (total, average, min, max, etc.). Let the user configure the period Interactive displays offer the advantage that the user can zoom in and out or filter on the go to focus on a smaller period. Here is one example that pretty much speaks for itself: overview+detail based on vega.js Reveal the underlying trend to the user A convenient and okay-to-understand approach is to calculate moving averages and plot those as a layer over the original daily or monthly data. Based on the number of data points involved in the moving average calculation, you can visualise long or short term trends. At what time of the day/week/month/year does the user's site have most visits? One way to answer this question is to draw the data on a heatmap with a time scale on the x axis, e.g. months (or day numbers), and an ordinal scale on the y axis, e.g. day number (or even intra-day time). The number of visits should be encoded with grey tones (brightness) on a continuous scale. Here is such a heatmap based on vega.js . How do the site's daily visits compare to the prior year average? A simple way of comparing data in time is to transform the daily or monthly data into index values , base 100 being e.g the average number of daily or monthly visits during the previous year. Obviously, the choice of the base 100 requires careful consideration: it should be easily understood by the users on one hand and be meaningful on the other.
