How to delete a user in MSCRM 4.0

Do you know of a way to get rid of CRM User accounts in MSCRM 4.0? After some user accounts have been deleted in AD we're faced a lot of issues while importing the organisation to another server stating that there are issues with the user mapping. What kind of idea is behind the fact that no user accounts can be deleted from the crm installation? Is there any tool or undocumented Webservice API call to get rid of crm users? Thanks for sharing yours insights
