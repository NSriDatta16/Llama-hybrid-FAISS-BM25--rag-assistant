What is the chance level accuracy in unbalanced classification problems?

Suppose one has a balanced classification problem (50% of 0's and 50% of 1's). In such a case, the so called chance-level accuracy of classifier would be 50%. What is the chance-level accuracy if the problem is an unbalanced one (e.g. 25% of 0's and 75% of 1's). Is it still 50%? If one would guess each group to be 1 then one would achieve 75% accuracy. However, assigning groups randomly would still (?) give 50% correct on average. I'm using SVMs for the classification and 10-fold cross-validation for performance estimation if it matters.
