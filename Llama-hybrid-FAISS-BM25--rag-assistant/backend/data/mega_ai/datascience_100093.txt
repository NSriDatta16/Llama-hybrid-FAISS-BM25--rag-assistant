How to conclude from RMSE and R-suared value that our model is good or bad?

I used two different columns from dataset as targets and using logistic regression . Output for target 1 The model performance for training set -------------------------------------- RMSE is 8.136996958218045 R2 score is 0.5261727899306442 The model performance for testing set -------------------------------------- RMSE is 8.11008545942948 R2 score is 0.5156169844890891 Output for target 2 The model performance for training set -------------------------------------- RMSE is 1.6402023883989456 R2 score is 0.5242729273650613 The model performance for testing set -------------------------------------- RMSE is 1.4717139217150437 As am splitting data into 85:15 split getting these values as required.Before further proceeding to extract PCA components , I want to be confident that its a good fit. My question is What to conclude from the given values and is there any pre determind good or bad value for RMSE and R2?
