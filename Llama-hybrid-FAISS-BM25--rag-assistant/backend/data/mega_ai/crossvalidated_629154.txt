Consider an asymptotic 95% confidence interval for the mean of a univariate continuous random variable, based on the central limit theorem: $$[\bar X - 1.96 S/\sqrt{n},\; \bar X+1.96 S/\sqrt{n}]$$ Let ${\cal F}$ be the set of distributions with finite means and variances. For any distribution having finite mean and variance, the confidence interval has coverage converging to 95%, by the central limit theorem. Given a large enough sample size, the confidence interval coverage will be as close to 95% as you want. However, the sample size you need for a specified confidence interval accuracy does depend on the distribution. More specifically, it's sensitive to the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution (and probably to higher moments). Distributions with higher standardised skewness and excess kurtosis need large sample sizes for the central limit theorem to give a good approximation to the distribution of the mean. If you want, say, coverage between 94.9% and 95.1%, then for any distribution $F$ you can specify a sample size $N_F$ that is big enough for that distribution. But you can't specify a single $N$ that works for all distributions, because the standardised skewness and excess kurtosis can be arbitrarily high. No matter what $N$ you pick, I can find a distribution that's bad enough to need a larger $N$ .
