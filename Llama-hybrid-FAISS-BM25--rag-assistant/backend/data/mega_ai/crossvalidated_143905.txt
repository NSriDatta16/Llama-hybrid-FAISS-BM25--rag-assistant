Loadings vs eigenvectors in PCA: when to use one or another?

In principal component analysis (PCA), we get eigenvectors (unit vectors) and eigenvalues. Now, let us define loadings as $$\text{Loadings} = \text{Eigenvectors} \cdot \sqrt{\text{Eigenvalues}}.$$ I know that eigenvectors are just directions and loadings (as defined above) also include variance along these directions. But for my better understanding, I would like to know where I should use loadings instead of eigenvectors? An example would be perfect! I have generally only seen people using eigenvectors but every once in a while they use loadings (as defined above) and then I am left feeling that I do not really understand the difference.
