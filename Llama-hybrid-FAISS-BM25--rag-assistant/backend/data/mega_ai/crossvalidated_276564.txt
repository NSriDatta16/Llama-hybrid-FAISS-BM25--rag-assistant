With the clarification in comments (about "tend to have higher ratings"), I'd lean toward something like the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test ( Mann-Whitney U-test / Wilcoxon rank-sum test). It will not even require that the ratings be interval scaled (i.e. you don't have to assume that the difference between a 4 and a 5 is the same as the difference between a 2 and a 3, as you'd need to be able to take averages before a t-test could even make sense). Indeed the Mann-Whitney U statistic measures tendency of one to be higher than the other in a pretty direct way.
