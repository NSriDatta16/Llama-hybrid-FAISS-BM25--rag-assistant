Finding if the coefficients are significantly different from each other

I have a dataset which is segmented into two independent groups. I used multinomial logistic regression to estimate the coefficients corresponding to explanatory variables in both the groups. The independent variables are the same for both groups and are supposed to effect the response variable differently for segmented groups. I wanted to find if the coefficient for the independent variables are significantly different or not between the groups. Is it possible to use a Z-test? $$Z=\dfrac{b_1-b_0}{\sqrt{SE_{b_1}^2-SE_{b_2}^2}}$$ Is this applicable only for linear regressions or also for logistic regressions? Is there any other way to calculate the statistical difference, when we have coefficient and t-stat for the variables for both segmented groups?
