Organize TSNE data into grid

I have some data reduced by TSNE into a 2D representation, which shows clear spatial features. However, I'd like to format this into a grid â€“ not just snapping data to the nearest grid square but spreading everything out to fill up a grid, preserving (as much as possible) the existing spatial relationships. So far, I've only found this article which might close to what I need? This process might already have a name and I'm just one step from an easy Google solution, but at the moment I'm stuck!
