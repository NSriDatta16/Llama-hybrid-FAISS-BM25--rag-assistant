For PostgreSQL, the documentation states that char() has no advantage in storage space over varchar() ; the only difference is that it's blank-padded to the specified length. Having said that, I still use char(1) or char(3) for one-character or three-character codes. I think that the clarity due to the type specifying what the column should contain provides value, even if there are no storage or performance advantages. And yes, I typically use check constraints or foreign key constraints as well. Apart from those cases, I generally just stick with text rather than using varchar() . Again, this is informed by the database implementation, which automatically switches from inline to out-of-line storage if the value is large enough, which some other database implementations don't do.
