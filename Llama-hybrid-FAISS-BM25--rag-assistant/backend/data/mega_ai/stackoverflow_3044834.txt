Drag and Drop as Multitouch event in WPF

I´d like to drag and drop objects in wpf solution via multitouch gesture. I get two userControls . I am able to drag an item from userControl1 and place it anywhere in my application. It sounds good so far, but here is the problem: If I move userControl1 , the dragged and placed item is going to move with userControl1 . That means even though I moved an item before out of userControl1 , it is still connected to that userControl . I would like to drag an item from userControl1 and place it in userControl2 . There shouldn´t be any data binding between the item and userControl1 anymore, when I drag the item out of the userControl . Does anybody know a suitable answer for my problem?
