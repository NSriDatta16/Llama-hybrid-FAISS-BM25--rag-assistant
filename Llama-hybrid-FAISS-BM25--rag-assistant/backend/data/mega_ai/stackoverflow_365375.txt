There is certainly nothing wrong with nested loops. They are fast, readable and have been around since software development took its first baby steps. As you want to perform actions as you iterate over a collection, you may find that LINQ would be an interesting avenue to explore: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa904594.aspx You'll be limiting yourself to later versions of the Framework (3.5 onwards), but you may actually find the Functional Programming approach quite elegant. Other language features that come into play when you go down this road include lambdas and anonymous methods, which are fascinating in their own right. Best of luck and I hope you have fun on the way - that's a great approach :)
