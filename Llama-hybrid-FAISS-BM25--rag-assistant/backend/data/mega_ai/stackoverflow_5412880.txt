Are you sure img and bw_img is a valid pointer, and not NULL by any chance? The destination image must exist - it's not created by cvtColor() otherwise you would have to pass a pointer to a pointer. http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/miscellaneous_image_transformations.html#cvtcolor "dst â€“ The destination image of the same data type as the source.
