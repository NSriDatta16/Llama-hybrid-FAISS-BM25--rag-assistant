The columns of the orthogonal contrast matrix are scaled so that they each of a norm of 1. Such a matrix is said to be orthonormal . If this matrix is $X$ and you compute $X^TX$, the diagonal elements are the squared norms of the columns of $X$, which is why you get an identity matrix when you do the computation you mentioned. As for why the designer of contr.poly() decided to produce the codes in this way, my guess is just because it is kind of elegant, and it ultimately doesn't matter what the scales of the contrasts are anyway. I don't think it is for any considerations of interpretational ease.
