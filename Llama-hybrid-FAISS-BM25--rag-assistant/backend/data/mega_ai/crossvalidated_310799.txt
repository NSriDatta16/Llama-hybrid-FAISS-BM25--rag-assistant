Saving machine learning pipeline and results best practices

I've been thinking about how best to save tests I've done with certain preprocessing, hyperparameters etc. Obviously, I could just pickle/joblib every model I create, but I want an easy way to see exactly how I've handled certain aspects of the pipeline (i.e. did I do any dimensionality reduction, how did I handle missing data, which specific features did I use etc.) and what sort of results I got (in CV, on test set etc.). I feel like pickling an entire sklearn Pipeline could help, but then I'd find it rather difficult to easily read exactly what I'd done. So, my current thought is to create a spreadsheet with every step I'm concerned about and write a new line to this after every test. But I feel like there must be a better way. Has anyone got any suggestions?
