Take advantage of Flash CS4's PNG Compression, but as an external file?

Here's the issue: I'm developing some Flash web sites and really enjoying AS3. The problem: PNG 24-bit images are too big... I have three PNG images with transparency that I'd like to rotate through on the "Home page" every 10 seconds or so. Great. No problem - but instead of embedding all three PNGs in the SWF, which would take the thing longer to load, I'd like to load them dynamically from external files, so that the user doesn't have to wait around for images to load that aren't going to be displayed for another 10-15 seconds anyway. That's fine... I have working code for that. The real problem: These PNG sizes, even loaded from external files on the fly, are really bugging me. One image is 350k when saved with Photoshop - 300k when I use PNGOUT . But... when I import the PNG into Flash's Library, I can go in and set it to JPG/Image Compression which reduces the size to about 45k, yet maintains the alpha information!! If Flash can compress my PNG that much, and still make it look good, why can't I find an app that can do the same for an external file? I'd be content to load my images into the Flash library and let it handle the compression, but if I end up with 5 or 6 images, that still turns out to be too long of a loading time. Summary: How can I shrink my 350k PNG image with transparency down to 45k like Flash does when I import it into it's library? Possible solution: Or.... hmmmm.... this could be a workaround... maybe I could just make a separate SWF movie for each PNG I want to use which uses the Flash compressed image - then read that file dynamically using a Loader... That ought to work! I shall return and report... But still, how does Flash compress those PNGs so much more than compressors like PNGOUT? Maybe I'm just not passing in the right parameters for them to be effective. Thanks for reading my ramblings. You all are a great sounding board!
