Session-only cookie for Express.js

http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/cookie.shtml Session-only cookies, on the other hand, stores information in the browser memory, and is available for the duration of the browser session. In other words, the data stored inside a session cookie is available from the time of storage until the browser is closed. Moving from page to page during this time does not erase the data. How can I achieve this using Express.js ?
