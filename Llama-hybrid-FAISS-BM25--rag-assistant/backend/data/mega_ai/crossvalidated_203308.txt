You could explore recursive feature selection in the caret library in R, if you have available resources. Another factor to consider is the frequency of training of your models. This approach can be resource intensive, so remember to run in parallel. You set the function to use the randomForest algorithm which then recursively runs through all your features in sequential training sessions. By doing this it will select the appropriate amount of variables that should be use. As well as the best Random Forest model based on a evaluation metric like kappa. Go read up on the applicability of the rfe function here: Caret on Github
