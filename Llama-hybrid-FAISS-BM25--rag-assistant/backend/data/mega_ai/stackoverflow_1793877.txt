Silverlight application doesn't run. I get an invalid or malformed application error

I have a Silverlight application, and when I click 'run' Internet Explorer starts up and nothing is shown. I get an error icon in the bottom left that, when I click it, result in the following error. Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0) Timestamp: Wed, 25 Nov 2009 00:11:41 UTC Message: Unhandled Error in Silverlight Application Code: 2103 Category: InitializeError Message: Invalid or malformed application: Check manifest Line: 54 Char: 13 Code: 0 URI: http://localhost:50511/TestPage.html Why do I get this error? And how can I fix it? I have looked around and other people seemed to get this error when they renamed their application, however I haven't done this. I have created a custom style, if that might have anything to do with it. I have done no coding, all I have done is dragging on my style's controls and linked the pages.
