I don't think drag/copy magic can be done with literal values in formulas. There are a couple of ways to fudge it - probably the easiest is to insert an 'index' row above your data and do something like this (assuming indices are in row 1 and you're putting this in G,H,...): =COUNTIFS('Sheet1'!E2:E465,G1,'Sheet1'!F2:F465,2) Otherwise, you could fudge it buy using the COLUMN() function to get the current column and working out the 7,8,9... sequence from that. This will break though if you move the formula around in the worksheet.
