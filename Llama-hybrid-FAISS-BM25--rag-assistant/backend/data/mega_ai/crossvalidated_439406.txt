Using data from multiple sources with same features in classification problem

Suppose that I am doing a classification problem where I classify people into two categories as bullied or not . In such type of research there are several datasets available such as; cyberbullying in students , cyberbulling in social media , cyberbulling in women etc. i.e. the problem is same (i.e. cyberbullying), but the test population is different. What I currently do is using my features in each dataset and train models seperately for each dataset using 10-fold cross validation at get results. However, since the underlying concept of these datasets are same (i.e. it tries to detect the bullied people), I am wondering if I can train machine learning model in one dataset using all its data points (say cyberbulling in students dataset), then test it on remaining datasets fully using its data points (say cyberbulling in social media , cyberbulling in women etc.) and get only the results of the tested datasets. However, I am not sure, what is the conclusion that I am trying to make through this experiment. Is it like I am saying, I trained the model fully on student data, and applied it on social media and women. Does it show any generalisability of features? What are the conclusions that I can make through this?
