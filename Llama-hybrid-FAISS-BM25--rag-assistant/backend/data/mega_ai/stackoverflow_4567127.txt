Is it possible to use Indy 10.5.8.0 in Delphi XE and DataSnap?

The case I'm trying to update the INDY to the latest version for my Delphi XE (Update 1), so I downloaded the latest INDY10 file (Indy_4545.zip) from indy.fulgan.com/ZIP . The packages compiles successfully and I can now even see the new version 10.5.8.0 on the about box dialog, but after a IDE restart I got a message saying: No se encuentra el punto de entrada del procedimiento @Idhttp@TIdCustomHTTP@GetRequestHeaders$qqrv en la biblioteca de vínculos dinámicos IndyProtocols150.bpl. My free translation to English: Entry point not found for procedure @Idhttp@TIdCustomHTTP@GetRequestHeaders$qqrv not found on the dynamic link library IndyProtocols150.bpl. After a quick comparision of old and new IdHTTP.pas I found a lot of changes on the TIdCustomHttp class, including the rename of some methods GetResponseHeaders to GetResponse GetRequestHeaders to GetRequest SetRequestHeaders to SetRequest Along with changed public/published method firms in this and other and classes interfaces. After the update, I got a lot of packages failing to load, including dclcxPivotGridOLAPD15.bpl, which in turns depends on dclDataSnapServer150.bpl which encounters the missing method on the bpl. AFAIK I can't recompile the dclDataSnapServer150.bpl (and maybe other failing packages, I just stopped here). DataSnap and DevExpress support on the IDE is a must for my day to day so The questions Is there a safe pre-established path to update to the newest INDY for Delphi XE? If not, am I on the safe side by just parching the source code by creating the old public methods and call the new ones on the implementation part? am I missing something else or am I really stuck with INDY 10.5.7 until the next Delphi minor/major release?
