How to use GAMs for seasonal time series forecasting m

I have a daily time series with multiplicative seasonalities : yearly, monthly and weekly seasonalities. I want to try a GAM model to forecast the time series I donâ€™t know how the trend should be accounted for. I plan to use natural cubic splines with continuous time as a feature to model the trend. During inference, I have to extrapolate and I think that it is better to use natural splines for this. I plan to use cyclic cubic splines to model the seasonalities. The features will be day-of-week, day-of-month, day-of-year I have categorical features (0/1) for special events like holidays (and days before/after), back to school, scholar holidays. As I am new to GAMs, how would you handle such a forecasting problem ? Also, how can I take into account the multiplicative aspect of seasonalities ? Shall I use a log link function ?
