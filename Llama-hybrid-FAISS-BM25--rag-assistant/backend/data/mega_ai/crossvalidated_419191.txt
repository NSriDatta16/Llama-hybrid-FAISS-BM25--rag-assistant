A couple of points: The fixed-effects part of the model specifies the mean structure. Based on the design of your study and your research question, you would probably want to assume that there is a difference in the average longitudinal evolutions between the two groups. To achieve this you would need to include the interaction term between your follow-up time variable and the intervention, and test for this interaction term. The longitudinal evolutions in the two groups may be nonlinear. You could at least test for that by including polynomials or splines. The random-effects part of the model accounts for the correlation in the repeated measurements of each participant. The random intercepts models you have posted above assumes that the correlations over time remains constant. Most often this is not a reasonable assumption. Including both random intercepts and random slopes can give you more flexibility, and postulates that the correlations decrease with the time lag between measurements. You could test for that using a likelihood ratio test. When the mean and variance-covariance structure of the mixed model are correctly/flexibly specified, and your missing data are missing at random, then the mixed model will provide you with valid inferences without having to do anything about these missing data. You may find more information regarding all these issues in my course notes .
