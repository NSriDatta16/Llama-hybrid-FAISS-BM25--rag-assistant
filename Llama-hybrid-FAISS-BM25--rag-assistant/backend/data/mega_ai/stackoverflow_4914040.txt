I'd go with 480x800. As someone already pointed out, they got scaled down for thumbnails anyway, and also for fullscreen pics on MDPI devices. I've had issues with 480x854, where it looks like a strip on the left and the bottom of the picture has been removed on the thumbnails when viewed on a 480x800 device like a Desire. Fullscreen pictures seem ok though. As there are more 480x800 devices than x854 ones, I'd go with 480x800. For reference, I'd be interested on how the thumbnails in these apps look for you on your phone: market://search?q=pname:de.boersego.gmt.android (480x854 screenshots) market://search?q=pname:com.kevinread.profanitybuzzer (480x800 screenshots)
