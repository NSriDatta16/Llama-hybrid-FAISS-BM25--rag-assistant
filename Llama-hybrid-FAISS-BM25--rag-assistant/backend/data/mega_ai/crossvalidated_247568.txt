Prediction intervals (PI) in non parametric regression & classification problems, such as neural nets, SVMs, random forests, etc. are difficult to construct. I'd love to hear other opinions on this. However, as far as I know, Conformal Prediction (CP) is the only principled method for building calibrated PI for prediction in nonparametric regression and classification problems. For a tutorial on CP, see Shfer & Vovk (2008), J. Machine Learning Research 9 , 371-421 [pdf]
