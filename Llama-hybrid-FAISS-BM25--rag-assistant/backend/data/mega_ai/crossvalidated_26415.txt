Markov chain convergence, total variation and KL divergence

I have a few related questions regarding the convergence of continuous-state Markov chains. The theorems that I found claim that Markov chains converge in total variation if they are $\phi$-irreducible and aperiodic (e.g. http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404033.pdf , Theorem 4). I am confused by the fact that the way this result is phrased, it does not seem to depend on the choice of $\phi$ but $\phi$-irreducibility seems to always hold for the trivial measure . Maybe I misinterpreted the definition of $\phi$-irreducibility? Could somebody help me understand this important result? The other question that I have is: Under which conditions do Markov chains converge in KL-divergence (ideally with respect to $D_\text{KL}[P^n(x, \cdot), Q]$)? Is this known? Pinsker's inequality tells me that convergence in either KL-divergence is stronger than convergence in total variation. Thanks!
