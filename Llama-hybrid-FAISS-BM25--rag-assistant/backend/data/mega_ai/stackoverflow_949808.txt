XSLT to flatten XML hierarchy to HTML table

I’ve got some hierarchical XML like this: The names of the elements are the same all the way down (“node”), and the depth of the hierarchy isn’t known beforehand – in the above sample the deepest leaf is four down, but it can be of any depth. What I need to do is take this XML and flatten it into a HTML table. The number of columns in the table should equal the depth of the deepest element, plus a column for the value attribute of each element. The "value" should appear in the rightmost column of the table, so the output rows cannot have ragged edges. There should be a row for each node regardless of what level it’s at. The above example should be transformed into: a 1 a gga 5 a gga dh 9 a gga dh tyfg 4 a dfhgf 7 a dfhgf fdsg 2 Anybody got some clever XSLT that can achieve this?
