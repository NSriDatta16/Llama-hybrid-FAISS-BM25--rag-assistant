Avoid new Random for each instance schenanigans

Trying to get this code off the ground: Random random = new Random(); public Particle(int mouseInputX, int mouseInputY, int[] RGBBounds){ this(mouseInputX, mouseInputY, 6, 12+ random.nextInt(10),RGBBounds); But netbeans espouses that I can't reference random before the superclass constructor has been called. So I tried this: this(mouseInputX, mouseInputY, 6, 12+ new Random().nextInt(),RGBBounds); Which works, but I don't want to create a new Random object for each particle object made (performance is already an issue). How to proceed?
