OK here's my best attempt at an informal and crude explanation. A Markov Chain is a random process that has the property that the future depends only on the current state of the process and not the past i.e. it is memoryless. An example of a random process could be the stock exchange. An example of a Markov Chain would be a board game like Monopoly or Snakes and Ladders where your future position (after rolling the die) would depend only on where you started from before the roll, not any of your previous positions. A textbook example of a Markov Chain is the "drunkard's walk". Imagine somebody who is drunk and can move only left or right by one pace. The drunk moves left or right with equal probability. This is a Markov Chain where the drunk's future/next position depends only upon where he is at present. Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms (simply sets of instructions) which randomly sample from some process under study. They are a way of estimating something which is too difficult or time consuming to find deterministically. They're basically a form of computer simulation of some mathematical or physical process. The Monte Carlo moniker comes from the analogy between a casino and random number generation. Returning to our board game example earlier, perhaps we want to know if some properties on the Monopoly board are visited more often than others. A Monte Carlo experiment would involve rolling the dice repeatedly and counting the number of times you land on each property. It can also be used for calculating numerical integrals. (Very informally, we can think of an integral as the area under the graph of some function.) Monte Carlo integration works great on a high-dimensional functions by taking a random sample of points of the function and calculating some type of average at these various points. By increasing the sample size, the law of large numbers tells us we can increase the accuracy of our approximation by covering more and more of the function. These two concepts can be put together to solve some difficult problems in areas such as Bayesian inference, computational biology, etc where multi-dimensional integrals need to be calculated to solve common problems. The idea is to construct a Markov Chain which converges to the desired probability distribution after a number of steps. The state of the chain after a large number of steps is then used as a sample from the desired distribution and the process is repeated. There many different MCMC algorithms which use different techniques for generating the Markov Chain. Common ones include the Metropolis-Hastings and the Gibbs Sampler.
