Hibernate was the inspiration for the new-modern JPA. EJB 3.0 ORM ( JPA ) is based on simple, clean, beautiful Hibernate. When JPA was born, Hibernate became JBoss' JPA implementation base. So if you are using JBoss and JPA, you are probably using Hibernate underneath. I can't spot any significant advantage of one over the other. Maybe the main thing is that if you use JPA then you are using a pure JavaEE implementation. Meaning that, in theory, you could switch to a different application server and your application will still work even if the new application server is not using Hibernate. Keep in mind that I said IN THEORY . :-) JPA uses Hibernate in some application servers. RedHat's JBoss is the main product using Hibernate for its JPA implementation.
