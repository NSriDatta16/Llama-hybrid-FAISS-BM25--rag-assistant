Is there a 3D neural network and how to code it in R?

I have coded some NN using neuralnet and caret packages. But these neural networks are of 2-Dimension (I dont know even this term exists) But I was curious whether "3D neural network" exists. While searching I came across this website and found this neural network. I have a good understanding of feed forward and back propagation concepts in neural network. If a 3d neural network exist how does it work?Is there any package in R which can be used to create models(and predictions) for this type of neural network? If not can you suggest any other platform?
