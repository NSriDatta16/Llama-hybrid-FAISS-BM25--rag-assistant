Lifetime of static variables and user sessions are very different concepts. Static variables have a lifetime defined by the CLR and essentially boils down to the following 2 rules There is one storage location for a static variable per AppDomain Each unique instatiation of a generic type creates a different static variable. I'm finding it hard to write the second rule without it being ambiguous as to unique . Essentially MyType and MyType each have different static variables. While MyType and MyType share the same one. User's acess to a web server don't affect either of these. If you want to have per user data then use the Session to store the data. Session["examKey"] = theExam;
