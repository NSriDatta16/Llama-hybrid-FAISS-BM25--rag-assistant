Getting mapped entities from an ISQLQuery without AddEntity

consider these POCOs: class Foo { int Id {get;set;} string Name {get;set;} } class Bar { int Id {get;set;} string PropA {get;set;} Foo PropB {get;set;} } Now what i want to achieve is using an ISQLQuery with a root entity of Bar to also hydrate the PropB property. ISQLQuery barsAround = nhSes.CreateSQLQuery("select b.Id, b.PropA, {????} from Bar b inner join Foo f on f.Id = b.FK_FooId"); barsAround.SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean ()); IList results = barsAround.List (); where in the {????} is the fragment that fetches the b.Id and b.Name and hydrates the property PropB of entity Bar. I cannot use ISQLQuery.AddEntity() because that results in managed entities and i cannot use managed entities. The bars fetched are versions of a bar so the same Id for each row kills the NHibernate engine.
