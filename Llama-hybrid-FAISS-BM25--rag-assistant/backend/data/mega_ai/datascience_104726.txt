There are many issues, it is hard to say which one applies to your case: DOCs values are impossible to research, FCM is poorly designed and the maps won't converge or the map is too dense. These are some of the ones I came across while testing our code. We recently developed fcmpy library. Hopefully, you can find some answers there! You can compare your implementation with ours and see why the convergence doesn't work. You can use it for building FCMs, simulating them, creating interventions as well as optimizing or generating them using machine learning. Article about the library is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12749v1 The package can be installed via pip https://pypi.org/project/fcmpy/ Git repo https://github.com/SamvelMK/FCMpy cheers!
