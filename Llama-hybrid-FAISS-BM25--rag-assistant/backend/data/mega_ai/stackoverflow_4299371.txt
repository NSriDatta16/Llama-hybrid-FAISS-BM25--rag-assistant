HTML should be only markup, pure content. Design should be in CSS style sheet. Dynamic scripting should be in JavaScript code, separate file is good. Just feels better and looks better - as far as I can tell it's not more efficient just more elegant and easier to maintain when all the script is in one place instead of being spread all across the HTML. :)
