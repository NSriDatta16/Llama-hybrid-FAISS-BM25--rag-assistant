What is the difference between a regular Linear Regression model and xgboost with objective set to "reg:linear"?

As I understand it, a regular linear regression model already minimizes for squared error, which means that it is the theoretical best prediction for this metric. Does xgboost's "reg:linear" objective do something other than minimize squared error?
