HTML, from the very beginning, has had this tension between markup and behavior (cf. Why do we have an IMG element? ). HTML and the web are inexorably linked already. The HTML specs waver between technical purity and paving the cowpaths. HTML is a markup language, but the behavior of application implementing the spec is constrained. For more pure markup, XML or SGML would be more appropriate. As I understand it, you are asking why the spec isn't limited to the markup portion (x/HTML 5) and instead also specifies user-agent behavior, is that correct? If so, I believe it is because the spec does cover user-agent behavior, intentionally so. It specifies how the implementing application should behave in order to be in adherence to the specification. If you were starting from scratch today, you would not end up with HTML5. However, we're not starting from scratch and the HTML specs have always tried to balance the real world with the ideal.
