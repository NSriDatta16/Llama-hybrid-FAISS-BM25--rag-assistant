Most of the time it's OK to make the class static. But a better question is why do you have a class without state? There are very rare instances where a stateless class is good design. But stateless classes break object oriented design. They are usually a throwback to functional decomposition (all the rage before object oriented techniques became popular). Before you make a class static, ask yourself whether the data that it is working on should be included int he class or whether all of the functionality in the utility class shouldn't be broken up between other classes that may or may not already exist.
