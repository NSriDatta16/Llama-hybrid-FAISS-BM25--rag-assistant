This helped me, Thanks Darin. However, context.RouteData.Values did not have the area for me but context.RouteData.DataTokens["area"] did! also in my case I had controller that were not in specific areas (e.g. shared controllers) therefore I had to check for datatoken area to be null. This is what worked for me: kernel .BindFilter (FilterScope.Controller, 0) .When((context, ad) => context.RouteData.DataTokens["area"] != null && context.RouteData.DataTokens["area"] == "Organization");
