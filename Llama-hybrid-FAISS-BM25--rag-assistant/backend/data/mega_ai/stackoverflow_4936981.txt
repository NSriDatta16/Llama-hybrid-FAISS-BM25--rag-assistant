Remove the script tag with the draggable. Immediately after your chart.draw invocation, add this code: google.visualization.events.addListener(chart, 'ready', $( ".draggable" ).draggable({ grid: [ 40, 40 ], containment: "#playfield", scroll:false})); What you're doing is making sure that the Google Chart/Visualization API is completely done before letting jQuery handle the draggable part. I made these changes to your jsbin . Update/Edit: Whoops, that's what I get for only seeing what happens in Chrome (which does produce the desired behavior, but the dragging is somewhat flaky.). Internet Explorer doesn't render the chart, and Firefox seems to go into an infinite loop. sigh Oh well, maybe someone else will have a good answer. I still think that adding a listener for the chart ready event is the way to the eventual soution; I'm just not familiar enough with the APIs (plus adding jQuery UIs draggable) to make it work.
