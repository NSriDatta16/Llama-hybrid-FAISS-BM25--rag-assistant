Beginner needing experienced advice for important choices

I've never written a program, (although I've dabbled in Access and am familiar with OOP concepts), and have decided to undertake the challenge of writing myself a database program for home use. (It'll keep track of our finances and be customized to our way of doing things.) I've pretty much decided to use Python and SQLite, but that still leaves other decisions to be made. I think I should get experienced advice and help choosing because I know nothing about the pros and cons (for my situation) of what's out there. I know I'll need reports of some kind (something similar to Access reports would be ideal). Also I'll need (the easiest way) to build a UI. What are some softwares that I (total beginner) should look at for those purposes? And are there other tools will I need besides those? Thanks a lot for your help. Update. Are there any drag and drop form and report development tools for Python/Sqlite (similar to Access)? What about opinions on Netbeans IDE and Swing UI for me?
