Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning

I would like to implement Bayesian hyperparameter tuning in Python, but I am struggling to find a complete explanation of how it is exactly working. As anyone links, books or papers I could read about it with detailed explanation? Would really appreciate it. Thanks, Umberto
