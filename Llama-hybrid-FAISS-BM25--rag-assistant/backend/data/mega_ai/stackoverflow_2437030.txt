It's not a good idea. Instead, always map the full class and create smaller ones that you can project on using Transformers.AliasToBean or LINQ. An example of the latter: var lightContacts = (from contact in session.Linq () where contact.Country = "Argentina" select new LightContact { Id = contact.Id FirstName = contact.FirstName, LastName = contact.LastName }) .ToList(); This will only select those three fields from the DB, even when filtering by a different one. It's worth noting that, with LINQ, you could also use an anonymous type to select any projection you want without creating additional types or mappings.
