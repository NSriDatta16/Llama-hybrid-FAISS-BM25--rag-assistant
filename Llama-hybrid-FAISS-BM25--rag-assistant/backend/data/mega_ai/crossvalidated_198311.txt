See p195 of "Clinical Prediction Models" by EW Steyerberg. To select a candidate predictor based on AIC, the chi-squared value has to exceed twice its df. The P-value for a 1 df chi-squared that justifies the model change is 0.157 (which is where I think the 0.15 comes from). However the p value for a 2 df model (eg if you wanted to see if a nominal variable with 3 categories should be added) is 0.135. Other words the 0.15 criterion only applies to 1df changes. Stepwise selection of models using AIC adapts the critical p-value in an implicit way and using higher p-values allows inclusion of predictors with weaker effects, although the best results use model averaging. The AIC is also asymptotically equivalent to cross-validation
