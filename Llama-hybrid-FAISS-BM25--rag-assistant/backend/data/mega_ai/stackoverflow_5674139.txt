Rewriting Django template {% for %} into a Model method

I have existing code that works: {% for author in seminar.authors.all %} {{ author.first_name}} {{ author.last_name }} {% if forloop.last %}{% else %},&nbsp;{% endif %} {% endfor %} As you may have guessed, seminar.authors is a m2m field. Generic, nothing special. I know how to write Model methods, but im not sure how to properly loop through each author item per seminar object and apply a comma if the current iteration is all but last. Would it be alright to name this Model method get_author_display ? Im not sure if this clashes with Django's built-in get_*_display . furthermore, I'd love to support a few forloop.last conditions: 1 author name = no comma or "and" 2 author names = comma 3 or more author names = commas w/ "and" prepending the last author name. but in an elegant manner. Ideas?
