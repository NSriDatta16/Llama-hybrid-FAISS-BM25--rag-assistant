The named_scope is a rather elegant way to go, I think, but if you take that route you will want to use it with a lambda method so that the time doesn't get scoped to when the application is initially loaded. For example, this: named_scope :last_month, :conditions => ['created_at > ? AND created_at will work properly the first month your application is up, but improperly the next month, unless the app gets restarted. But this: named_scope :last_month, lambda { {:conditions => ['created_at > ? AND created_at will work every time, because the lambda method gets executed on every call, reevaluating the Date.today s.
