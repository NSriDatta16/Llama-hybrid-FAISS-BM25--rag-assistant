.NET hosting in china: IIS 7 + MSSQL 2008 R2

A client of ours need hosting for a Chinese website - in china. We have trouble finding a Chinese web hosting provider that use IIS 7 and MSSQL 2008 R2 It's for an Umbraco website. The client has local presence, so we don't need certificates from cnnic. Any suggestions are very welcome. Thanks, Adam
