It is working properly. videoView = (VideoView) findViewById(R.id.VideoView); File f=new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "words/"+videoname); Uri video = Uri.parse(f.getAbsolutePath()); videoView.setVideoURI(video); videoView.start(); But sometimes a few specific files starts to play and almose at the end of the video, it is giving error with following msg. Cannot play video Sorry, this video cannot be played This is happening only when I am trying it Motorola Droid. In the logcate it is giving following error. 04-16 11:46:12.244: WARN/MediaPlayer(7541): info/warning (1, 44) 04-16 11:46:12.244: INFO/MediaPlayer(7541): Info (1,44) 04-16 11:46:12.244: DEBUG/MediaPlayer(7541): getMetadata 04-16 11:46:12.268: DEBUG/AudioHardwareMot(7788): AudioMgr:Output 0xb538 exiting standby 04-16 11:46:14.018: WARN/AudioSystem(7112): AudioFlinger server died! 04-16 11:46:14.018: WARN/AudioSystem(7112): AudioPolicyService server died! 04-16 11:46:14.018: INFO/ServiceManager(1040): service 'media.audio_flinger' died 04-16 11:46:14.018: INFO/ServiceManager(1040): service 'media.player' died 04-16 11:46:14.018: INFO/ServiceManager(1040): service 'media.camera' died 04-16 11:46:14.018: INFO/ServiceManager(1040): service 'media.audio_policy' died 04-16 11:46:14.018: WARN/MediaPlayer(7541): MediaPlayer server died! 04-16 11:46:14.018: ERROR/MediaPlayer(7541): error (100, 0) 04-16 11:46:14.018: ERROR/MediaPlayer(7541): Error (100,0) 04-16 11:46:14.018: DEBUG/VideoView(7541): Error: 100,0 04-16 11:46:14.557: INFO/(7802): ServiceManager: 0xad80 But the same file is playing without any problem in other device.
