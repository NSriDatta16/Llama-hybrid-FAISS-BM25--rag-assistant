Asymptotic theory is an important basis for Cox models and other types of models fit by maximum (partial) likelihood. The tests are based on the behavior of statistics as the sample size becomes increasingly large. In that limit of very large sample size, the normal distribution of coefficient estimates holds. At finite sample sizes there's no assurance that a t distribution would hold, however, unlike the situation with sampling from a normal distribution. So the tests are based on the asymptotic normality. With small sample sizes, likelihood ratio tests are typically more reliable than Wald tests, but they require refitting the model over a range of coefficient values. A way to proceed is outlined in this answer . I'm not sure whether there is any built-in way to do this for Cox models in R, but I recall that SAS can do this directly. This page discusses related matters in the context of logistic regression, which fits models similarly.
