Create and estimate a FAVAR

I try to estimate a factor augmented VAR model. I estimated 4 factors by PCA and added them to my data set. factor augmented data set = [f1' f2' f3' f4' variables'] Then I estimated this FAVAR in R by VAR(factor augmented data set) ( vars package ). I couldn't find an answer somewhere, if that's the right way doing it. Is it possible to simply add the factors to my data set and estimate it as VAR model as usual, or do I have to consider something special? Thank you for your help.
