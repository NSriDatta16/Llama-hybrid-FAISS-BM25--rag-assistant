Maybe you could set a flag? I don't think that's a good option but it may work. What might be more important is the structure of your code. Not everything needs to be anonymous. Even if the callback is complex you can still organize your code so that moving lines 6 and 7 into the callback is easy. For example: $('...').fadeOut(function() { doRemoveAndLotsOfCoolStuff(); doLines6and7(); });
