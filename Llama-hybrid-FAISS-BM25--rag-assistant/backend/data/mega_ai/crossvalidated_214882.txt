Selection Bias and Controlling Covariates

I am currently performing a retrospective study that is comparing a surgical procedure vs a modified version of the same procedure. There is obvious selection bias because of the selection criteria necessary to perform the modified procedure. I was wondering how I would control for these 3 variables (all are simple T/F requirements)? Should I just perform a logistic regression for each dependent variable we are investigating and hope none of them reach significance? Or is there a statistical test that automatically adjusts for these 3 selected covariates? Initially I did not perform any statistical tests between these groups for this reason, but if we were to prove that these variables are not confounding then I could simply perform the appropriate two sample test, correct? My Data: Independent Variable (2 groups) = Procedure 1, Procedure 2 We also have multiple dependent variables we want to compare between the two groups: Numerical and Logical (e.g. Length of Stay, or Re-operation within 30 days, etc.) But I have 3 Logical variables that I am afraid are confounding. PS. I'm using R to carry out this analysis and any reference to R functions would be a plus.
