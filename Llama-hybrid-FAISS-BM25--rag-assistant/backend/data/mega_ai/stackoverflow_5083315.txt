private , public and protected are all used for declaring the Scope of a class for variable. static means that the thing being defined is a member of the class and not an object that is instance of the class. abstract means that the class can not directly created and can only be used by subclasses. An abstract method can be defined in an abstract class and means that any subclass must define a method matching the defined signature. final means that the variable can only be assigned a variable once at its creation. A final class/method can not be inherited/overridden, respectively. Stay away from putting everything in one big file. Use an IDE, like Eclipse, and it will make it easy to work with code that has one class per file. It allows you to better organize your code and encapsulate code so you don't end up in a situation where everything knows about everything. This will lead to errors as it becomes easier to accidentally use something the was created to do a different purpose.
