My experience is that in most "normal" cases you are better off having one big document containing both the post and the comments. Of course, I am aware that it's not a good idea if you have thousands of comments. That's why I said "most normal cases". Don't throw out this option right off, as "improper". You get all kinds of goodies like being able to count comments count in the map view, easy (one request) retrieval of the whole page from the database, ACID per post (with comments) etc. Plus, you don't need to think about trickeries like view collation right now. If it gets slow, you can always transform your data structure later on (hell, we used to do it every day with RDBMS). If your use case is not totally unsuitable for this, I really advise you to try it. It works remarkably well.
