This is a topic which has been addressed in the context of logistic regression using dominance analysis, a useful relative importance approach . Given that the only difference between Poisson and logit regression is the link and disribution, the results from the logit model should apply in a straightforward way to Poisson. The only software I am familiar with to estimate such a model is in Stata currently. There is an R version which could accommodate, but I have yet to try this package out myself.
