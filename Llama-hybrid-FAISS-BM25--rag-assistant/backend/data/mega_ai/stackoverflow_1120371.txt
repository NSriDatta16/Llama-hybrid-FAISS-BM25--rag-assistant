How to convert IPv6 from binary for storage in MySQL

I am trying to store IPv6 addresses in MySQL 5.0 in an efficient way. I have read the other questions related to this, such as this one . The author of that question eventually chose for two BIGINT fields. My searches have also turned up another often used mechanism: Using a DECIMAL(39,0) to store the IPv6 address. I have two questions about that. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using DECIMAL(39,0) over the other methods such as 2*BIGINT? How do I convert (in PHP) from the binary format as returned by inet_pton() to a decimal string format usable by MySQL, and how do I convert back so I can pretty-print with inet_ntop()?
