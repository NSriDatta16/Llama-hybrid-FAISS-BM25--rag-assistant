Controlling the mail client from delphi

I have an issue here where we need to control outlook from Embarcadero Delphi 2010. we used today some thirdparty components for opening the mail sending window, this worked some timeago. but now it seem to fail on newer outlook versions. are there any component out there dedicated to controlling outlook from Delphi, or are there any MAPI clients that can work as a better replacement for this. what we need to do basically is to: 1. Start new message in outlook (sending recipient as parameter) 2. receive the sent message so we can store it 3. drag and drop messages from outlook to our application. if the enduser do not use outlook, a normal MAPI would suffice as replacement. where do I find a good robust component for doing such job for me ?
