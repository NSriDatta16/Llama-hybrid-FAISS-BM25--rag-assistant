How can I treat command-line arguments as UTF-8 in Perl?

How do I treat the elements of @ARGV as UTF-8 in Perl? Currently I'm using the following work-around .. use Encode qw(decode encode); my $foo = $ARGV[0]; $foo = decode("utf-8", $foo); .. which works but is not very elegant. I'm using Perl v5.8.8 which is being called from bash v3.2.25 with a LANG set to en_US.UTF-8.
