The way I read your terminology, what you want is first to assess internal consistency within each group of variables, and then to assess the correlations among the scale scores which constitute the average of each group of variables. The first can be done using Cronbach's alpha, and the second using Pearson correlation. This assumes you have reasonably normal distributions and reasonably linear relationships. A more involved method, and not necessarily a required one, would be to conduct an exploratory factor analysis. You would try to establish which variables should be grouped together and then again to what degree those factors would be correlated. If you try this method, make sure you use oblique rotation to allow those correlations to show up. Whether you use principal components extraction or principal axis extraction would depend, respectively, on whether your variables are objective, error-free measurements or subjective ones such as survey items that contain a certain amount of error.
