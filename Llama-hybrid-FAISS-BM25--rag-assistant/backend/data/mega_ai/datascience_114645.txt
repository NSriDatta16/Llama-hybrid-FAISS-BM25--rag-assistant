How to optimally visualise hyperparameter tuning?

I am working on a basic Neural network and want to show performance of model with respect to different parameters. I need help with suggestions for impactful visualizations. I can not make countourplots as far as I understand because for that I have to define loss as a function of the parameters. Please suggest some interesting plots.
