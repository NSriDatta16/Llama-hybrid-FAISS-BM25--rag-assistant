Are your data events totally random, or do they follow a certain logic ? If they do, you can totally do things. You have to transform each time series into variables to represent it. This way, when you encounter a new serie, you compute the same variables which allows you to predict what you want. With your example, you can make many things : Let's say you have 1.2, 4.6, 10.0, 17.3, 23.2, 24.3 as input time series, and want to predict the next event. You can say next event is in 30.6 - 24.3 = 6.3 units of time . So you have a target variable of 6.3 for this series. With values 1.2, 4.6, 10.0, 17.3, 23.2, 24.3 , you can calculate many things : General variables : mean time between 2 events in general, frequence, etc Local variables : It would be easier if you had more values in one sample, but you can also do local variables : time between the 2 last events, mean of time between the 3 last events, number of events in the last 20 units of time, etc With such variables, you have a good view of what's happening globaly and locally. This creates variables. You're now, from a time-series problem, brought to a simple regression problem, where you have to guess, from a few variables, a target value.
