It has enormous importance in various areas of economic and social development, including engineering, architecture, physics, computer science, and many others. The understanding of mathematics affects students' comprehension of other subjects they take (Kedir, 2023, p. 1-5). As per the STME STARS Project (Camara Education at al., 2022, p. i), Silte Zone is one of the regions in Ethiopia, where the performance of students in Mathematics is low. Researchers believe that several factors are responsible for the poor academic achievement of Mathematics among secondary school students of Silte Zone (Belachew, 2016, p. 38). In the global context, studies indicate that Mathematics performance is below the desired level in several other countries, such as Somalia (Abdirahman, 2020), the United States of America (Moore, 2019), and Bangladesh (Habib & Mawa, 2022) because of socio-economic factors, such as parental education, family income, gender, or the quality of education. Similarly, in the national context, several studies relate the poor performance of Mathematics in Ethiopia (Assefa & Sintayehu, 2019; Beyessa, 2014, p. 1-29; Kufi, 2023; Gurmu, 2020). Studies show that there are significant differences between the performance of students attending government schools and private schools in Ethiopia (Mohammed & Abera, 2022, p. 23-33). Poor school infrastructure, inadequate resources, low teacher quality, and poor management among other things affect students' academic performance in Ethiopia (Tesfaye, 2019, p. 1-2). In the local context of Silte Zone, Kedir (2023, p. 1-5) evaluated the utilization of the Information and Communication Technology infrastructure in secondary schools of Silti Woreda found that the ICT infrastructure usage for Mathematics instructions is inadequate. Ahmed and Sintayehu (2022) conducted a study on the implementation of Covid-19 protection protocols and its implications for learning and teaching in public schools. They found that COVID-19 negatively impacted the quality of education in Ethiopia and could affect the academic performance of students. Several factors affect students' academic achievement in Mathematics in Silte Zone, such as instructional leadership practices (Mohammed & Hankebo, 2019), parental involvement (Assefa & Sintayehu, 2019), school climate (Belachew, 2016), curriculum (Tuge, 2008), and teacher qualifications (Beyene Tufa, 2017). Other factors that can hinder students' achievement in Mathematics include socio-economic status (Ebrahim, 2016), academic attitude (Byiringiro, 2024), and family socio-economic status (Naungayan, 2022). Recent research shows that COVID-19 also created a negative impact on academic performance in Mathematics (Ahmed & Sintayehu, 2022). In conclusion, it is essential to identify and address the factors that affect students' academic achievement in Mathematics. In the global, national, and local context, there is a necessity to assess and evaluate the aspects that influence students' performance and provide appropriate solutions that enhance the quality of education. Therefore, this study aims to explore the factors affecting students' academic achievement in Mathematics in secondary schools of Silte Zone and make recommendations to improve the quality of Mathematics education in the region Background of the Study The academic achievement of students in mathematics is a crucial aspect of their educational development, particularly in secondary schools within the Silte Zone.
