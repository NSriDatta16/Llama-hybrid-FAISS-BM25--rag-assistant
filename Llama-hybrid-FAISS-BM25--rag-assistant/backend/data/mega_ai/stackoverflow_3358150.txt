How can I avoid having to write boilerplate code?

Well, I've been following the NerdDinner tutorial online and I've completed it to a T. Now I've implemented a project of my own using pretty much the same architecture. I notice my process is: Create database. Create DBML. Create |TableName|Repository.cs class with data access methods. Create partial |TableName| class to handle validation. Rinse and repeat for all tables. By the time I'm done I'm exhausted and I haven't really done anything except drag and copypaste code and change variable names. What am I missing here. Where can I improve this boilerplate haze I'm in? Edit: Sans creating my own T4 template, is there a tool that will help me?
