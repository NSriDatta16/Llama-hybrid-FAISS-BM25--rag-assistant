TeamCity GitHub Private Key Access Denied

Does anyone know of a tutorial for using TeamCity with github with ssh private keys. I have tried to set up git hub to connect and I either get a authentication error or get access denied. I am running TeamCity on Windows 2003. I am running the build agent as a custom account. I am running the web server under the administrator account. I have create a key for the custom account and administrator account. I now get an error that: The connection test failed: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ssh (Access is denied) If anyone has successfully set this up please help. I am going on 3 hours into this and want to get it solved. Thanks.
