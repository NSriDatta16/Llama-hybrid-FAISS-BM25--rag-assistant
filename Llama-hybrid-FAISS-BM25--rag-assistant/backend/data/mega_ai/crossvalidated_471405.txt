Sample size required for a given margin of error in sample mean when population standard deviation is not known

I have trained a regressor to predict the revenue generated when users click on an ad impression. Only few clicks eventually lead to positive revenue. As such, I have used the Tweedie regression in XGBoost to train the model. My question is, how many samples do i need to train on for a given ad to have confidence in its prediction? Is there a way to compute the margin of error? I am familiar with computing the margin of error for classification tasks (sample proportions ). However, I am not sure how to do this for sample mean . When I searched online, most texts ( for example ) state that one needs to know thee population standard deviation in order to compute the margin of error. But that itself is unknown here. My idea is that, I can define a margin of error (say 1% of sample mean) and see if the given sample size gives me a margin of error less than this threshold. I can use this formulation to compute a minimum sample size. I don't have a formal stats background. So, might be totally off here.
