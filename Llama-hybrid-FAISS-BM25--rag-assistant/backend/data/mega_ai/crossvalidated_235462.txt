please try propensity score matching ..here's a simple tutorial for you http://web.hku.hk/~bcowling/examples/propensity.htm ideally you divvy up the groups (like you have already tried) and ID different attributes of the students in both the groups , perform a logistic regression on both groups. For e.g. if you ID attributes like "score in maths" A and "score in science" B and score in chem is C then your equation would be something like C = xA+yB, which after logistic regression on different samples should give you coeffecient values of x and y .. post that you apply these very coeffecients to both the data sets and compare the mean/median ..what this would tell us is that due to A and B scores in C went up or down and that there's no bias in the test since all students are equally likely to be administered the computerized chem course .. if this is confusing, please read the tutorial above ..it does a better job
