In both cases the model is $$Y\sim Be(p)$$ in which Y is the dependent variable. Here we model the effect of independent variables on Y through a link function. Logit and probit functions are used as the link function for logisic and probit regression models respectively $$logit(p)=X'\beta~~~~or~~~~~\Phi(p)=X'\beta$$ So it's easy to see if you want to simulate Y based on an observation of X, you have to compute p based on the $$X'\beta$$ In logistic regression it is straight forward as you have mentioned. But in probit regression model you have to compute $$p=\Phi^{-1}(X'\beta)$$ to be able to simulate Y. So it's up to you which method you like to use to compute this quantity. You can use numerical methods or interpolating from a table or any other method you know.
