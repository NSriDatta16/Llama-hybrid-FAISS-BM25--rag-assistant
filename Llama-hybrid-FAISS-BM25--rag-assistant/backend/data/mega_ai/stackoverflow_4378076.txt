Is there a standard naming convention for WPF UI controls?

it exist some standard for notation of UI controls in WPF. Something like hungarian notation. For example What kind of notation do you use? And my second question is about sequence, organization properties in element. Fot example I have this: or In listbox I have properties such as Name, ItemSource,SelectedItem, and som Events. What is appropriate to their organization. The first should be the name of the UI control, then the events and finally style properties?
