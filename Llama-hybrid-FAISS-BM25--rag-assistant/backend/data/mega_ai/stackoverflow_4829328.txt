It's impossible to get a distance from a swipe gesture, because the SwipeGesture triggers the method where you could access the location exactly one time, when the gesture has ended. Maybe you want to use a UIPanGestureRecognizer. If it possible for you to use pan gesture you would save the starting point of the pan, and if the pan has ended calculate the distance. - (void)panGesture:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)sender { if (sender.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) { startLocation = [sender locationInView:self.view]; } else if (sender.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) { CGPoint stopLocation = [sender locationInView:self.view]; CGFloat dx = stopLocation.x - startLocation.x; CGFloat dy = stopLocation.y - startLocation.y; CGFloat distance = sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy ); NSLog(@"Distance: %f", distance); } }
