You could try to build a static library and link against that. I didn't try that myself yet, but as far as I could see, libxenserver has libxml2 as its only dependency. libxml2 is available on the iPhone so you might have a chance. To get started, create a Cocoa touch static library project and drag the C files into the project. Now you have to figure out where to place the include files. This might get a bit tricky and you will start with a lot of compile errors, but to me it seems possible to get it compiled.
