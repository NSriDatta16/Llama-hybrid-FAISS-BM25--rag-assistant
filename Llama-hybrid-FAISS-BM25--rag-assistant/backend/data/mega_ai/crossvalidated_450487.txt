If we take estimated parameters from an MCMC and plug it back into the likelihood to draw new observations, what does the histogram approximate?

Suppose we have the following set-up and we conduct an MCMC on it. Likelihood: $$ X\sim ~ Gamma(\alpha,\beta) $$ Prior: $$ \alpha \sim Unif(0,10) $$ $$ \beta \sim Gamma(0.5,0.5) $$ Assume the MCMC over $M$ iterations gives us estimates of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ where $\widehat{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_M)$ and $\widehat{\beta} = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_M)$ . Assume we iteratively for $i = \{1, \ldots, M\}$ : Take $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ and sample a value of $x_i \sim Gamma(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ If we plot the density of these $(x_1, \ldots, x_M)$ , what is it approximating? Is it the posterior predictive ?
