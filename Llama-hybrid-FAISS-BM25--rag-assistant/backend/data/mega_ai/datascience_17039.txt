As @oW_ mentioned, Orange seems to be a good choice. Data Source Orange3-spark provides Hive/Spark support, cool! Interface A little laggy, but acceptable. Algorithms Full algorithm supports (based on scikit-learn). I can implement deep learning stuff myself. Customization Highly supported. Widgets & addons can be developed . Visualization Not bad.
