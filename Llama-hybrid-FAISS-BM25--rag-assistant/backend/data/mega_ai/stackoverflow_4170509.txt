Why can't I drag a tab bar controller into my view? Because only other views can be dragged onto views. A view controller is not a view. Why does IB create another "window" when I drag a TBC to the document window? Because every view controller has its own main view. If you double click a view controller in IB, its view opens. If you really want to create all controllers from a NIB file, do it like this: Create a fresh empty XIB file called "TabBarController.xib". It contains nothing but the entries for File's Owner and First Responder. Drag a UITabBarController into this XIB. Ignore the view that gets opened (you can close it). Configure the tab bar controller according to your needs, especially by dragging as many UIViewController objects (or UIViewController subclasses) onto the tab bar controller as you have tabs. If these child view controllers should be instances of your custom view controller subclasses, make sure to set their classes accordingly in the Inspector. For each child controller of the tab bar, create another XIB file in Xcode, this time using the View XIB preset. Let's call these "ChildController1.xib", ... Open all of them in IB and set their File's Owner class to the class of the corresponding child controller (i.e., UIViewController or a subclass). Then connect the views in these XIB to the view outlet of File's Owner. Configure these views as you need them (by adding the actual UI elements of the child views and possibly connecting other outlets if necessary). Close the child XIBs and return to TabBarController.xib. For each child controller, open the Attributes Inspector and set its NIB Name attribute to "ChildController1", "ChildController2", ... Then close the XIB. In your code: NSArray *nibFile = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"TabBarController" owner:self options:nil]; UITabBarController *tabBarController = [nibFile objectAtIndex:0]; [self presentModalViewController:tabBarController animated:YES];
