problem with pop up object list with visual-studio-2008

I'm developing ASP.net project with C# using vs visual-studio-2008. when I drag drop asp control from tool box to the design view then I go to the code behind I should see the control in pop up object list. at the begin I had no problem but not when I drag and drop any new control I can not see it and even if I write it manually when give me an error this this name not exist.
