In short, Single Table Inheritance (STI) is a design pattern that allows a mapping of OOP inheritance relationships to the database. If you define any subclasses from your ActiveRecord model objects, then you should consider STI. STI is (originally?) documented in Martin Fowler's 'Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture' book, and is also described in DHH's canonical Rails book 'Agile Web Development with Rails' (section 18.4, I think.) I refer you to these books because they provide a much better explanation than I could hope to do in this space. I strongly disagree with the sentiment expressed at www.matthewpaulmoore.com (linked by robintw in this thread), that STI is inherently a bad thing. This seems to be a somewhat naive view that discounts the usage of OOP inheritance. I have used STI to create some elegant solutions in Rails, but you can abuse any design pattern, I suppose.
