Is there a way to diff files sentence-by-sentence instead of line-by-line?

Just trying to get diff to work better for certain kinds of documents. With LaTeX, for example, I might have a long paragraph that is strictly just one line, but I don't want to see that entire paragraph if just a sentence is changed. Particularly if I'm running some kind of version control and a co-author edits the same paragraph (but not the same sentence) as me. I wouldn't want that to show up as a conflict. That's a secondary question. The main question is whether I can use diff to look sentence-by-sentence. Thanks. Edit wdiff is almost perfect. But is there a merge equivalent, as diff has with diff3 ?
