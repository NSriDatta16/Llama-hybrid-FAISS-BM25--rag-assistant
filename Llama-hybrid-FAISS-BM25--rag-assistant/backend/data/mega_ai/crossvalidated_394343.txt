Can I infer correlation from two time series

Consider the following plot of two variables unemployment and underemployment in different years in the US. Can I infer a positive correlation between unemployment and underemployment? For this purpose, I have usually seen scatter plots are used, but it seems that this plot also shows the correlation, right?
