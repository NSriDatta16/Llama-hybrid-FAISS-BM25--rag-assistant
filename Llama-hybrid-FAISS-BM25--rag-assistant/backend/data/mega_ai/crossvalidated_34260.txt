In David Brillinger's "Time Series Data Analysis and Theory" 1975 Holt, Rinehart and Winston Publishers page 94 Theroem 4.4.1 states under certain condition the discrete fourier transform for an r vector-valued series at frequencies λ$_j$(N) are asymptotically independent r dimensional complex normal variates with mean vector 0 where λ$_j$(N)=2π s$_j$(N)/N. This happens to be a very important theorem in the development of estimates for the spectral density of stationary time series.
