Have you ever thought to embed your additional info inside the PDF as a separate file? The generic PDF specification allows to "attach files" to PDFs. Attached files can be anything: *.txt, *.doc, *.xsl, *.html or even .pdf. Attached files are contained in the PDF "container" file without corrupting the container's own content. (Special-purpose PDF specifications such as PDF/A- and PDF/X-* may impose some restrictions about embedded/attached files.) That allows you to tie additional info and/or data to PDF files and allow for common storage and processing. Attached files are supposed to not disturb any PDF viewer's rendering. I've used that feature frequently, for various purposes: store the parent document (like .doc) inside the .pdf from which the .pdf was created in the first place; tag a job ticketing information to a printfile that is sent to the printshop; etc.pp. Of course, recently discovered and published flaws in PDF processing software (and in the PDF spec itself) suggest to stay away from embedding/attaching binary files to PDF files -- because more and more Readers will by default stop you from easily extracting/detaching the embedded/attached files. However, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to put your additional info into a medical-record-info.txt file of arbitrary lenght and internal format and attach it to the PDF: MRN TEST000001 ACCT TEST0000000000001 DATE 2009-01-01 TIME 16:44:33.76 DOC_TYPE Clinical DOC_NUM 192837475 DOC_VER 1 MORE_INFO blah blah Hi, guys, can you please process this file faster than usual? If you don't, someone will be dying. Seriously, David. FWIW, the commandline tools pdftk.exe (Windows) and pdftk (Linux) are able to attach and detach embedded files from their container PDF. Acrobat Reader can also handle attachments. You could setup/program/script your document server handling the PDF to automatically detach the embedded .txt file and trigger actions according to its content. Of course, the doctor who views the PDF would be able to see there is a file attachment in the PDF. But it wouldn't appear in his "normal" viewing. He'd have to take specific additional actions in order to extract and view it. (And then there is the option to set a password on the PDF to protect it from un-authorized file detachments. And/or encode, obscure, rot13 the .txt. Not exactly rock-solid methods, but 99% of doctors wouldn't be able to accomplish it even if you teach them how to...)
