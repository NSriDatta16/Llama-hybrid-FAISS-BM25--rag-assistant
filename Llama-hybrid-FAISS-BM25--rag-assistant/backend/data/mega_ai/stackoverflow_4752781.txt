++n increments the value and returns the new one. n++ increments the value and returns the old one. Thus, n++ requires extra storage, as it has to keep track of the old value so it can return it after doing the increment. I would expect the actual difference between these two to be negligible these days. I know a lot of compilers will optimize it so they're identical if the return of n++ isn't actually used, though I don't know of Java does that.
