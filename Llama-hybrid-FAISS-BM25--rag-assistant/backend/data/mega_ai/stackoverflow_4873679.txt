Django checkbox want to check only a subset of the list of items

another checkbox question. I have items in a list. Each item has a checkbox. What I want to do is What I want to do is to tick all the items that are a subset of items. The subset of items = client.storageitem_set.all() is items = models.StorageItem.objects.filter(orderstoragelist__order__pk = order.pk) This is defined in another view called edit_order. So in views.edit_order, there is a subset list of teams. I go to views.client_items This is where I want all subset of items to be ticked in the checkbox. Right now the code just checks for the first item. I don't want this anymore. I want to check The subset of items instead. def client_items(request, client_id = 0): client = None items = None try: client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() except: return HttpResponse(reverse(return_clients)) return render_to_response('items.html', {'items':items, 'client':client}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) # Redirect after POST {% for item in items %} {{item.tiptop_id}} {{item.alternative_id}} {{item.title}} {{item.type}} {{item.format}} {{item.itemstatushistory_set.latest}} {{item.itemstatushistory_set.latest.date.date|date:"d M Y"}} Edit {% endfor %}
