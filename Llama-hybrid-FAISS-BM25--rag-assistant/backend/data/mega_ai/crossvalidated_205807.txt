MinMax normalization when all elements are same

I'm using min-max normalization to normalize time series which I compare in the following. My question is, by definition min-max normalization is defined as: x[i]=(x[i]-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x)) My question is, what should the new value be if all values in the array are same? That is, max=min. One possibility is to set all elements to 0, the other is to set them all to 1. I could also set all values to half of the range, that is 0.5. But what is the proper approach?
