There are pretty much no cons to having them, so if there are any chance you will need them, then add them. People may mention performance or storage concerns but, in reality they will have little to no effect on SELECT performance with modern hardware, and properly specified SELECT clauses there can be a minor impact to write performance, but this will likley only be a concern in OLTP-type systems, and this is exactly the case where you suually want these kinds of columns if you are at the point where adding columns like this are a dealbreaker in terms of performance, then you are likely looking at moving away from SQL databases as a storage platform With CreatedDate , I almost always set it up with a default value of GetDate() , so I never have to think about it. When building out my schema, I will add both of these columns unless it is a lookup table with no GUI for administering it, because I know it is unlikely the data will be kept up to date if modified manually.
