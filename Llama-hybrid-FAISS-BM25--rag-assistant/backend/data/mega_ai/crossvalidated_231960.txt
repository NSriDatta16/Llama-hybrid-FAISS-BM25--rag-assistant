There is no final decision tree. When you predict with a Random Forest, the data is presented to every tree and in your example, each tree reaches a decision on Species, which is one of three possibilities: Versicolor, Virginica, or Setosa. When your 500 trees have each decided, the mode (most common answer) is chosen as the forest's decision. So the mode is the mode of the decisions. There is no mode of the trees. (I doubt that any two trees are the same, and defining a mode of trees that doesn't involve exact duplicates might be difficult.)
