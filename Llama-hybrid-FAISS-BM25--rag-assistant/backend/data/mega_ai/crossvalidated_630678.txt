Consider a model like the following for your data stress $_{td} \sim N(\mu_t+\pi_d, ~\sigma^2),~\pi_d \sim N(0,~\tau^2)$ , where $t$ codes the time (morning, afternoon) and $d$ indexes the 27 days. If Gaussianity is a reasonable assumption, you can analyze the data with the above model formulation using lme4 or nlme : m1 P.S. The previous recommendation was based on the assumption that the primary focus is on comparing dailystress and nightstress , and this additional information has been incorporated following the OP's update. Lacking direct access to the dataset, providing a specific recommendation is challenging. Instead, I offer a more general approach: Theoretical Hypothesis: Clearly formulate your theoretical hypothesis regarding the relationship between dailystress and nightstress . Define the expected patterns or trends. Data Visualization: Plot the data to gain insights. Visualization can reveal patterns, trends, or anomalies that align with or challenge your theoretical hypothesis. Tools like scatter plots, or time-series plots can be insightful. Modeling: Consider employing an autoregressive model or its derivatives. In R, the ar function could be a good starting point. Such models can capture temporal dependencies in the data, which might be crucial when studying stress patterns over time. This approach encourages a structured exploration of the data, ensuring that your analysis is guided by your theoretical expectations. Visualization aids in uncovering nuances, and an autoregressive model provides a statistical framework for capturing temporal dependencies, a common consideration in stress-related studies.
