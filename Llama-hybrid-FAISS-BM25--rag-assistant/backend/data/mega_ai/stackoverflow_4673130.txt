DataGrid doesnt display anything (WCF-RIA)

this is the code of my page: OrganizationContext ctx = new OrganizationContext(); public EmployeeList() { InitializeComponent(); ctx.Load(ctx.GetEmployeesQuery(), LoadBehavior.MergeIntoCurrent, EmployeesLoaded, null); } private void EmployeesLoaded(LoadOperation lo) { dataGrid1.ItemsSource = lo.Entities; } The callback executes, and the LoadOperation.Entities.Count is 291 but for some reason the grid doesnt display anything. By the way i've tried setting the DataContext property and still doesnt work.
