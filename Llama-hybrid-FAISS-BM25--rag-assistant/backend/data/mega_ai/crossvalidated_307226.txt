I would do it in Stata, where it's very easy to draw (and then estimate) the generalized SEM you describe using their SEM Builder tool. In the example below, I'm using a single latent regressor (built from a factor analysis of x1-x5) to explain the binary x10 in a logistic regression. To tell Stata that the regression has to be logistic, you draw in x10 as a "generalized response variable".
