If more information is available, you may wish to incorporate it into assigning a missing data point. For example, a study of players historical rankings over time, including those who were unranked for a period, might suggest a more meaningful value (derived from their average rank) than using just a team average value. Losing data is not usually the best option and adding dummy variables could decrease the accuracy of all estimates. There is also the problem of explaining your choice. Now, a select data record for assigning the missing value could be challenged, but only by those with more knowledge, which could be incorporated into a revised study.
