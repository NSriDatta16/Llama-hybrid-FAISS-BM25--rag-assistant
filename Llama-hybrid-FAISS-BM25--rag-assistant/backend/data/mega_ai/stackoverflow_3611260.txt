After fixing conflicts git still complains?

I usually rebase when I pull in changes from my teammates, and often time I have conflicts: ... CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in app/views/search/index.html.erb Auto-merging public/stylesheets/application.css CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in public/stylesheets/application.css Failed to merge in the changes. Patch failed at 0001 organizing When you have resolved this problem run "git rebase --continue". If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git rebase --skip". To restore the original branch and stop rebasing run "git rebase --abort". So after opening each file with a conflict, fixing it then committing the fixed files: ~/Projects/myApp[956f6e1...]% git rebase --continue You must edit all merge conflicts and then mark them as resolved using git add I still get the same error... ~/Projects/myApp[64b3779...]% git rebase --continue Applying: organizing No changes - did you forget to use 'git add'? When you have resolved this problem run "git rebase --continue". If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git rebase --skip". To restore the original branch and stop rebasing run "git rebase --abort". I've sort-of always had this problem, but I guess never really chose to address it, I would I always just get lazy and git rebase --skip . How do I actually resolve the conflict the right way?
