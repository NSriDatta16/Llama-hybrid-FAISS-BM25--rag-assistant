You could use PHP, but I wouldn't recommend it. In addition you will need a shell on your server and the ability to execute custom servers, since the PHP socket server will not be running from inside the webserver (Apache etc). I would recommend one of the many realtime communication servers available for Flash, such as Wowza , ElectroServer , Union , or others (just google for them) There are some free ones available too, but the quality may not be as good. Some examples I found with a 30 second google serach, I know nothing about them: Oregano , GFS , Palabre
