Fourier transforms and other periodograms are mostly good if you do not know the underlying period of your data. (Moreover 24 data points per cycle with noise will make it very difficult to gather the subharmonics etc. needed to reconstruct the underlying periodic signal.) The main advantage that you have is that you know the periodicity of the data or have some hypothesis about it that you want to test. Thus I would suggest two much simpler approaches: Take averages of all the data for a given time of the day and look at the resulting time series, which represents the average daily cycle. If your assumptions are correct, the effect of the noise should be reduced by the averaging and your actual steps should remain. Take a look at all pairs of adjacent times of the day and count the number of increases (or decreases) that exceed a given threshold. If your assumptions are correct and your noise level is not too high, there should be a threshold for which your count should be significantly higher for some times of the day. If both of the above approaches fail, your hypothesis (as I understood it) is likely not correct.
