Typically what I've done is push the data into a database table (SQLCE is my typical route). When I need to push something to the web service, I send it to the dispatcher, which in turns puts it into the database. The dispatcher has a background thread that pulls data out of the database, sends it, then does a database delete upon successful send. It also monitors connection state. A queue in the dispatcher is a little cleaner and faster, but your desire to persist across app and device restarts requires persistent storage, so a database is probably the simplest mechanism.
