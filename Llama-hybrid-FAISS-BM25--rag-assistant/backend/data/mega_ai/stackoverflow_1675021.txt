Out of four std::vector objects select the one with the most elements

I have four std::vector containers that all might (or might not) contain elements. I want to determine which of them has the most elements and use it subsequently. I tried to create a std::map with their respective sizes as keys and references to those containers as values. Then I applied std::max on the size() of each vector to figure out the maximum and accessed it through the std::map. Obviously, this gets me into trouble once there is the same number of elements in at least two vectors. Can anyone think of a elegant solution ?
