Why is Magento so slow?

Is Magento usually so terribly slow? This is my first experience with it and the admin panel simply takes ages to load and save changes. It is a default installation with the test data. The server where it is hosted serves other non-Magento sites super fast. What is it about the PHP code that Magento uses that makes it so slow, and what can be done to fix it?
