A tidy way of bundling checking for allocation failures and returning errors if so

I'm working in C++ but its on Brew which doesn't support exceptions. There's going to be lots of code of the form: X* x = new X; if (!x) return NoMemoryErrorCode; Is there a nice elegant way of condensing the above 3 lines into one? Something along the lines of: X* x = ReturnIfNoMemory(new X); I could do that with a #define but would prefer not to use the pre-processor. Thanks
