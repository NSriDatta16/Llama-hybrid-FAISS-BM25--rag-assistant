If your Apache logs say one of the worker processes segfaulted, it's not a client-side issue. No matter what the client does, it should not cause the server to crash. The issue might be related to IE8, but only indirectly - IE8 could issue a different pattern of requests when visiting the page, or at the very least sends a different User-Agent string which the server might use to follow a different codepath. Try upgrading your version of Apache. If that doesn't work, check for configuration errors in Apache, such as a bad extension module. If that doesn't do it, inspect your server hardware for flaws.
