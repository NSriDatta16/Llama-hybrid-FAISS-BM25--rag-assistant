I would approach this problem from the following perspectives . These are just some ideas off the top of my head - please take them with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, I hope that this will be useful. Time series clustering . For example, by using popular dynamic time warping (DTW) or alternative approaches. Please see my related answers: on DTW for classification/clustering and on DTW or alternatives for uneven time series . The idea is to cluster time series into categories "normal" and "abnormal" (or similar). Entropy measures . See my relevant answer on time series entropy measures . The idea is to determine entropy of a "normal" time series and then compare it with other time series (this idea has an assumption of an entropy deviation in case of deviation from "normality"). Anomaly detection . See my relevant answer on anomaly detection (includes R resources). The idea is to directly detect anomalies via various methods (please see references). Early Warning Signals (EWS) Toolbox and R package earlywarnings seem especially promising.
