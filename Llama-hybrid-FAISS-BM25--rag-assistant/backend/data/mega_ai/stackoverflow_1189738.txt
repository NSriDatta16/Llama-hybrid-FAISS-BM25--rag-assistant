I agree with Tom -- you should look into using a framework such as Zend, Cake, Symfony, Kohana, CodeIgniter, ez-Components, or Seagull. The advantage of using a framework is that they have already solved a lot of issues for you, including: 1) How to structure your code 2) How to interpret pretty urls (i.e. /x/1/y/2 instead of ?x=1&y=2) 3) Where to put certain types of code (html, php, configs, etc) 4) How to fix something you can't figure out (because these frameworks have communities) and much much more... That being said, maybe you don't want all the overhead of using a framework (it does require you to learn a lot). In that case, I recommend Rasmus Lerdorf's " No Framework PHP Framework ". Rasmus is the creator of PHP, so you know he knows his stuff. Lastly, to answer your actual question, here's how I would do it: could i somehow add the identifiers to the array too? i want the pages as index.php?matchid=9438 and for regular pages: index.php?content=matches Sure, but yes, as Chacha102 said, you will need 2 parameters: $area (page) and $id. Example: index.php?area=articles&id=2345 Then you can re-organize & simplify your 'front controller' this way: /index.php /areas/articles.php /areas/boards.php etc. Instead of naming the templates articleid.php, just call it articles.php -- this way your area name also tells you which template to use. $valid_areas = array("matches", "boards", "search", "articles", "interviews", "userlist", "teams", "servers", "awards", "gallery", "qids"); $area = strtolower(trim($_REQUEST['area'])); //if you are not posting any forms, use $_GET instead $id = (int)$_REQUEST['id']; //if you are not posting any forms, use $_GET instead if(!$id) { include('home_en.php'); } if(!in_array($area), $valid_areas)) { echo 'Sorry, the area you have requested does not exist: '.$area; exit(); } else { $template = '/templates/'.$area.'.php'; if(!file_exists($template)) { echo 'Sorry, the file you have requested does not exist: '.$area.' '.$id); } else { include($template); } }
