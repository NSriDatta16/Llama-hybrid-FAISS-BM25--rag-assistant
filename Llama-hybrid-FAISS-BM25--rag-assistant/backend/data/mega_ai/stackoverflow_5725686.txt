If you created any folders on a device's external storage... there is no way for you to call code when the user uninstalls your app. Certain things are removed automatically (databases, anything written to Internal Storage), but not folders on external storage. EDIT - As pointed out by Stephan, if you are targeting API Level 8 or higher, you can use Context.getExternalFilesDir() for your external files and those will be removed on uninstall.
