How to store arrays in a database?

I have a simple messaging system that up till now uses file based storage. Because the number of users of the system is increasing gradually I would like to switch over to database based storage. In code the message server maintains a list of users (with their credentials) and a list of messages. A Message object has as its main fields a Sender (of type User), Recipients (of type User[]) and a Content(of type string). Typically, a user will request the messages addressed to him from the server and receive all messages in which the Recipients field contains his own username. So, for the database I envision the following tables: -A Users table -A Messages table (- a table for each user that specifies the messages addressed to him by MessageID)? The problem I have is how to store the Recipients field (which contains an array) in such a way that a database query can search it for the user that requests to receive the messages addressed to him. I can see no better solution than to dynamically create a table for each new user that registers on the system that holds references to the messages in which he is listed as a recipient. Are other approaches possible? Thanks a lot!
