Magento: placing upsells in the product view page

Hi I have a custom template that I want to add upsells into. I've successfully done it with related items but am having trouble with my upsells. Here's my catalog.xml: ... ... ... ... 4 upsell 4 And here is my view.phtml file: getChildHtml('catalog.product.related'); ?> getChildHtml('upsell_products'); ?> This seems as though it should be straight forward and work but it hasn't. I've also remembered to create upsell products ;) Any help most appreciated, Billy
