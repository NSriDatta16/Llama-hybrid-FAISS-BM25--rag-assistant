Form that submits using get

Is there any more elegant and JSF-Oriented way to create a form that submits using GET rather than using the following two methods: Using normal and tags Firing up a Post-Redirect-Get. The first strategy does it ok with only one GET request, but I don't know if there is a better way to do. I'm going with normal and so far. Obs: BalusC expose those two known methods here .
