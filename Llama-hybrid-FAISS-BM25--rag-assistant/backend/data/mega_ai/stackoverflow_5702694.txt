I don't know that there is a "standard" for serializing and serializng CustomActionData. There are a couple libraries out there though. If you happen to be using C# DTF custom actions there is a CustomActionData class that can serialize and deserialize the property collection for you. Otherwise you pretty much come up with your own pattern like: /PROPERTYA=VALUEA /PROPERTYB=VALUEB or PROPERTYA=VALUEA;PROPERTYB=VALUEB Or even an XML fragment like VALUEA VALUEB The point is to serialize and deserialize so that it can be available to your deferred CA.
