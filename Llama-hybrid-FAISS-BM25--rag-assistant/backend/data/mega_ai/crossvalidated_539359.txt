You play a coin flip game with your friend, but you know that your friend somehow tends to toss heads almost every time. So, you can say something like "Ha I know my friend (prior belief), he always tosses heads, so the probability of him toss heads again will be somewhere between $[0.7,0.9]$ ", i.e. $\theta$ can be whatever value you want inside that interval. A natural way for saying that in a probabilistic language, that the probability of success (for your friend) lies inside $[0.7,0.9]$ is to let $\theta$ be a random variable. Now that $\theta$ is a random variable you can assign it a distribution. But your distribution has to reflect your prior belief, that the probability of success for your friend will be inside the interval $[0.7,0.9]$ . A good choice for distribution for $\theta$ would be a $Beta(a,b)$ distribution (as it takes values inside $[0,1]$ where probabilities also do). However, this $Beta(a,b)$ distribution must give more attention to values inside $[0.7-0.9]$ which is your prior belief right, that your friend always toss heads. To do that you can center the distribution around $0.8$ which is the midpoint of the interval $[0.7-0.9]$ You can do that by solving $\frac{a}{a+b}=0.8$ a potential solution for that can be choosing $a=10$ and then $b=2.5$ . So, $\pi(\theta)= Beta(\theta;10,2.5)$ reflect your prior belief about the success probability of your friend that lies inside the interval $[0.7-0.9]$ . Now if you want to say something about as $n$ (the number of samples tends to infinity) then check that the mean of the posterior is $$Mean = \frac{a+\sum x}{a + \sum x + b +n - \sum x} = \frac{a}{b+n} + \frac{\sum x}{b+n}$$ where for $n\rightarrow \infty$ , the mean of your posterior belief $\pi(\theta|x)$ goes to $\bar{x}$
