It's a fairly open question, and the answer is equally as open: Every guideline should cost less to implement than the benefit it brings. Be careful, because each side of the equation has some hidden parts. The cost of implementation can include excluding perfectly good alternatives, stifling creativty and innovation, and encouraging code reviews to degenerate into highlighting minor infractions of the style rather than addressing real issues. The value of the benefits may be intangible (and hence frustrating) to a busy developer in a hurry, but might result in your organizations brand being stronger or bringing new staff onto the project being faster - something that might outweigh the small incremental cost of complying.
