Any model selection procedure will affect the standard errors and this is hardly ever accounted for. For example, prediction intervals are computed conditionally on the estimated model and the parameter estimation and model selection are usually ignored. It should be possible to bootstrap the whole procedure in order to estimate the effect of the model selection process. But remember that time series bootstrapping is trickier than normal bootstrapping because you have to preserve the serial correlation. The block bootstrap is one possible approach although it loses some serial correlation due to the block structure.
