Edit (The same idea was proposed by Stephan Kolassa a few minutes before I posted my answer. The answer below can still give you some relevant details.) You could use seasonal dummies. For simplicity I illustrate this for a quarterly time series. Seasonal dummies are indicator variables for each season. The $i$-th seasonal dummy takes on the value 1 for those observations related to season $i$ and 0 otherwise. For a quarterly series the seasonal dummies, $SD$, are defined as follows: \begin{eqnarray} SD = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right] \quad SDB = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} B_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & B_{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & B_{3} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & B_{4} \\ B_{5} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ B_{n-3} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & B_{n-2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & B_{n-1} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & B_{n} \\ \end{array} \right] \end{eqnarray} You can multiply each column in $SD$ by your explanatory variable $B_t$ and get the matrix $SDB$ defined above. Then, you can specify your model as follows: $$ G_t = Z_t + \beta_{0,s} SD_t + \beta_{1,s} SDB_t \,, $$ where the index $s$ indicates the season. Observe that we now have four coefficients (12 in your monthly series) $\beta_{1,s}$, one for each column in $SDB$. The same for the intercept $\beta_0$ except that we must remove one column in $SD$ in order to avoid perfect collinearity. In a monthly series you would include for example the first 11 seasonal intercepts in $SD$. Fitting the model for example by maximum likelihood will give you one coefficient estimate for each season. You could also test whether $\beta_{0,s}$ are the same for all $s$ or similarly if $\beta_{1,s}$ are constant across seasons.
