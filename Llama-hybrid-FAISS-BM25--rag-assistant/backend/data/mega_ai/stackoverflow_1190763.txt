Firefox not running jQuery for XHTML output

Okay, I did a crappy job of describing the issue in my previous post. I think the discussion got sidetracked from the core issue - so I'm going to try again. Mea Culpa to Elzo Valugi about the aforementioned thread. I have an XML file: Hi Simple enough. I also have a stylesheet to create XHTML output: FF-JS-XHTML WTF Last but not least, I have the following jQuery in toto (wtf.js, from the script tag in the stylesheet): $(function() { alert('Hiya!'); $(' Hello ').appendTo('body'); }); Extremely simple, but sufficient for the demonstration. When I run this in Internet Explorer, I get the alert 'Hiya!' as well as the expected: Hi Hello but when I run it in Firefox (3.0.1), I still get the alert, but the jQuery does not insert the paragraph into the DOM, and I just get this: Hi If I change the stylesheet to method="html" it works fine, and I get (along with the alert): Hi Hello Why doesn't Firefox run the jQuery with an XHTML document? Has anyone any experience with this problem? EDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO I can successfully insert elements into the documents this way in Firefox (method="xml"): var frag = document.createDocumentFragment(); var p = document.createElement('p'); p.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Ipsum Lorem')); frag.appendChild(p); $('body').append(frag); but I'm running into a similar problem with the .remove() method. It is looking more and more that Firefox doesn't construct a DOM from XML that jQuery can relate to, or somesuch.
