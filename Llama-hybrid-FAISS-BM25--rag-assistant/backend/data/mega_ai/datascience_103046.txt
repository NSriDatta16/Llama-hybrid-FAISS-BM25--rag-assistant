why categories are converted to numeric values? Its due to the simple fact that the most machine learning models do not accept categorical values to perform prediction. For this reason its Yes, for this reason there are some techniques(like SMOTE) to ensure the data is rightly balanced. You can also opt for other metrics like F1 score which works for imbalanced data. Its ideal to clean and replace prior training the model(your example of toyota falls under automotive category) Few Techniques to remember while dealing with imbalanced text data remove duplicate data: ensuring duplicates of texts with same semantic meaning (eg: where is my product and where is the product is one and the same) Merge minority classes resampling Dataset undersampling majority class oversampling minority class(like SMOTE) Data Augmentation(using spacy, space_wordnet, word embeddings
