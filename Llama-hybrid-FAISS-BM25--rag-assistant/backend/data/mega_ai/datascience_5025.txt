For such questions, I like to go to the Task Views on CRAN, since the packages noted there are, to a degree, pre-vetted by the R community. I'd trust those a tiny bit more than just googling myself. The Machine Learning Task View at CRAN says: Packages rgp and rgenoud offer optimization routines based on genetic algorithms. The package Rmalschains implements memetic algorithms with local search chains, which are a special type of evolutionary algorithms, combining a steady state genetic algorithm with local search for real-valued parameter optimization.
