What I've done before is set the "W3" option rather than "Wall" then in each of my own source .cpp files I put #pragma warning(push, 4) at the top AFTER all the "#include..." lines and then #pragma warning(pop) as the very last line of the file. This way you get level 4 warnings in your code and level 3 in 3rd party code that you can't do anything about.
