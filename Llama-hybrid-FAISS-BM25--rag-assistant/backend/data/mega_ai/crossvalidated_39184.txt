First of all, Monte Carlo methods are not intended just for estimation of integrals. It is intended to sample random variables from distribution and the "by product" is aproximation of integrals. The reason behind the Markov chains is that MCMC methods/algorithms, e.g. Metropolis-Hastings produce a Markov Chain which has stationary distribution exactly the same from which you desire to obtain random draws. And the beauty of MCMC is that you can have your distribution just up to a normalizing constant. And the desire to obtain random samples from your distribution is not confined just to obtain estimates of expectation or variance.
