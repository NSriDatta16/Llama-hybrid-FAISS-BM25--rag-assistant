Making Infragistics UltraGrid Columns have "Spring" Behaviour

Oout of the box the Infragistics UltraGrid control allows you to make the last column in a grid spring to fill the remaining unused portion of the grids bounding rectangle. ____________________________ | Col1 | Col 2 | Col 3---->| | | I have searched but cannot find a method of making a column that is not the end column spring to fill the width. For example, a row that has a text description followed by a column that contains a button to perform some action. You want the text description to take most of the width, and have the column with the button butt up to the end of the grid's bounding rectangle. __________________________________ | Text Col ------------>| Button | | | Has anyone got any experience of attempting to get the UltraGrid control to do this out of the box, or some hack to make it work?
