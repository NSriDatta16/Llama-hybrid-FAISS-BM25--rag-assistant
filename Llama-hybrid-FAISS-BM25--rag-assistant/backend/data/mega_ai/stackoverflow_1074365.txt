How do I get number of fields in JavaScript object?

I'm trying to use JavaScript object as an associative array and everything was well until I needed to get number of entries that are stored in it. What is the easiest and most elegant way to do that? All I can think of is to run for each loop or jQuery $.each function and just see how much iterations it would do but that looks like an an awful thing to do.
