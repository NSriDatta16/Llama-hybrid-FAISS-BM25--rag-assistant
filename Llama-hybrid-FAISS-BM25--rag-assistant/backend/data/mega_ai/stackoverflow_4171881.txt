Why does Html.DisplayFor and .ToString("C2") not respect CurrentUICulture?

In my ASP.MVC 2.0 website I have the following setting in web.config: When I try to display an amount in a view using Html.DisplayFor() or ToString("C2") I expected to get "kr. 3.500,00" (uiCulture) and not "$3,500.00" (culture). posting.Amount)%> If I explicit uses CurrentUICulture info it works as expected, but I don't want to do that everytime I need to display a number, date or decimal. And I also like to use DisplayFor, which doesn't support the IFormatProvider parameter. How can I change the formatting, without changing the culture of the system? This is running in Azure, and if I change the culture to "da-DK" all decimal points are lost, when saving to Azure Table storage! #BUG
