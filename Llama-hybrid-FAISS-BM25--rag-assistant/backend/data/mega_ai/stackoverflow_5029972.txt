Why do I have to add the server SSL certificate if my client program is in Java and not when it is in C#?

If I use HttpsURLConnection in a Java program and try to open an URL starting with https:// I'll get an error message: unable to find valid certification path to requested target and the solution I found is to add the server certificate to the client certificate storage . But if I write a C# program that uses HttpWebRequest then I don't have to add anything anywhere. So for me it looks like a C# client "just works" and a Java client only works after being tweaked with a hammer. Why is an extra step required for a Java client? Can I somehow skip saving the certificate to the client storage of JVM?
