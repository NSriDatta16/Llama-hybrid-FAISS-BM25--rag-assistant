Regex Question: Matching this pattern with hard or soft quotes

I have this anchor locating regex working pretty well: $p = '% (?:.*) %im'; It matches followed by zero or more of anything followed by a space and name=" It is grabbing the names even if a class or an id precedes the name in the anchor. What I would like to add is the ability to match on name=' with a single quote (') as well since sooner or later someone will have done this. Obviously I could just add a second regex written for this but it seems inelegant. Anyone know how to add the single quote and just use one regex? Any other improvements or recommendations would be very welcome. I can use all the regex help I can get! Thanks very much for reading, function findAnchors($html) { $names = array(); $p = '% (?:.*) %im'; $t = preg_match_all($p, $html, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER); if ($matches) { foreach ($matches as $m) { $names[] = $m[1]; } return $names; } }
