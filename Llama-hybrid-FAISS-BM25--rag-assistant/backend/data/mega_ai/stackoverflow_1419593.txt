On the local disk volume requirement Do not take local too literally. While it is indeed a requirement that MSSQL should "see" the filegroup(s) associated with FILESTREAM data as local drives, this storage is often supplied by way of NAS or other storage technologies which trick Windows into thinking these are local NTFS disks (by way of iSCSI and such). This is particularly true with enterprise applications, with the level of space requirement you mention. On using FILESTREAM at all... Do weigh the pros and cons carefully. Your question mentions rather big (MB-size) images (I'm assuming graphic images, not logic images of sorts), which implies a rather atomic use of them. A file server setup would require external (to SQL server) management and synchronization, but this seems to be a relatively small cost to pay to keep your freedom, not so much vis-a-vis SQL Server / Microsoft, but also your ability to move things around more easily for scaling / bandwidth purposes.
