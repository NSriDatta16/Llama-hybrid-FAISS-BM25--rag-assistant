Why is the current version of Eclipse called Galileo?

It's silly, but I've been wondering about this for some time. Eclipse 3.2 was Callisto, 3.3 was Europa, and 3.4 was Ganymede, so why wasn't 3.5 Io instead of Galileo? Was it the risk of being confused with I/O? On a related note, it looks like 3.6 will be called Helios. How did we wind up there instead of moving to, say, moons of Saturn? I just wondered if anybody knew the answer. Thanks!
