You might want to pursue http://autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog/entry/will-we-make-the-month-qtargetq-number as it deals with your kind of question. If you post your daily data in a csv file and define what the data is and define your target # I will try and make sense of it. I answered a similar question ( at least similar to me !) here Confidence Interval derivation and received a down vote without any explanation or reflection. It is, at least to me, kind of counter-productive not to explain why the down vote thus consequently not providing positive feedback or a viable way forward. You might consider re-titling your question in the spirit of my initial comment as your problem should have more of a spotlight and get more attention.
