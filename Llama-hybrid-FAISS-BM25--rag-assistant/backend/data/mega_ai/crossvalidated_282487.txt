Predict continuous variable from factor variables and dates/time series

I would like to know the best way, and ideally also less optimal ways, to predict, for "next week", the health index (outc_health_index) of subjects (subject_id), based on daily data (date) on whether they have gone jogging or not (pred_went_jogging) and on whether they did meditation or not (pred_did_meditation) I am stuck at the very beginning, before statistics and coding, I do not know whether I can ignore the dates and so avoid getting into time series that I do not well and would avoid if possible. (Note that this is an exercise to get back in contact with statistic&C so I have some freedom) These are the data set.seed(1000); N head(df, n=3) subject_id pred_went_jogging pred_did_meditation date outc_health_index 1 3 1 0 2001-06-05 0.9182955 2 6 0 0 2001-06-07 0.7304148 3 1 0 1 2001-06-19 -1.6822627
