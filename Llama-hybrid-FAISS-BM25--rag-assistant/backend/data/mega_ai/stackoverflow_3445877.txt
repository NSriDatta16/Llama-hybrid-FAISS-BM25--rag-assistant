It does no seems to sort by date and its giving me back a lump of code I need to be sorted by date and been able to manipulate data so I can put them in table rows. Like this. 110 2009-10-15 100 2010-10-15 130 2008-10-15 No , the code (if it were correct) would output the string value of one of the New or Previous elements with maximum date . Here is the main problem in your code : the msxsl:node-set() extension function returns a document tree -- not a top element or an XML fragment. To put it in other words, it returns the root node: / of this document tree. Therefore, the above selects a single node only , and this node has children that are only New or Previous elements. Therefore, there is no sort, because the result of sorting a single node is always this same node. Then later in the code: Because . is the root node of the temporary tree, the above xslt instruction produces the string value of the whole temporary tree -- that is, the concatenation, in document order, of all text nodes in this temporary tree. This is exactly what you complain of getting. Solution : Replace : with : Now, the select attribute of xsl:for-each selects all New and Previous top elements in the tree, as obviously was desired.
