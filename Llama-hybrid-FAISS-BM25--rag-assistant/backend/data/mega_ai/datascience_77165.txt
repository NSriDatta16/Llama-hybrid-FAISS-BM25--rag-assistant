How to analyse the results of cross-validation do determine overfitting

I performed k-fold CV and measured the resulting average error (RMSE) for each fold. This was done with 5 folds, and 4 of the measurements gave similar errors (between 10% and 12%), but one of the tests has given a 4% error. What can be concluded in regards to overfitting in this experiment? Is the model overfitted because it works much better in one of the situations than in the others? Thanks.
