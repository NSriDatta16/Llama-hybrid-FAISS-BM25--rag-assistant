If you just want to say what proportion of men vs. women are likers (or something similar) you can do it straight from the table: 10/40 men are likers, 3/31 women are. You could then run a test of equality of proportions on these two proportions. If, on the other hand, you want to answer all the questions you asked in your text, and treat one variable as independent, then you want ordinal logistic regression. This would also allow you to control for any other variables. However, your title question isn't well posed: With a 2-group independent variable, the influences are, by necessity, equal (and opposite). EDIT: Here is how you would do it in SAS data liking; input sex $ liking $ count; datalines; M 3 10 F 3 3 M 2 20 F 2 20 M 1 10 F 1 9 ; run; proc logistic data = liking; class sex; model liking = sex; freq count; run; and sex is not significant at p = 0.05. Its odds ratio is 1.69 with a 95% CI of 0.682 to 4.198.
