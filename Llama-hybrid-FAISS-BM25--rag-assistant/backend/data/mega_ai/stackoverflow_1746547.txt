No, it's not scientifically or otherwise proven. To "prove" it would mean either: To demonstrate its validity from an analytical point of view. To show that it works in practice and then infer its validity An analytical approach is unfeasible, since we are dealing with people here rather than simple systems. You cannot formalise teams and organisations. Empirical studies, on the other hand, have been conducted, but the outcomes are unconclusive. Robert Glass shows some interesting results in his book Software Creativity 2.0, for example. So no, agile is not proven. Not even close. :-)
