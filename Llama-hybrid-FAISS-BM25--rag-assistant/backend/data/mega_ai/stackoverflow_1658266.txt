On 32 bit platforms an int is 32 bits long which is 4 bytes of 8 hexadecimal digits. So E_FAIL would be 0x80004005 , (which is what the code you pasted shows. If you dump this value on a 64 bit machine then it'll take up twice as much storage and since numbers are sign extended and the leading 8 (binary 100 ) means the sign bit is 1 then it's ones all the way. 1111 in binary is F in hex which brings all the F s you see.
