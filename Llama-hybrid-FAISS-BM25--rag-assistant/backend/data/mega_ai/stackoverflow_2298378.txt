While I cannot, even from my own organization provide direct metrics, the tool provides a wealth of assistance and hints for developers. It will also, when properly used, help an organization have more consistent code following the organizations code standards.

Aside from that aspect, once developers become more proficient in its use, it has a great number navigational features that allow them to quickly zip through code.
