I don't know who the Bayesians are (although I suppose I should have a prior distribution for that), but I do know who they are not. To quote the eminent, now departed Bayesian, D.V. Lindley, "there is no one less Bayesian than an empirical Bayesian". Empirical Bayes section of Bayesian Methods: A Social and Behavioral Sciences Approach, Second Edition by Jeff Gill . Meaning I suppose that even "Frequentists" think about what model makes sense (choice of a model form in some sense constitutes a prior), as opposed to empirical Bayesians who are totally mechanical about everything. I think that in practice there is not that much difference in the results of statistical analysis performed by top echelon Bayesians and Frequentists. What is scary is when you see a low quality statistician who tries to rigidly pattern himself (never observed it with a female) after his ideological role model with absolute ideological purity, and approach analysis exactly as he thinks his role model would, but without the quality of thought and judgment the role model has. That can result in very bad analysis and recommendations. I think ultra-hard core, but low quality, ideologs are much more common among Bayesians than Frequentists. This particularly applies in Decision Analysis.
