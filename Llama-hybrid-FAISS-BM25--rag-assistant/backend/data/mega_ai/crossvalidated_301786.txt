i would assume so BUT as to precisely what that would be might require some mathematics . In general the pearson (ordinary) cross-correlation coefficient is only interpretable under very strict requiremnents viz. each series by itself is gaussian. The impact of alternative scenarios can be evaluated by actually constructing alternative series. You might want to look at Finding correlations between financial time series .
