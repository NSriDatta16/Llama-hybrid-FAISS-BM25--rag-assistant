What is the difference between model hyperparameters and model parameters?

I have noticed that such terms as model hyperparameter and model parameter have been used interchangeably on the web without prior clarification. I think this is incorrect and needs explanation. Consider a machine learning model, an SVM/NN/NB based classificator or image recognizer, just anything that first springs to mind. What are the hyperparameters and parameters of the model? Give your examples please.
