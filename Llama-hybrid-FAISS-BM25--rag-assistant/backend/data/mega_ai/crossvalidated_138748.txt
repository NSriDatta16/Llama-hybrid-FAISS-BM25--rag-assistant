How to handle changing input vector length with neural networks

I want to train a neural network with a sequence of character as an input vector. Learning examples have different length and for this reason I don't know how to represent them. Let's say I have two examples of sequences, here names: john doe maurice delanoe First example is of length 8, second is of length 15. Is there a way to learn of both these examples ? Meaning to use both an input vector of size 8 and 15 in the same learning system. Thanks for your help !
