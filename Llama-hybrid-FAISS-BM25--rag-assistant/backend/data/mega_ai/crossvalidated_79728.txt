Logistic regression with few observations

I suppose regression analysis with few observations has some peculiarities. Here are results for my logistic regression. $R^2_{\rm LR}$ = 0.7, Number of 1 = 6 (4 predicted), Number of 0 = 78 (all predicted) Is it good-fitting? If the number of observation is 10 times higher I would have on doubt but here I'd like to ask for an expert's opinion.
