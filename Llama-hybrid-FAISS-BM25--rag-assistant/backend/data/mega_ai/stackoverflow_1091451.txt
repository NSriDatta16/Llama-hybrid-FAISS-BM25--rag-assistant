I got stuck up when I tried to run the Unit Test written using mbunit from NAnt. when I tried this lines of code in NAntbuilder. I got an error message BUILD FAILED ./.../mbunit.build(26,5): Invalid element . Unknown task or datatype. I have copied the mbunit.framework.dll, quickgraphalgorithm.dll,quickgraph.dll to NAnt's bin folder. Could you please any of you help me out to run the mbunit test from NAnt. Thanks in Advance, Ganesh
