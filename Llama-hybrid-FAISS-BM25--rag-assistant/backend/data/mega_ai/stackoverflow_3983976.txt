The disadvantage is that you can't enforce referential integrity in the database between the accountID in the accounts table and the accountID in the bids table (which I assume represents the accountID of the provider bidding on the order) because not all accountID values are allowable. But, don't give up on the single-table solution for accounts, which may well be the correct one for your problem (I can't say for sure not completely understand the relation between providers and customers). Here's what you need to do to both use the single table solution and allow referential integrity: Remove isProvider and isCustomer from Accounts. Add two new tables Providers and Customers. Each table will have an accountID column which is both the primary key in that table and a foreign key back to the original account table. Migrate any additional columns from Accounts that are unique to either Providers or Customers into the appropriate table. Now, the accountID in the Orders table should be a foreign key into Customers, not Accounts. Similarly, the accountID column in Bids becomes a foreign key into Providers rather than Accounts. Relational integrity and single-table storage for accounts is provided for.
