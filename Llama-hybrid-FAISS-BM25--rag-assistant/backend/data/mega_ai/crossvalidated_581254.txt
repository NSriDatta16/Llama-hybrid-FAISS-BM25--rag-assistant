The answer from @Eoin gets to the heart of the matter. One models marginal, population-level values while the other models conditional, subject-level values. Here are a few additional suggestions, drawing from the McNeish et al. paper recommended by @Noah in a comment, " On the unnecessary ubiquity of hierarchical linear modeling ," Psychological Methods 22: 114â€“140 (2017), and Chapter 7 of Frank Harrell's course notes and book , on modeling longitudinal responses. First, your concern about a highly influential point leading to bias is an issue in all regression. If some unmodeled characteristic leads to an individual with "particularly high values of the response variable (Y) for a given predictor" in standard linear regression with equal numbers of observations per individual, you have a similar problem. The fundamental assumption is that the regression model is capturing the associations of predictors with outcome, plus an error term to be estimated from the model in least squares or set by the family in a generalized linear model. If that assumption isn't met, then an individual with an unmodeled extra association with outcome could lead to undue influence on the coefficient estimates. Whether that ends up being more or less of an issue with multiple measurements per subject has to do with the relative number of observations associated with the subject. Checking influence is important, regardless. Second, a hierarchical model doesn't necessarily avoid that problem. Remember that a strength of multi-level modeling is its partial pooling of observations among cases to obtain its estimates--cases with more observations contribute more to the model. If the high response value Y of an individual is due to an individually high slope with respect to predictor X but you only model random intercepts, you have much the same problem. Third, a working independence model followed by robust standard errors isn't the only way to deal with repeated measures outside of a mixed linear regression model. Generalized least squares , unlike a working independence model, can provide best linear unbiased estimates with correlated observations, provided that you specify the correct correlation structure. The coefficient estimates will in general differ from those under a working independence assumption. Harrell discusses this in his chapters on longitudinal modeling and includes a helpful summary table of strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. Although generalized least squares doesn't work other than with linear regression, the McNeish et al paper nicely outlines the approach of generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, which can start with several choices of initial correlation structure and iteratively account for correlations in the broader context of generalized linear models. So there are several valid approaches, beyond mixed models or working independence followed by robust standard errors, for dealing with multiple measurements per subject. They are appropriate choices when the primary focus is on marginal, population-average effects and there isn't a multi-level hierarchy.
