Using a moving average for a time series with trend may be approprite but is inconsistent with the claim of stationarity. If you have a trend themean is changing with time and the series is non-statistionary. The moving average model is a special form of an ARIMA model namely IMA(1,1). If you have a linear trend taking a first difference could make the residual series stationary. My suggestion is to fit the more general ARIMA models and pick the one that fits best which may or may not be exponential smoothing (i.e. a simple first order moving average).
