Silverlight ObservableCollection v. Reactive Extensions for .NET (Rx)

I figure I'm missing something here but I was just reading this article by jesse liberty regarding Reactive Extensions for .Net . His example is for Window Phone 7 using Silverlight, but Silverlight also has an ObservableCollection data type. So I'm trying to figure out what the difference ... perhaps the Rx is more powerful? Can anyone compare and contrast these? When would I use one over the other? Thanks
