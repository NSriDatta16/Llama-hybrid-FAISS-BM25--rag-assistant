How much that is too much is impossible to answer. It's not just about the amount, the quality of the code matters as well. The one thing that can be said with certainty is that if you put large amounts of code into a single page, you will have issues maintaining the code. If you are more than one developer working on the application you will for instance need to merge changes in your source control system very frequently, instead of performing simple updates of separate files. Even if you would implement the application as a single page I would strongly encourage you to encapsulate separate behaviours on the code behind into separate classes that are created an used as needed by the page. But I would personally design the application so that separate behaviours went into separate pages as well.
