It depends on exactly what you mean by 'this inequality'. And, no, I'm not just being difficult. First (and I think this is what @whuber was being oracular about), if $X_i$ is a second-order Markov chain with state space ${\cal S}$ , then the process with state $Y_i=\langle X_i, X_{i-1}\rangle$ at time $i$ is a first-order Markov chain with state space ${\cal S}\times {\cal S}$ . It follows immediately from the result you quote that $$I(Y_i, Y_l)\leq I(Y_j, Y_k)$$ On the other hand, it does not follow that $$I(X_i, X_l)\leq I(X_j, X_k).$$ Suppose $X$ is actually an interlacing of two first-order Markov chains, so $X_1, X_3, X_5,\ldots$ is first-order Markov and so is $X_2, X_4, X_6,\ldots$ . To take a degenerate case, suppose the odd-times chain has a very low probability of moving to a new state and the even-times chain has an independent choice of state at each time. The inequality $$I(X_i, X_l)\leq I(X_j, X_k).$$ will be true if the indices are all odd or all even, but it will not be true for $i=1$ , $l=5$ , $j=2$ , $k=4$ as, ex hypothesi , the information about $X_1$ from $X_5$ is large -- they are very likely to be in the same state -- but the information about $X_2$ from $X_4$ is zero.
