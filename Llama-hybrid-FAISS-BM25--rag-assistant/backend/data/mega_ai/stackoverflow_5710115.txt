How to do simple 2D Graphics UI basic shapes with mouse interactions

I am trying to make 2D a drawing program similar to MS Viseo, Google Docs Drawings, MS Word. I want to be able draw circles, rectangles, arrows, etc... I have no idea where to begin at all. Whats the easiest way (platform/framework/language) to not only draw these shapes, but also be able to click and drag with the mouse and reposition them on the screen. Thanks in advance
