Well you could build a small web app that takes your GPX track and overlays it on google maps. Then write some code to let the user enter some number of "corrected pairs" where they click on the GPX point and then the point on google maps. Once they have done this for n number of points, where n is the number of points you want to achieve accuracy, you can calculate an average errorX and errorY. Then you can go about and for each GPX point do X + errorX and Y + errorY which should be good on average. Does that make sense?
