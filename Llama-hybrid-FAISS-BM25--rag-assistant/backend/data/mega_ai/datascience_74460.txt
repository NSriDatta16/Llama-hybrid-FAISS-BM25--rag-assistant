What if multiple final prediction values for multi-class Neural Network are equal

If, for example, your final prediction for a multi-class problem, say for ["mouse","cat","dog","lion"], is [0.1,0.3,0.3,0.3], should the neural network predict that this data is "cat","dog" or "lion"? Should this be picked randomly?
