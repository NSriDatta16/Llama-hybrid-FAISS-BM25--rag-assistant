I agree with Archimedix... Instead of putting them into MySQL as BLOB, you can store the file on the disk and store its path in MYSQL as TEXT field. This way your retrieval time will be low. If you are space conscious then you can zip the doc and save it on the disk and on request uncompress and send it. UPDATE From your code it appears that you already have the handle of the file and you are able to save it on the server. Now to save space you can zip it using default java zip utility. You might face a problem when two people upload two different files with the same name. To avoid scenarios like this you can either rename your archived document with an uuid (use java 6 uuid class) or you can generate SHA1 for that file and use that for name. Now you can use the absolute path of the archived (and renamed file) for storing in the MySQL. Instead of table schema resources UserID [varchar(15)] Document [mediumblob] You can use this resources UserID [varchar(15)] Document [varchar(512)] So for a query like this: Select Document from table Documents WHERE UserID = 'abcd'; you will now get an absolute path for the zipped file. Uncompress this file and send it.
