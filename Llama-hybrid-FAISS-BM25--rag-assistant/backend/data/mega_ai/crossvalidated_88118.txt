What exactly is called "principal component" in PCA?

Suppose $u$ is the vector that maximizes the variance of the projection of the data with design matrix $X$. Now, I have seen materials that refer $u$ as the (first) principal component of the data, which is also the eigenvector with largest eigenvalue. However, I have also seen that the principal component of the data is $X u$. Obviously, $u$ and and $Xu$ are different things. Can anyone help me out here and tell me what is the difference between these two definitions of principal components?
