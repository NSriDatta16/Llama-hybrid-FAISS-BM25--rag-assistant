Why do we divide by $n-1$ when calculating sample correlation?

I understand the rationale for dividing by $n-1$ when calculating the sample variance, i.e. that if we divide by $n$ we will have an estimate of population variance that is biased to be too low. Buglear (2013, p. 57) states about the Pearson correlation: We divide by $n - 1$ for the same reason as we do it when calculating sample standard deviations â€“ it gives us a better estimator of the population equivalent. [Buglear, J. (2013). Practical Statistics: A Handbook for Business Projects . Kogan Page Publishers] However, I don't understand why this also applies to correlations. Why is it the case that dividing by $n$ would underestimate the population correlation coefficient?
