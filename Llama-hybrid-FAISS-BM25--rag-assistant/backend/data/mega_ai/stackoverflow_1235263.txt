Encouraging good development practices for non-professional programmers?

In my copious free time, I collaborate with a number of scientists (mostly biologists) who develop software, databases, and other tools related to the work they do. Generally these projects are built on a one-off basis, used in-house, and eventually someone decides "oh, this could be useful to other people," so they release a binary or slap a PHP interface onto it and shove it onto the web. However, they typically can't be bothered to make their source code or dumps of their databases available for other developers, so in practice, these projects usually die when the project for which the code was written comes to an end or loses funding. A few months (or years) later, some other lab has a need for the same kind of tool, they have to repeat the work that the first lab did, that project eventually dies, lather, rinse, repeat. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to persuade people whose primary job isn't programming that it's of benefit to their community for them to be more open with the tools they've built? Similarly, any advice on how to communicate the idea that version control, bug tracking, refactoring, automated tests, continuous integration and other common practices we professional developers take for granted are good ideas worth spending time on? Unfortunately, a lot of scientists seem to hold the opinion that programming is a dull, make-work necessary evil and that their research is much more important, not realising that these days, software development is part of scientific research, and if the community as a whole were to raise the bar for development standards, everyone would benefit. Have you ever been in a situation like this? What worked for you?
