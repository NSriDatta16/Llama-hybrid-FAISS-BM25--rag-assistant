I did a quick search and found a few mappers in development but nothing extremely solid. Yeah MongoDB is like 18 months old. Most of the "wrappers" for it have been written in the last 4 to 6 months, I think that you're going to have a rough time finding extremely solid. Instead you're going to find a lot of "enthusiastically built" and "running on our prod system" . NoRM is a .NET library for "POCO" to Mongo. There are several "POJO" wrappers listed on the MongoDB website . They will likely have their own details regarding connection pooling and configuration injection. However, there's very little configuration to inject with Mongo, I mean, we're basically talking about one connection string here, maybe a "java-to-object" map, that's pretty much it. And most people do away with that last part by using conventions. In terms of connection pooling, it's available "out-of-the-box" with the Java driver, so hopefully your POJO wrapper is leveraging it by default or tells you how to use it.
