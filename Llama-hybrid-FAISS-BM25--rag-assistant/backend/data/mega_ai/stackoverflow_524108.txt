Merging should happen when it is overall beneficial. For example, if either or both of the projects: Are too weak to survive on their own (not enough active development to keep up with technology changes); or... Could provide good synergy through overlapping (i.e. not fully identical) functionalities. However, there isn't anything wrong with having two strong projects that both do the same thing - it can help to encourage innovation as they try to be better than each other.
