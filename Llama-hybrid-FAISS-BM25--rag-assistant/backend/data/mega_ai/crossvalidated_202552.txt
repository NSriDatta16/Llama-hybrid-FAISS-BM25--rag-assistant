PDF of sums, products of iid Normals

I've recently taken to looking at the distribution of a financial time series of the form $$X_t = X_{t-1}(1+W_t)$$ where $W_t$ is iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$. Expanding the equation out we get $$X_t = X_0\prod_{k=1}^t (1+W_k)$$ And multiplying out the right-hand side gives us: $$X_t = X_0 \Big(1+\sum_{i=1}^t W_i + \sum_{i\neq j}W_iW_j + \sum_{i\neq j \neq k}W_iW_jW_k + \cdots + \prod W_i\Big)$$ Now I know that the product of n iid random normals $W_1*\cdots*W_n$ has pdf: $$f_W(w) = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-n/2}\exp \bigg(\frac{-1}{2\sigma^2}w^Tw \bigg)$$ So my question is, how would one go about finding the pdf of $X_t$, which is the sum of several of these variables (with repetitive $W_i$ terms)? As a second question, is there is there a less intensive way to model a financial time series? I've heard of GARCH models, but I would love to hear what others might use to study the behavior of stocks.
