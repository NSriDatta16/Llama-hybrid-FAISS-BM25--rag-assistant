How can I compare the following mutual information values?

How can I compare the following mutual information values ? I'm just wondering what's the most appropriate way to display them in my report table. I'm computing them with this formula where e and c are clusters and the intersection is the number of elements in common. For each couple e and c I have a I value (mutual information). Successively I average over all e belonging to the same category (not shown in the formula) and I end up with a table like: cat1 0.0123 cat2 0.0012 cat3 0.0009 cat4 0.0100 ... The mutual dependency values are usually very low (around 0.01), because n (total amount of documents in the collection) is very high. Should I use another measure, or... what do you suggest ? thanks
