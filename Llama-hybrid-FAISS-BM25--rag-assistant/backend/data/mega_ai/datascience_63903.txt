increase performances in neural networks

I am starting being interested in neural networks, and I am writing some code about it. But, differently from methods like support vector machines, random forests,..etc., to me it seems more like a black box which I can't control. So my question is: What are methods to increase accuracy and other performances in a neural network? Thanks in advance.
