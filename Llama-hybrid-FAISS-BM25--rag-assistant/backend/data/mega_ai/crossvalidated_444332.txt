For a GLM, do I just set up the design matrix like in linear regression and select the appropriate model? Do exactly the same thing as before? Yes, the design matrix will be the same. You will need to specify the relevant distribution (eg binomial) and possibly a link function (eg logit for logistic regression and log for poisson)
