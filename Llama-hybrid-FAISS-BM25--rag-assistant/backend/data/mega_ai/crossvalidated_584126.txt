I would like to highlight that the accepted answer is not entirely true. This may be the case after the input layer, but if you use a linear layer as your input layer order does indeed matter. This is because the first linear layers weight is directly related to the order of the input features. This is because the dot products between the weight matrix and the input matrix will change depending on the order of the input matrix. This is especially true for 1-D time series data
