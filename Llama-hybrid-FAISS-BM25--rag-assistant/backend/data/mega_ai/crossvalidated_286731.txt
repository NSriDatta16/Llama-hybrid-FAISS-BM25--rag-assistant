Get random trials/distribution from (seasonal) ARIMA forecast

I want to fit a (S)ARIMA model to a temperature time series and use it for a forecast afterwards. It is crucial to get a distribution of the predicted values at a time and thus, there must be a random factor included. Bootstraping might be a solution, but I don't know if that is applicable with the seasonal component and how to do it in R. Any idea? Or any other idea how to get different forecasted values?
