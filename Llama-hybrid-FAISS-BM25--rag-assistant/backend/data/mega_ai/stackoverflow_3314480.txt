It's been over a year since you originaly asked the question, so I'm guessing you've solved your problem by now. But if someone else is interested in a possible solution I suggest the following: First of all, I don't know of any "all in one" solution to your problem. However it's quite easy to combine three products that will solve all of your needs and provide a single source for User management and password storage. The first thing to do is install an LDAP Directory to manage Users and Groups (and possibly other objects outside the scope of your question). This can be OpenLDAP , Apache DS , Microsoft Active Directory, etc. Basically any LDAP Server will do. Second I recommend installing FreeRADIUS with the LDAP Directory configured as it's backend Service. Third get a license of Atlassian Crowd . It provides OpenID and Google Apps authentication. Prices for up to 50 Users start at $10 and go all the way up to $8000 for an unlimited user license. Installation and Configuration of the three is relatively easy. You'll probably put most work into creating your Users and Groups. You can install all three components on a single Server and end up with a box that allows you to authenticate pretty much everything from Desktop Login, over Google Apps and other Web Apps, down to VPN and even Switch, WiFi and Router Login. Just make sure you configure your Roles and Groups wisely! Otherwise you might end up with some Sales Person being able to do administration on your Firewalls and Routers :-)
