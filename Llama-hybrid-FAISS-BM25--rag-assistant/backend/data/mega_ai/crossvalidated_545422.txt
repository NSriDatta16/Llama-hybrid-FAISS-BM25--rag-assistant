i am trying to find missing precipitation from other best correlated stations by using multiple linear regression. But my regression equation gives negative values (which is not possible for ppt) So what should I do now? Plz help Sample calculation is attached (same equation is obtained using R, XLSTAT, Excel) (Removing missing observations)
