WPF Treeview HierarchicalDataTemplate Drag and drop

I have a treeview in wpf that is built using the xaml below. It is a well structured data source, and I am having a lot of trouble dragging and dropping. I have tried several methods, all to no avail. Can anyone tell me what the standard procedure is for doing this type of thing?
