Because for MA( $q$ ), the true autocorrelation $\rho(q + l) = 0$ for $l \geq 1$ , the key of the proof is to apply the Bartlett's formula (as you correctly pointed out) to compute the asymptotic variance of $\sqrt{n}\hat{\rho}(q + l)$ . The Bartlett's formula (Theorem 7.2.1, Time Series: Theory and Methods by Brockwell and Davis) gives the asymptotic covariance between $\sqrt{n}\hat{\rho}(i)$ and $\sqrt{n}\hat{\rho}(j)$ : \begin{align} w_{ij} = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty\{&\rho(k + i)\rho(k + j) + \rho(k - i)\rho(k + j) + 2\rho(i)\rho(j)\rho^2(k) \\ & - 2\rho(i)\rho(k)\rho(k + j) - 2\rho(j)\rho(k)\rho(k + i)\}. \tag{1} \end{align} Since the problem of interest only concerns with $\hat{\rho}(q + l)$ , the asymptotic variance of $\sqrt{n}\hat{\rho}(q + l)$ can be obtained by setting $i = j = q + l =: r$ in $(1)$ , which returns \begin{align} w_{rr} &= \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty\{\rho^2(k + r) + \rho(k - r)\rho(k + r) + 2\rho^2(r)\rho^2(k) - 4\rho(r)\rho(k)\rho(k + r) \} \\ &= \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty\{\rho^2(k + r) + \rho(k - r)\rho(k + r)\} \tag{$\dagger$} \\ \end{align} In $(\dagger)$ , we use $\rho(r) = 0$ since $r > q$ and it is an MA( $q$ ) process. So it remains to evaluate the two summations in $(\dagger)$ . The first summation is easy, again by noting $\rho(s) = 0$ for all $|s| > q$ in MA( $q$ ), it follows that \begin{align} \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty \rho^2(k + r) = \sum_{t = -\infty}^\infty\rho^2(t) = \sum_{t = -q}^q\rho^2(t) = 1 + 2\sum_{j = 1}^q\rho^2(j). \tag{$\dagger\dagger$} \end{align} For the second summation, note that the summand $\rho(k - r)\rho(k + r) \equiv 0$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ . This can be verified by considering $k - r and $k + r > q$ separately (for each category, the product of $\rho(k - r)$ and $\rho(k + r)$ is zero -- again, use $\rho(s) = 0$ for all $|s| > q$ in MA( $q$ ), and the union of these two categories covers $\mathbb{Z}$ ). Combining $(\dagger)$ and $(\dagger\dagger)$ gives the desired result.
