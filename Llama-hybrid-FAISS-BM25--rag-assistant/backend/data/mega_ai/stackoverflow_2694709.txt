You'll have to expose users to part of the process, since they have to describe the tables and table relationships somehow. You could take a page from the likes of Crystal Reports, Visual Studio and phpMyAdmin and create a visual table designer. A table is represented as a rectangle with a title bar showing the table's name and a list of fields. The tables are on a canvas, and can be placed anywhere on that canvas. Foreign keys are represented as lines connecting fields. You can use the same interface as a query creator: the user specifies which tables to query by dragging them from a list of tables to the canvas, which fields they're interested in (perhaps include a checkbox next to each column) and which fields to join on by connecting fields with lines. To join a table to itself, you could allow a table to be added to a query more than once, or allow fields within a table to be connected to other fields within the same table. If you don't have it, grab phpMyAdmin , install it, open a database and go to the "Designer" tab to see how it works. You can also take a look at some screenshots
