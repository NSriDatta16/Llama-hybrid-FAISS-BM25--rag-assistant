First, you seem to have just a few datapoints so you need a very simple model . The good rule of thumb to answer questions like this is to ask yourself if there are any likely patterns in the data. The general plot doesn’t reveal anything like this, what about if you difference it? How do the plots of STL decomposed data look like? My guess would be that there’s no regularities, so no much to build a model. In such a case, you can treat it as a white noise around the global mean.
