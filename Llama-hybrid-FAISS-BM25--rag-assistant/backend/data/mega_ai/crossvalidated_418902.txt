How many lags to use for ADF test if several values reject null hypothesis?

I'm still a novice with time series so I'm sorry if this is a little basic.When performing an Augmented Dickey Fuller test on my data I found that lag values from 1-4 all lead me to reject the null hypothesis. Since this is the case, how should I determine the number of lags to use?
