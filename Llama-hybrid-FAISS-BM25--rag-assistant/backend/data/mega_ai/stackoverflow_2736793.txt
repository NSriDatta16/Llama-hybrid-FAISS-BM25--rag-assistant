Delphi's IDE takes several liberties with your code without warning you. In particular : if you have a callback (eg: "TMyForm.FormCreate") linked in the dfm, and the IDE detects that the function's body is empty, when you save your unit, the ide removes the declaration and the implementation before saving your file. Adding anything (even a simple "//") in the function's body prevents this : try typing some code or some comment in your function before closing your Delphi. As for errors when Delphi closes, there can be so many reasons. Do you have any third-party components or experts installed ? Have you tried installing IDEFixpack for D2007 ?
