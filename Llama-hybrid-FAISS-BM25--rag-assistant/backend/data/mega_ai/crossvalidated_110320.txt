To use or not to use a variable that contains information w.r.t. uncertainty

The data I'm looking at is concerned with percentages of people who would recommend a hospital. E.g. NOT PROBABLY DEFINITELY FREQ hospital_1 10.0 80.0 10.0 100 hospital_2 20.0 50.0 30.0 200 We'd like to do the analysis on the hospital level, so basically I converted the percentages in some kind of weighted score (for example the arbitrarily chosen NOT * 0 + PROBABLY * 1 + DEFINITELY * 2, does not matter), which will yield some kind of single variable called "average_recommendation_score". I'm expecting that this score is unbiased regardless of the number of people who filled in the survey (FREQ), well... in the limit. However, in doing this kind of analysis, where this might actually be a dependent variable, should we also use the FREQ variable for the estimation of parameters (it feels like this given uncertainty about the average_recommendation_score contains extra information; you can imagine how a maximum score is probably not the "real" score if only based on 1 participant's vote)? Is it OK to disregard the FREQ variable or should it / could it be incorporated somehow yielding a single variable? If it should be, how? Note: The goal is inference using some variables that are assumed to be predictors.
