How do I extract "eTag" or "x-ms-request-id" from my Astoria DataContext response?

The Azure table whitepaper mentions that the x-ms-request-id is useful to send to Microsoft in the event there is an error working with the data. If I do have such an error, I'd like my try...catch block to take this and save it somewhere for future analysis. In addition I need to extract the ETag value as well while in Table storage. How do I extract this information and have it available when the Exception comes around? HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Content-Length: 0 ETag: W/"datetime'2008-10-01T15%3A27%3A34.4838174Z'" x-ms-request-id: 7c1b5e22-831d-403c-b88a-caa4443e75cb
