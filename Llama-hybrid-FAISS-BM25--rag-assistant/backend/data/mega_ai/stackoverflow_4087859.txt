elegant comparing strings in two NSArrays

Dear all. We have 2 arrays(currentCarriers and companyList with strings inside. A final solution have to be array, which exclude same string from first array. Bellow is a my solutions, but probably two for loops is not like cocoa style. Maybe somebody can suggest something better? for (NSString *carrier in currentCarriers) { for (NSString *company in companyList) { if ([company isEqualToString:carrier]) [removedCompanies addObject:company]; } } NSMutableArray *companiesForAdd = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray:companyList]; [companiesForAdd removeObjectsInArray:removedCompanies];
