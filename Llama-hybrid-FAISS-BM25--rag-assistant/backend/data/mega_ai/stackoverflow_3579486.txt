Sort a Javascript Array by frequency and then filter repeats

What is an elegant way to take a javascript array, order by the frequency of the values, and then filter for uniques? So, ["apples", "oranges", "oranges", "oranges", "bananas", "bananas", "oranges"] becomes ["oranges, "bananas", "apples"]
