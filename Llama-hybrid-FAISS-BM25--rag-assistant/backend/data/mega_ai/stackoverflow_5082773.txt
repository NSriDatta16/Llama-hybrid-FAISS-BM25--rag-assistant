Use a Master File for Template Layout/Design in Sitefinity 4.0

I have a master template that contains hand coded HTML, JS, and CSS (that worked in 3.7) that I would like to use as the template for a Sitefinity 4.0 project but I cannot seem to figure out how to create a template and use that master file instead of dragging and dropping, painfully, a bunch of layout boxes and re-crafting all my existing code. Whereas I could drop my master in to the project from the file system on 3.7 it doesn't seem to find it, or allow me to use it in 4.0 Specifically- I can't seem to get the paths to the JS and CSS files correct in the HTML. Firebug says that the server is returning a Forbidden and Not Found for certain files.
