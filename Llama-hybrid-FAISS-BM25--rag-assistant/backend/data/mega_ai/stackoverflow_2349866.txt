I would maybe start here: Google white papers on IR Then also search for white papers on IR on Google maybe? Also a few things to add to your index: Subdomains associated with the domain IP addresses associated with the domain Average page speed Links pointing at the domain in Yahoo - e.g link:nytimes.com or search on yahoo Number of pages on the domain - site:nytimes.com on Google traffic nos on compete.com or google trends whois info e.g. age of domain, length of time registered for etc. Some other places to research - http://www.majesticseo.com/ , http://www.opensearch.org/Home and http://www.seomoz.org they all have their own indexes I'm sure theres plenty more but hopefully the IR stuff will get the cogs whirring :)
