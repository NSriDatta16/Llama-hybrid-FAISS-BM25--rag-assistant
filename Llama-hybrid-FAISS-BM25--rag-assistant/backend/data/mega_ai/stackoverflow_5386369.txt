I'm not sure if I'm reading it completely right, but you may able to do it with this code snippet from NotificationClicked.java Intent oi = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); oi.setClassName("com.android.settings", "com.android.settings.InstalledAppDetails"); oi.putExtra("pkg", pkg); oi.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); context.startActivity(oi); I'm having a little trouble figuring out what the String pkg is exactly though.
