I am not sure about library for additional widgets support for Smartgwt, but you can achevie the implementation of flowchart or designing of flowchart even in Smartgwt with animation support (drag & drop). For shapes you can use various images or label / html panel (refer http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/#effects_lf_corners ). You can support dynamically adding text to these shapes/images also by using some events.
