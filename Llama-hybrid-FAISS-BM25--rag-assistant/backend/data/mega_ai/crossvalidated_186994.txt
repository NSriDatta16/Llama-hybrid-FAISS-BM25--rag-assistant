You can use the R package {lmerTest} and call on the following function: summary(fit) Linear mixed model fit by REML t-tests use Satterthwaite approximations to degrees of freedom [lmerMod] Formula: weight ~ sex * treatment + (1 | litter) Data: df REML criterion at convergence: 38.6 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.47793 -0.54377 -0.01737 0.48467 1.45905 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. litter (Intercept) 0.4318 0.6571 Residual 0.7574 0.8703 Number of obs: 16, groups: litter, 4 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.

Dev. of 0.6571 measures the variability between litters, as opposed to the variability that is still unaccounted for ( 0.8703 ). This can be visually inspected with boxplots: Among the fixed effects the differences will simply be in intercepts, also illustrated with boxplots: Notice on the output that the actual intercepts should be calculated as: fixef(fit) (Intercept) sexm treatmentb sexm:treatmentb 3.54300434 -2.46379392 0.01800987 1.08647799 so that the (Intercept) in the output (i.e. $\small3.543$) is the average of females treated with a : > a_fem The second coefficient is the average for males treated with a ($\small 3.543 - 2.464 = 1.079$): > a_male The third coefficient is for females treated with b , amounting to ($\small 3.543 + 0.018 = 3.561$): > b_fem Finally the last coefficient stands for males treated with b or ($\small 3.543−2.464+0.018+1.083=2.187$): > b_male We see in the output that there is a significant difference in intercepts in females treated with a and males treated with a . The fixed effects coefficients come with the standard errors calculated. Otherwise, they can be extracted from the variance-covariance matrix: vcov(fit) 4 x 4 Matrix of class "dpoMatrix" (Intercept) sexm treatmentb sexm:treatmentb (Intercept) 0.4052795 -0.1893622 -0.4052795 0.1893622 sexm -0.1893622 0.3787245 0.1893622 -0.3787245 treatmentb -0.4052795 0.1893622 0.8105590 -0.3787245 sexm:treatmentb 0.1893622 -0.3787245 -0.3787245 0.7574489 For example, for females treated with b : (fem_b_SE The confidence intervals can be calculated as follows for example in the case of female treated with b : (fem_b_SE or in the case of males treated with b : (male_b_SE Notice that the function built into lme4 gives different values: confint(fit) Computing profile confidence intervals ... 2.5 % 97.5 % .sig01 0.0000000 1.308364 .sigma 0.5581087 1.251771 (Intercept) 2.4416191 4.644389 sexm -3.6591640 -1.268425 treatmentb -1.5518958 1.589257 sexm:treatmentb -0.6040305 2.776985 are significantly different, and give a bunch of error messages.
