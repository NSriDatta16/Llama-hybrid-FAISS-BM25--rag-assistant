You can certainly do this, as RageZ describes above, but I don't think I would recommend doing it. What this does is creates too loose of a "contract" between the users of this class - i.e. nobody really knows which properties the class has. Instead of defining the properties on the fly, I would bet that you have a pre-defined set of "object property sets" that could in turn define a class hierarchy. So instead of doing if I get an array with "a = 2 and b = 3", create object with $obj->a = 3 and $obj-b = 3 if I get an array with "c = 5", create an object with $obj->c = 5 Do this: define a class for MyObjectOfTypeOne, that has properties $a and $b define a class for MyObjectOfTypeTwo that has property $c Then, use the Factory pattern to generate the right type of object depending on the parameters passed to the static factory method.
