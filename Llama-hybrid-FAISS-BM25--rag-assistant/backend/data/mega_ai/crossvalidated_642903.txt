First, the variable shown will have negative skewness as it has a long tail at the low end. I'm not sure what went wrong with your calculation. In your title, you correctly say "left skew" but that would mean a negative value for skewnees. Second, no form of regression requires that the variables be symmetric, much less normal. OLS regression assumes that the errors are normal, but even here, the assumption only relates to some applications. Logistic regression makes no such assumptions at all. But the quantile plot of the residuals would be pretty good, even for OLS regression -- here, it's just superfluous. Third, I don't know what you mean by "shaky". If you are saying it would be sensitive to small changes, well, you could try it out. Add noise or other things to the IV and see what happens to the model.
