Simple answer: yes, you can Even better: why don't you inherit ICar from IVehicle, that is you can extend IVehicle with new methods and name it ICar. This way your object can be QI'd for both interfaces and ICar will have all the methods a client needs to manipulate the object. This also allows ICar to be upcasted to IVehicle so both interface can share a single implementation (i.e. accessing MaxPassengers both on ICar and IVehicle executes the same C++ method). Same for IPlane but the extension will include different methods.
