Getting information (on click) that was used to programatically generate asp controls

How may one get information that was used to programatically generate asp controls? For example, I pulled a DataTable of user objects from the database and have organized them on a page, listing groupings such as a list of employees directly under the employer for each employer. On the page, I list each user's Username as a LinkButton . When I click one of these employees, I want to redirect the page (which is easy) and set a session variable to the selected user's UserId (which seems not so easy). How can I pull this UserId value back? These elements are not hard-coded with nice names (as they are generated in a for each loop). Code from comment below: Dim lnkbtnPm As New LinkButton ' is my link button. ' lnkbtnPm.Text = pmDr.Item("Username") ' where pmDr is my datarow. ' lnkbtnPm.CommandArgument = pmDr.Item("UserId") lnkbtnPm.CommandName = "CommandNameHere" panelToAddControlTo.Controls.Add(lnkbtnPm) Thanks :)
