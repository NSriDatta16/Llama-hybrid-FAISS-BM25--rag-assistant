That line of code took my manual parser a few moments longer to digest than I would like. I'm all for succinct and elegant coding, but wouldn't you rather come across this in a few months time, albeit over a few more lines? if (found) // Use empty strings for fieldName and productName field = String.Format(Str, value1, value2, fieldName, productName); else // Use the fieldName and productName in the string field = String.Format(Str, value1, value2, String.Empty, String.Empty); Just my personal taste, but I know which one I'd rather encounter.
