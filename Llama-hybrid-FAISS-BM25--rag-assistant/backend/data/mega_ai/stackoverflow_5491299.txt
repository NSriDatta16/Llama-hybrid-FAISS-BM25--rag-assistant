giving no errors to me, in CS5, though one thing that you can check is, drag a progress bar component from the component window, save and run your file, then delete the instance. after that your code should do just fine. also you can comment this line as: var progressBarr:ProgressBar = new ProgressBar(); //progressBarr.source = swfLoader.contentLoaderInfo; progressBarr.x = 27; progressBarr.y = 155; check fla here: http://ashwani.50webs.com/test.fla
