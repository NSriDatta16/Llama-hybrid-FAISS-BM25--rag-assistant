ORA-06550 and PLS-00103

HI, I am using UNIX OS and working on oracle. I am getting the error message below E ORA-06550: line 1, column 8: PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol "" when expecting one of the following: begin function package pragma procedure subtype type use form current cursor The symbol "" was ignored. ORA-06550: line 2, column 27: PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol "" when expecting one of the following: begin function package pragma procedure subtype type use On googling, I found "The problem appears to be with Windows CRLF characters on line breaks. Oracle does not treat this as white space, instead it sees it as an empty string. In order to get round this problem, convert the CRLF characters to LF characters and Oracle should be happy." Anyone have any idea about why it is happening in UNIX/ksh shell?
