iPhone - XCode Target Info Creator Field

In XCode, if I click on my Target->getInfo and go to the Properties tab I see that the Creator field has ???? in it. Is this just simply a field to insert the name of the company/individual that is making the application or is it for something else? Also, does the Version field drive when an .ipa file is dragged into iTunes - whether or not this version of the file replaces another version. I ask because I recently made an adhoc distribution and when users dragged it in to iTunes even though iTunes would prompt the user about replacing the existing version, it would not replace it. We had to delete the app, sync, re-drag and drop the .ipa, and resync. Any help would be great.
