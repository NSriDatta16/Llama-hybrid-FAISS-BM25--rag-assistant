So, maybe for those 3 readers who are NOT completely familiar with linear regression, like me: They demand to improve their predictions by 10 %. That's tough. It's tough, because I suppose that estimating a user's choice simply by the average choice other users have given is probably a good estimator already. What I want to say is: there is not so much space left for improvements.
