Tools to organize Dataset designer?

Does anybody know of good tools/plugins to organize the dataset designer in Visual Studio 2008? Right now it's a big jumble of TableAdapters without relationship views - it would be very cool if there was a tool available that could organize it, kinda like how it's done in SQL Server Management studio's 'Diagram' pane. Cheers, WT
