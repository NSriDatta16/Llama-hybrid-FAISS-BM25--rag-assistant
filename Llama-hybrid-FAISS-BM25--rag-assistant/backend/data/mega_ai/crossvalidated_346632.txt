Reducing a logistic model used for prediction

I'm developing a logistic regression used for prediction. I have pre-selected, based on prev. literature, 15 candidate predictors (fitting my ~200 events). Now, I want a reduced/more parsimonious model for ease of use, and I want to use model approximation for it (as suggested in RMS by Harrel). I will need to present a multivariable summary table of selected predictors based off their approximation. I wonder, when reporting P-values for each coef in the reduced model, what should I use (i.e, re-estimate the reduced model against outcome) sample R code: library(rms) lp
