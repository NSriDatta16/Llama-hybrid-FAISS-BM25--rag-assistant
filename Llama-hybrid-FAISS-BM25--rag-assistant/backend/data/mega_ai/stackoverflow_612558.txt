Thanks for replying so quickly! It turned out that the issue was not in this code fragment at all. I was executing this code dependent on a value in the keychain. While my simulator's keychain has that value, my test iphone did not have this value. Feel so silly for troubling all of you. But following up on the reply from nduplessis helped me narrow down the issue.
