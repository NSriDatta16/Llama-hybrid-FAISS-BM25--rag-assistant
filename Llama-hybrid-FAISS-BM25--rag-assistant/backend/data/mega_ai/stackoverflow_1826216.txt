What CI server and Configuration Management tools I should use

What CI server and Configuration Management tools I should use together for a truly development and deploy maintenance. There isn't the de facto rails sustainable environment, is there? Some assumptions: • code control version ok - git (de facto tool) • test framework ok - whatever (rspec is my choice) • code coverage and analysis ok - whatever (metric-fu, for example) • server stack ok - (Passenger for example) • issue tracker (RedMine) • etc, ... I'm want to play if integrity and moonshine projects, for me it's a good for beginning, isn't it? What do you think about this? Thanks, Bruno
