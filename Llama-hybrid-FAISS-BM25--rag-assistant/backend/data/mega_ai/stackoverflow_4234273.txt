programmatically set uiimage's visibility

I've dragged a UIImage in interface builder onto the view and selected my PNG from the dropdown, that works great but if I want to change the visibility of the uiimage according to the number of rows in this table code: - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section { id sectionInfo = [[self.fetchedResultsController sections] objectAtIndex:section]; return [sectionInfo numberOfObjects]; } Would I have to declare the uiimage as an outlet and how would I code the visibility in the above code if the number of rows in the table was more that 1 (ie. there were rows present)
