Edit : Funnily enough, the very same question was asked only a week ago on SO. The comments in the accepted answer provide a good explanation why this can't be done. I am pretty sure this is not working due to a security restriction, and rightly so. In my perception, IE generally tends to be more strict with stuff like this, maybe because they've been so badly burned (and had such gaping security holes) in the past. You could argue that the user did set the value, and copying the element thus should be ok. But this kind of stuff is what back doors for some cross-site-frame-something shenanigans (that work when frame A is in this domain, frame B in that, the user is Male and under thirty, and the Moon is in Virgo) are made of, so I find it understandable that it is forbidden.
