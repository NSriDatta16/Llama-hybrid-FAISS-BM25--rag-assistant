Please see my answers at Projects folder structure recommendation and How do you organize your version control repository? . For your specific question, the issue is managing inter-project dependencies. The answer is to version them--each project that depends on another should depend ONLY on the binary deliverable from that project (or the closest equivalent if not a compiled program/library), and that deliverable should be versioned in each such reference. Of course, you first need to make sure that each project produces ONE and ONLY ONE binary deliverable (or equivalent). By depending only on the binary deliverable from another project, you make each project stand-alone and greatly ease its maintenance, since its "build interface" is a single file. Reaching into another project's source/build is like reaching into the middle of a library's implementation = lots of problems. By versioning each project, you can modify a particular project's source on behalf of another (new) project, but not affect any of the other old projects that used it. In effect, each project becomes a PRODUCT. Like any product, you should manage its releases and its compatibility with other products.
