I just had a similar question . Though I do not yet fully understand it, this paper * performs an in-depth analysis of the difference of the scores. They shows that 2 Prec Rec/(Prec+Rec), where Prec and Rec are averages over classes, leads to some issues: one formula well 'rewards' classifiers which produce a skewed error type distribution Apparently the average over class-wise F1 scores does not suffer from this issue. Thus it would be preferable. * Opitz, J. and Burst, S., 2019. Macro F1 and Macro F1. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.03347.
