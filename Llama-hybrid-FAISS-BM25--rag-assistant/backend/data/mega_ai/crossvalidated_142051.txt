On a parametrization of an infinite series to recover the GARCH process

Time series analysis By James D. Hamilton (a great book) proceeds in this way to introduce the GARCH process: First it recalls that the equation that described an ARCH(m) process was the following: $$u_t = \sqrt{h_t} v_t$$ where $v_t$ is iid with zero mean and unit variance and where $h_t$ evolves according to $$h_t = \xi + \alpha_1u_{t-1}^2+ \alpha_2u_{t-2}^2 + \dots+ \alpha_mu_{t-m}^2$$ Hamilton then invites us to imagine a more general process for wich the conditional variance depends on an infinite number of lags: $$ h_t = \xi + \pi(L)u_t^2 $$ where $\pi(L) = \sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} \pi_j L^j$. Hamilton then says that a natural idea is to parametrize $\pi(L)$ as the ratio of two finite polynomials as so $$\pi(L) =\frac{ \alpha_1L^1+ \alpha_2L^2 + \dots + \alpha_mL^m}{1- \delta_1L^1-\delta_2L^2 - \dots -\delta_rL^r}$$ So why is this so natural?
