I don't entirely agree with Jon Skeet. I think that if you can get an easy win to give you coverage and eliminate the noise in your coverage report, then you should do it. Either tell your coverage tool to ignore the constructor, or put the idealism aside and write the following test and be done with it: @Test public void testConstructorIsPrivate() throws NoSuchMethodException, IllegalAccessException, InvocationTargetException, InstantiationException { Constructor constructor = Foo.class.getDeclaredConstructor(); assertTrue(Modifier.isPrivate(constructor.getModifiers())); constructor.setAccessible(true); constructor.newInstance(); }
