The CDN TTL says for how long your copy will remain in the CDN after being copied from the main repository. Selecting different values for TTL have several effects: cost since you get to pay for the copying from the main repository. I would assume a low TTL would increase costs. I do not know if there is any charge to having data stored in the CDN. if you change a file while it is already in the CDN, that change may take up to TTL hours before it is available via the CDN to users. A high TTL thus reduces flexibility. speed/latency is also affected. If the data requested by a user is not available in the CDN, it has to first be copied there from the repository which takes some extra time. In a project where the files where changing on average once a year or so I chose the maximum TTL of 72 hours.
