how to configure only once in pom.xml in a desktop application

I'm making a swing application with maven and I try to keep the pom.xml under tight reins (this file tends to become a pile of junk after pasting there whatever we find in google). My pom is with jar and I use the maven-assembly-plugin with "jar-with-dependencies" descriptor. So I need to define twice the part of my project (main class and versions), once for the normal jar and the other once for the jar-with-dependencies. I think the problem comes from the jar-with-dependencies assembly descriptor, instead of unpacking the normal jar and fusion the manifests, it creates a new jar from ${project.build.outputDirectory} wich smells strange to me. Does anybody have a compact and elegant idea to avoid this repetition of my manifest configuration ? Thanks, Nicolas.
