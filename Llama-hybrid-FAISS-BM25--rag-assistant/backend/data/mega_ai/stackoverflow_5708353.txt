I think you'll have to set your own drawable image for your buttons, and not use the standard system image. Unless I'm mistaken, the standard MDPI image for buttons has a built in transparent border of 3 pixels on the horizontal sides, 1 pixel on the top side, and 4 pixels on the bottom side. So, even if this button image were fully expanded to 100% fill a grid cell, it would still include this transparent border, and thus not appear to fully fill the cell. (This is based on the assumption that the default button image is btn_default_normal.9.png.) Instead of using Buttons, take a look at ImageButton , which allows you to set your own image. Or, to use the regular Button , you may need to set the button's background image with a state list drawable. Take a look at the "Button style" section for more information. -- However, I do see now in the docs, "Explicitly setting a padding value will override the corresponding padding found in the background." I see you mentioned you tried setting the padding, but did you try setting the padding to zero?
