If you have multi dimensional data, it's very hard to visualize. PCA helps us in reducing the dimension of the data set by keeping maximum co-variance in top K Features. So PCA will help us in presenting the data in most of the cases. So if you perform PCA, you will definitely lose some data and creating a model with less data, will definitely affect the model outcome.
