@msp, I think you are looking at a two stage model in that attachment (I did not have time to read it), but zero inflated continuous data is the type I work with a lot. To fit a parametric model to this data (to allow hypothesis tests) you can fit a two stage but then you have two models (Y is the target and X are covariates): P(Y=0 |X) and P(Y|X;Y>0). You have to use simulation to "bring" these together. Gelmans book (and the arm package in R) shows this process for this exact model (using logistic regression and ordinary linear regression with a log link). The other option I have seen and like better is to fit a zero inflated gamma regression, which is the same as above (but gamma as the error instead of guassian) and you can bring them together for hypothesis tests on P(Y|X). I dont know how to do this in R, but you can in SAS NLMIXED. See this post , it works well.
