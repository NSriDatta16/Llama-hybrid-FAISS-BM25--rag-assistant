It's simple: views are virtual tables. Views are based on SELECT-queries on "real" tables, but the difference is that views do not store the information unlike real tables. A view only references to the tables and combines them the way SELECT says them to. This makes often used queries a lot more simplified. Here's a simple example for you. Lets suppose you have a table of employees and a table of departments, and you'd like to see their salaries. First you can create a view for the salaries. CREATE VIEW SALARIES AS SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.name FROM employees AS e, deparments as d WHERE e.depid = d.depid ORDER BY e.salary DESC This query lists the name of the employee, his/her salary and department and orders them by their salaries in descending order. When you've done this you can use queries such as: SELECT * from SALARIES On a larger scale you could make a view that calculates the average salary of the employees and lists who has a salary that's less than the average salary. In real life such queries are much more complex.
