if you posted some code, including the function that spawns the thread, it would help. Doubt leads to multiple possible explanations Deadlock Your thread is not alive anymore because it's stuck in some locks. Double check (if any) all the lock instructions and also pay attention to DB transactions Running flag set too late I had a similar problem with a thread never starting at all in Mono, in a scenario similar to yours. But, if you have code such as this: { Thread t = new Thread(Method); t.Start(); Run = true; } void Method() { while(Run) { ... } } then you may get problems depending in what position you set Run=true. In this case, after Start() , you might think that it will take some time for the thread to reach its control point, but it's actually not true. Without further information about your code, I might imagine, from your description, that you have a problem like this (ThreadAbortException or ThreadInterruptException can be handled to log but will ultimately propagate, so that's not the case) Anyway, You asked how to debug: with Visual Studio you can "connect to process" and attach to your running process, getting the thread list and so on.
