Permission to write on SD card android

I have a problem writing to the SD card, here is the code: (Sorry about the layout of the code, just copy pased it ) public class SaveAndReadManager { private String result; private String saveFileName = "eventlist_savefile"; public String writeToFile( ArrayList arrlEvents ){ FileOutputStream fos = null; ObjectOutputStream out = null; try{ File root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); if( root.canWrite() ){ fos = new FileOutputStream( saveFileName ); out = new ObjectOutputStream( fos ); out.writeObject( arrlEvents ); result = "File written"; out.close(); }else{ result = "file cant write"; } }catch( IOException e ){ e.printStackTrace(); result = "file not written"; } return result; } public boolean readFromFile(){ return false; } } I have not implemented the readFromFile() yet. The problem is that root.canWrite() returns false all the time. Here is the manifest file: I've asked for the permission to write, and on my avd, if i go to settings -> SD card and phone storage, it tells me i have 1 gb on the sd card to write on. Please help. Thanks:)
