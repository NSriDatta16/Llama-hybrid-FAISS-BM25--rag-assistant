I believe you are training the autoencoder and creating the new image using two other models i.e. encoder, decoder. For that, First create the encoder, decoder and then use them in Model API to create the Encoder-Decoder. Should also change the Loss and Activation to MSE, ReLU . Though current is working fine. # This change will fix the issue decoded_imgs = autoencoder.predict(x_test) Output for hidden_size = 16
