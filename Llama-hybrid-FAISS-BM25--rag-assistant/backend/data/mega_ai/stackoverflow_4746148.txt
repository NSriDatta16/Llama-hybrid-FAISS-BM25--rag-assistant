Issues in handling touches on subviews(uiviews) in UIScrollView

I have craeted a UIScrollView using code and i have created subviews which i am creating dynamically from the DB that are added to the array of views and to the UIScrollviews.I am using touchesBegan and touchesMoved methods.The subview which i am selecting is not recognized,but the control comes into touchesBegan and touches moved method.I have posted the code below.Please anybody help me to overcome from this issue. I have created the scrollview through code and i have subviews in an array named "arrayofviews".these subviews are the same views which are in the array.I am able to move these subviews which are from the DB on a normal view,but when i added these views to the scrollview its not working. I have tried so many solutions which are in the net,but i couldn't get a proper solution. .m file - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated { scrollview=[[UIScrollView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 374)]; scrollview.backgroundColor=[UIColor clearColor]; [scrollview setScrollEnabled:YES]; [scrollview setContentSize:CGSizeMake(300, 600)]; scrollview.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = YES; scrollview.delaysContentTouches=NO; . . . . //here i am retrieving the controls from the DB and adding into the "arrayofviews" array which is an NSMutableArray //I have added subviews in this part to the scroll like [scrollview addSubview:vw1]; [scrollview addSubview:vw2]; . . . scrollview.userInteractionEnabled=NO; scrollview.scrollEnabled=FALSE; [self.view addSubview:scrollview]; [self.view bringSubviewToFront:scrollview]; } -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { scrollview.userInteractionEnabled=YES; [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation; touchLocation.x=scrollview.contentOffset.x; touchLocation.y=scrollview.contentOffset.y; for(UIView *vw in arrayOfViews) { vw.userInteractionEnabled=YES; if([touch view]==vw) { vw.center=touchLocation; } } } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event //method to intiate the touch events { [self.nextResponder touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch = [[event touchesForView:scrollview] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation1; touchLocation1.x=scrollview.contentOffset.x; touchLocation1.y=scrollview.contentOffset.y; for(UIView *vw in arrayOfViews) { if([touch view]==vw) { vw.center=touchLocation1; //statement to move the control } } }
