Why the accuracy of Random Forest Classifier is very low?

I'm trying to train a machine learning model that predicts jobs based on the skills entered. I used Random Forest Classifier as the algorithm, but the accuracy turns out to be very low. I thought the model was underfitted, so I added more unique data and columns to the dataset. However, this caused the accuracy to decrease even more. The prediction results are correct, but How can I improve accuracy?
