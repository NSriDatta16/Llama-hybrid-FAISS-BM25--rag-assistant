Looking for a safe, portable password-storage method

I'm working on C++ project that is supposed to run on both Win32 and Linux, the software is to be deployed to small computers, usually working in remote locations - each machine likely to contain it's own users/service-men pool . Recently, our client has requested that we introduce access control via password protection. We are to meet the following criteria : Support remote login Support remote password change Support remote password reset EDITED Support data retrieval on accidental/purposeful deletion Support secure storage I'm capable of meeting the "remote" requirements using an existing library, however what I do need to consider is a method of storing this data, preferably in a way that will work on both platforms and will not let the user see it/read it, encryption is not the issue here - it's the storage method itself. Can anyone recommend a safe storage method that could help me meet those criteria? EDIT We're initially considering using a portable SQLite database, however what we are interested in, is limiting the access to the file with the data to users. How can we achieve that? (file not visible to the user, file cannot be opened manually by user etc.) EDIT 2 Cheers for the responses flowing in so far, Can we focus on ways to limit the access to the file itself? Encryption is not the issue here. What we're looking for is a way to hide and or backup the file, and only permit the "MyApp.exe" to work with it. So far we're also investigating Alternate NTFS Streams, however we're not sure if this will work on Linux
