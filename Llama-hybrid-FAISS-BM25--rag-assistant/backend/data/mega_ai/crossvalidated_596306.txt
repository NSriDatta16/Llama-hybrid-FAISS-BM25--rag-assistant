Weird AIC weights in model averaging

I conducted AIC selection on a set of models, and isolated my top 3 models. I then calculated the AIC weights of each model, and got the values 0.99, 1.92e-14,and 6.9e-18. I never saw weight values that low, and am worried I might have screwed up somewhere. Has anyone else seen AIC weights like this?
