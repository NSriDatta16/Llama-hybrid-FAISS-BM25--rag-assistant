Is it possible to do a reduction on an array with openmp?

Does OpenMP natively support reduction of a variable that represents an array? This would work something like the following... float* a = (float*) calloc(4*sizeof(float)); omp_set_num_threads(13); #pragma omp parallel reduction(+:a) for(i=0;i Ideally, there would be something similar for an omp parallel for, and if you have a large enough number of threads for it to make sense, the accumulation would happen via binary tree.
