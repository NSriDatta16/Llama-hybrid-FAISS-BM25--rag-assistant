I know, this might be a late answer, but I just wanted to add that you cannot simply say that SVMs are outdated for time series classification (TSC). It rather depends on the kernel function you're using. The conventional kernels such as RBF, poly, etc. sure aren't fitting well for TSC. This is due to the time axis distortion problem Because of the time axis distortion problem, classical kernel functions, such as Gaussian RBF (GRBF) and polynomial, generally are not suitable for SVM-based time series classification. Motivated by the success of dynamic time wrapping (DTW) distance, it has been suggested to utilize elastic measure to construct appropriate kernel. This said, if you choose a custom kernel function such as GTWED or GERP (subtypes of GEMK), SVMs show high potential in TSC: Experimental results show that, in terms of classification accuracy, SVM with GEMK is much superior to the state-of-the-art similarity measure methods and SVM with GRBF and GDTW kernels.
