Are transition matrices and markov chains considered a part of time series analysis

Is the topic of Markov Process and Transition Matrices considered a part of time series analysis? Transition matrix has the intuition of being a time based process because the transition probabilities are w.r.t time periods. So are transition matrices considered time series analysis. I ask because I could not find them in a book on machine learning, so was wondering what kind of book should cover this topic?
