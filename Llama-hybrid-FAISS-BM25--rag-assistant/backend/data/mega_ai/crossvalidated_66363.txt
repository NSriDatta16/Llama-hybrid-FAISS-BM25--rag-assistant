If you are looking for a gentler approach I can highly recommend the book by Kruschke which uses R to explain the core concepts. It is a very practical and hands-on approach into learning Bayesian statistics and on his website you can find all of the codes used. Someone also recommended the text by Cam.Davidson.Pilon to me, haven't look at it yet but it can be found here .
