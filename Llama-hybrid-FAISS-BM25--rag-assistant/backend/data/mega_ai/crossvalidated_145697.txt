D-separation in a Bayesian Network

The above question asks to see if Radio is D-Separated from Petrol given certain evidence. For evidence (i), why would this mean D-Separation? If Battery is true, we have a inactive triple. If Starts were true, however, then this would cause a active triple. Doesn't this active triple mean Radio and Petrol are not D-Separated? Or is the fact that a inactive triple exists in the path enough for them to be D-Separated? I assume for this same reason, evidence (ii) also shows D-Separation? I assume it is because it doesn't matter whether Battery or true/false. As long as it is observed, it creates a inactive triple, which proves D-Separation? Why is evidence (iii) showing no D-Separation? Is it simply because a active triple exists now that Battery is unknown? Or is there more to it than that? Why is evidence (iv) showing no D-Separation? Is it due to the same reason as (iii)?
