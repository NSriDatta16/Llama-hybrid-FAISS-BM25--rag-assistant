CAML from Sharepoint to HTML

I'm invoking one of SharePoint's web service APIs that returns a CAML fragment. I've searched the interweb far and wide but I've been unable to figure out how to make this CAML fragment to render as "normal" HTML that I can render in a more sane environment like Plumtree, WLP, Liferay or any other portal besides SharePoint. Without a way to do this, I'm wondering why Microsoft wrote SharePoint web service calls that return CAML in the first place. Web services are for interoperability and it seems the CAML is only valid within a WebPart running within SharePoint. [Note to Bill and Steve: that's not interoperability.] If I can't do anything with the CAML that comes back, I'm just going to call a different web service that returns only data and then write my own UI. I was hoping for an easier path. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
