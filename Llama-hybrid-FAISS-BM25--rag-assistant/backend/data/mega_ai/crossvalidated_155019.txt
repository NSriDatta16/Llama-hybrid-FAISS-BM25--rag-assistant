The proper analog of univariate moments in a multivariate setting is to view the exponent $\mathbf{k} = (k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n)$ as a vector, too. The exponential notation with vector bases and vector exponents is a shorthand for the product, $$\mathbf{y}^\mathbf{k} = y_1^{k_1} y_2 ^{k_2} \cdots y_n^{k_n}.$$ For any such vector $\mathbf{k}$, the (raw) $\mathbf{k}^\text{th}$ moment of the random variable $\mathbf{Y}$ is defined to be $$\mu_\mathbf{k} = \mathbb{E}\left(\mathbf{Y}^\mathbf{k}\right).$$ To motivate such a definition, consider a univariate moment of a linear function of $\mathbf{Y}$: $$\mathbb{E}\left(\left(\lambda_1 Y_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n Y_n\right)^m\right) = \sum_\mathbf{k} \binom{m}{\mathbf{k}}\lambda^\mathbf{k} \mu_\mathbf{k}$$ where the sum occurs over all $\mathbf{k}$ whose components are whole non-negative numbers summing to $m$ and $\binom{m}{\mathbf{k}} = m!/(k_1!k_2!\cdots k_n!)$ are the multinomial coefficients. The appearance of the multivariate moments on the right hand side shows why they are natural and important generalizations of the univariate moments. These show up all the time. For instance, the covariance between $Y_i$ and $Y_j$ is none other than $$\text{Cov}(Y_i, Y_j) = \mathbb{E}(Y_i Y_j)- \mathbb{E}(Y_i)\mathbb{E}(Y_j) = \mu_{\mathbf{k}_i + \mathbf{k}_j} - \mu_{\mathbf{k}_i}\mu_{\mathbf{k}_j}$$ where $\mathbf{k}_i$ and $\mathbf{k}_j$ are the indicator vectors with zeros in all but one place and a one in the indicated location. (The same formula elegantly yields the variance of $Y_i$ when $i=j$.) There are natural generalizations of all univariate moment concepts to the multivariate setting: a moment generating function, cumulants, a cumulant generating function, central moments, a characteristic function, and algebraic and analytical relationships among them all.
