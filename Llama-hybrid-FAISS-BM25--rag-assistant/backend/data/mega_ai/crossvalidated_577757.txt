From Wikipedia In the frequentist interpretation, probabilities are discussed only when dealing with well-defined random experiments. The sunrise problem is not a well defined experiment. So the answer is that a "frequentist" will not be dealing with that problem. As far as "frequentists" exist. It is not something like a religion like a statistician uses either only frequentist methods or only Bayesian methods. A scientist or a statistician is using whatever tool, frequentist or Bayesian, they prefer, like and/or is best applicable. They can use both. But let's put all that asside. When we bluntly apply a frequentist approach to the problem then we could use for instance model the situation 'the event of a sunrise on a particular day' as a Bernoulli distribution with a parameter $p$ and each day an independent event from the others (which is absurd, but that is because the sunrise problem is absurd). Then the frequentist could compute the likelihood and determine the maximum, which is $p=1$ . One could also compute a confidence interval, which the rule of three would state as $1-3/n$ to $1$ , where $n$ is the number of days that the sun has risen. It is unclear why the many worlds are needed and where this comes from? Maybe to turn this into a well-defined (thought) experiment with a long run frequency of failed and successful estimations? Yes that seems artificial, but the frequentist approach should not have been used in the first place.
