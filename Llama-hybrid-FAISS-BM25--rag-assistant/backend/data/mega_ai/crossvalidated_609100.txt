You might use an elo rating, but whether it is a good model depends on your game. An elo rating relates to an underlying latent variable similar to a probit model where each player has some performance score distributed according to a normal distribution (or a logistic distribution when we use the approximate logistic regression model) and a game is modelled as each player drawing a performance for the particular game from those individual normal distributions, and the player with the highest performance wins. This approach becomes problematic when the performance is not independent from the opponent, for instance whether there is some asymmetric rock paper scissors effect. In Chess it works reasonable, you have chess players with different styles but it works out reasonably, there is not too much variation in the game. In other games, for instance card trading games, players may have startegies with large variations that work out vary different depending on the opponent. If an elo-system makes sense for your game, then you can apply it also for games with multiple players. You could apply an elo rating updating scheme. But also, you could solve the model for all games at once. In the case of chess this would be a binomial regression model. In your case with multiple players this becomes a multinomial regression model. Potentially you could add additional variables for Cases when specific players encounter each other (to get a rock paper scissors effect) with few players and many games you can include parameters for individual interaction, for many players with few games you could try to define categories of playing styles. Some sort of PCA could be interesting here. Based on the matrix of wins against other players you can consider the principle components of that matrix as a model for the win probability. other variables that may influence the game. Possibly some players are better at games with many players and other players are better at games with few players.
