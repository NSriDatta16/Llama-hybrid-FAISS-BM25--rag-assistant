Your question, as I understand it, is this: So, how is the class label defuzzified and then we can say with a confidence that 85% probability that the shopper is shopping for furniture if the input patterns are labelled under Class 3. I use the following to understand defuzzification: - http://www.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/examples/defuzzification-methods.html - http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~rij/newrep/node16.html Have you considered something like this: - http://sipi.usc.edu/~mendel/publications/FLS_Engr_Tutorial_Errata.pdf It contrives the FL problem so they allow direct and parallel comparison with feedforward neural networks. Have you considered radial basis function networks? They can be trained to give outputs of mahalanobis distance given inputs of the parameters. Mahalanobis distance can be converted to probability density.
