Is 50% correct a floor effect in recognition experiments?

In a memory recognition experiment, participants have to indicate whether an item was previously studied or not. Because the only possible answers are yes or no, even guessing it would be expected to get at least 50% correct. However, in my experiment, I have people who obtained less than 50% correct. Would that be considered a floor effect? It is a time series experiment and the 50% correct was found at the very last measurement, where it is more normal to have forgotten all the studied information
