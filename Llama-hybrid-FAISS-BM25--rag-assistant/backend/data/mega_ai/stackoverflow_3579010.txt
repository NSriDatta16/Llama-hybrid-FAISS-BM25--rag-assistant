Objective-C, iPhone RSS Reader Application Query - How to organize your RSS Feed Display into groups?

I've been very unfortunate with my programming. I am still rather new to Objective-C, but I am trying to learn as quickly as possible. I need to complete an RSS Reader for iPhones application, a relatively simple one which parses the rss feed, displays it in a navigation-table view and when you click on an article you are taken to a main page. Unfortunately, I am having difficulty with the parsing aspect. Currently, the program downloads all the articles, but I would like to display it in lists of 10, along with a next button at the bottom. Once the next button is clicked, the parsing continues and the next 10 are on display. I am sorry but I cannot show you the code I am using at the moment as I am on my home computer and the project is on the office mac. If anyone could give me some Ideas i would be most grateful. I have tried a number of methods (making an additional array to act as an article counter so I could record which article is which for which list, for example) but i keep running into roadblocks as I just dont know how to use the program well enough to do that. Please, I am in a lot of need! Thank you.
