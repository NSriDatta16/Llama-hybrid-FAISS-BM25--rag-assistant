System is a namespace. Namespaces are used to organize your code and cope with naming issues. The class DllNotFoundException is part of the System namespace so its full name is System.DllNotFoundException . If you include a using System; into the header of your file you can use all classes from System namespace without specifying the full name, resulting in DllNotFoundException .
