Can't Drag Items Onto An Empty List Using Scriptaculous Sortables

I have three unordered lists that have been created as Scriptaculous Sortables so that the user can drag items within the lists and also between them: var lists = ["pageitems","rowitems","columnitems"]; Sortable.create("pageitems", { dropOnEmpty: true, containment: lists, constraint: false }); Sortable.create("rowitems", { dropOnEmpty: true, containment: lists, constraint: false }); Sortable.create("columnitems", { dropOnEmpty: true, containment: lists, constraint: false }); How can I make it so that if the user drags all the items out of a list, they're able to put them back again? At the moment it won't allow items to be dragged onto an empty list.
