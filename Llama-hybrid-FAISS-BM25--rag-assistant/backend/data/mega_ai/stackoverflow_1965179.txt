Drag/drop ins Data Grid View -Row and column are always -1

I am trying to take text from a list box control and put it into a particular cell in a data Grid. I am using the following code: private void DG_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { DataGridView.HitTestInfo theHit = DG.HitTest(e.X, e.Y); int theCol = theHit.ColumnX; int theRow = theHit.RowY; MessageBox.Show(theCol.ToString() + " " + theRow.ToString()); } By the column and row coordinates are always -1. I suspect the X and Y coming in need to be adjusted somehow, but I am not sure how or if this is the problem. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated...
