Deep Learning based time series forecasting

According to the paper "Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods: Concerns and ways forward", it looks like the recent DNN-based approach has weaker predictive power in extrapolation, i.e. time series forecasting than statistical algorithm like VAR or ARIMA. The benchmark result is contrary to the current Deep-Learning-beats-it-all trend. Is the reason behind the result from the fact that DNN algorithms require a large-sized data?
