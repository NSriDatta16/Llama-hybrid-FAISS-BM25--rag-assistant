Should I always detrend time series, even for machine learning algorithms like trees? Are there drawbacks?

I plant engineer asked me to analyze some data they have regarding production. It has multiple materials quantities, machines parameters, and final product quality (which he wants to predict). The data has a time stamps every 3 hours for the last year, 25 parameters (all continuous variables). I tried to detrend the series but a colleague says this could backfire - I didn't really understand why. I am new in this position and have a lot to learn so any advice will be really appreciated.
