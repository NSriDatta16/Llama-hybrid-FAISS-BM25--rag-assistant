As per the UIResponder Class Reference , you will also need to implement – touchesBegan:withEvent: and – touchesEnded:withEvent: . After you implement these methods, you should be able to get enough data to implement a pathing bezier curve or other suitable solution. [ edit ] A perhaps better solution would to be to obtain the touches directly from the UIEvent object once your controller receives a – touchesMoved:withEvent: notification. Also, the GLPaint sample code may also prove helpful.
