Paragraph tags in Conflict with Meyer's Reset in IE7?

Working on a rather small, and simple layout, I decided to use Meyer's CSS Reset rules to clear some of the expected discrepancies between browsers. All was working fairly well until I decided to add a few paragraphs into a couple nested divs. Once I placed the paragraph-tags within the second nested div, the background images of both the parent, and the grant parent divs vanished in IE7. Removing the paragraph tags (and going with untagged-text) returns the background images. Additionally, leaving the tags and removing reference to the reset.css file restores the background images. Obviously I don't want to go with either of those routes to solve this issue. Any CSS gurus here know what is taking place? Demo: http://www.sampsonresume.com/projects/patriot-depot/
