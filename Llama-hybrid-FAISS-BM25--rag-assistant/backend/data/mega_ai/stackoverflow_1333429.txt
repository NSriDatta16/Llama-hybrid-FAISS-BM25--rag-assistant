Meanwhile, I found another way to do this. It's less elegant, but it only uses one substitution so I've thought I'll post it here also. The idea is to use Hold on the Plot so it wouldn't get evaluated, do the rule substitution and then ReleaseHold , just before the Manipulate . Manipulate[ReleaseHold[ Hold[ {Plot[x[t], {t, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> {0, 1}], x[4]} ] /.NDSolve[{x'[s] == -a x[s], x[0] == 1}, x, {s, 0, 10}] ], {{a, 1}, 0, 5}]
