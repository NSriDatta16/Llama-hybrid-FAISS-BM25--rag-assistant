How do you know where to strike the balance between good ol' trusty server code that works every time and fast, fancy, shiny jQuery that works pretty much every time, except when the user may have JavaScript turned off? It may sound blunt, but favoring to less than 5% of users ( and declining ) is unfair. It will just be the cause of a user-interface nightmare for you as well. Just remember to draw the distinction between server and client. Server-side code is just that: Code that belongs on the server and doesn't affect how the client sees the end-product; let's just say that it is immutable for the client. Displaying the end-product is mutable and at times is encouraged to change rapidly to provide a more in-depth user experience.
