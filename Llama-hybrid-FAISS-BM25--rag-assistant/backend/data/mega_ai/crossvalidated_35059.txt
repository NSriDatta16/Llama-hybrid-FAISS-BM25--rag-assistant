I voted for and second the use of wavelet and spectrogram based analysis as an alternative to dft. If you can decompose your series into localized time-frequency bins, it reduces the fourier problems of aperiodicity and non-stationarity, as well as provides a nice profile of discretized data to compare. Once the data is mapped to a three dimensional set of spectral energy vs. time and frequency, euclidean distance can be used to compare profiles. A perfect match would approach the lower bound distance of zero.* You can look into time series data mining and speech recognition areas for similar approaches. *note that the wavelet binning process will filter the information content somewhat- If there can be no loss in the compared data, it might be more suitable to compare using euclidean distance in the time domain
