How to pool (average) hazard ratios?

Let's say the task did not allow me to use either the MICE package or RMS / HMISC to perform survival analysis on multiply imputed data. I had to impute 5 different data sets and calculate separate hazard ratios in each of these. I need to pool the hazard ratio from each set to one "average" / "pooled" hazard ratio but how is that done? I've searched the web but can't find no formula or package that would facilitate this. Now, there are plenty of information on pooling hazard ratios for meta-analyses but recall that my estimates originate from the same data which was used to impute 5 complete data sets.
