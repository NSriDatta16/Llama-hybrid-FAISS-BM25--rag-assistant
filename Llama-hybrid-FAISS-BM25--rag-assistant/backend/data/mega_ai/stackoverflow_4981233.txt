Xcode 4 and GData compile problem

After upgrading to the GM version of Xcode 4 I can't compile my projects that make use of GData (e.g., YouTube API provided by Google). In particular, it complains about GDataFeedYouTubeVideo because it does not recognize it. This is the exact same project that compiled just fine in Xcode 3.x. In Xcode 3.x, you use to be able to drag a folder from one project to another project. Looks like this feature is removed from Xcode 4. Does anybody know how to do this in Xcode 4?
