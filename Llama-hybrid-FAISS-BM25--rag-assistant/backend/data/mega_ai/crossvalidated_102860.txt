To truly assess the characteristics of the undecided voters who are more likely to vote for each of the candidates, you would need a dataset with known outcomes. More specifically, if you had this current data with their actual votes in the next election appended to it, you be able to compare undecided voters who voted for candidate A vs. candidate B across variables such as gender, economic status, etc. Since you do not possess these known outcomes (next election voting results), you could look into unsupervised learning techniques such as neural networks or clustering. My expertise does not lie in these areas, but I bet someone reading this can provide more sufficient detail! I hope this helps!
