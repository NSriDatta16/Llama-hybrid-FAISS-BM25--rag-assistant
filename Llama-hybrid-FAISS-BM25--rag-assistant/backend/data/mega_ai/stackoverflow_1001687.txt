Actually... You can write the entire implementation in a file. Templated classes are all defined in the header file with no cpp file. You can also save then with whatever extensions you want. Then in #include statements, you would include your file. /* mycode.cpp */ #pragma once #include class myclass { public: myclass(); dothing(); }; myclass::myclass() { } myclass::dothing() { // code } Then in another file /* myothercode.cpp */ #pragma once #include "mycode.cpp" int main() { myclass A; A.dothing(); return 0; } You may need to setup some build rules, but it should work.
