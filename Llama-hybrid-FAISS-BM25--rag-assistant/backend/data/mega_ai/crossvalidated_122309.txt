Can we average over a Cauchy random variable?

Assume $X$ is a standard Cauchy random variable with density $f(x)$, and define a continuous transformation $Z= g(X)$. What happens with $$E(Z) = \int f(x)g(x)dx = ?$$ Does it exist /is finite? Are there some general results for classes of functions, or one has to examine the issue case-by-case, for each specific $g()$? I understand that if for example $g(x)$ is of the form $g(x) = x^k, k \in \text{N}$, then we are looking at the raw moments of the Cauchy itself, so if $k$ is even $E(Z)$ will be infinite, while if $k$ is odd, $E(Z)$ is undefined. Any other such conclusions? I feel this is basic but somehow what I know (or remember) about integration theory does not seem to help me here.
