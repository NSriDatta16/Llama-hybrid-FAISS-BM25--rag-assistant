First lets talk about how to organize your data.Lets assume you organize your in a spreadsheet, where columns represent your features and rows your different samples. Imagine you asked 3 people about their sex and age, then you get a spreadsheet with 3 rows (3 people) and 2 columns (sex, age). Now you can interpret every row as a single feature vector. In our example case the feature vector would have 2 dimensions (sex, age). Instead of physics the (euclid.) magnitude of the feature vector might have no direct usage for us, since the dimensions come from different domains (in contrast compare a velocity vector). Nevertheless we could compute the magnitude (after normalization). On the other hand the direction of the feature vector is important, since it represents the feature values itself. All in all feature vectors should not directly be interpreted as you do in physics.
