How to structure this group of related Java classes?

So I've been wondering how to best structure some Java classes I have. The original structure is a hierarchy of three classes: BaseData&Behavior | extends | BaseData&Behavior_WithExtraData&Behavior | extends | BaseData&Behavior_WithExtraData&Behavior_AndAlsoTwoMoreViewsAndCalculationsOnTheBaseData New features are desired that make us want a class like: BaseData&Behavior_AndAlsoTwoMoreViewsOnTheBaseData This class would not fit neatly into the existing hierarchy! How to create this new class without duplicating code, and in the most elegant fashion? In Ruby or Scala I could use a Module or Trait, for example. I'm thinking that the way to do it in Java is to make the AndAlsoTwoMoreViewsAndCalculationsOnTheBaseData code go into a class that both BaseData&Behavior_AndAlsoTwoMoreViewsAndCalculationsOnTheBaseData and BaseData&Behavior_WithExtraData&Behavior_AndAlsoTwoMoreViewsAndCalculationsOnTheBaseData would delegate to. What do you think is the best way to structure this in Java? Thanks, Alex
