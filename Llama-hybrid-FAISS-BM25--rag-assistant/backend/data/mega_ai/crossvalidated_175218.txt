Note that predict has a "type= c("link", "response", "terms")" argument: type the type of prediction required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors; the alternative "response" is on the scale of the response variable. Thus for a default binomial model the default predictions are of log-odds (probabilities on logit scale) and type = "response" gives the predicted probabilities. The "terms" option returns a matrix giving the fitted values of each term in the model formula on the linear predictor scale. Default is link but you are looking for response . Is it typical of logistic regression ? Not that I know. It is mostly a choice of implementation, both quantities can be useful depending on the situation. Python sk-learn implements both predict_proba and predict_log_proba .
