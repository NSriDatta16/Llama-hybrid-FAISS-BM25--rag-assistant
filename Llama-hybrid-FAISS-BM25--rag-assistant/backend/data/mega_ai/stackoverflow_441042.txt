Enterprise Service/Data Buses for a new company's infrastructure?

I'm designing a system for a new business and am in a unique "carte blanche" position. Like every business it plans to last a long time and grow to an indeterminate size. Is it worth while going whole hog and developing a full enterprise architecture with explicit data and service buses where each layer is a webservice of some kind... or should I design the smallest system that could possibly work and just plan on growing it organically as time passes. From my experience organically grown â„¢ systems are the worst kind to inherit in my opinion so I'm wondering what the community thinks? Are we at the stage where it's a bad practice to develop a business without these layers, even if it's small? Thanks
