ConvLSTM2D is an implementation of paper Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting that introduces a special architecture that combines gating of LSTM with 2D convolutions. The architecture is recurrent : it keeps is a hidden state between steps. TimeDistributed wraps a layer and when called, it applies on every time slice of the input. Here you would need the input of shape $B \times T \times a \times b \times c$ (where $B$ is batch, $T$ sequence length, $a$ , $b$ and $c$ are dimensions of every time slice). layers.TimeDistributed(Conv2D()) will iterate over the first dimension and independently apply a 2D convolution on tensors of shape $B \times a \times b \times c$ . No gating, no recurrence going on.
