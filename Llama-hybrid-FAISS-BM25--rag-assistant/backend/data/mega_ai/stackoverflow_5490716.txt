Jenkins (or Hudson) can run anything you can run from the command line as part of the build process. If you specifically want to use LCOV, you can: Install LCOV on the build server, add a build step that executes it and archive the artifacts. Add an LCOV installation into your repository and add a similar build step. If you're after a code coverage tool, the Cobertura plugin might be what you're looking for.
