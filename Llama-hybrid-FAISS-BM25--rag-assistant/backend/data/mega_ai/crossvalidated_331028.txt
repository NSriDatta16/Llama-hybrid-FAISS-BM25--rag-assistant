When you use PCA, you are creating new variables which are linear combinations of your original variables. So, instead of using the original 15 variables, you use the 7 components. The rotated component matrix tells you how to create the new components using your original variables. For example, the first component is given by: $$ Y_1 = 0.724 V9 + 0.695 V6 + 0.619 V11 + 0.13 V1 + \cdots + 0.120 V5 + 0.294 V15 $$ You then use these components in your regression model.
