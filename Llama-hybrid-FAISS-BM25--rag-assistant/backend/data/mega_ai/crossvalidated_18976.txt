Forecasting a "chaotic" time series

Here are four graphs, 1, autocorrelation, autocovariance, partial-correlation and cross-correlation calculated from a time series are given. 2, The time series I need to do some predictions on them. My questions are 4 : 1, I do not quite understand what these four graphs can tell or show. Can anyone explain? 2, Does the four subplots tell if it is appropriate to do forecasting for the time series 3, If so, any method to do forecasting? 4, I am wondering if particle filter can be used. I am a little clueless about this problem.
