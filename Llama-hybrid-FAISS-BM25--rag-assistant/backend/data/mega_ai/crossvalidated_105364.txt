First: I am not sure that the number of comments is a good indicator for the likelihood of an answer. Maybe it's a nonlinear relationship? E.g.: Zero comments are a bad sign, while a few comments are a good indicator and dozens of comments are indicating a wild discussion but no obvious solution? (this hypothesis is based on my feeling of stackoverflow). Second: Do your data capture the time of the upvote or comment? Many comments and upvotes are occuring when the answer was given, so they have not influence whatsoever. Try to capture the number of comments / upvotes immediately after the answer. Third: I would second @ssdecontrol: Use a simple t-test to compare group means. Or is logistic regression a requirement? Last: which fields are also available?
