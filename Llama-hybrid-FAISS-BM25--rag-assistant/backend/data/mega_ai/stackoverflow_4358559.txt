Wicket 1.4 EJB Support

I tried implementing the JavaEE Inject jar from Wicket Stuff. (glassfish v3, wicket 1.4) - however, the code given in the tutorial doesn't work method addComponentInstantiationListener in class org.apache.wicket.Application cannot be applied to given types required: org.apache.wicket.application.IComponentInstantiationListener found: org.wicketstuff.javaee.injection.JavaEEComponentInjector looks to me like the API has changed. The JIRA link inside http://wicketstuff.org/confluence/display/STUFFWIKI/JavaEE+Inject and the Repository link are both broken. Is it still maintained? Another short question: Is it possible to populate ListView directly with entity beans? I'd like to avoid too many proxy classes. Thanks in advance
