There are a few details I'd like you to clarify (would put into comments on the q, but it is actually easier to remove from here when you update your question). What is the intended usage of data, insert once and get the counts many times, or your inserts and selects are approx on par? Do you care about insert/update performance? What is the engine used for the table? (heck you can do SHOW CREATE TABLE ...) Do you need the counts to be exact or approximately exact (like 0.1% correct) Can you use triggers, summary tables, change schema, change RDBMS, etc.. or just add/remove indexes? Maybe you should explain also what is this table supposed to be? You have record_id with cardinality that matches the number of rows, so is it PK or FK or what is it? Also the cardinality of the date_updated suggests (though not necessarily correct) that it has same values for ~5,000 records on average), so what is that? - it is ok to ask a SQL tuning question with not context, but it is also nice to have some context - especially if redesigning is an option. In the meantime, I'll suggest you to get this tuning script and check the recommendations it will give you (it's just a general tuning script - but it will inspect your data and stats).
