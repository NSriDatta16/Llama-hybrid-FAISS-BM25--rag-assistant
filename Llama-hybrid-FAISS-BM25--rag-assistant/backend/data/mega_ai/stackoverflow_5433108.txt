This is kind of strange question from my point of view. This write-after-write situation you mentioned is a logical error . Compilers detect mostly syntax errors . In some cases logical error may reveal themselves as syntax errors but not always. A logical error means that you made a mistake in implementing your algorithm. You can notice it only upon testing. Or you can also try static program analysis (as steabert mentioned). I'm also interested if there are C++ compilers with such warnings, and if there are Java IDEs that provide such warnings, but right now I'm focusing on the Fortran side of things. Take a look at functional programming languages. Due to immutability write-after-write situation just can't happen. ;-)
