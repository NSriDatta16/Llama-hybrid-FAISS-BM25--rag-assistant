WPF : using a designed vector image as a control template in WPF

I am exploring the idea of using professionally designed vector images as the ControlTemplates in my WPF application. The idea is to make several types of controls, each with a different visual design, which can then be dragged and dropped. This is exactly the same use-case as a visual designer (a'la visio) I have the following XAML. It defines a control template with a target type of Button, and I have a Button which uses this template. What I want to know is how can I modify this template so that it will use only the height and width of the Button. It seems to me as if the Template renders itself relative to the top-left corner of the button (If I move the button the image moves) but it takes no account of the dimensions of the button, so it keeps its "designed" size no matter what I do. Hi there
