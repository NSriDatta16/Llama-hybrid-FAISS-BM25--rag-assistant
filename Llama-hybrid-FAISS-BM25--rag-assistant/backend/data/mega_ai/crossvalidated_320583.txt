ML method to identify data subset with lower average values?

I have a task where I need to find anomalous groups of observations [y,X] by the average value of y, using the feature set X. A good interpretation is that these are customers and I want to find the most valuable ones. (Note, this is actually separate from a classification problem, which I would use decision trees.) This lead me to "Subgroup Discovery", but this is a field I'm unfamiliar with and I don't know the mainstream methods in it. For example, regressions, decision trees and NN are methods in classification methods, but I don't know the standard methods for SD. Can someone confirm subgroup discovery is what I want and give point me in the right direction with some concepts (maybe just search keywords) of common methods used in this field for my problem?
