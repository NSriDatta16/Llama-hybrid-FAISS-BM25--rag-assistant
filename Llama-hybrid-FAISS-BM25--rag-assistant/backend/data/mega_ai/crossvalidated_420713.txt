Something else that you could try is to analyze your data using a linear mixed effects model which includes: Fixed effects for patient sex and disease state ; Random effects for subject and brain region . The outcome variable would consist of brain perfusion (presuming you can treat it as a continuous variable - from what I could see via Google, there may be multiple ways to quantify brain perfusion). In R, you could fit this type of model with the following syntax: m It is not clear from your answer whether disease state (aka state) is a predictor whose value (i) can change from one brain region to another or (ii) is the same across all brain regions. If (i) is true, then you can add a random effect for state across regions by replacing (1|region) with (state|region) in the syntax provided above. If (ii) is true, then the above-stated model would be adequate. You can then test contrasts (or comparisons) of interest based on the coefficients of the fixed effects in your stated model (i.e., the coefficients for the main effects of sex and state and their interaction). See Robert Long's answer to this thread for the idea that inspired my response: Mixed Effects Model with nested data . I will tag Robert to my answer so that he can chime in as well.
