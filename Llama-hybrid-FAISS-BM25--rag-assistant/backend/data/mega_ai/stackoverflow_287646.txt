Looking for *small*, open source, c# project with extensive Unit Testing

(I asked this question but did not receive much response. It was recommended that I ask the same question with regards to C#. ) I am a VB.NET developer with little C# experience (yes, I know I need to write more in C#), looking for small open source projects that demonstrate high unit testing coverage from which to learn. I'm looking for small projects because I don't want to have to wade through a ton of code to get a better understanding of how to apply unit testing in my own situation, in which I write mostly IT business apps used internally by my company. UPDATE: Original question that got me asking about this is here
