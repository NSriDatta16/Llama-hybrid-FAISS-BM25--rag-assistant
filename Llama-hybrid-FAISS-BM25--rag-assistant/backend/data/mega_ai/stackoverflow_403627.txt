From my answer here : As regards a practical use for Extension Methods, you might add new methods to a class without deriving a new class. Take a look at the following example: public class extended { public int sum() { return 7+3+2; } } public static class extending { public static float average(this extended extnd) { return extnd.sum() / 3; } } As you see, the class Extending is adding a method named average to class Extended . To get the average, you call average method, as it belongs to extended class: extended ex = new extended(); Console.WriteLine(ex.average()); Reference: http://aspguy.wordpress.com/2008/07/03/a-practical-use-of-serialization-and-extension-methods-in-c-30/ As regards Performance , I think you can see an improvement with Extension methods since they are never dispatched dynamically, but it all depends on how the dynamic method is implemented.
