Classifying the Next Call

Suppose I have calls that come from handsets A, B, C, and time series data aggregated like so: CallDateTime Buckets 1/11/15 4:52 PM A 1/11/15 7:00 PM B 1/11/15 10:43 AM C I have this data from 1/11 to 2/1, where each call has come in and has been stamped with either an A, B, or C. I want to predict the likelihood at any time of the next call being either an A, B, or C. How can I do this in R? I'm looking to improve on using historical averages, but I'm not even sure where to start or what to search to be honest. Thanks very much for any help.
