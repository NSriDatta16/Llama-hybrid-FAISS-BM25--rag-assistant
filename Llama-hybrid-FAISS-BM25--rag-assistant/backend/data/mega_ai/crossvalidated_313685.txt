Quantify similarity between self-organizing maps (SOMs)

What would be a valid similarity measure to quantify the (dis)similarity between two different datasets processed using the same trained version of a self-organizing map (trained on the combination of both datsets)? What I mean is, each instance from the first dataset will be assigned to a specific node, giving rise to representation $R1$. Every instance from dataset 2 will also be assigned to a specific node, giving rise to representation $R2$. How do I quantify the dissimilarity between $R1$ and $R2$? Would similarity measures for count data be appropriate, counting the number of datapoints assigned to a certain node of the map?
