Equal representation of variables in Principal Component Analysis

I have 8 variables that I want to combine into one performance score. I am doing PCA and taking the first three components (~62% of variance), then adding the three scores for each record from these components to get one final score. My question: four variables load high on the first component, three load high on the second component, and one variable loads high on the third component. Does that mean that the last variable that is loading high on the third component will have more impact on the final score than the other variables? I am asking since I want equal representation for all variables in my final score. Thank you for your help in advance.
