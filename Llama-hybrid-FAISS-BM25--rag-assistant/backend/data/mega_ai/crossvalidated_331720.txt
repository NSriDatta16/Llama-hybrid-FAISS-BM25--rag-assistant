Structural change analysis validity in case of auto-correlated data?

I attempted to assess the "significance" of some environmental alteration through the identification of break points in a diagnostic time series (using R strucchange package). The results (number of break-points were selected based on the BIC criterion) indicate a significantly altered regime prevailing since ~2008-present (and another, prevailing over 1984-1998). My concern is that the original time series can not be considered strictly as random. In particular, it is significantly auto-correlated for lags of 1 and 2 years. Therefore, I wondered : about the validity of concluding for a significant regime shift. if there is a way the method should be adapted to account for auto-correlated signals, or, alternatively, if some transformation may be operated on the time series before a similar analysis to ensure that the conclusion holds (for instance, the data are slightly non-normal, but a Box-Cox transformation does not change the conclusions). Thanks for your suggestions !
