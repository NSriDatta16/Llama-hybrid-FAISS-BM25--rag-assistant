Let's decipher formulas in the paper: $$RMSE = \left[ \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - x_i)^2 \right]^{1/2}$$ this one is pretty clear: RMSE is a square root of averaged square difference between $y_i$ and $x_i$ where $y_i$ is an observed frequency and $x_i$ is a frequency predicted by the model. The formula for $R^2$ they provide is more complicated: $$R^2 = \frac{ \sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - z_i)^2 - \sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - x_i)^2 }{ \sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - z_i)^2 } $$ It is ambiguous since authors describe its parameters as "Where: $y_i$ is the actual data, $x_i$ is the predicted data using the Weibull distribution, $z$ is the predicted data using the Weibull distribution, $N$ is the number of observations", so $x$ and $z$ seem to mean the same thing and it would not make sens. However, they quote other paper they wrote that describes $z$ as an mid value of $y$.
