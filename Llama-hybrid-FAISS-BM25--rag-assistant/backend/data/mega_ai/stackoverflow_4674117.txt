Open a file stored on a shared area from ASP.NET

I need another time your help! I'm working on a web application that stores some Office document (and any other kind of doc) on a remote shared area. I need to allow user to view the files available on shared area using my web application, how can I do that? Some years ago I solved this issue with Java / JSP opening into an output streaming the file, how can I do the same with ASP.NET and VB.NET? there is another way to solve my issue? This is how I organized my application: C:\Webapp -> Webapplication \remoteserver\sharedfolder -> shared area The owner of IIS process is the only user that can write / read the shared area. I want thanks you all in advance! bye, Andrea
