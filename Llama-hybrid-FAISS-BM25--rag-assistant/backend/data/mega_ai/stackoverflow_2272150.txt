The best and typical way is to add this to a header in your WCF message - and that would be perfect in a message contract. Why do you not want to add it to the message contract?? WCF typically encourages a "per-call" methodology - you send all necessary info with your call, each and every call that is. It is discouraged to have any kind of "state" that lingers around between calls. So again: why not just include your authentication string as a header in every message? That's the preferred way of doing things these days. UPDATE: Check out Nicholas Allen's blog post on Adding Headers to a Call . Besides adding them to the message contract, you could also check out the Message Inspector sample he links to, which creates a message inspector that automagically adds those header entries to each outgoing call. No code clutter, no mess, nothing - just works.
