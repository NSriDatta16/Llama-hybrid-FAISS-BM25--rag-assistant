Is there a javascript drag&drop that works on iPad and PC

I am looking for a javascript plugin that supports drag and drop for both touch and mouse enabled devices (IOS, Andriod) (PC, Mac). Example for touch: http://www.midemos.com/demos/iphone/touch/?/iphone/touch/ Example for mouse: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ Is there a plugin that supports drag drop across touch and mouse based devices? I understand touch devices uses different events, but I dont see a reason why a plugin can't support both interfaces. Thanks.
