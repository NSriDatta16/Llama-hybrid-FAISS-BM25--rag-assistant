I ended up using this query which may not be the most efficient, but it works. My biggest problem was I didn't know how to do sub queries properly. query = From final In _ (From subfinal In _ (From countdata In _ (From a In _ (From aa In db.table3s _ Where aa.appcode = "neo" _ Where aa.success = True _ Group By aa.emplid Into Group _ Select emplid = Group.Min(Function(f) f.emplid), _ stampMin = Group.Min(Function(o) o.stamp) _ ) _ Join j In _ (From jj In db.table1s _ Where jj.empl_rcd = 0 _ Group By jj.EMPLID Into Group _ Select EMPLID = Group.Max(Function(m) m.EMPLID), _ EffDate = Group.Max(Function(z) z.effdt) _ ) _ On j.EMPLID Equals a.emplid _ Join jorg In _ (From jj2 In db.table1s _ Where jj2.empl_rcd = 0 _ Select jj2.EMPLID, jj2.Org, jj2.effdt _ ) _ On j.EMPLID Equals jorg.EMPLID _ And j.EffDate Equals jorg.effdt _ Select j.EMPLID, a.stampMin, j.EffDate, jorg.Org _ Distinct) _ Where countdata.stampMin StartDate _ Group By countdata.Org Into Group _ Select count = Group.Count, Org = Org _ ) _ Select subfinal.Org, subfinal.count _ ) _ Join d In _ (From dd In db.table2s _ Select dd.ORG, dd.ORGANIZATION_DESCRIPTION, dd.DEPARTMENT_DESCRIPTION, _ dd.VP_COLLEGE_DESCRIPTION _ ) _ On final.Org Equals d.ORG _ Select final.count, final.Org, Org_desc = d.ORGANIZATION_DESCRIPTION, _ Dept_descr = d.DEPARTMENT_DESCRIPTION, Coll_descr = d.VP_COLLEGE_DESCRIPTION Hope this helps someone else...
