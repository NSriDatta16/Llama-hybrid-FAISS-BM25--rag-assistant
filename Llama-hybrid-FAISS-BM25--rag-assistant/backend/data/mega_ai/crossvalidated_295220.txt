How do I test for trend in sum of random variable?

I have a dataset with cost measurements for hospital admissions of ~25,000 patients over multiple years. Cost seems to be log-normal distributed and taking the logarithm results in an approximately normal distribution. Using this transformation, I have analysed differences in the average cost across years using one-way ANOVA. Can I do a similar test on the total costs (i.e. sum) across years? The only thing I could come up with is testing for a linear trend using a linear regression of the sums on year. However, this leaves me with only 8 instead of 25,000 data points, which intuitively strikes me as throwing away a lot of information.
