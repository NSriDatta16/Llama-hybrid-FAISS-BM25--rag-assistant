You're right: "Embedding SQL statement in your code is not bad." It is terrible. Doing so makes your application highly coupled, brittle and difficult to maintain. At least, if you have it all in procs, when you alter something, you can do a search on dependancies. stored procs, I feel really need to go away too for those procs that are handling business logic. The reason is that business logic belongs in the business layer - not the data layer. Of course, if the generated Linq to SQL turns out something messy & slow, you've got to use a proc. One of the great advantages of Linq To SQL is that you can chain together filters - you're where clause is just added dynamically via your logic as required. You don't need to create new procs just because you want to call for a set of data based on multiple params.
