The problem was definitely caused by running the application off of the network drive. This put the application into Partial Trust which is preventing writing to the ApplicationData directory. Isolated Storage was supposed to work around this but I haven't had any luck with it either. It produces the exact same error as using other File IO commands directly. One thing that DOES work is to install the .NET 3.5 framework which changes the default trust level for applications running on network shares.
