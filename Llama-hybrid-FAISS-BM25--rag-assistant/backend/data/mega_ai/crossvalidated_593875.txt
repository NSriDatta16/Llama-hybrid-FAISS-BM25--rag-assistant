How to deal with multicollinearity in r

I am using metafor package for my meta-analysis. As part of the meta-analysis, I did a meta-regression analysis where I found out there is a multicollinearity issue across the variables I used. Is there any way to deal with it in metafor package? I was suggested to use bayesian model averaging (BMA) . I am doing an ecological meta-analysis where my effect size is computed with response ratio (treatment/control , in such case, is it still possible to use BMA ?
