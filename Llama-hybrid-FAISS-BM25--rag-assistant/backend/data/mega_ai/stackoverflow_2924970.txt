I think it should work. What are you afraid of? Proxy settings, firewall? I think running web server locally isn't hard for power user but it could be a problem for average user (even integrated with your app). Probably You should run your app as service because forcing user to start server before entering web page, could be frustrating. I would prefer other solutions. I would probably use Java (Swing) or C++ with QT. But I like Your approach, especially that it allows easy prototyping. If You prefer web style development you could try http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-desktop-application-development/ it creates desktop apps using html+java script +webkit. But I didn't tried it my self (but I would like to). Also Adobe Air could be probably good option for You.
