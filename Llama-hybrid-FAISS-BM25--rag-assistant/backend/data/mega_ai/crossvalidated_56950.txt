Neural network with skip-layer connections

I am interested in regression with neural networks. Neural networks with zero hidden nodes + skip-layer connections are linear models. What about the same neural nets but with hidden nodes ? I am wondering what would be the role of the skip-layer connections ? Intuitively, i would say that if you include the skip-layer connections, then the final model will a sum of a linear model + some non-linear parts. Is there any advantage or disadvantage in adding skip-layer connections to neural nets ?
