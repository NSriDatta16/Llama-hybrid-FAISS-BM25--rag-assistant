Sounds like you're looking for the Don't Fragment (DF) flag. It gets set on a per packet basis in the flags of the IP header . Anything sent larger than the MTU with DF set will result in an ICMP error message being generated. Without DF set the router may fragment and send. There are a lot of broken systems out there which either eat the ICMP error (crazy paranoid firewalls) or otherwise behave oddly. RFC791 provides details on the rules for fragmenting IP datagrams. Typical MTUs are 1500 bytes. The minimum MTU for IPv4 is 576, whilst for IPv6 it is 1280. Gigabit ethernet and other links often support much larger MTUs.
