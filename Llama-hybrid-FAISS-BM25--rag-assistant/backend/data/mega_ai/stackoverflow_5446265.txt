As you are not showing all the code, I can only speculate that you have defined inspect or to_s to build a string containing, among other things the parents. Your current parents method doesn't seem to be doing anything reasonable, as it returns all organisations that are companies, no matter which association you start from. Thus, any company has itself as parent. Attempting to convert it to string will induce an infinite loop to try to show the parents' of the parents' of ... In any case, the bulk of your parents method should be in a helper, called something like options_for_parents_select , because that's what it seems to be doing? Even then, the first empty choice should be passed as allow_null to select. The fact that it sets instance variables is a code smell. Good luck
