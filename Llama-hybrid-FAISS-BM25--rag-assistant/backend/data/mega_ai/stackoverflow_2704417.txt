Why is Go so slow (compared to Java)?

As we could see from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game in 2010: Go is on average 10x slower than C Go is 3x slower than Java !? How can this be, bearing in mind that Go compiler produces native code for execution? Immature compilers for Go? Or there is some intrinsic problem with the Go language? EDIT: Most answers deny intrinsic slowness of Go languge, claiming the problem resides in immature compilers. Therefore I've made some own tests to calculate Fibonacci numbers : Iterative algorithm runs in Go (freebsd,6g) with the same speed as in C (with O3 option). The dull recursive one runs in Go 2 times slower than in C (with -O3 option; with -O0 - the same). But I haven't seen 10x fall as in the Benchmarks Game.
