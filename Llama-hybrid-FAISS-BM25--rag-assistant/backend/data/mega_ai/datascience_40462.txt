How to prepare the varied size input in CNN prediction

I want to make a CNN model in Keras which can be fed images of different sizes. According to other questions, I could understand how to set a model, like Input =(None,None,3) . However, I'm not sure how to prepare the input/output datasets. Concretely, now I want to combine the datasets with (100,100) and (240,360). However, I don't know how to combine these datasets.
