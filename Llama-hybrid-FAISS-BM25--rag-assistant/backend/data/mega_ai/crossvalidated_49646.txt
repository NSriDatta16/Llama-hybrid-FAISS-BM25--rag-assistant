For a random matrix, shouldn't a SVD explain nothing at all? What am I doing wrong?

If I construct a 2-D matrix composed entirely of random data, I would expect the PCA and SVD components to essentially explain nothing. Instead, it seems like the the first SVD column appears to explain 75% of the data. How can this possibly be? What am I doing wrong? Here is the plot: Here is the R code: set.seed(1) rm(list=ls()) m Update Thankyou @Aaron. The fix, as you noted, was to add scaling to the matrix so that the numbers are centered around 0 (i.e. the mean is 0). m Here is the corrected image, showing for a matrix with random data, the first SVD column is close to 0, as expected.
