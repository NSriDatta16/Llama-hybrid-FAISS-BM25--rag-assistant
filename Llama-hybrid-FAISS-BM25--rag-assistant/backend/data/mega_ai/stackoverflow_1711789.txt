Including HTML fragments in a page - methods?

This is an extension of an earlier questions I asked, here: Django - Parse XML, output as HTML fragments for iFrame? Basically, we're looking at integrating various HTML fragments into a page. We have an small web app generating little fragments for different results/gadgets, at various URLs. This is not necessairly on the same domain as the main page. I was wondering what's the best way of including these into the main page? We also need the ability to skin the HTML fragments using CSS from the main page. My initial thought was iFrames, however, I'm thinking the performance of this might not be great, and there's restrictions on CSS/JS manipulation of the included fragments. Are SSI a better idea? Or should we use php includes? or JS? Any other suggestions? The two main considerations are performance of the main page, and the ability to style/manipulate the included fragments. Cheers, Victor
