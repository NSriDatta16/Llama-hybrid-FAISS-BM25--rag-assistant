Apply SVM on LDA in python

hope someone kindly put time here, my approach is like this: TFIDF -> LDA -> SVM I am using LDA to extract topics. I want to do topic modelling and use the topics as features to do document classification. I know that I have to send the feature vector to SVM, but my question is that how can I make this feature vector to send to svm? Is featureValue here is the probability assigned to each word? My question is kind of the step 3 in the below link that I dont know how to do it svm on lda but in this link there is no implementation, that is just explanation. Many thanks for your time:)
