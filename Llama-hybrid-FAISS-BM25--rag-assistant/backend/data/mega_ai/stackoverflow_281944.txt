To add on to a few others' comments, I currently am running with the following modifier key set up: Caps-lock = Control Control = Option Option = Inactive Command = Command Under Emacs (btw, you mentioned Aquamacs, go with Emacs.app instead) I then specify via the preferences to have Option = Command and Command = Option. This places the two most used keys (C and M) just off the home row and just off the space bar, which I've found to be very comfortable to use. To go with Emacs.app, just use MacPorts to install it sudo port install emacs-app Also, I'm going to put my encouragement in there with everyone else; You have to try this for an extended period of time or you will not stick with it. Go through the tutorial multiple times (C-h t), browse through the Info manual (C-h r), if you don't know how to use Info, go through the Info manual (C-h i h) (it's really an incredible documentation system), and for about 30 of the best tips I've ever heard written in a really concise manner, visit Yegge's old effective Emacs post . Beyond all that, really turn off everything else and just go for it. When you come up against something you don't know how to do, take the opportunity to research it, repeat it a few times, and then move on. You'll slow down a lot at first but afterwards you will be much more efficient at editing any sort of text out there.
