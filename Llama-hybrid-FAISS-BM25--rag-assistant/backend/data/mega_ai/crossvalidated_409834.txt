Alternatives to The Statistical Sleuth?

I am looking for a simple and concise book on statistics (t-test, ANOVA and all its variants, linear regression, etc.), centered on data analysis. I am not interested in theory or proofs, but just want to know what test is appropriate under what conditions, preferably with some real world examples. E.g., "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by G. James et al. does this for machine learning. The only book I could find that vaguely fits that description is "The Statistical Sleuth," but it's not available at my local library. Is there any other alternative like that?
