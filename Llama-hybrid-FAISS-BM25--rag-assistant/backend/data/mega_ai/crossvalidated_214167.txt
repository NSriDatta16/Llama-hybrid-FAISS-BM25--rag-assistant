VIF interactions

I would like to check for multicollinearity in logistic regression analysis. Independent variables are categorical (always binary) and continuous. Sample has limited size (N=176, 36 events), so I can use 2, max. 3 variables. Can I use VIF as an indicator for multicollinearity in final model? What if I have in final model 2 categorical (binary) and one continuous? Does it make sense to use VIF? Are there any others SIMPLE options? (SPSS) I have searched all over internet but could not find an SIMPLE (excluding complicated formulas) answer concerning VIF with categorical variables. I am using SPSS 22.0 and my field is heart surgery, not statistic. Any suggestions? (instead of finding a statistician).
