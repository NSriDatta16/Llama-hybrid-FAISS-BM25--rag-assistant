Not sure what the performance would be with this suggestion, but the by far easiest if you just want to avoid fetching the XML files every time your activity re-launches, is to save them to Internal Storage . When your activity (re-)launches, you'll start by checking if the files exist locally before you fetch them from the web. You would of course need come kind of logic to tell whether an XML file is "out of date" (you could have a simple database table with file names and last-fetched dates), and you would probably also like to have some kind of clean-up logic to delete files when you no longer need them so they don't fill up unnecessary space.
