MySQL Rating system (calculating average from two tables)

I have two tables, videos and videos_ratings . The videos table has an int videoid field (and many others but those fields are not important I think) and many records. The videos_ratings table has 3 int fields: videoid , rating , rated_by which has many records (multiple records for each fields from the videos table) but not for all records from the videos table. Currently I have the following mysql query: SELECT `videos`.*, avg(`videos_ratings`.`vote`) FROM `videos`, `videos_ratings` WHERE `videos_ratings`.`videoid` = `videos`.`videoid` GROUP BY `videos_ratings`.`videoid` ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 0, 12 It selects all the records from table videos that have a rating in table video_ratings and calculates the average correctly. But what I need is to select all records from the videos table, no matter if there is a rating for that record or not. And if there aren't any records in the videos_ratings table for that particular videos record, the average function should show 0. Hope someone could understand what I want... :) Thanks!
