IMO, the goal of cleaning/preprocessing is to remove the "randomness" of the impact of missing/dirty values. Machine learning is just mathematics. And this specific set of mathematics require numbers to work with. An empty value doesn't represent a number. For example if I take a simple linear regression example where : ${y=a*x+b}$ where ${x=\emptyset}$, what is the algorithm supposed to output? By cleaning the data, eg. adding the mode value, you minimize the impact of the missing data on your algorithm. Also, don't forget that missing data is often just that, missing . If the variable height of ${x_1}$ in my... tree classifier (example) is null , it's not because the tree doesn't actually have an height, it's just because it is absent in the dataset. So, to answer your question, we need to generalize to deal with real world problems (missing data) while having the smallest impact possible on our prediction.
