For me there are two categories of 'unfinished project'. The first is (as Robert said) projects that never really finish. The best example is Searcharoo.net which has had 7 iterations but still has a long way to go, if it is to perform all the tasks it should. I will continue to work on the code as long as people keep emailing me about it - but it goes for months without any attention; then I might concentrate on it for a week before another long period. The key thing that gets me working on it is an interesting problem to solve . Mundane bugs or 'simple' features or tidying the code never motivates me as much as needing to do something tricky. Other things that I have started because they seemed cool/fun, but stopped when I solved the initial problem and got bogged down in 'generic code' (you know: membership/login, robust error handling, UI tweaking) include: RaceReplay.net - which was written originally in WPF/E :) and updated for SL1 -- although this has recently been re-activated since the MS SL VE Map Control. Sat for well over 12 months without any action though RecipeNow.net - originally written in .NET 1.0, updated for 2.0 and planned to re-write in MVC (one day...). I've even started (but not finished, of course) an iPhone version. There are grand plans for membership, contributions, sharing, community... all started but not finished... SilverlightEarth.com - MS/google map viewer written in Javscript and WPF/E;SL1, long before DeepZoom. Half-done 'Ink' support. Half-done map rotation. Half-done SL2 migration... the half-working code is on the website for everyone to see (it's Javascript - just view-source to see all the crap hacks and TODOs) Geoquery2008.com - SQL 2008 geospatial query tool. Spent a solid chunk of time over about 2 months getting it 80% of the way to a "real" product... but it has stagnated since then as an 'almost useful' tool. DeepZoomPublisher.com - this one is very sad, as I have written the 'Console Application' back-end (and posted examples of how it works) but never got around to writing the promised Windows UI nor actually publishing the code itself... so if you go to the website you get to see examples of what it does, but you can't really find the application that does it :-( my bad. To answer the other part of the question - I never intentionally delete them, although I have "accidentally" tidied up my PCs and somehow deleted all copies of one or two 'half-done projects'. VERY frustrated at myself - because I like to have the option of coming back to finish them... even if I never do ;-) Network Solutions are happy, though, as whenever I get excited about a new project I register a domain name for it. I think blogs - particularly those where the author is knowledgeable and kind enough to write little examples/samples - take the place of 'unfinished projects' for some people. If you have a cool idea you just code up the minimum to demonstrate how cool it is - post it on your blog and leave it at that! (unfinished)guilt-free :-)
