Plot data with small differences but large scales

Suppose you have some measurement series with quite different variances, see e.g., figure below. The problem is that the differences between a, b, and d are barely recognizable, because the y-scale is rather large, because of the first measurement (these are no measurement errors, they are quite essential and can not be ignored). What is the most elegant way to plot the data without losing too much information. Two possibilities come to my mind: a) Leave the first measurement out, and supply it otherwise (e.g., in the text or as a table). b) Make the y-scale exponential (inverse of log). However, this is quite uncommon (how do you do this with R?). What would you suggest?
