Conditional Exact Logistic Regression

I have paired data for two tests. I would like to say that Test A is more sensitive than Best B, but not sure if I'm using the correct methods or if my data support it. I know McNemar's Exact test can be used to determine a statistical difference, but I would like to go further. My data are as follows: Data Test_compare; input ID : $2. test :$ 1. pos :$1.; datalines; 1 A 1 2 A 1 3 A 1 4 A 1 5 A 1 6 A 1 7 A 1 8 A 1 9 A 1 10 A 1 11 A 1 12 A 1 13 A 1 14 A 1 15 A 1 16 A 1 17 A 1 18 A 1 19 A 1 20 A 1 21 A 1 22 A 1 23 A 1 24 A 1 25 A 1 26 A 1 27 A 1 1 B 1 2 B 1 3 B 1 4 B 1 5 B 1 6 B 1 7 B 1 8 B 1 9 B 0 10 B 0 11 B 0 12 B 0 13 B 0 14 B 0 15 B 0 16 B 0 17 B 0 18 B 0 19 B 0 20 B 0 21 B 0 22 B 0 23 B 0 24 B 0 25 B 0 26 B 0 27 B 0 ; proc logistic data=test_compare; strata id; class test (ref='B') / param=ref; model pos(event='1') = test; exact test / estimate=both; run; I have used Conditional Exact Logistic Regression which has produced the following Exact Odds Ratio: Exact Odds Ratios Parameter Estimate 95% Confidence Limits p-Value test A 26.914 * 5.855 Infinity Is this saying the odds of a positive result with test A are 26.9(5.855, +INF) times greater than that of Test B? Thank you for your help!
