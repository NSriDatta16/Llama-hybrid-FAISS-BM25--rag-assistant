using regex in sqlite or mysql

I'm using sqlite3 to try and find users who have an e-mail address that is either with Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail. It needs to do this just on the basis of the first part of the domain, so I want any address that had the @yahoo to be accepted. It appears from documentation that it is not possible to use a regular expression when querying an sqlite database. Is there any elegant way of doing something similar? It doesn't seem to be possible to use a "like/in" with multiple options (eg: LIKE (%@yahoo%, %@gmail%, %@hotmail%)? Failing that, I may switch over to MySQL for a reg exp as I want to keep the solution simple and elegant and DB isn't a major factor. How would said regexp query be written in MySQL?
