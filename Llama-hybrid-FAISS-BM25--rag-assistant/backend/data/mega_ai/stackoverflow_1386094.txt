Multiple databases have no performance advantage over multiple schemas (namespaces) that I can see (except perhaps if you have an incredibly large number of tables). CREATE TABLESPACE allows you to put whatever you want wherever you want on the filesystem, so the physical storage can be controlled by you in either case. The main difference will be when you query across multiple schemas, it's much better than querying across multiple databases. Also, you may be able to share more connections via a connection pooler if it's all in the same database.
