In which languages can I estimate a VMA model?

In which languages/environments are there tools to estimate a vector moving average model of a given order? That is, given $q\in\mathbb{N}$ and a multivariate time series $y_t\in\mathbb{R}^d$ , $t=1,\dots,T$ , a function that returns best-fitting (in some sense, ML for instance) matrices $\Theta_i\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ such that $y_t$ is generated by the process $$y_t=u_t+\Theta_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + \Theta_q u_{t-q},$$ where $u_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are iid random variables (for instance, multivariate Gaussians)? I'd be especially interested in open-source languages such as Python or Julia.
