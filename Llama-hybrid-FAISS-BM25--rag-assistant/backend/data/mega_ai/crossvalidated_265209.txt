No, it's not guaranteed, but if the solution has no alpha in that open interval, then we have a "degenerate" SVM training problem, for which the optimal w=0, and we always predict the majority class. This is shown in Rifkin et al.’s “ A Note on Support Vector Machine Degeneracy ”, an MIT AI Lab Technical Report. Does your problem have these characteristics? It seems unlikely this would happen with naturally occurring data.
