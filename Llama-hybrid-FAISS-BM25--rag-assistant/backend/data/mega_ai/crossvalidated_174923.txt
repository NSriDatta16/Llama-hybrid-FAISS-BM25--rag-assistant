Checking if a time series is weak-sense stationary

I just learned that a time series is called weak-sense stationary if: 1 $\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \mu$ is independent of $t$. 2 $\operatorname{Cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)$ is independent of $t$ for each $h$. I am trying to check this for the following time series: $X_t=b+Z_t-Z_{t-1}$ with {${Z_t}$} ~ $WN(0,\sigma^2)$. It is quite easy to see that $\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \mu$ is independent of $t$, but how can you check condition 2? When trying to calculate $\operatorname{Cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)$, I end up with the following: $\operatorname{Cov}(Y_t,Y_{t+h})=\operatorname{Cov}(b+Z_t-Z_{t-1},b+Z_{t+h}-Z_{t-1+h})\\=\operatorname{Cov}(Z_t,b+Z_{t+h}-Z_{t-1+h})-\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{t-1},b+Z_{t+h}-Z_{t-1+h})\\ =\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{t+h},Z_t)-\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{t-1+h},Z_t)-\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{t+h},Z_{t-1})+\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{t-1+h},Z_{t-1})$ It isn't clear to me how I can conclude that $\operatorname{Cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)$ is or is not independent of $t$ for each $h$.
