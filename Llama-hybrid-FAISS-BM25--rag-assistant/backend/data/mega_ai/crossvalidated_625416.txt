This probably isn't the best approach, but I anticipate you don't need best, you just need "good enough". Given your control isn't a typical "control" in the sense of a randomized experiment, you should use something called a "Difference in Difference" approach. Basically, fit the following model $$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 t \cdot x + \epsilon_i $$ $\beta_0$ is the average number of visitors in the control group in the pre-period $\beta_1$ is difference in average visitors in the control between pre and post periods $\beta_2$ is the difference in average visitors between control and group $i$ in the pre period, and $\beta_3$ is the difference in group $i$ between how they actually evolved in time and had they evolved like control. This relies on the parallel trends assumption. I'm not going to give an entire lesson on difference in difference, but it would be a good idea for you to review the method, interpretation, and assumptions made therein. Assuming this is a valid approach (I'll comment on why it might not be and why you might still use it anyway a little later), we can estimate the differences for all groups at the same time. Using R... library(tidyverse) data.frame( stringsAsFactors = FALSE, time = c("Week 23","Week 24","Week 25", "Week 26","Week 27","Week 28","Week 29","Week 30", "Week 31","Week 32","Week 33","Week 34"), control = c(8590L,9217L,9534L,10213L, 10435L,10932L,11489L,10936L,11856L,10621L,9905L, 9812L), G1 = c(1492L,1588L,1599L,1714L, 1704L,1817L,1948L,1974L,2061L,1851L,1852L,1850L), G2 = c(2929L,3138L,2992L,3440L, 3187L,3180L,3566L,3707L,3885L,3926L,4051L,3621L), G3 = c(2837L,2846L,2812L,3005L, 2987L,3234L,3159L,3273L,3609L,3586L,3372L,3203L) ) -> d md % mutate(t = rep(0:1, each=6)) %>% pivot_longer(control:G3, names_to = 'group', values_to = 'y') fit |t|) (Intercept) 9820.2 181.4 54.133 What you care about are the coefficients that start with t:group . Those are the $\beta_3$ type coefficients for each group. Associated estimates and p values are shown there as well. There is probably a better way to do this using fixed effect estimation, but I don't think you need that and this might be good enough for your purposes.
