One method is to install an Unhandled Exception Filter and then write a minidump from it which you can then upload to some place of your choosing. I wouldn't totally disregard Windows Error Reporting -- that's an addition to any crash reporting of your own. If your application is for public release then registering for Windows Error Reporting is well worthwhile as you get information about which crashes users are encountering in the wild and when crashes have been fixed you can add a response code to point them to a new version or other relevant information. Another tool that may be useful depending on how your application is deployed in your organisation is to run Adplus on a user's machine which will collect together crash dumps. This is more useful for one-off crashes that seem to affect an individual user but aren't reproducible in a development environment.
