After some consultation, I decided to use a logistic regression. I performed one regression using a binary response (presence or absence of sand lance in the diet), and another using success/failures (# sand lance in the diet vs. # of other fish in the diet). For this, I had to use a quasibinomial distribution due to over-dispersion. Both models gave similar answers.
