Re the openFileOutput() method on the Context class to open a file for writing, what internal storage file path does it write to? It points to where getFilesDir() on Context returns. You can tell this because the documentation says: Returns the absolute path to the directory on the filesystem where files created with openFileOutput(String, int) are stored.
