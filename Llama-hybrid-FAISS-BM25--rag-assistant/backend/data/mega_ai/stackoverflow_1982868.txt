How normal should my checkbox data be for storage in database

I have a web form with about 15 checkboxes that users may check 0 or all 15 checkboxes and any quantity in between. The database that will store the form data is MySQL, but reports will be generated from the data in MS Access using a MySQL ODBC connection. I see three options for handling this. The Spreadsheet way: Have one table with a boolean column for every checkbox and a text box for "Other" The Normalized way: Have two tables, one with the form data other then the checkbox info. Then a second table containing the FK of the form data and the value of the checkbox in a one to many relationship. Handle the inserting of the checkbox values separate from the insertion of the form data with some looping when the form is processed. The Short way: Have one table with a text field for the checkbox data. When processing the form concatenate checkbox values into a comma separated string and put that in the text field along with the other data. Both the Access way and the Short way are enticing because of the ease in which they can be used to generate reports, the Short way especially. Unfortunately, while I prefer the normalized way no one in my organization who develops the Access parts knows how to generate reports that use the normalized data properly, at least not cleanly. Both The Access way and the Short way can be problematic when filtering by checkbox values (the Access way more so). How should I proceed in this? If I go the normalized way I will also have to take responsibility for developing a tool to generate reports, which may step on a few toes and be a bit of a political wrangle. I stick with what they are using already (The Access way) increasing my immediate workload and buying myself a mess of programming problems down the line, but avoiding any office politics. Or the hybrid way which costs a bit of programming now and some annoyance later, has only a few obstacles in other project members?
