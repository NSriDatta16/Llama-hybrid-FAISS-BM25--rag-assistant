Well, for all the browsers besides IE you can use the CSS 3 rgba, that sets the color and the alpha, but only for the background (if you set it on background-color, of course). For example, this is how 60% transparent black background color will look in CSS: background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.60); For IE it is more complicated, but there is a great guide for it: http://www.daltonlp.com/view/217
