I am adding this here since I do not have reputation to comment. The question requires some more clarity on the following statement. But the problem is i don't know which type of svm should i use, because i extract three lession features (MA, HM, and EX) You will need to provide more information to set the context of your problem. For now I will assume you are using a single task - single model setting which basically means that you have one feature set and a single model. The model will try to learn that feature set and make predictions. Now if you are only concerned about the multiclass vs multilabel then the only question you should be asking is will any of you samples ever fall into multiple classes (normal, mild, moderate, severe, PDR), that is can a sample fall into 2 classes say normal,mild (you need to decide if this makes sense)? If the answer to that question is "No" then https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html#multiclass-classification If the answer to that question is "Yes" then https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html#multilabel-classification Additional Reference: Multitask Classification : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html#multilabel-classification
