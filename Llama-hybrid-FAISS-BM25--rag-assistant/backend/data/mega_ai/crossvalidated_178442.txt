State-of-the-art in Collaborative Filtering

I am working on a project for collaborative filtering (CF), i.e. completing a partially observed matrix or more generally tensor. I am a newbie to the field, and for this project eventually I have to compare our method to other well-known ones that nowadays, proposed methods are compared against them, namely state-of-the-art in CF. My search revealed the following methods. Indeed I came across them by looking at some of these papers and their references, or by looking at experiments section when they do comparisons. I would be happy to know for a new proposed method and to do a comparison with SoTA, which of the following would be a good pick to do so? If not among them, I would be happy to know a good representative.
