Gestures like swipe and drag aren't handled for you; you pretty much have to do the work yourself. In my app, I've made a UIView subclass to do this. You'll want to override the following: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event A few random tutorials on the subject here and here .
