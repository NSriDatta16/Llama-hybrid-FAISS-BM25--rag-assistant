Which is better, save a website images on Amazon S3, Flickr or Picasa?

I have a website and going to extend it, so users will upload their images on this website, i want to save users images in another storage service. Users will save images and view them, and also share with others. I know that i can do that using Amazon S3, Flickr or Picasa. But i want to know which is better than which? which one should i use and why? Based on your experiences, can you recommend one, or advice me if you a better service than those 3?
