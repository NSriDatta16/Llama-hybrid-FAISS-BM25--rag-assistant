This one is not "hidden" so much as it is misnamed. A lot of attention is paid to the algorithms "map", "reduce", and "filter". What most people don't realize is that .NET 3.5 added all three of these algorithms, but it gave them very SQL-ish names, based on the fact that they're part of LINQ. "map" => Select Transforms data from one form into another "reduce" => Aggregate Aggregates values into a single result "filter" => Where Filters data based on a criteria The ability to use LINQ to do inline work on collections that used to take iteration and conditionals can be incredibly valuable. It's worth learning how all the LINQ extension methods can help make your code much more compact and maintainable.
