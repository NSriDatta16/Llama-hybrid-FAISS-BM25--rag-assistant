Ordinal Logistic Regression in R - Understanding coefficients

I am creating an OLR model using R with the polr function in the MASS package. All of my predictors are also ordinal data, all of the data is the integers from 1 to 5 coming from a customer survey. I am aware that the coefficients you obtain are log odds ratios, and I am familiar with taking the exponent to find the odds ratios. What I don't understand is the following points: 1) What do the polynomial terms actually represent? Because the coefficients are the same if I change the scale to be say from -2 to 2, so I assume the data is transformed into some standard labelling and then squares, cubics etc. are taken. 2)How do I interpret these polynomial coefficients?
