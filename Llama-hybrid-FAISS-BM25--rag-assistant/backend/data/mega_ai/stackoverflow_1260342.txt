The OSGi standard property for specifying whether the bundle cache should be purged on framework startup is org.osgi.framework.storage.clean org.osgi.framework.storage.clean - Determines whether the bundle cache is flushed. The value can either be "none" or "onFirstInit", where "none" does not flush the bundle cache and "onFirstInit" flushes the bundle cache when the framework instance is first initialized. The default value is "none". This is a relatively new one (in fact, it is still a draft, find it in the R4.2 Draft under section 4.2.2), but it should work in recent Equinox versions, I guess.
