Ideas for factor analysis and PCA: # get some Big 5 personality data and pretend we only have cor matrix and n library(psych) bfi Canonical correlation analysis I don't think CCA or cancor takes correlation matrices as input. You could use one of the sem packages in R to perform canonical correlation analysis. I know that sem can take a correlation matrix as input.
