How random is Random.Next()?

I have been doing some testing on the Random class and I have used the following code: while (x++ I kept changing the rnd max limit (i.e. 5000000) and I changed the number of iterations and I got the following result: 1) if y = rnd.Next(1, 5000) : The average is between 80 to 110 iterations 2) if y = rnd.Next(1, 5000000) : The average is between 2000 to 4000 iterations 3) if y = rnd.Next(1, int.MaxValue) : The average is between 40,000 to 80,000 iterations. Why am I getting these averages, i.e. out of 10 times I checked for each value, 80% of the time I get within this average range. I dont think we can call it near to being Random. What can I do to get a fairly random number.
