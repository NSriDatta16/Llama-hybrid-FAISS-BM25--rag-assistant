You are adding a complex type (StackPanel) as the items of your combobox. When you access the SelectedItem property of your combobox you are getting back the instance of the StackPanel object. That is the extent that the combobox knows about it's items. It has no idea what is inside the StackPanel. Like Myermian said you would need to crawl the visual tree in some way to figure out what you want. The hacky way is to take the StackPanel instance you get back and call StackPanel.Children to get it's children then iterate those and find what you want. However, that is a very fragile and generally not recommended approach. What you really want to be doing is data binding the combo box and separating the UI from the data in the list. This way you can access the data you want (the text box value) regardless of the UI structure of the item
