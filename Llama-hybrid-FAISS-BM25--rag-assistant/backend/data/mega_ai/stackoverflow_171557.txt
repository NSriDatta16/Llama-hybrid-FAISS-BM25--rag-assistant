The problem you are seeing is related to "data aliasing" due to limitations of the FFT being able to detect frequencies higher than the Nyquist Frequency (half-the sampling frequency). With data aliasing, a peak in real frequency will be centered around (real frequency modulo Nyquist frequency). In your 20 Hz sampling (assuming 70 Hz is the true frequency, that results in zero frequency which means you're not seeing the real information. One thing that can help you with this is to use FFT "windowing". Another problem that you may be experiencing is related to noisy data generation via single-FFT measurement. It's better to take lots of data, use windowing with overlap, and make sure you have at least 5 FFTs which you average to find your result. As Steven Lowe mentioned, you should also sample at faster rates if possible. I would recommend sampling at the fastest rate your instruments can sample. Lastly, I would recommend that you read some excerpts from Numerical Recipes in C ( Section 12.0 -- Introduction to FFT Section 12.1 (Discusses data aliasing) Section 13.4 (Discusses FFT windowing) You don't need to read the C source code -- just the explanations. Numerical Recipes for C has excellent condensed information on the subject. If you have any more questions, leave them in the comments. I'll try to do my best in answering them. Good luck!
