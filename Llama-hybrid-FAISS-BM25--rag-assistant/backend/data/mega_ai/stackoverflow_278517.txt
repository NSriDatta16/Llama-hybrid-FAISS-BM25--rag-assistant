If you mean that you want to start Eclipse with some command line arguments, there is no file where you can add those to be used as default. But you can make a small script that will start Eclipse with the arguments you want, something like: /Applications/Eclipse.app/Context/MacOS/eclipse some command line arguments and then add executable permissions to your script, through Terminal window: chmod 755 your_file you can just type " chmod 755 " on the terminal and then drag and drop the script file on the terminal window, it will type the file's full path onto it, press ENTER and that's it. You can double-click your script file and it will start up Eclipse with the command line arguments you typed.
