Data storage to ease data interpolation in Python

I have 20+ tables similar to table 1. Where all letters represent actual values. Table 1: $ / cars | A user input could be for example, (2.4, 24594) which is a value between f, g, j, and k. My Python function definition and pseudo-code to calculate this bilinear interpolation is as follows. def bilinear_interpolation( x_in, y_in, x_high, x_low, y_low, y_high ): # interpolate with respect to x # interpolate with respect to y # return result How should I store the data from table 1 (a file, a dict, tuple of tuples, or dict of lists), so I can perform the bilinear interpolation most efficiently and correctly?
