simple time series db

I am looking for a simple time series database. The sort of database that could take raw stock tick data for example and for company X and company Y in a split second return end of day data, or data at 3pm, or similar types of query. I dont know what google uses for http://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXDJX however that's the sort of data and speed I am looking for. Some of the high end time series dbs cost the earth and do far more than I need. Are there opensource or nearly-free dbs out there that would be appropriate for this?
