ARIMA modeling with more than one Categorical Variable

I am using auto.arima for forecasting. I have more than one categorical variables having more than one level. My questions are : Do I need to do dummy coding ? If I do dummy coding with my categorical variables, this will result into 20 variables. Is it good to have such number of variables in time series model. How can I do variable selections? I would appreciate any kind of help.
