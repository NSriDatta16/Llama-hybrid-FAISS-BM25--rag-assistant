It IS practical not to use retain counts as a debugging aid. In fact, it's experienced Objective-C coders who will tell you not to pay attention to retain counts. The people who worry about them in general are coders new to Objective-C, and they wind up being confused like you are. You should not worry much about retain counts. The fact that something has more retains than you expect does not necessarily have anything to do with your code and does not necessarily indicate a bug, and the only way to determine which is the case is to use a proper debugging tool like you were advised to do in the first place. In this particular case, 2 is the correct retain count for that object at that point in time because it was created with a retain count of 1, then retained by your setter method.
