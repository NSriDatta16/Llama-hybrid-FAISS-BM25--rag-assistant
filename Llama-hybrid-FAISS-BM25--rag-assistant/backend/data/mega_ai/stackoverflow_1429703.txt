How to include files with HTTPS - PHP

I made a form process and broke the code up into different files to stay clean and organized. Now I am setting up the form for https security. Do all the files I pull into my page have to be called as https as well? In which case I can no longer use include(); as it no longer allows relative paths? Is the solution to use file_get_contents();? Or does only the (master) page itself need to be called as https?
