There is no template because the estimation process has to be tailored to change. There are different approaches to estimation which consider different parts of the process. For instance you can take a factor based approach and assume that testing will take 1.5 times development effort. This is a narrow-minded approach as not all testing effort is equal to 1.5 development effort. Other approaches include doing function point analysis and estimating or estimating how many test cases can be written per day and how many can be executed per day. Do you include data setup in the testing time? Another approach factors in the resources available, the stability of the environment, the skill of each resource and how much they can contribute to the project. In all of this you need to consider what is being tested; a ui, a client-server system; does it include distributed services? Are you testing them? Are you just looking at functional testing or do you need to do some measure of security testing as well as load/performance and stress testing? All of which can take considerable time to execute. Estimation should be done by an experienced tester who has worked on the types of system and preferably within the organisation before. So there is no one template and nor is there a bunch of variables to fill out to come out with an accurate number of time. Testing takes different amounts of time, each and every time you do it. If you have defects then the rework and retest time needs to be included. How many defects will you raise? Not a question you can answer but if Steve is naively providing estimations to his testers he should also indicate how many bugs are still in there. The fundamental thing to remember with estimation is that it is an estimate.
