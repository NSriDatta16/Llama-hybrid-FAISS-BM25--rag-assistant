A fast, easy an often effective way to approach this imbalance would be to randomly subsample the bigger class (which in your case is the negative class), run the classification N number of times with members from the two classes (one full and the other subsampled) and report the average metric values, the average being computed over N (say 1000) iterations. A more methodical approach would be to execute the Mapping Convergence (MC) algorithm, which involves identifying a subset of strong negative samples with the help of a one-class classifier, such as OSVM or SVDD, and then iteratively execute binary classification on the set of strong negative and positive samples. More details of the MC algorithm can be found in this paper .
