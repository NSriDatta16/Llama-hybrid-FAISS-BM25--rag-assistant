I love JQuery . Love it. Want to mate with it. And I hate everything. Don't get me started about anything. I hate it. But I love JQuery. The power and functionality are spectacular. It's well-designed and easy to use. The docs are complete, accurate, detailed, clearly-written, and current. Every function is explained with code samples and a working example. There is a good collection of plugins . There is also the JQuery UI library which provides a whole other layer of functionality -- drag-and-drop, modal dialogs, various controls, etc. I've been using JQuery for years and it has never let me down. I truly can't say that about any other library/language/tool/computer thing that I've used a lot. JQuery is amazing.
