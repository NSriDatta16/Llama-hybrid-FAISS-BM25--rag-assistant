Similarity Measurement between Color Image (OpenCV)

I'm working with a CBIR (Content-based Image Retrieval) project which will draw RGB histogram of images and also calculate the distance between other images with query image. I'm using VS 2008 - MFC and OpenCV Library. The method I wanted to use for calculating the distance is Euclidean Distance(ED), but somehow I failed to work it out. I found a function - cvCalcEMD2() that can help me calculate the distance between two histogram. To use this function, i need to create signature for my histogram. Here is an example for creating signature that I found in the For loop, there is a line where I need to pass in my histogram: float bin_val = cvQueryHistValue_2D( hist1, h, s ); and in my function for histogram don't have something like the variable h_bins and s_bins In my program, I calculate/draw my histogram into R, G and B. means, each image I've 3 histogram. eg: CvHistogram *hist_red, *hist_green, *hist_blue; How do I use my histogram to create signature? *the link to my drawHistogram function is on my comment below
