You're making some basic mistakes in the question. The HTML/CSS/JS combination is different from HTML 5, That combination works just fine with current implementations (ignoring some of the annoyances of IE for the moment.) HTML 5 is a new extended definition of HTML with a number of new features like local storage. HTML 5 is also not completely settled, nor completely supported. You should learn HTML and CSS to start with; in general, you still need a web page in which to embed your Flash stuff. You should get some basic knowledge of Javascript for much the same reason. Conveniently, the Javascript will carry over to Actionscript, which is a variant of the same ECMAscript standard.
