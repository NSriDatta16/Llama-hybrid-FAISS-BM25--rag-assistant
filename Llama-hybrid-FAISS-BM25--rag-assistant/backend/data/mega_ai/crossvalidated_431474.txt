Can anyone hep me to find the probability of the following question please?

The organizers of a banquet at a restaurant have ordered 10 place settings, but they have invited 13 people. Past experience indicates that 15% of the people who are invited independently decide not to come. If more than 10 people come there will be a surcharge of $100 times the number of additional people. What is the expected surcharge?
