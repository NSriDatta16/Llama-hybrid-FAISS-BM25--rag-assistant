I'd use Response.Redirect(Request.RawUrl) method to reset the form data from the server side. A little explanation: this is PRG design pattern Used to help avoid certain duplicate form submissions and allow user agents to behave more intuitively with bookmarks and the refresh button. A workaround for this question: necessary data may be stored in Session for example. This means we getting the data with the first POST, putting it to the storage, performing redirect and getting it back.
