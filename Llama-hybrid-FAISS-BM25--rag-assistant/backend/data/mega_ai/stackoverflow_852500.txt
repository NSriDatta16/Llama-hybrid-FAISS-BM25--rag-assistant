PostgreSQL has a big storage space overhead since every tuple (a prepresentation of a row in a table) is 28 byte excluding the data (PostgreSQL 8.3). There are 2, 4 and 8 bytes integers and a timestamp is 8 byte. Floats are 8 bytes I think. So, storing 1,000,000,000 rows in PostgreSQL will require several GiB more storage than MySQL (depending on which storage enginge you use in MySQL). But PostgreSQL is also great at handling huge data compared to MySQL. Try do run some DDL queries to a huge MySQL table and you'll see what I mean. But this simple data you are storing should probably be easy to partition heavily, so maby a simple MySQL can handle the job nicely. But, as I always says, if you're not really really sure you need a specific MySQL feature you should go for PostgreSQL. I'm limiting this post to only MySQL and PostgreSQL since this question is tagged with only those two databases. Edit: Sorry, I didn't see that you actually stores the CSV in the DB.
