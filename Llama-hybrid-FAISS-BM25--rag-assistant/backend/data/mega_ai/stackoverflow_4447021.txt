The local variable sender is of type id . You're trying to access the text property of sender , which doesn't exist in id (it's a property of UITextField ). The line sender = (UITextField *)sender is uselessâ€”you downcast from id to UITextField* , but then when you assign back to sender , you're upcasting back to id . You should change your code to this: UITextField *textField = sender; // casts from id to other types are implicit [self operationForInput:textField.text inTextField:textField];
