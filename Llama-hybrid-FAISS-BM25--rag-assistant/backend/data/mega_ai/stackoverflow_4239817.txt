Loop in Perl - with LWP::UserAgent

Here the code that has needs to be build in loop - to make USER-Agent to iterate over a bunch of targets. for my $i (1..10000) { my $request = HTTP::Request->new(GET => sprintf("http://www.example.com,%d", $i)); Is this the correct way to iterate? I love to hear from you ... to get a starting-point...
