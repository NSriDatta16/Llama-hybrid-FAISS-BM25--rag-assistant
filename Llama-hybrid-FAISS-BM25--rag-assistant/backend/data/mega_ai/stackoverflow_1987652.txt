copy data from remote server -- got problem

I wanted to copy files from a remote server, but it seems that the remote host is using session, and needs cookies. well I used this method after defining variables... $url="http://example.org/exmple.mp3"; $nn = "\r\n"; $cookies=""; $request = GET . " " . str_replace ( " ", "%20", $url ) . " HTTP/1.1" . $nn . "Host: " . $host . $nn . "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14" . $nn . "Accept: */*" . $nn . "Accept-Language: en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3" . $nn . "Accept-Charset: windows-1251,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7" . $nn . "Pragma: no-cache" . $nn . "Cache-Control: no-chache" . $nn . $proxyauthorization . $referer . $cookies . "Connection: Close"; $fp= socksopen($Proxy,$port, $errno, $errstr, 15 ); socket_set_timeout ( $fp, 120 ); fputs ( $fp, $request ); fflush ( $fp ); //read header $i = 1; do { $header.= @fgets ( $fp, 128 ); $i++; } while ( strpos ( $header, $nn . $nn ) === false ); echo $header; fclose ($fp); now I have the header with cookies that the url said : HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Content-length: 0 Content-type: text/html Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Mon, 28 Dec 2009 13:40:53 GMT Set-cookie: ERIGHTS=5YAaxxmNsMuTK87E1TCAohwDRuyqBaCgM-oehmg24bkzHplCtmgn7zMA==;path=/;domain=.example.org Set-cookie: WLSESSION=1528980108.20480.0000; expires=Tue, 29-Dec-2009 13:40:52 GMT; path=/ Location: http://example.org/exmple.mp3&tag=1 Via: 1.1 proxy-server1 Proxy-agent: Sun-Java-System-Web-Proxy-Server/4. then I did some sting code and built this in the code: $cookies="ERIGHTS=5YAaxxmNsMuTK87E1TCAohwDRuyqBaCgM-oehmg24bkzHplCtmgn7zMA==, WLSESSION=1528980108.20480.0000"; re-requesting the url with same method mentioned above and again i have got same header with another cookies It seams that the remote website is treating me as a first-time visitor each time and sets new cookies gain what is wrong?
