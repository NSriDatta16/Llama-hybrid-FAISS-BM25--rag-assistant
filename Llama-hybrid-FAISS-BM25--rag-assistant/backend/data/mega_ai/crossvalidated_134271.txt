Interpreting ordered logistic regression in R

Lets say I have a predictor variable with the following values: x I want a piecewise linear model with breakpoints at 3, 5, and 7, so I construct 3 new variables: x1 I then use lrm : fit (this is just a simple example, my predictor variable has many more values) Here are actual results: Coef S.E. Wald Z Pr(>|Z|) y>=2 3.2585 0.2496 13.06 =3 1.9381 0.2118 9.15 =4 0.7775 0.1980 3.93 =5 -0.2087 0.1978 -1.05 0.2914 y>=6 -1.4611 0.2058 -7.10 =7 -3.2949 0.2213 -14.89 It is easiest to explain what I would want if this were simple OLS. Basically I want to report the difference in slopes between the second to last segment and the last segment. In OLS, these slopes would be x+x1+x2 and x+x1+x2+x3. Given that the coefficient on x3 is significant, I can say that the two slopes differ. Now I know that ordered logit is quite different. Taking the exponential of the coefficients gives me the odds ratio, or how much the odds of moving up a category in y is influenced by a one unit change in x. Can I just take the ratio of the “slopes?” (x+x1+x2)/(x+x1+x2+x3) What would be the correct interpretation here? What I think I really want here is the log odds of moving up a category when x, x1 and x2 all increase by one unit, compared with the log odds of moving up a category when x, x1, x2, AND x3 all increase by one unit. Any help here?
