Best statistics to show outliers beyond 2 SD

I try to perform scheduling for an organization based on client flows. We are very seasonal. Our senior management in Washington, DC make us base our schedule on the mean number of clients we have annually. However, in summer months the number of clients we see on a daily basis are two SD above the mean. In the winter, on a daily basis, we see very few clients (on many days two or three SD below the mean). I would like to convince management we need to develop two schedules one for the winter (where we are currently over staffed because staffing is based on the annual mean number of clients) and one for the summer (where we are currently severly understaffed because staffing, again, is based on the annual mean number of clients we serve). I have used bar charts showing the numbers above and below 2 SD, but I have to believe there is a more robust stastical argument and graph I can use to make my point. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
