Superposition of two renewal processes

Usually, superposition of two independent renewal processes may not lead to a renewal process. However, in my problem, the interval time between two events of the renewal process is more specific which follows a time shift exponential distribution. To be more specific, now I have two renewal processes whose average rates are $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ respectively. The density functions of the interval time $T_1$ and $T_2$ are $\lambda_1e^{-\lambda_1(t-\beta_1)}$ and $\lambda_2e^{-\lambda_2(t-\beta_2)}$. I was wondering after the superposition, if it is possible to derive a closed form of the average rate and variance of the new/synthesized process.
