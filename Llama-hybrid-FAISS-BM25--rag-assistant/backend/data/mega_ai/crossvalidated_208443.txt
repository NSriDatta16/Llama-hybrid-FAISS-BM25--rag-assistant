Intuitive explanation of logloss

In several kaggle competitions the scoring was based on "logloss". This relates to classification error. Here is a technical answer but I am looking for an intuitive answer. I really liked the answers to this question about Mahalanobis distance, but PCA is not logloss. I can use the value that my classification software puts out, but I don't really understand it. Why do we use it instead of true/false positive/negative rates? Can you help me so that I can explain this to my grandmother or a newbie in the field? I also like and agree with the quote: you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother -- Albert Einstein I tried answering this on my own before posting here. Links that I did not find intuitive or really helpful include: http://www.r-bloggers.com/making-sense-of-logarithmic-loss/ https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-for-the-log-loss-function https://lingpipe-blog.com/2010/11/02/evaluating-with-probabilistic-truth-log-loss-vs-0-1-loss/ https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/LogarithmicLoss These are informative, and accurate. They are meant for a technical audience. They do not draw a simple picture, or give a simple and accessible examples. They are not written for my grandmother.
