I believe in 100% coverage. Also 100% coverage not by simply testing simple interactions by mocking things or just setting and getting things, but more integration/acceptance tests that check functionality. So if you end up writing really good integration/acceptance tests, all of your constructors (and simple methods such as setters and getters) should be called.
