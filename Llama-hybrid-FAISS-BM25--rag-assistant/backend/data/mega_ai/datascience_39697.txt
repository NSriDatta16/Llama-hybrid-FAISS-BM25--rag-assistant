How can we use machine learning to distnguish between similarly looking images

How can I build a model which can distinguish between Milk and Phenyl ? I want to predict whether a given item is edible to eat or not. If I train a model with thousands of photos of Milk and Phenyl which are labelled, Won't the model get confused between them because they look very very similar? No matter how much I train, I will be getting poor results, won't I? Another such scenario is in the case of salt and sugar . I want to know if there is a way to tackle this situation. Please let me know if I can achieve better results with any other approach. Also Please let me know If I'm unclear.
