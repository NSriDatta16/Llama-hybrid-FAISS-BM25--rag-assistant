Another binding to consider for rendering with opengl is pyglet . Its best feature is that it is just one download. I think it contains everything you need to implement what Anurag spells out.

If this is your first exposure to OpenGL, consider a series of tutorials like NeHe Tutorials and other help from the OpenGL website .
