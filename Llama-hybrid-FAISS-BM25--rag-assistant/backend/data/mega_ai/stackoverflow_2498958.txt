Dragging a image in flex

Hi I am having trouble in dragging a image within a loader. I am able to do zooming and rotating image but not moving image with mouse. Purpose is when I zoom a image info is out of boundaries and so is hidden. To see that info users should be able to drag the image any way they want. Please help.
