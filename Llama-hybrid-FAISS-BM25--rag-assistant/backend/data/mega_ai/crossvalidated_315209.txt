Using Principal Component Analysis Based on Sample Covariance? [But really how to get these eigenvalues?]

I have the following sample covariance matrix; $$ S= \begin{pmatrix} 16 & 10 \\ 10 & 25 \end{pmatrix} $$ Now to use PCA I know I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I know how to get the eigenvalues which gives me: $$\lambda_1 = 31.47 , \lambda_2 = 9.53$$ But how do I get the following eigenvectors? $(0.54, 0.84)^T$ and $(0.84 , -0.54)$ Can someone do it step by step for me? I thought I knew how to find eigenvalues by, hand but I've always used whole numbers when learning eigenvectors. EDIT: This is one of the earlier steps to problems involving Principal Component Analysis. My book says, "here are the eigenvalues" and I can confirm that they are the eigenvalues but I have 0 clue how they calculated the eigenvectors. Perhaps I misunderstood PCA?
