TCP port 705 is used by default for AgentX protocol. Master agent listens on this port and subagents send registrations to this port - master agent then knows who is registered. You did not mentioned it, do you use net-snmp? If so, see the Agent FAQ 12 - How can I run AgentX with a different socket address? .
