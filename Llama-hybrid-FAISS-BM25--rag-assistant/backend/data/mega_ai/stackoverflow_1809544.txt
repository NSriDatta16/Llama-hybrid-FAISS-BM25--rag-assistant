Change wording "Special Price" & "Regular Price" in Magento

I am trying to change the wording "Special Price" and "Regular Price" in Magento. I've already tried editing the Mage_Catalogue.csv, reuploading and clearing the cache to no avail. I've also done a giant Dreamweaver search within the entire site for the text "Regular" and "Special" and haven't found anything. I can only conclude that this may be hidden somewhere deep in one of 200 DB tables... If anybody knows where I might be able to change these values I'd be forever grateful. Thank you Jack
