Like JaredPar said you can refer to Josh Smith's article towards Automation. However if you look through comments to his article you will find more elegant way of raising events against WPF controls someButton.RaiseEvent(new RoutedEventArgs(ButtonBase.ClickEvent)); I personally prefer the one above instead of automation peers.
