The MSCUI demo is built by Martin grayson and he has published his Drag Dock control here: http://mightymeaty.members.winisp.net/blacklight.silverlight/ (there are also now some other TileView controls available now from Telerik and Infragistics that also perform the same cool layout functions). However by default this does not support automatic content resizing. Luckily there is a new control in the November 2009 Toolkit: ViewBox that will do what you need with minimal code. There is a demo of this at http://silverlight.net/content/samples/sl3/toolkitcontrolsamples/run/default.html . The ViewBox demo is at the bottom of the menu on the left. Toolkit can be downloaded from http://silverlight.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=36060
