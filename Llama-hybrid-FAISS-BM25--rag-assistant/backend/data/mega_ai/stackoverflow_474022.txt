Perl would be my first choice for the string parsing. Using a RegEx you could parse through that log file in no time. From what I can see it looks like you're dealing with a nicely computer readable file. You could use a Perl hash to do your averaging. You could likely do the same thing with C# and their RegExs if you're more familiar with that, but Perl was built to do stuff like this.
