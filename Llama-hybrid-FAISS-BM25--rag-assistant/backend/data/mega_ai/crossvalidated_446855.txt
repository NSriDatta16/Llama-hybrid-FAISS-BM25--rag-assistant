Does mislabeling due to adversarial noise in features count as adversarial machine learning?

According to the traditional definition, Adversarial machine learning is a technique employed in the field of machine learning which attempts to fool models through malicious input. However, I have mostly seen GANs as an example of an adversarial machine learning algorithm. Does anything that leads to the modification of the performance of the ML model count as adversarial machine learning?
