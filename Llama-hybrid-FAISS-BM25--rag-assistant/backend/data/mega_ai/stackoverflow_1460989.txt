According to this entry , you could use the "workbench activities" mechanism, and: define separate activities corresponding to the different access levels define your actions in regular action sets, grouped according to access level associate each activity with the appropriate action sets via activityPatternBinding elements set the enabled activity ids after authentication, early in the workbench lifecycle, e.g. from your WorkbenchAdvisor 's preStartup() method. (Note, the above was for a filtering based on user's permissions, but it could be generalize to other criteria.) Regarding the preference pages for the storage and help, you should bind the id of those pages with an activity you know you can disable: would disable all menu/preferences/views related to help. If you use org.eclipse.help.ui.PrefPageHelp\..* , it would only bind prefPageHelp and prefPageHelpContent . If you add another activity binding extension with org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui.sec_storage_preferences_context , that would also take care of the Secure Storage preference page.
