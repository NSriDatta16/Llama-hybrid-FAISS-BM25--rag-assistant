Assuming you have a method for quantifying the top X% percent performers, I'd suggest that instead of using a hard coded threshold you analyze the performance distribution and make your cutoff somewhere in the range of the first major drop in performance, and then tuning your crossbreads, mutations, and new organisms to fill in the gaps. This way if you have a very "productive" run in which lots of variations were successful you don't throw a significant number of high performers. Also, if you have an "unproductive" run you can scrap more of the existing organisms in favor of more newer organisms that should be taking their place.
