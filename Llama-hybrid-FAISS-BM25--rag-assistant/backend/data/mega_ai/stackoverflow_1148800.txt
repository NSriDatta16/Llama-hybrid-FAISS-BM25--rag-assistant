If you want to stick to Borland products you can install Turbo C++ . I'm talking about the 2006 Turbo C++ part of the " Turbo Explorer " effort to bring back some of the popularity of the 90's Turbo C++. They brag with "Turbo C++ contains support for the industry standard ANSI C and ISO/ANSI C++ languages and libraries. Turbo C++ also includes the Dinkumware C++ runtime libraries and support for the popular Boost library." I think that a 2006 implementation should be decent enough, somehow not so popular like Visual Studio Express 2005/2008. Regarding the compilation problems, one must fiddle with the two configuration files found in the bin directory (in this case C:\BORLAND\BCC55\BIN), namely bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg. The compiler cannot find the iostream.h file.
