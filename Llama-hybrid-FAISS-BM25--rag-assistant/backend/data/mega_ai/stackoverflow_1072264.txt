OR/M and Sql 2008 table value parameters

By edict, we're using stored procedures for all interactions with our database. By organizational directive, we're using table value parameters in some of these stored procedures, specifically the ones I need to use. By legal edict, we can't use nHibernate or anything under LGPL (though, if necessary, we can fight back on that). Are there any OR/M (object-relational mapper) frameworks out there that support table value parameters into stored procedures? I've already investigated the crap out of Linq to Sql and Entity Framework v1, and I know that it's fundamentally not supported now, and L2Sql will probably never support it. Anything out there, commercial or free? I really don't want to write hundreds of lines of boilerplate to decode the results.
