First you may use string.IsNullOrEmpty() , instead of checking whether the string is null or "" Beside, this should work. You probably reorder it outside of this code. Pay attention this isn't execute until you foreach it (call GetEnumerator() ). So if you change something before iterating it.. that might be the reason. p.s. is TIMECARDDATE is object or string?
