Organizing and grouping commands is an ongoing dilemma in PowerShell. It is something that will always have to be managed. However, there are some best practices around naming cmdlets and functions that can work if you are diligent. You probably have noticed that all cmdlets are in the verb-noun format. IE Get-Process , Set-Item , etc. What a lot of people do is add a third part to the command which groups the nouns together. For example, in the world of Active Directory, you don't have get-user , but rather get-aduser . One thing you could do, and it may not be the prettiest thing, is to name your unit test functions with some 2 or 3 letter sequence of your choosing. Let's say you chose something incredibly original like UT for unit test. Your function would then be function Do-UTSomething { "Something was done" } Once you have all your UT functions, you can use the Get-Command cmdlet to iterate through them like so Get-Command *UT* -commandtype function Also, if you go a bit further and package them into a module, you could do one better and sort by that module. Get-Command -module MyUnitTest You can get all kinds of information on modules by using help about_modules
