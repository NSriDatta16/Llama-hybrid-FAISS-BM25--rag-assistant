Firmware is machine code that is typically placed inside some storage on a piece of hardware, to make that hardware function. That is to say, firmware is typically written in a low level language (be it C or assembly), compiled and assembled into machine code, and placed in a known position on this storage, where the hardware, during its startup process can read from a known location, and begin executing that machine code.
