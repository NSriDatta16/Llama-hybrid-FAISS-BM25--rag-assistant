If the things really are as you describe them then your teacher's code illustrates some rather bad programming practices. Your question is tagged C++. In C++ the proper technique would be to move the variable declaration to the point where it can be meaningfuly initialized. I.e. it should've looked as follows Order* order1 = order(customer1, product2); The same would appliy to C99 code, since C99 allows declaring variable in the middle of the block. In C code the declaration must be placed at the beginning of the block, which might lead to situations where you can't meaningfully initialize a variable at the point of declaration. Some people believe that in this case you have to initialize the variable with something , anything just to keep it initialized as opposed to leaving it uninitialized. I can respect this as a matter of personal preference, buy personally consider it counterproductive. It interferes with compiler optimizations and tends to hide bugs by sweeping them under the carpet (instead of encouraging proper fixes). I would say that your teacher's C++ code suffers from some bad habits brought over from C.
