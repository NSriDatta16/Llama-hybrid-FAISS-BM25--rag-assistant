This is a fairly common problem in forecasting. The traditional solution is to compute mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) on each item. The lower the MAPE, the more easily forecasted is the item. One problem with that is many series contain zero values and then MAPE is undefined. I proposed a solution in Hyndman and Koehler (IJF 2006) [Preprint version] using mean absolute scaled errors (MASEs). For monthly time series, the scaling would be based on in-sample seasonal naive forecasts. That is if $y_t$ is an observation at time $t$ , data are available from times 1 to $T$ and $$ Q = \frac{1}{T-12}\sum_{t=13}^T |y_t-y_{t-12}|, $$ then a scaled error is $q_t = (y_t-\hat{y}_t)/Q$ , where $\hat{y}_t$ is a forecast of $y_t$ using whatever forecasting method you are implementing for that item. Take the mean absolute value of the scaled errors to get the MASE. For example, you might use a rolling origin (aka time series cross-validation ) and take the mean absolute value of the resulting one-step (or $h$ -step) errors. Series that are easy to forecast should have low values of MASE. Here "easy to forecast" is interpreted relative to the seasonal naive forecast. In some circumstances, it may make more sense to use an alternative base measure to scale the results.
