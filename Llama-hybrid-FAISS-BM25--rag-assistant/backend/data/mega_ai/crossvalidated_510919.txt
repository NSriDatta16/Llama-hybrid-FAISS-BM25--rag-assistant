You can have asymmetric encoders and decoders. In fact, due to non-linearities, even with tied-weights most AEs are not invertible (you'd need to have inverse activation functions to achieve something like that). Invertible neural networks (INNs) do exist, sharing a lot with normalizing flows, and I recommend you to check them to see what AEs are missing. Tied-weights make sense only for linear, single layer, AEs (and why bother if you can have PCA already for that scenario?)
