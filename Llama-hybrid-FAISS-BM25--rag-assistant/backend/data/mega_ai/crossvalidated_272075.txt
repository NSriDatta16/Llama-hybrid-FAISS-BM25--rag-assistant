I am not an expert but I would be happy to share my experience with the monomvn package. Should I give initial values to beta? Given enough iterations, initial values shouldn't have any impact on any parameter (e.g. regression coefficients, error variance and penalty parameter). Please consider the R code and traceplots below: # load required packages and datasets library(monomvn); library(lars); library(glmnet); library(miscTools) data(diabetes); attach(diabetes) # define the burn-in period, number of mcmc samples to be drawn and initial values burnin To get the parameter estimations, I would use the posterior median as Park and Casella (2008) have done. > colMedians(coef.lasso[-seq(burnin), -1]) beta1 beta2 variance lambda.square 0.0000000 -172.3840906 2841.4410472 0.3031814 Please consider that I have computed the coefficients after discarding first half of the draws. Since I have considered only the draws from green-shaded areas, those extreme initial values I have assigned above have no impact on the posterior medians anymore. I tried to follow this but when it comes to my data, all coefficients were shrunk to zeros. Let's now compare lasso (glmnet package) and Bayesian lasso (monomvn package) fit.glmnet The original lasso implementation has shrunk 53 parameters to 0. Let's now check Bayesian lasso: sum(colMedians(lasso$beta[-seq(burnin), ]) == 0) 56 and it shrank 56 out of 64 exactly to 0. Please also note that your estimation results might significantly differ when you specify the prior distributions. A quick example would be to change the parameters using the 'rd' argument in blasso() where 'rd' controls the gamma prior on lambda^2. (please hit ?blasso for other hyperprior specifications) Here is an example: lasso2 I hope it is now clear now that giving initial values doesn't really help. Have you tried estimating the parameters using glmnet? If the results differ a lot, then you might consider tuning the hyperpriors on parameters in blasso(). If you still get the same results, maybe the parameters are all indeed 0 :-) Hope that helps!
