XMLRPC.Net how do you pass in an associated array?

I am using the open source library xmlrpc.net and am trying to make a call to a service that has an input parameter that is an associative array. Documentation on call (I am trying to integrate with a phpsite called Magento and by the errors it is throwing I know it is using the Zend xmlrpc library.) Method Name: sales_order_shipment.create Create new shipment for order Return: string - shipment increment id Arguments: string orderIncrementId - order increment id array itemsQty - items qty to ship as associative array (order_item_id â‡’ qty) string comment - shipment comment (optional) boolean email - send e-mail flag (optional) boolean includeComment - include comment in e-mail flag (optional) So In .Net I have been able to get the following to work proxy.Create(sessionId, "sales_order_shipment.create", new object[] { 100000010, new object[] { }, "Shipment Created", true, true }); but I can't seem to figure out what .Net type I should pass in for itemsQty. new object[]{} works but I need to be able to pass in what items shipped not just create a shipment with 0 items shipping in it. What .Net type can be used that will map to an Associated Array using xmlrpc.net
