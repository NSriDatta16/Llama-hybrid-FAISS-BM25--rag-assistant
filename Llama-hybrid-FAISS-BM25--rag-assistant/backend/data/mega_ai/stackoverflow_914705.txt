can I attach database on different sql instances at the same time?

I have sql database stored on a shared netwrok drive , after set of configurations I can attach this database over the network on sql server 2008 instance. But I want to attach the same database on different machine that contains different sql instance (I think logically there is no data corruption as I want it to be reading only). So my question is can I attach databse to more than one sql instance at the same time? and how? I am doing this to use a centralized database? if I can not, so what is the other solution to support database sharing between different sql instances on different machine? (I know there is SAN storage but it is costly for me, and I think Fiber/SCSI connection will not support sharing)
