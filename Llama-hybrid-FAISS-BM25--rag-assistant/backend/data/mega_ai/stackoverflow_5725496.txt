To quote the HTML::Form docs on click: The result of clicking is an HTTP::Request object that can then be passed to LWP::UserAgent if you want to obtain the server response. So you can do: my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $response = $ua->get($url); my @form = HTML::Form->parse($response); my $chosen = $form[0]; $chosen->value('netid', $user); my $ro = $chosen->click('Search'); # If you want to see what you're sending to the server: print $ro->as_string; # Fetch the server's response: $response = $ua->request($ro); What you do with $response next depends on what you're trying to do. P.S. "responce" is usually spelled without a C. But HTTP does have a history of misspellings. (I'm looking at you, "Referer".)
