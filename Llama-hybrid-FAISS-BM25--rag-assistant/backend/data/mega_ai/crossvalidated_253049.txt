Two out-of-the-box suggestions: You can use weights on the loss function of your logistic regression, so that the doctor who is very certain that the patient has cancer with P=1 gets double the impact has another who says he has cancer with P=0.75. Do not forget to properly transform your probabilities into weights. A family of models often neglected are ranking models. Within rankers there are three big groups: listwise, pointwise and pairwise ranking, depending on what your input is. It sounds like you could use pointwise ranking in your case.
