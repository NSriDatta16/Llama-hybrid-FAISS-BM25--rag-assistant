How can I tokenize a text file with BERT or something similar?

I want to use the twitter datasets in a project and the tweet contents look something like this: tweet_ID tweet_text 12324124 some text here that has been twitted bla bla bla 35325323 some other text, trump, usa , merica ,etc. 56743563 bla bla text whatever tweet bla bla Now I would like to end-up with a file that contains tweet_IDs and some vector encodings. I was reading about BERT, ROBERTA, etc. Is there a way to simply generate these encodings without writing a huge amount of boilerplate code?
