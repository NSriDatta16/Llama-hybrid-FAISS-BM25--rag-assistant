Method comparisons for trees and forests

I am looking to compare various types of models for a dataset, in order to determine which one is the most suitable. They will all be a form of decision tree, from the basic tree to random forests, including oblique trees, random trees, etc. My variable of interest is binary, with a lot more 0s than 1s. I intend to use many methods for comparison in order to be thorough. (Weighted) cross-validation will of course be included, but what else would you suggest? If it changes anything, I'm using R, but I am perfectly willing to implement methods myself in the unlikely event that they are not already included in some package.
