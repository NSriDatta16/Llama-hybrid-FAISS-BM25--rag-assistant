You have a series of Bernoulli trials and you're estimating the parameter $p$ of a good review. (+1) @Michael Chernick expresses the most firmly grounded, classic statistical way to think about it. An alternative, Bayesian approach: An alternative is to become a Bayesian , and instead of treating $\rho$ as a parameter (i.e. some number), you can model $\rho$ as a random variable ! That is, you can use the tools of probability to model the uncertainty in your head about $\rho$. You will: Start with some beliefs about $\rho$ (this is your "prior") Update those beliefs based upon whether review $1$ is positive or negative. (This is called forming the "posterior.") Repeat, do the same thing with review $2$, review $3$, etc.... If we represent our beliefs about $\rho$ using the beta distribution, then our beliefs about $\rho$ after observing a new review will also follow the beta distribution because it is a conjugate prior when the likelihood is Bernoulli. You can then compute the maximum the maximum a posteriori estimate. Anyway, the way this work out in simplest terms is before see any actual reviews, you initialize your beliefs about $\rho$ as if there were $\alpha$ positive reviews and $\beta$ negative reviews. Let's say you then observe $x$ actual positive reviews and $y$ actual negative reviews. You would act as if you've seen $\alpha + x$ positive reviews. Your maximum a posteri estimate would be: $$\hat{p} = \frac{\alpha + x}{\alpha + x + \beta + y}$$ And your posterior (over $\rho$) follows the Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha + x$ and $\beta + y$. You're effectively incorporating some initial beliefs about whether the product is good or bad. The weakness of this approach is that your choices of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ may be difficult to justify! Should it be $\alpha =1$ and $\beta=1$? $\alpha = 4.2$ and $\beta = 2.1$? If you have some objective way to set $\alpha$ and $\beta$ based upon outside data, outside information, then the Bayesian approach makes more sense. If you're pulling your choices for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ out of a magic hat, then it can be rather arbitrary.
