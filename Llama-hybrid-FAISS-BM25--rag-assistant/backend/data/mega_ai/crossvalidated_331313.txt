Why is the center of data important?

I have recently begun learning statistics along with Python with the Anaconda IDE and started a Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng. I understand the mathematics behind what I am doing as the textbooks usually explain this part very well. However, whether it is the mean, median, mode, or any other technique used to find the center of data, I am wondering why we do this and what real-world results are after we apply it in a professional setting. Thank you.
