Chances are, some of your controls are embedded in container controls, and the tab order of your container controls is causing the focus to appear as if it is jumping around randomly. Make sure that when you're in the tab order view, you pay careful attention to the tab order of your container controls: Make sure that none of them have the same tab order, and that they're ordered logically with the tab order of your individual controls. Otherwise, you need to check your UI code for some calls to Control.Focus that could be interfering with the default tab order at run-time. Some validation code may be changing the focus to the "next" control after it completes successfully (or "back" to a previous control if validation failed).
