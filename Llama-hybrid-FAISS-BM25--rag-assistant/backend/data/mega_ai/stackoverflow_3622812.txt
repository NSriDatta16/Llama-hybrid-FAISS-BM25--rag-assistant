Are you registering your window to accept dragged files with the DragAcceptFiles function? ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776406%28VS.85%29.aspx ) It's useful for getting very basic drag-drop functionality without getting into OLE, but doesn't provide as much versatility, because you only get the WM_DROPFILES message after the mouse button is released.
