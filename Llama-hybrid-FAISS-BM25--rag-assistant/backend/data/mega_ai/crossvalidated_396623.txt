Other options for GAN losses

Would it be possible to update the loss of my generator using a loss function different from binary cross entropy? I have a multi-class labeled data-set and I want to train my discriminator to learn how to classify these images, while my generator is trained to make fake images so that the discriminator can't predict the right class. Excuse me if I ask something obvious, but i would appreciate any help!!!
