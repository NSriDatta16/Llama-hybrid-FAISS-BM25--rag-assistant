How to stop a gem of previous version from being loaded?

I am working on a webserver which is a third party so i can only work in my home dir. I have ruby rail installed under webapps. I changed by local environment variable for PATH and GEM_HOME to point the local installation folder. This was recommended by the web-hosting service (webfaction) and work fine. Now the problem is that i install haml new version. I can check it as following. [user@abc n2]$ gem list -d haml *** LOCAL GEMS *** haml (3.0.23) Authors: Nathan Weizenbaum, Chris Eppstein, Hampton Catlin Rubyforge: http://rubyforge.org/projects/haml Homepage: http://haml-lang.com/ Installed at: /home/myhome/webapps/mysite/gems An elegant, structured XHTML/XML templating engine. Comes with Sass, a similar CSS templating engine. But when i do following for some reason haml-2.2.9 is activated before the new haml-3.0.23 . I have no access or rights to haml-2.2.9 it may be install under some root folder on which i don't have access. How can i fix this issue. Remember i have only rights on by home folder and what ever under it. The haml-2.29 is not locally installed.
