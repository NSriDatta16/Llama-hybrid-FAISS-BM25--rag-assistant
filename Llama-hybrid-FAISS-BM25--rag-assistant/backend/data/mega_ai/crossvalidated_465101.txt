Stationarity of Time Series

There are different test for staionarity testing of time series. One of the methods is to detect the trend in the time series. Dracup and others(1980) fitted a trend line to the time series and estimated the slope. But I have not understood how they did the hypothesis testing. That is how to test if the slope is significant. They talk about a "t" static and alfa value. But it did not become absolutely clear how they estimated the t static While the decision maker can decide the value of alfa such as 0.05 or 0.01, but how is the t static or the p value estimated from the data to make a decision. Any help will be much apprecited
