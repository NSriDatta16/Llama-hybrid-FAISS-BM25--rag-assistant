A problem of your approach is that you treat object and its member as two separate tokens separated by . . Classical Shunting yard algorithm knows nothing about OOP and relies on single token for function call. So the first way to resolve you problem is to use one token for a call of an object member -- i.e. entire a.b.c must be a single token. You may also refer to automatic parser generators for another solution of your problem. They allow to define complete grammar of your target language (JavaScript) as a set of formal rules and generate parser automatically. List of popular tools includes tools that generates parser on different programming languages: ANTLR, Bison + Lex, Lemon + Ragel . --artem
