How should I tackle ARCTAN (and prevent deviding by zero) without the convenience of ARCTAN2(n,m) being available?

I try to determine the angle from a point (n,m) to (0,0) . Without arctan2 being available, I'm running into the problem that m can be 0, which leads to a possible division by zero. What would be an elegant, correct solution to tackling this issue?
