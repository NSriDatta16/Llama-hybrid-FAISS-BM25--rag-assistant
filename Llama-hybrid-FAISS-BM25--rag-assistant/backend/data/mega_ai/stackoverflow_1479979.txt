Case-insensitive comparison of sets in Python

I have two sets (although I can do lists, or whatever): a = frozenset(('Today','I','am','fine')) b = frozenset(('hello','how','are','you','today')) I want to get: frozenset(['Today']) or at least: frozenset(['today']) The second option is doable if I lowercase everything I presume, but I'm looking for a more elegant way. Is it possible to do a.intersection(b) in a case-insensitive manner? Shortcuts in Django are also fine since I'm using that framework. Example from intersection method below (I couldn't figure out how to get this formatted in a comment): print intersection('Today I am fine tomorrow'.split(), 'Hello How a re you TODAY and today and Today and Tomorrow'.split(), key=str.lower) [(['tomorrow'], ['Tomorrow']), (['Today'], ['TODAY', 'today', 'Today'])]
