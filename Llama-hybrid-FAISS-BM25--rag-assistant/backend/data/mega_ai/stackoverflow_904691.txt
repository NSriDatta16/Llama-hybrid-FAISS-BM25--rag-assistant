This is just a guess -- is there a UIScrollView somewhere in the view hierarchy? UIScrollViews don't pass touch events like normal views, you have to subclass it and implement a custom touchesBegan method. You can find information about that here -- it's a problem that sent me scratching my head and Googling for several hours the first time I encountered it.
