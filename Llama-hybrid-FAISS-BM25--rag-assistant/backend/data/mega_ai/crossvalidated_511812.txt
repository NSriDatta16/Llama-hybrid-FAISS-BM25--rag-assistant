In general, you should not be concerned about efficiency (performance) between random variate generation methods, unless you have written an implementation of them, compared their running time, used them in your application, and found the running time to be unacceptable in your application. This is a general issue in programming that is obviously not limited to random variate generation, an issue commonly known as "premature optimization". The bigger concern is ease of implementation or ease of sampling, or rather the availability of algorithms that sample the distribution in question. (Accuracy of sampling the distribution is also often important.) Although numerous algorithms are now available for sampling "standard" distributions, such as normal, gamma, and beta, many other distributions that occur in practice have non-trivial probability functions (such as PDF, CDF, and/or inverse CDF), and many of them have PDFs whose normalizing constant is intractable, for example. A notable example is certain Bayesian posteriors whose PDFs cannot be evaluated pointwise. The following question shows one example involving the beta distribution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65975300/speed-of-random-sampling-from-distribution-in-r
