Adding Flash Components to Stage Dynamically from AS3 File

When I attempt to create a new flash list component from my as3 file (FrontEnd.as) and add it to the stage, I get the following error: "1046: Type was not found or was not a compile-time constant: List". Below is the code: package { import flash.display.MovieClip; import fl.controls.List; public class FrontEnd extends MovieClip { public function FrontEnd():void { trace("FrontEnd Here"); init(); } private function init() { var userSelect:List = new List(); addChild(userSelect); userSelect.move(200, 100); userSelect.width = 120; } } } Someone commented on a livedocs page that you have to drag the component to the .fla library and cannot create it solely from as3. Is this really true? Hoping someone can set me straight, thanks.
