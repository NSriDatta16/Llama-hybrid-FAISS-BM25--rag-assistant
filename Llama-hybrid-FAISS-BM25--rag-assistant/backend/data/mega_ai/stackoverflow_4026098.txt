I've been on both ends. Taking over a code base and handing it off. You should: Identify areas that aren't completely obvious. So, if you have a directory called "xml" but all your flash object get their data from "flash/swfs/xml" you should document that. Identify parts of the database which are no longer in use. If there are tables that simply have no use anymore. Identify areas of concern such as speed/performance of certain pages. If you have some really backwards logic on certain pages, explain why, if it's not been commented in the code directly. Any third party vendors should be identified along with their cost and use on the site. So if you're using a delivery network to stream your flash videos, definitely let that be known. If you have pages still in the project, but aren't being used anymore, identify them, or simply remove them. If you know for a fact that your database was poorly designed, contains no constraints or indexes and has no primary keys on many tables, mention it. It will let the new developer know they need to optimize the database. If you hardcoded e-mail addresses within the code and didn't put them in .config files, identify that as well. I'm sure there are more but there are things I wish were brought to my attention on a project I had taken over at one point.
