WYSIWYG - Drag and drop widgets from toolbar into canvas

I'm trying to create a web-based WYSIWYG editor that consists of a canvas and a tool bar with widgets such as text object, shape object, line object, image object, video object and photo gallery object. A person can click and drag objects from the tool bar and place them into the canvas area. Once placed in canvas, they can change the properties of the objects. Properties they can change are width, height, color, z-index etc.... Does anyone know if there's an off the shelf solution I can start from and customize? If not, then what libraries and technologies should I be aware of to build this from scratch? I'm primarily a backend developer, so I'm not up to speed with all the new things that come with HTML5 and CSS3, so not sure if they are relevant to what I need to do.
