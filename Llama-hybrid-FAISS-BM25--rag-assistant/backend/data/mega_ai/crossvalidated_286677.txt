If you are certain that some variable doesn't affect what you are modelling, then you can manually remove it. But, in most of the problems you can't make sense of what each column represents. There are two ways to go about solving this, one is to use feature selection algorithms or do dimensionality reduction. If you use something like PCA for dimensionality reduction you aren't selecting features but you are creating new features using the old ones which can represnt the data almost as accurately. If you want to only use features among the ones present, you can use feature selection algorithms. If you are using regression analysis, you can use Lasso, i.e, using L1 distance as regularization, it brings many coefficients of the weights to zero. Linear models penalized with the L1 norm have sparse solutions. Or, you can use the feature selection algorithm before doing any alnalysis. Some simple methods would be, removing features with low variance, or randomly selecting features and keeping the set that works best for you etc.
