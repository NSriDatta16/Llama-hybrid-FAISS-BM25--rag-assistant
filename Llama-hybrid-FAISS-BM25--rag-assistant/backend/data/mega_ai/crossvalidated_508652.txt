Appropriate test set/training set for small sample time-series model?

So variations of this question have been asked a few times, but I think my case is somewhat different than the previous questions as they either have larger sample sizes and/or cross-sectional data. I have a time series model of the form $$x(t+1) = f_i(x(t)|\theta_i) + \xi_t$$ for several different models $f_i (\cdot|\theta_i)$ , and I estimate $\theta_i$ by maximum likelihood using a conditional decomposition. Besides using AIC for model selection, I also want to do some cross-validation. I read elsewhere that due to the temporal structure of time series models, normal cross-validation techniques such as $K$ -fold cross-validation are inappropriate. For this reason I want to use the cross-validation technique described here that starts with an initial training set, it makes a prediction on the next observation, and then expands the training set by one, and so on. (see picture below) The problem I have is that my dataset is really small, around 30-40 observations, and I have to estimate 5 parameters of interest. My MLE estimates are already not very robust (according to bootstrap standard errors I obtained) for my sample size, and so splitting my already-small sample size will create very unstable estimates. So my question is what training/testing split should I initially start off with? Before expanding it according to each step. I was thinking of a 2/3 and 1/3 split for the training and testing datasets, but that only leaves around 10 observations to be predicted in the cross-validation. Is this to small? Welcoming of any suggestions and/or references to check out.
