What is masking doing to the padding in the encoder stage of transformer?

I'm referring to this post What I don't understand is, if the result of padding is simply adding zeroes to ensure all input sequences are of the same length what is the masking stage doing exactly ? Truncating would defeat the purpose of padding in the first place, and setting to zeros would be redundant as padding is already set to 0. I don't quite understand what masking is doing.
