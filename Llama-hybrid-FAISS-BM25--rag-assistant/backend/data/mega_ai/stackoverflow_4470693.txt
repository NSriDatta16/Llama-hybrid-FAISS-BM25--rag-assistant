Best way to implement an Agent in Django Applications

What I'm needing is something running in background, independently of web requests, continuously checking a specific table and performing some calculations. The term "agent" seems to fit better for this task, but I'm not sure if it's correct. Any thoughts or ideas on how to implement this? The first thing that occurred me was a script being called by cron but I'm also not sure... Thanks.
