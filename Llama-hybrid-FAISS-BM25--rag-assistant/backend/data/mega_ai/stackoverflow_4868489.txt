iTextSharp is fairly popular around here. It is available under AGPL and commercial licenses (with source of course). It'll do just about anything that can be done with AcroForms-based PDF forms (including flattening), and can get/set values with LiveCycle Designer forms. It also supports the following symbologies: Codabar Code 39 (and variants) Code 128 DataMatrix (2d) EAN (8 & 13) Interleaved 2 of 5 PDF417 (2d) Postnet UPCA and UPCE Huh. I thought it supported code 93, but I don't see anything in the code here to back that up. The book iText In Action 2nd Edition is pretty good. Commercial support is available (included with a commercial license), and the help here and on their mailing list is quite good. Disclaimer: iTextSoftware pays me from time to time for services rendered. Whether or not you use decide to use iText will not affect that amount.
