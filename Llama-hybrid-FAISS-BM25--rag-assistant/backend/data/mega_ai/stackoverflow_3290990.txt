I would tackle this by completely ignoring the expected method of solving the problem (generating an HTTP POST) and instead focusing on what the actual problem is. What are your inputs? A bunch of JSP files by the sound of it. What are your outputs? The same bunch of JSP files. What has to be accomplished? Moving the inputs from one know location to another. Now with a well defined problem, a solution is much more likely to clearly present itself. For example, by looking at the problem I've defined I would think that XCopy would be an elegant solution to the problem. Any time I get handed a solution and then told to go solve a certain problem, I am always highly suspicious of the tool I've been given. If they knew that this was the best solution to the problem, why didn't they do it themselves? My advice: Find your own solution. Hope that helps!
