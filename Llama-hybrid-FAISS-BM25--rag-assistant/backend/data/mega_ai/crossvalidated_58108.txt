Weka is open sourced software, so you can find it out from its source code comment: "Evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the correlation (Pearson's) between it and the class. Nominal attributes are considered on a value by value basis by treating each value as an indicator. An overall correlation for a nominal attribute is arrived at via a weighted average." link Use 'sepallength' as an example: make a real vector v1 , each element is petal length, e.g. [5.1, 4.9, 4.7, ..., 5.9] make a real vector v2 , each element is class indicator, e.g. [1, 1, 1, ...., 1, 2, 2, 2,...2, 3, 3, 3, ... 3] (there are 50 ones, 50 twos and 50 threes representing three iris class and each class have 50 observations). calculate Pearson correlation between v1 and v2 . For more information, read this Weka source code if you want to re-implement the calculation. link .
