For WiX 2.0, tallow is very limited; paraffin and mallow offer additional functionality. For WiX 3.0, heat offers the same functionnality as tallow, a little bit better. In my case I've used mallow source and modified a bit and used it, because paraffin needs 3.5 version of .Net. You can use Mallow or Paraffin tool to generate WiX fragments: Getting started , The pain of WiX , A better tallow, Paraffin , Download , Paraffin for WiX 3.0
