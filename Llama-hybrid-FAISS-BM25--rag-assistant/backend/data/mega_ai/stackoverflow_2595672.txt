Just consider a circle and forget the filling. The bounds will either be the center of the circle, the endpoints, or the points at 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees (if they exist in this slice). The maxima and minima of these seven points will determine your bounding rectangle. As far as placing it in the center, calculate the average of the max and min for both the rectangle and the pie slice, and add or subtract the difference of these to whichever one you want to move.
