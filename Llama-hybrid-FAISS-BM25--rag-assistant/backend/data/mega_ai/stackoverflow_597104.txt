How can I format an entire source tree in Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede)?

The obvious thing to do would be to: Right-click on the folder that you wish to format. Source > Format Expected results: - All java code in the directory and subdirectories are formatted (using the project specific formatting settings) Actual results: - None of the java is formatted. While we're at it, how can we do a batch clean up operation in Eclipse? From editor, I Right-click > Source > Clean Up, but I can only do one file at a time.
