This problem has been looked at the last decade. You might want to google DFA learning, and download a couple of papers to get a sense of the state of the art. Once you have the DFA generating a regular expression is trivial. To avoid the problems @FrustratedWithDesign mentions some conditions such as generating the DFA with the least amount of nodes is introduced, from a machine learning point of view this is similar to having a regularization condition for the simplest hypothesis.
