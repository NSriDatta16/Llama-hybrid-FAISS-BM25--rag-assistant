What is the name of an algorithm that does not use training data?

In articles on how machine learning algorithms are different from "non-machine learning" algorithms I keep reading words such as "traditional" or "classical" to describe the latter. I used the word "lazy" myself one time in lack of better alternatives but that is not right either (it's more of a "special case"). "Heuristic" is also wrong. So is there a generic term for an algorithm that does not use any training data?
