Arguably the best known facial detection algorithm is Viola-Jones , which was proposed in 2001 and does not involve any Neural Networks. Instead the original framework was trained using a variant of AdaBoost , classifying Haar features. This algorithm is very popular because it's lightweight, fast and sufficiently accurate,. You can find many pre-trained models in many open-source libraries such as OpenCV . An example can be found here .
