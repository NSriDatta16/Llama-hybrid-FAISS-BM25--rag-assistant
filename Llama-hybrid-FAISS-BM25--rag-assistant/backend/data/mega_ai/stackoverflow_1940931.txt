Have you considered using ELMAH ? ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment. Once ELMAH has been dropped into a running web application and configured appropriately, you get the following facilities without changing a single line of your code: Logging of nearly all unhandled exceptions. A web page to remotely view the entire log of recoded exceptions. A web page to remotely view the full details of any one logged exception. In many cases, you can review the original yellow screen of death that ASP.NET generated for a given exception, even with customErrors mode turned off. An e-mail notification of each error at the time it occurs. An RSS feed of the last 15 errors from the log. ELMAH won't log the state of the application, but perhaps you could throw a custom exception that would encapsulate any state you need to see. Are you looking to log something like a core dump? Perhaps something like debugdiag would be better: The Debug Diagnostic Tool (DebugDiag) is designed to assist in troubleshooting issues such as hangs, slow performance, memory leaks or fragmentation, and crashes in any user-mode process. The tool includes additional debugging scripts focused on Internet Information Services (IIS) applications, web data access components, COM+ and related Microsoft technologies.
