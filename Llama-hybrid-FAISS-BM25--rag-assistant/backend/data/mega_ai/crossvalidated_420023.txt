Are non-independent samples an issue in within groups designs

I'm currently designing a statistical analysis. Currently opting for a repeated-measures ANOVA with 4 factors. The data I am using a list of time series. These are grouped by where they came from and also I will be getting a varied number of slices from each series. The within subject design would be comparing between the value at the beginning of each slice and at the end of each slice (2 levels). My question is: do I need to be worried about the non-independence of samples? My instinct is yes but logically wouldn't any issues of covariance in the IV be corrected as the analysis is only interested in the change within each time series.
