Does Javascript have a contains function?

I am not sure if it does or does not. Some sites show using a contains in javascript but when I try it does not work. I have var userAgent = navigator.userAgent.split(';'); if (userAgent.contains("msie7") == true) {...} I am trying to use the useragent to figure out if the user is running IE 8 in compatibility mode. So I want to check the userAgenet for msie7 & for the trident 4.0 So how could I check this array?
