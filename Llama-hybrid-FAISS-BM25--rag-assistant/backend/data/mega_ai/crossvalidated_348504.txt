Is it ok to re categorize my variables this way?

I have a 2^3 factorial design, where the dependent variable is binary, and the three independents are binary and I care about interactions. I've seen that you can use logistic regression, but I feel this doesn't fully answer my question. Instead of having y~ a+b+c+ab+ac+bc+abc, can I just have y~as.factor(factors), where I recode a to be 1, b to be 2..... abc to be 8. Then I can use kruskal Wallis or something to serve as like an ANOVA? My data is unbalanced, and obviously not normally distributed, but observations are independent. and although I like the logistic regression, I feel like I need an additional step to determine that effect BC is statistically different from effect AC (for example). I want the multiple comparisons. Help please :)
