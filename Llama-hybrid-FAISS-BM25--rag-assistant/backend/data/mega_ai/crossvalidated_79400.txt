Does ARIMA require normally distributed errors or normally distributed input data?

I have two questions related to time series forecasting with ARIMA: Does ARIMA require normally distributed errors or normally distributed input data ? Are there any assumptions on input time series data for ARIMA model and exogenous variables for ARIMAX model ?
