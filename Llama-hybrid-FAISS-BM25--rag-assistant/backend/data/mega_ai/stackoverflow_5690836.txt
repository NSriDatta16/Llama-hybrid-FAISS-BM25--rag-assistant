How to overlay an icon image on top of an exisiting view

This is a two part question. I have an image of a warehouse that I would like to divide it into regions (A,B,C,D,E & F) where each letter represents a storage in the warehouse. If the user selects storage "B" then I would like to programmatically overlay an icon over the region on the images that is designated for "B". Question: What is a good way to subdivide the image into regions that will describe each of the storage room? How to programmatically place an icon over the correct region? Thank you.
