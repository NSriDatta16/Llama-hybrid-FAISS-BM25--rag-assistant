What I did in the application I am working on at the moment, to make an action in the shopcart controller (name it getAjaxCart or something obvious) that returns a partial view containing the list of items with the price etc, and put that in the div that you have assigned for the shopping cart. Check out the jquery documentation at http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax . You can then use $('#shopcart').html(result) in the success part of the javascript call.
