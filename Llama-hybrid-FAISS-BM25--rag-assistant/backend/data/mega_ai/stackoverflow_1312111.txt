Growing development team- issues with Dreamweaver Check In/Out

Our relatively small development team is getting a bit sick of Dreamweaver. The only functionality that we're reliant on is its file check in system. As the team is likely to grow over the next few months we need to address these issues. Subversion has come to our attention but are unsure if it will suit our requirements. All we need is to be made aware of whether or not someone is working on a particular file before we request it from the server and to block any overriding of a checked out file. Any recommendations or advice on general best development practices would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
