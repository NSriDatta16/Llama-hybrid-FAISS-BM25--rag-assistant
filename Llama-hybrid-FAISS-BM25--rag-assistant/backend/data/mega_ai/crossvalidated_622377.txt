In principle, I think it would not normally be a problem to include a random site effect and latitude, if there is things about sites that make the departure vary beyond the latitude. That's because there's plenty of things that could be going on that would not be fully capture by a linear latitude term e.g. being next to the sea = perhaps more moderate climate, higher altitude = colder and thus earlier departure, protected by a mountain range = later departure, different types of plants growing in different locations, if you include latitude as a linear effect that may not capture the relationship exactly (perhaps the functional form is already published for some other birds or has been theoretically "derived") while you may have too little data to fit anything more complex unless you want to build in prior knowledge etc. What might make this tricky is that you only have 13 sites and very few animals per site, in which case it may be hard to even tell whether latitude explains this more or less. I would personally be tempted to take a Bayesian approach that would allow you to incorporate prior knowledge on various things including how much departure dates could possibly vary between sites (for a start surely never more than 183 days or so, and probably a whole lot less...).
