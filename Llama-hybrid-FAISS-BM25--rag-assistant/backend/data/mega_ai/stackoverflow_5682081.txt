Organizing the post array

Here is my form I have this format [post] => Array ( [28] => 1 [29] => 1 ) I really want the post array to be products and then a list on product ids with quantities ...is there an easy way to change the form so on the next page i can do this $products = $_POST['products'] foreach( $products as $p) { if( isset($p) && $p<>'') { ///// place your code here } }
