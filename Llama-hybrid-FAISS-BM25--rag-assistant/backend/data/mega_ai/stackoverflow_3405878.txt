I'm assuming you're not running SQL 2008, as the integrated full text engine in that version should make better decisions for a query such as yours. For earlier versions, I've had success by embedding additional keys in the text with some form of a custom tag. You'll need some triggers to keep the text up to date with the keys. e.g., "This is my sample text. TypeKey_3" Then your where clause becomes something like: where Contains([text], @text AND "TypeKey_" + @type)
