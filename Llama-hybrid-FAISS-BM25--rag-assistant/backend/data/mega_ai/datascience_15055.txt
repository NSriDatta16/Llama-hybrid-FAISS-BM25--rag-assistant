How to extract paragraphs from text document?

The extracted file content looks like: Sample pdf file is here FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking information to enable investors to comprehend our prospects and take investment decisions. This report and other statements written and oral â€“ that we periodically share contain forward-looking statements that set out ...//Content Continued like in this format until the paragraph ends// HERO O FOREVER Now if check out the actual report on above link the text under Notes to Account and Independent Auditor's Report follows the almost similar structure in all companies reports in India. Only the Chairman's message or Boards reports vary but usually talks about growth, performance, future, investments etc. So is there any way to extract only the paragraphs/multiple paragraphs combines into single(if continuation of same information) which contains useful information. I have searched but i find most of work on paragraph/document summarization but donot find something like extraction of actual continuous blocks of text data from documents. Note : There is lot of noisy data(actual data in pdf but they are like page number, if company added some text in header/footer apart from title of page etc) between paragraphs which is generated while converting from pdf to text like: Multi-line paragraph R N O I WE W DS REMA INDS BRANVANT IN M RELE MARKETSDES AND SS DECA ACRO 6 Next Multiline paragraph
