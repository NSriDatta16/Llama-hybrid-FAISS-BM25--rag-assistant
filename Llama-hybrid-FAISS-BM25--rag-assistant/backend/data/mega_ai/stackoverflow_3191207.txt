I took Ross's code and added a few things that helped me. In particular, this code won't respond to the swipe until it stops. It also prevents a swipe from reversing direction partway through. #import #define kMinimumGestureLength 25 #define kMaximumVariance 5 typedef enum swipeDirection { kSwipeNone, kSwipeLeft, kSwipeRight } tSwipeDirection; @interface SwipeableTextView : UITextView { CGPoint gestureStartPoint; tSwipeDirection swipeDirection; } @end @implementation SwipeableTextView - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; swipeDirection = kSwipeNone; UITouch *touch =[touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; CGFloat deltaX = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.x - currentPosition.x); CGFloat deltaY = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.y - currentPosition.y); // Check if we already started a swipe in a particular direction // Don't let the user reverse once they get going if (deltaX >= kMinimumGestureLength && deltaY
