As a non-programmer myself, I found the book "How to Program" from Pragmatic Programmers very helpful from a rudimentary standpoint. It's approachable and easy to read for a beginner. It won't take you from beginner to expert, but it will prepare you for what to do once you pick a language and pick up your first "Learn to Program in (language here)" book.
