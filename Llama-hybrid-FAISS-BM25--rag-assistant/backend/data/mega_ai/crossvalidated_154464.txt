How to check statistical significance

I am from Civil Engineering background. In an experimental work, I am comparing some property (consider strength) of two materials/ mixtures "A" and "X". I prepared three specimens for each "A" and "X" and tested all of them for strength. Suppose a, b and c are the values for "A" and x, y and z for "X". I am reporting the strength of theses mixtures as the average of corresponding values (i.e., $[a+b+c]/3$ for "A" and $[x+y+z]/3$ for "X"). Now, I want to check whether the strength of "A" is significantly different from that of "X". Can you please help me how to check it?
