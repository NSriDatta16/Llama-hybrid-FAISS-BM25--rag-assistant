What can cause a "Error() model is singular error" in aov when fitting a repeated measures ANOVA?

I have the following data set: | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | |Trial 1|Trial 2| Trial 3|Trial 1|Trial 2| Trial 3| ------------------------------------------------------------------- S1 | ... Condition 1 S2 | ... S3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------- S5 | Condition 2 S6 | S7 | Thus the Trials are nested in the Scenarios and all of them are within subject. I am trying to run an ANOVA on this data set. Here is the model without defining that Scenarios (and Trials ) are within subject. my_data.aov But when I specify that these are within subject: my_data.aov I get the following error In aov(value ~ Condition * Trial % in % Scenario + Error(Player/(Trial %in% : Error() model is singular The closest set-up I could find was Split plot in R but there the subjects are nested inside each Trial not in each Condition . EXAMPLE FILE Here is an example file in long format. What about this approach? If I treat each Trial as a sample, then I can collapse across Scenarios by averaging them, so I will have a simpler model, where each Subject 's behavior is described per Scenario . And since I need to analyze the relationship of value~Condition*Scenario I can do so by defining the Error like Error(Subject/Scenario) . Will this approach invalidate my analysis?
