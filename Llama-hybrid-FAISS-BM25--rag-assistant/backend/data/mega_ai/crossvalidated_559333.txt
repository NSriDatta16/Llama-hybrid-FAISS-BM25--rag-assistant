For stacked denoising autoencoders you apply the encoding function learned by the first autoencoder to the clean input. You then use the resulting representation to train the second autoencoder as usual, adding the noise to it. See Stacked Denoising Autoencoders: Learning Useful Representations in a Deep Network with a Local Denoising Criterion for a full explanation (Figure 3 gives an overview of the training process.)
