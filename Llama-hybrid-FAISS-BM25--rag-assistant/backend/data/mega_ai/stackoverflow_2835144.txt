I have a hard time to believe you want this 16byte field to be a scalar integer. In the odd event that int16B is what you want (for a fotonic enumerator application, observing the universe), you need to define it as a class, make appropriate storage (see below), overload every arithmetic operators, to make any good use of it. If you want a set of 16 bytes under the same name, to which arithmetic wont be applied, use uint8 Data[16];
