Following Guo et al. , I ended up using the Expected Calibration Error, defined as $$\sum_{m=1}^M\frac{|{B_{m}|}}{n}\left|acc(B_m) - conf(B_m)\right|$$ In extending this to multiclass, one can either take the maximum probability for each prediction, or average across the top $n$ predictions, if desired.
