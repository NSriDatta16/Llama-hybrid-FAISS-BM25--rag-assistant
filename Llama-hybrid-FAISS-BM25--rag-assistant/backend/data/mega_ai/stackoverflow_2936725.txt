iPhone long plist

I have some data i want to add in to my app...about 650 categories (includes a name + id number), each with an average of 85 items (each with a name/id number). Will the iPhone support such a large plist? I want to first display the categories in a UITableView, when a category is selected I want to display all of the associated items. Having such a large plist, im not sure if the iPhone will lag when loading the items. At over 51,000 lines it seems like...it might. EDIT: The raw text file is 2MB
