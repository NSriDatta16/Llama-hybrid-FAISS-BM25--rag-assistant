Your coding style is not the norm. His coding style is not the norm. The norm is the coding style chosen by the project or, sometimes, the whole organization (and that should be documented somewhere) and both of you have to comply to it. Tools like Checkstyle (with Java) can be used to ensure conformance. If you use such a tool, distribute its configuration file. Also distribute files for IDEs formatting configuration. Many open source (or corporate) projects do use these principles (see for example XWiki's Java Code Style , Maven Code Style And Code Conventions or Apache Developers' C Language Style Guide ). This works for developers distributed around the world, don't tell me this can't work for developers in a same room. If your project doesn't have any code standards, then it's maybe time to define some and I just hope you will be able to do it as two adults (actually, this should be a team decision). If necessary, remind why an unified code style is important (for a better readability, for diffs). If, sadly, this doesn't work, then have a boss decide for you.
