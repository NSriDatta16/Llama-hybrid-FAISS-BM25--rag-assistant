EM algorithm In response to @Daniel Johnson, I want to quickly show you how you can fit the EM algorithm in R . Use the package mixtools ( click for a link ). Then, you can use the normalmixEM function with the option k=2 to estimate the parameters of a two-component gaussian mixture distribution. Let's make an example: # Let's look at the old faithful data library(mixtools) data(faithful) plot(density(faithful$waiting), las=1, col="steelblue", lwd=2, main="") The distribution is clearly bimodal, so we're gonna calculate a mixture model with 2 components ( k=2 ): out The first normal distribution has an estimated mean of $54.6$ with a standard deviation of $5.88$, the second a mean of $80.1$ with a standard deviation of $5.86$. This corresponds nicely to the peaks in the graph above. Bayesian methods To estimate the mixture models with Bayesian methodology, use the bayesmix package for R ( click here for link ). You'll need to install JAGS on your computer first, though (just download the exectuble file and install it). To illustrate its use, I re-run the above example of old faithful data. I choose independent (option independence ) and uninformative priors (option priorsUncertain ). Further, we run 10000 MCMC samples (option n.iter=10000 ) and discard the first 1000 as burn-in samples (option burn.in=1000 ): library(bayesmix) data(faithful) bayesmod The model output is ("mu" denotes the estimates of the means and "sigma2" the estimates of the variances): Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) output: Start = 1001 End = 11000 Thinning interval = 1 Empirical mean, standard deviation and 95% CI for eta Mean SD 2.5% 97.5% eta[1] 0.3622 0.0318 0.3013 0.4251 eta[2] 0.6378 0.0318 0.5749 0.6987 Empirical mean, standard deviation and 95% CI for mu Mean SD 2.5% 97.5% mu[1] 54.63 0.7365 53.25 56.12 mu[2] 80.08 0.5128 79.02 81.05 Empirical mean, standard deviation and 95% CI for sigma2 Mean SD 2.5% 97.5% sigma2[1] 36.11 7.209 24.61 52.76 sigma2[2] 35.38 5.066 26.90 46.34 The estimated means are $54.63$ and $80.08$ with standard deviations (square roots of the variances "sigma2") of $\sqrt(36.11)\approx 6.01$ and $\sqrt(35.38)\approx 5.95$. This is very close to the estimates we've calculated with normalmixEM .
