Seems pretty silly, logging output or a stack trace will show you who the offending class is, so that explanation doesn't wash. Also seems dangerous, as if people are encouraged to throw the OurCompanyRuntimeException they're throwing RuntimeExceptions, which don't force the caller to handle them and can take down your application. I agree with you that exceptions should reflect the reason behind them. I've seen a custom exception as the root of a hierarchy, although it probably ought to be abstract, so that you need to create a specific extension to use one, and it definitely shouldn't be a RuntimeException.
