Filtering from join-table

I'm having some trouble with a tricky SQL-query. In my MySQL database there is the tables topics, tags and tags_topics to join them. I want to fetch topics that share the same specified tags. For example, let's say i have 3 tags with ids 1, 2 and 3, i want to fetch all topics that have tag 1, 2 and 3 associated to them. The topics can have other tags, but must have all of the specified tags. Help me think plz xD EDIT: Found a solution using GROUP BY in this question: Fetching only rows that match all entries in a joined table (SQL) If anyone have a more elegant solution, please post :)
