TL;DR The fiducial argument has not been accepted because the idea doesn't work. The fiducial distribution is disguised as something that looks like a probability distribution (and people might have wanted it to behave like a probability distribution) but it is not the same as a probability distribution. It is only a function of probabilities. You can not do the same thing with a fiducial distribution as with, for instance, a posterior probability density. This is illustrated in the example below where we compute a 80% fiducial interval but get in some cases a 100% coverage. Example where it doesn't work In the nice answer by Michael R. Chernick it is mentioned that the logic behind the fiducial distribution started to fail when people tried to apply it in a multidimensional setting like for instance the Behrens Fisher problem. Here we give a one dimensional example that already shows that it does not work. Let some statistic $X$ be distributed as a Uniform distribution with $$X \sim \mathcal{U}\left(\theta-0.5\sqrt{1+\theta^2},\theta+0.5\sqrt{1+\theta^2}\right)$$ We can plot the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(x;\theta)$ as a function of $x$ and $\theta$ using isolines. The image shows the CDF as function of $x$ and $\theta$ In vertical direction, for fixed $\theta$ , the function describes the CDF of the observation $x$ which is a random variable. We can compute the probability density function as $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} F(x;\theta)$$ In horizontal direction, for fixed $x$ , the function describes the fiducial distribution for the estimation of $\theta$ We can compute the fiducial density as $$\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} F(x;\theta)$$ For example the fiducial density, when we observed $x=0.1$ looks like. The points in red are inside the 80% interval [-0.396 , 0.475], it is the 80% probability mass with the highest density. The problem is the following : the probability statements by the fiducial distribution only 'work' when we consider the same quantiles, independent from the observation $x$ . However when change the quantiles as function of $x$ then the content of the probability statements entailed by the fiducial distribution are changed and become false. Therefore, the distribution can not be used in a similar way as a probability density. An example when this happens is for instance like the example above when we compute a highest density interval in combination in combination with a fiducial density that doesn't have the same shape for different observations $x$ (which makes us select different quantiles). We can see this in the plot when $\theta = 0$ for that case we get a 100% coverage by the 80% highest density interval instead of a 80% coverage. This is not what you would expect when the fiducial distribution could be used as a probability density for $\theta$ .
