Where is DropWhile in Mathematica?

Mathematica 6 added TakeWhile , which has the syntax: TakeWhile[ list , crit ] gives elements e i from the beginning of list , continuing so long as crit [e i ] is True. There is however no corresponding "DropWhile" function. One can construct DropWhile using LengthWhile and Drop , but it almost seems as though one is discouraged from using DropWhile. Why is this? To clarify, I am not asking for a way to implement this function. Rather: why is it not already present? It seems to me that there must be a reason for its absence other than an oversight, or it would have been corrected by now. Is there something inefficient, undesirable, or superfluous about DropWhile? There appears to be some ambiguity about the function of DropWhile, so here is an example: DropWhile = Drop[#, LengthWhile[#, #2]] &; DropWhile[{1,2,3,4,5}, # Out= {4, 5}
