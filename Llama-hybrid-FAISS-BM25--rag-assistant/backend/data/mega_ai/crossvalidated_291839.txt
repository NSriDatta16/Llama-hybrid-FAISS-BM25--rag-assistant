Derivation of $p(\omega|X,Y) = \frac{p(Y|X, \omega) p(\omega)}{p(Y|X)}$ in bayesian modelling

I am reading this thesis on Bayesian modelling explanation and there is a statement (section 2.1) there which I can't understand: Here we have a regression problem, where $X$ are our inputs, $Y$ are outputs and $\omega$ are model parameters. Why we have $p(\omega)$ instead of $p(\omega | X$)? If we apply Bayes rule to $p(\omega|X,Y)$ we get: $$p(\omega|X,Y) = \frac{p(Y|X, \omega) p(\omega | X)}{p(Y|X)}$$ The only way to get the statement from the paper is to assume either $p(\omega | X) = p(\omega)$ or $p(X,Y) = p(Y|X)$, both of which feels wrong to me.
