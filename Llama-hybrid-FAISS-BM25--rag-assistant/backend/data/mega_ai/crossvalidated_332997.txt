How can I get the optimal perturbation of a trained model?

I get stuck while reading Goodfellow's paper on adversarial networks. In the explanation of the Figure 2 he stated that: b) The sign of the weights of a logistic regression model trained on MNIST. This is the optimal perturbation. I am wondering how I can get such an optimal perturbation. I have searched the Google only to find all links are referring to the usage of Optimal Perturbation Iteration Method and they are quite difficult to understand. Could anyone please explain how to get the optimal perturbation in Figure 2, b?
