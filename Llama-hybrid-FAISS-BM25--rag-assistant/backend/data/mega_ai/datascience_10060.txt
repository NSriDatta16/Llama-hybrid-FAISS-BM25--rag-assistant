Improve k-means accuracy

Our weapons : I am experimenting with k-means and Hadoop, where I am chained to these options for various reasons (e.g. Help me win this war! ). The battlefield : I have articles, which belong to c categories, where c is fixed. I am vectorizing the contents of the articles to TF-IDF features. Now I am running a naive k-means algorithm, which takes c centroids to begin with and starts, iteratively, grouping articles (i.e. rows of the TF-IDF matrix, where you can see here how I built it), until converenge occurs. Special notes : Initial centroids: Tried with random from within each category or with the mean of all the articles from each category. Distance function: Euclidean. Question(s) : The accuracy is poor, as expected, can I do any better, by making another choice for the initial centroids, or/and pick another distance function? print "Hello Data Science site!" :)
