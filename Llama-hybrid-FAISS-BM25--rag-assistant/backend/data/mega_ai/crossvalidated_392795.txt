K-means cluster labels are not numeric. They are categorical although it is common to use numbers. There is no order to them, and you must not use arithmetics on them. So it's better to think of them as A, B, C rather than 1, 2, 3. Hence, you must not compute correlation with the label. If you want to check if an independent variable correlates with the clusters, you could (and that would be consistent with the idea of k-means) correlate the original variable with the quantified version: For every point i, and variable z use qz = mean(z) averaged over the cluster of point i. So if you have three clusters, you get a three-level quantified version qz of z, and you then can look at cor(z,qz).
