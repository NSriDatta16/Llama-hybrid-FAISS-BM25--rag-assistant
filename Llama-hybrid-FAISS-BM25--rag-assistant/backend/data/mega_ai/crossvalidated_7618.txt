White box machine learning probability estimator

Have you ever heard about Child-Pugh cirrhosis score? There are five features, each feature is discretized in three intervals. For each interval you get a point, eg 1 for the first, 2 for the second etc. After computing all points you sum them up and then you get a cirrhosis stages ranked from A to C. Each stage is correlated to a particular probability to survive. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child-Pugh_score I have a DB with a many features and a label, the label is binary: ill and good. I have chosen probability estimation trees to get a white box model that estimates probabilities to be 'ill'. The model can show almost clearly the classification process, but I think that a Child-Pugh like score could be clearer than this for a medical doctor. Is there something similar in literature?
