Why do residuals cluster in two group?

I am running a logistic regression in a sample with ~150,000 observations. I am predicting three different outcomes, x, y, and z, that occur in ~10,000, ~4,000, and ~2,000 cases respectively (for each I am running a separate glm). When checking the residuals, they cluster in two groups, with most of the residuals from non-cases in one group, and most of the residuals from cases in the other group. Depending on the outcome, the proportion of cases that represent outlier residuals (if outlier is defined as lying >2 standard deviations from the mean), is between 0.95 and 0.99. So the model seems to be having issue with predicting cases accurately. Below is generic code that leads to this result. The figure is for the outcome with ~10,000 cases. The left part of the distribution (around 0) are residuals for non-cases. On the right (around 2) are residuals for cases. model What is likely to be causing this issue and how can it be rectified? Thanks.
