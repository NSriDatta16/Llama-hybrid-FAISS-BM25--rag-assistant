Comparing failure rates between 2 products with different number of deployed equipment

I have the following scenario, which I am trying to better understand. There are 2 different brands or groups of devices performing the same functionality as such: - Product/Brand 1 has 4,323 devices in service - Product/Brand 2 has 1,644 devices in service The table below identifies the failure/service rate required for each product group: Date Product 1 Product 2 ------------------------------- Mar-14 106 17 Apr-14 136 22 May-14 152 8 Jun-14 178 11 Jul-14 266 17 Aug-14 159 22 Sep-14 209 37 Oct-14 349 83 Nov-14 416 26 Dec-14 301 20 Jan-15 190 25 Feb-15 129 44 Mar-15 83 41 Apr-15 75 14 I am trying to understand whether the difference in the number of failures/service calls for the two products is attributable solely to the difference in the number of items in service, or whether there is evidence of a difference in the tfailure/servicing rate between products 1 & 2? My initial approach is to take the monthly ratio of each group (failure/devices in service) to get the percentage of total device failures as seen here: Date Product 1 Product 2 --------------------------------- Mar-14 0.025 0.010 Apr-14 0.031 0.013 May-14 0.035 0.005 Jun-14 0.041 0.007 Jul-14 0.062 0.010 Aug-14 0.037 0.013 Sep-14 0.048 0.023 Oct-14 0.081 0.050 Nov-14 0.096 0.016 Dec-14 0.070 0.012 Jan-15 0.044 0.015 Feb-15 0.030 0.027 Mar-15 0.019 0.025 Apr-15 0.017 0.009 If I average this over the 13 months of data, I have a failure/serving rate for 0.045 for Product 1 and 0.017 for Product 2. Then if I divide this by the units in service I get Product 1 as 1.05E-05 and Product 2 as 1.02E-05 which seems to me to imply that Product 1 has a failure rate of 3% more than Product 2. My question is am I going about this the right way and what statistical tools are there to identify whether the difference between the failures are significant or an artifact of a larger population?
