I am again using a question as an opportunity to learn more about time series - one of the (many) topics of my interest. After a brief research, it seems to me that there exist several approaches to the problem of modeling short time series. The first approach is to use standard/linear time series models (AR, MA, ARMA, etc.), but to pay attention to certain parameters, as described in this post [1] by Rob Hyndman, who does not need an introduction in time series and forecasting world. The second approach, referred to by most of the related literature that I have seen, suggest using non-linear time series models , in particular, the threshold models [2], which include threshold autoregressive model (TAR) , self-exiting TAR (SETAR) , threshold autoregressive moving average model (TARMA) , and TARMAX model, which extends TAR model to exogenous time series. Excellent overviews of the non-linear time series models, including threshold models, can be found in this paper [3] and this paper [4]. Finally, another IMHO related research paper [5] describes an interesting approach, which is based on Volterra-Weiner representation of non-linear systems - see this [6] and this [7]. This approach is argued to be superior to other techniques in the context of short and noisy time series . References Hyndman, R. (March 4, 2014). Fitting models to short time series. [Blog post].
