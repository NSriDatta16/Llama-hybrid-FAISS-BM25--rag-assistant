Very basic database theory

I have a set of tables to show the relationship between organziations and supporters below. Although I have done some basic mySQL queries, I know very little about database 'design'. I plan to query the database for: a list of contributors to a specific organization... or, a list of organizations that a specific supporter supports. The database tables for organiations and contributors may have other columns in the future and receive a lesser amount of queries based on that information. A | X A | Y A | Z B | X B | Y C | X C | Z How should the tables be set up? I assume that there should be a third table, but there is still redundant information in the third table. Is there a better way of setting up the tables? +----+-------+ +-------------+----------+ +----+-------+ | id | org | | org | contr | | id | contr.| +----+-------+ +-------------+----------+ +----+-------+ | 1 | A | | 1 | 1 | | 1 | X | | 2 | B | | 1 | 2 | | 2 | Y | | 3 | C | | 1 | 3 | | 3 | Z | +----+-------+ | 2 | 1 | +----+-------+ | 2 | 2 | | 3 | 1 | | 3 | 3 | +-------------+----------+
