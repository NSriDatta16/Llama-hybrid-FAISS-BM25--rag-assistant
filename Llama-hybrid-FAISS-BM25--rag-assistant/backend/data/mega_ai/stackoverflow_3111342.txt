Java How to prevent that an external library downloads a DTD file

I've created a program in java that starts as JNLP (Java WebStart). This program can connect to a webdav service at the server, the JNLP was started from. The first webdav request results in a security warning that some code tries to open a connection to w3.org. I'm using a external webdav client library which creates a document internaly. The library should not be manipulated or replaced. Is there any possibility to prevent the download of the DTD from outside of the library? Thank.
