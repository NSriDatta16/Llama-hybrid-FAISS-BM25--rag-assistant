I believe that calculating the coherence would be of use to you. The coherence at a frequency, $C_{XY}(f)$, between two series, $x(n)$ and $y(n)$, is defined as: $C_{XY}(f) = \frac{|P_{XY}(f)|^2}{P_{X}(f)P_{Y}(f)}$ Where $P_X(f)$ and $P_Y(f)$ are the power spectrum of the series $x(n)$ and $y(n)$ respectively. $P_{XY}(f)$ is called the cross-spectrum. Let's say that we calculate the spectrum of $x(n) = x_n$ by first Fourier transforming the windowed data: $X(f) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}h_n x_n e^{-i2\pi fn}$ where $h_n = h(n)$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ value of the window we are using. This implies that the power spectrum of $x(n)$ is: $P_{X}(f) = |X(f)|^2$ The cross spectrum is then: $P_{XY}(f) = |X(f) \cdot Y^{*}(f)|^{1/2}$, where $*$ denotes complex conjugate. Thus, the coherence is: $C_{XY}(f) = \frac{|X(f) \cdot Y^{*}(f)|}{|X(f)|^2 |Y(f)|^2}$. After this, you could calculate the average coherence I suppose - I don't think averaging is the correct approach honestly, I will do some more checking. This is hopefully a start though. Using a multitaper method for estimating your power spectra is a good idea (Spectrum Estimation and Harmonic Analysis, DJ Thomson, 1982 (paper) or Spectral Analysis for Physical Applications, Pervcival and Walden, 1993 (book)) as you are able to get a much reduced variance for your estimate. If you decide to go that route, I would suggest checking out: http://www.spectraworks.com/Help/mtmtheory.html for more info.
