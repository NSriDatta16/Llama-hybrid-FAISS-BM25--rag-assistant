Describe year-over-year survey data statistically when there are some same respondents but also new respondents

Assume a survey asks a question in year one that 100 respondents answer. In year two, the survey asks the identical question and 120 respondents answer, but only 80 of them took part in both surveys (these numbers are arbitrary, purely for creating an illustrative example). I gather from Time series with same variables but different respondents that this situation has produced what is called "repeated cross section data," but that answer only points to books or articles. It is straightforward to calculate the margin of error for the data from each year's survey, but is there a statistical way to quantify something like margin of error when there is an "overlap" of 80 respondents and 40 new respondents? In my field, surveys in the legal industry, reports simply state the increase or decrease from year to year, but they ignore the changed composition of the question's answer. How should they characterize the data in year two to quantify the mixture of old and new respondents? Thank you for any guidance to this statistically challenged surveyor. In response to the two comments: The first year obtained its participants from a large email campaign to law firm executives; only a small portion of those emailed completed the survey. The second year followed the same procedure and obtained completed surveys from the overlap group plus the others. There is no way to know why in the second year some of the first year folks dropped out or why the new group decided to take part. This is the way many surveys are conducted in the methodologically sloppy legal industry.
