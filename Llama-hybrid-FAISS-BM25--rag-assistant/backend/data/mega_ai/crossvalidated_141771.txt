Nonlinear total least squares / Deming regression in R

I've been using nls() to fit a custom model to my data, but I don't like how the model is fitting and I would like to use an approach that minimizes residuals in both x and y axes. I've done a lot of searching, and have found solutions for fitting linear models: via the deming package , various stackoverflow posts: total-least-square-method-using-r , how-to-calculate-total-least-squares-in-r-orthogonal-regression , and this very nice CrossValidated post: How to perform orthogonal regression (total least squares) via PCA? . I've also found a MATLAB solution: Total least squares curve fit problem , but these fit a second order polynomial and not a custom, user-defined model. What I would like is something similar to nls() that does the x and y residual minimization. This would allow me to enter my custom model. Is anyone aware of any solution in R? Here's an example, but please note that I'm seeking suggestions on a general solution for nonlinear total least squares regression, and not something specific to this dataset (this is just an example data from here ): df Does anyone have any suggestion for how I might proceed?
