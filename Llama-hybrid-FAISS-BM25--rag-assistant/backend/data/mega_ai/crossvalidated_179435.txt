Using imaginary parts (complex variables) with GLM in R

I have a dataset of accelerometer readings and I'm using fft to transform my data into frequency domain. Then, I would like to apply glm to find a model. The problem is that glm does not allow the use of complex variables, and I can't just give up of the imaginary parts. I'm trying to use Logistic Regression (that's why I'm using glm ). Is there a way to do it with the complex variables?
