How about you separate out the processes? Do the reading and fill a list of integers with the contents of the file. Then perform the processing for min / max and average later on. Isolating issues help you focus on them. I like to call this noise reduction. As a contractor I get to work on a lot of messy code and one of the reasons they are hard to understand is that too much is going on at the same time. If you simplify whats going on the code almost writes itself. This is also called Separation of Concerns. This is a very important programming principle. After you've isolated the issues and got the code working you can then try to put it all together again so the process is more efficient (if you do it inline with the file reading then you will only hold one line in memory at a time).
