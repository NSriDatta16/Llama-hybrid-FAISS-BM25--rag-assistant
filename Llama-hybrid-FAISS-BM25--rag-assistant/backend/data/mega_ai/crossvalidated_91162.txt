Stepping back a bit from the mechanistic workings of regression, and looking at the 'information economics' here, I see several missed opportunities in your approach to the data, JCB. Most importantly, the models you discuss seem to ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. (The variables x1..x6 are sequenced in time and grouped by mother.) Also, your use of averages makes me hope that maybe you had daily measures, but arbitrarily grouped and averaged them week-wise as a variable reduction approach. If by any chance you actually have not 6 but 7*6 cortisol measures per mother, then you have an opportunity to learn from some fairly rich time-series data spanning the menstrual cycle, and to formulate and test some pointed scientific hypotheses about causal mechanisms. What is the scientific question that motivates your search for an association?
