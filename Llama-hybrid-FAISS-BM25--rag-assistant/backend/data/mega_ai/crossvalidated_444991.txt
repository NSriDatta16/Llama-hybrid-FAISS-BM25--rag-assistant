t-test for means of daily conversion

Let's say I'm a/b testing a new site version and want to know if it improves conversion. I realize that conversion is a proportion so I would use a Z-test for this. But then I am thinking - it is not entirely clear to me why I can't compute the daily conversion rate and then take the average of these conversions over the time period of the test, and use a t-test to compare the averages. Is there something wrong with this approach that I am missing?
