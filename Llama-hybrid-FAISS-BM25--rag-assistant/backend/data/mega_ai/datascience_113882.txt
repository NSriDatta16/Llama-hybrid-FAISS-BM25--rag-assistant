ML/DL model needed to perform binary classification on binary input image dataset

I desperately need help regarding ML/NN models that would be appropriate for binary input data.. So, I have an image dataset in which [R,G,B] values can only take binary values (that is 0 and 1). For example, a pixel value can be [0, 1, 1] , or [1, 0, 0] , or [0, 0, 0] , or [.., .., ..] etc. Essentially, this makes an image to consist of only of the following colors : true red, true green, true blue, true grey, true yellow, true magenta, true black, and true white. What is more, I would like to perform binary classification for this dataset. For example, this is an array of an image: [[[1. 1. 1.] [1. 1. 1.] [1. 1. 1.] ... ... [1. 0. 0.] [1. 0. 0.] [1. 0. 0.]] [[1. 1. 1.] [1. 1. 1.] [1. 1. 1.] ... [1. 0. 0.] [1. 0. 0.] [1. 0. 0.]] ... [0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0.]]] Which ML (say SVM) or DL model would be appropriate for such a task? I am not sure CNN would be an appropriate approach, even if I am dealing with images, as I doubt NN can work with binary input data. In fact, I performed a simple NN (not CNN) on them and all y labels were predicted to be 0. However, I am not sure if my implementation was correct because I don't have much experience in the field (and maybe my NN was wrong). Please correct me if I am wrong. Does anybody have an idea of how I could make this could work? I forgot to mention that these are 256x256 images and I think the end dataset will be quite large (>5000), in case that info is needed. Please help!! Thank you so much in advance!
