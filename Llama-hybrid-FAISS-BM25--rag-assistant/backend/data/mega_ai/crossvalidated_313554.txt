The concepts are diagonal to each other in a contingency table. A frequentist probability is the probability (/frequency) that a test or interval fails/succeeds. That is, the probability that a test says positive when we are healthy/sick, and/or the probability that a test says negative when we are sick/healthy. $$ \begin{align} &sick& healthy&\quad sum\\ negative \quad&\color{green}{99}& \color{red}{99 \, 999 \, 999} &\quad 100 \, 000 \,098\\ positive\quad &\color{red}1& \color{green}{9\,899\,999 \,901} & \quad 9\,899\,999 \,902 \\ sum \quad& 100 & 9\, 999\, 999\, 900 & \quad \color{blue}{100\, 000\, 000\, 000} \end{align}$$ It is the sum of the red sections divided by the blue section. $$\frac{\color{red}1 + \color{red}{99 \, 999 \, 999} }{\color{blue}{100\, 000\, 000\, 000}} = 0.01$$ Which contrast with the sum of the green sections divided by the blue section. $$\frac{\color{green}{99} + \color{green}{9 \, 899 \, 999 \, 901} }{\color{blue}{100\, 000\, 000\, 000}} = 0.99$$ Note that these are relating to the columns of the 2x2 contingency table (both have ratios 1:99 and 99:1). A Bayesian probability is the probability that a given estimate is true. $$ \begin{align} &sick& healthy&\quad sum\\ negative \quad&99& {99 \, 999 \, 999} &\quad 100 \, 000 \,098\\ positive\quad &\color{red}1& \color{green}{9\,899\,999 \,901} & \quad \color{blue}{9\,899\,999 \,902} \\ sum \quad& 100 & 9\, 999\, 999\, 900 & \quad {100\, 000\, 000\, 000} \end{align}$$given a particular outcome. Note that these are relating to the rows of the 2x2 table. And, they are not the same as the frequentist's probabilities. ---------------------------- In words: Frequentist: If we are healthy, then a failure is a test outcome telling us we are sick, And if we are sick, then a failure is a test outcome telling us we are healthy. This can be different than the probability that a certain outcome (test/interval) is true or not. Bayesian: If we have a test outcome telling us that we are sick then either we are either sick and the test was right. Or, not sick and the test was wrong. The probability of these two situations, which Bayesian techniques answer (using prior information), do not follow directly from frequentist probabilities. ---------------------------- Since we know about the 1 in 100 million (prior knowledge) we can say: In the case of a positive test result... much more often will there be patients with false negatives (1% of 99 999 999 in 100 million) than true positives (99% of 1 in 100 million), and thus one can not say that the probability is 99% that the test result is right (yet, still the test is 1% wrong, namely 1% wrong in the 99 999 999 out of 100 million truly negative cases, and 1% wrong in the 1 out of 100 million truly positive cases ).
