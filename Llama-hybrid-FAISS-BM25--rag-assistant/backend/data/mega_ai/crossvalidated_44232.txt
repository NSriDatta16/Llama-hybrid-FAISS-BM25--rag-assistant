You probably need to first normalize your data [A] You should never just use just one classifier and end it there. Certain choices of classifiers are also done based on the data characteristics. For example, if your data has quite a bit of missing attribute values, decision trees almost always tend to do better than any other model. The order in which I use the classifiers: 1] SVMs [B] 2] Logistic Regression/Multinomial Logistic Regression [C] 3] Decision Trees [D] I usually first try SVMs, if I get my results with the standard implementations of SVM then great! If not, then try to use LR/MLR from Weka. The only reason I try SVM first is because Weka is not great at handling large datasets for training. But this might not be the case for you, so you can try LR/MLR first as well if you wish. If neither SVM nor LR give the desired result, then I simply move to Decision Trees. After running all of them, I just pick the one that performed the best.
