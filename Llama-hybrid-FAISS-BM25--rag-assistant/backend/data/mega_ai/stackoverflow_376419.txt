I am not entirely sure what you mean by "undefined behaviors", but as others have pointed out, the core language is very predictable across platforms, and versions of the language and JVM. This is not true for graphics (Swing, AWT), however, which tend to be unpredictable and not necessarily reproducible across different platforms. I worked on a graphics intensive Java based visualization application and I spent a lot of time "writing once, and debugging everywhere". Also, Object.clone() has some major problems, and its use is discouraged in most cases. Please see Item 11, from "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch for a complete answer.
