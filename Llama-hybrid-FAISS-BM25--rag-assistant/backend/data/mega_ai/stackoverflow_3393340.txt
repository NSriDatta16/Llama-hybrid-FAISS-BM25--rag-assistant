Question Regarding Dynamic memory allocation

I have questions regarding stacks and dynamic memory allocation. 1) Does kernel determine the size of the stack dynamically during run time or sets the size before the load time ? If stack size is allocated dynamically how can stack overflow take place (Because if size of stack reaches beyond the limit the page handler will allocate space to grow the stack). Also If dynamically allocated how can stack grow from higher address to lower address(because always the virtual address increments for dynamically allocated storage right?) 2) Also if memory is allocated dynamically using malloc the size of the data region grows right ? Thanks & Regards, Mousey.
