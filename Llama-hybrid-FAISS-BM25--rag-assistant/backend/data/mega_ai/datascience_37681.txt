Been there, done that, it is still hard. For complex HTML sources, using shallow feature analysis proved to be best -- so a package like Dragnet is a good place to start.

For some things, your can just carry the tags in the text (boolean find), others you cannot (classification between sites). Configure, test, repeat. But a one size fits all, that is really hard -- I am also not convinced that some of the services can do much beyond Dragnet.
