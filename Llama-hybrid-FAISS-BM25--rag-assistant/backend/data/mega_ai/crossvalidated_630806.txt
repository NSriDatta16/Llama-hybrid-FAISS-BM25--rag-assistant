This particular problem is simple enough that you are able to calculate the solution by narrowing down to all the particular paths that will satisfy the required condition (or its negation). Using this method we find only one path that gets home in no more than 30 minutes (going directly home with no backward steps, which occurs with probability $(\tfrac{1}{2})^3 = \tfrac{1}{8}$ ). This means that the probability of getting home after 30 minutes is $1- \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{7}{8}$ . Although this solution method works in this simple case, in more complicated problems of this kind it is usually not feasible to count through all paths that meet a condition. For this reason, I will show you how to calculate the solution using standard Markov chain analysis, which can easily be applied when the problem is made more complicated, with large numbers of paths meeting/not meeting the condition of interest. The present method is overkill in this particular case, but it may be useful to help you understand how you can solve problems of this general kind even if they are more complicated than your particular problem. This is the type of problem that can be solved by framing it as a discrete-time discrete-space Markov chain. Letting $\mathscr{S} = \{ U,S_1,S_2,S_3,H \}$ denote the five spatial states you have described, and treating home as an absorbing state, the transition probability matrix for the Markov chain is: $$\mathbf{P} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}.$$ Over four time steps we get: $$\mathbf{P}^4 = \begin{bmatrix} \tfrac{3}{8} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{8} \\ 0 & \tfrac{5}{8} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{4} & \tfrac{1}{8} \\ \tfrac{1}{4} & 0 & \tfrac{3}{8} & 0 & \tfrac{3}{8} \\ 0 & \tfrac{1}{4} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{8} & \tfrac{5}{8} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}.$$ Suppose we let $T$ denote the number of steps required to move from the university to home (i.e., the "hitting time" for the home state when we start at the university). The probability of interest to you is: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{P}(7 T > 30) &= \mathbb{P}(T > 30/7) \\[6pt]&= \mathbb{P}(T > \lfloor 30/7 \rfloor) \\[6pt] &= \mathbb{P}(T > 4) \\[6pt] &= 1-[\mathbf{P}^4]_{U,H} \\[6pt] &= 1- \tfrac{1}{8} \\[6pt] &= \tfrac{7}{8}. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$
