When you need exec and eval, yeah, you really do need them. But, the majority of the in-the-wild usage of these functions (and the similar constructs in other scripting languages) is totally inappropriate and could be replaced with other simpler constructs that are faster, more secure and have fewer bugs. You can , with proper escaping and filtering, use exec and eval safely. But the kind of coder who goes straight for exec/eval to solve a problem (because they don't understand the other facilities the language makes available) isn't the kind of coder that's going to be able to get that processing right; it's going to be someone who doesn't understand string processing and just blindly concatenates substrings, resulting in fragile insecure code. It's the Lure Of Strings. Throwing string segments around looks easy and fools na√Øve coders into thinking they understand what they're doing. But experience shows the results are almost always wrong in some corner (or not-so-corner) case, often with potential security implications. This is why we say eval is evil. This is why we say regex-for-HTML is evil. This is why we push SQL parameterisation. Yes, you can get all these things right with manual string processing... but unless you already understand why we say those things, chances are you won't .
