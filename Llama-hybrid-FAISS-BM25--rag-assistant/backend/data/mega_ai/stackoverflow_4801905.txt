Paperclip sharpening processor causes resizing styles not to work

I'm trying to sharpen images uploaded through paperclip. The sharpen code is working but it causes the styles to not work. The code is like this: has_attached_file :photo, :styles => { :thumb => {:geometry => "100x100>"}, :medium => {:geometry => "300x300>"}, :original => {:geometry => "1024x1024>"} }, :processors => [:sharpen], :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/:style/:id/:filename" Now if I remove the processors option, the uploaded images are resized as specified. However if I include the processors option, all the resulting images are of original size. My sharpen processor looks like this: module Paperclip class Sharpen Any thoughts?
