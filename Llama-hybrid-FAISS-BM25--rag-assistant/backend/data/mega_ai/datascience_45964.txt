To create a pre-trained model for C#

I created a model with machine learning. Using the library Accord.NET . I would like to keep the pre-trained model in a file (not in the RAM memory) how this is possible? Note: not necessary to create the model with Accord.NET could be with Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc) but to use the pre-trained model from my desktop application in C#.
