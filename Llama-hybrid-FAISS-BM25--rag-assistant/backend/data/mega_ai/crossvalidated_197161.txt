In addition to what Richard Hardy said, we can use unobserved component model (UCM). It allows us to include regressors. I have also seen people using Random Forest and neural network for forecasting considering other regressors. You can compare the fitted values against actual and test the model accuracy on a holdout sample as well to see which model is performing better.
