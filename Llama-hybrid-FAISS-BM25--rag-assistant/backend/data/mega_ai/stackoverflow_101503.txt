Why not just (cons x y) By the way, I tried to run your code in CLISP and it didn't work as expected. Since I'm not a big fan of the loop macro here's how you might accomplish the same thing recursively: (defun genint (stop) (if (= stop 1) '(1) (append (genint (- stop 1)) (list stop)))) (defun genpairs (x y) (let ((row (mapcar #'(lambda (y) (cons x y)) (genint y)))) (if (= x 0) row (append (genpairs (- x 1) y) row)))) (genpairs 100 100)
