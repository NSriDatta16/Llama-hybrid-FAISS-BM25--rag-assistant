CardDAV with osX/iPhone clients

I am implementing a CardDAV backend to a crm package. During the handshake with my backend the following request/response is handled: PROPFIND /directory/ HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.0.0.202:9292 User-Agent: Address%20Book/883 CFNetwork/454.11.12 Darwin/10.7.0 (i386) (MacBookPro4%2C1) Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Depth: 0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Length: 147 Connection: keep-alive HTTP/1.1 207 Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8" Content-Length: 432 Connection: keep-alive Server: thin 1.2.11 codename Bat-Shit Crazy http://10.0.0.202:9292/directory/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK PROPFIND /contacts/ HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.0.0.202:9292 User-Agent: Address%20Book/883 CFNetwork/454.11.12 Darwin/10.7.0 (i386) (MacBookPro4%2C1) Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Depth: 0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Length: 167 Connection: keep-alive HTTP/1.1 207 Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8" Content-Length: 408 Connection: keep-alive Server: thin 1.2.11 codename Bat-Shit Crazy http://10.0.0.202:9292/contacts/ http://10.0.0.202:9292/contacts/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK This is despite my CardDAV backend never hinting that /directory/ is anything that the client need concern itself with. The client is returning the error The CardDAV server returned an error (207) for the user "richo" , however when I patched the server to return a different status code (200) I got the same error, but with a new status code. I am working on the hunch that something else is upsetting it about the response. I have tried returning absolute instead of relative URL's (and vice versa) to no avail. Any input appreciated. There is a similar issue on the mac forums here that seems to end with resolution but the links are broken.
