I've found the answer on an other forum. I hope this will help somebody else too. Answer: You can detect the end of the gesture by checking the UIRotationGestureRecognizer's state in your action method. If [gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded then it's done. If something had instead caused it to be cancelled (for instance, a phone call coming in) then you'd see it end in UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled instead. If you want to apply the recognizer's rotation directly to your view rather than treat it as a delta from the previous location you can set the recognizer's rotation the its state is UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan, and then it will calculate offsets from that value and you can apply them directly. This just requires that you remember the rotation you last ended at, and then you can do something like [gestureRecognizer setRotation:lastAppliedRotation] when the recognizer's state is UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan.
