This is called type affinity in SQLite. According to the SQLite website, they have done this "in order to maximize compatibility between SQLite and other database engines." (see the above link) SQLite supports the concept of "type affinity" on columns. The type affinity of a column is the recommended type for data stored in that column. The important idea here is that the type is recommended, not required. Any column can still store any type of data. It is just that some columns, given the choice, will prefer to use one storage class over another. The preferred storage class for a column is called its "affinity". My understanding is that SQLite is exactly what it's named for - a very lightweight, minimalistic database engine. The overhead associated with strong typing is probably beyond the scope of the project, and best left to the application that uses SQLite. But again, according to their website, they've done this to maximize compatibility with other DB engines.
