The first comments are the variables and methods names. A lot of attention shall be paid to choose them. Do not hesitate to rename them if you can think of a better name. Consistency and convention also help. Try to avoid NumberOfStuff, ThingCount, FooSize, always use the same form, possibly something in line with the language (does it have Array.length, or Vector.size). Always name similar things with similar names. "Code never lies. Comments sometimes do" . One day or the other, someone will modify the code and not the associated comment. Better spenf more time writing self-explanatory code complemented with some clever comment, than splitting out code and then explaining things with a lot of comments.
