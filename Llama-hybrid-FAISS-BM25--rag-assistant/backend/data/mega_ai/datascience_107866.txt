The kind of sound you are describing, that have a well defined duration and can be counted, is called a sound event. The task of detecting such is called Sound Event Detection (SED). Sometimes one also sees it called Audio Event Detection or Acoustic Event Detection (AED). There are some resources for learning about it online, for example: Sound Event Detection using Machine Learning (EuroPython 2021) Sound Event Detection: A Tutorial The key to doing this in real-time, is to process the audio as many short, fixed length analysis windows. Say that your model takes 1 second of audio as input, then you would every 0.1 second (for example) give it the last 1 second of audio, make a classification, and process that.
