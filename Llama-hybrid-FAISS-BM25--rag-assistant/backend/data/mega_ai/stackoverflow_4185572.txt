ASP.NET developer looking to get into SharePoint - 2007 or 2010?

I've been working with ASP.NET for about 5 years now and I'm looking to get into SharePoint development. Would it make more sense to get up to speed on SP 2007 first or just dive straight into SP 2010? Seems like learning SP 2007 would give me a better understanding of the "story" and broaden my work opportunities. What do we think? Is a grasp of SP 2007 a must for any SP developer at this point? Thanks Thanks for the helpful and encouraging answers. Seems the unanimous recommendation is to skip SP 2007 and dive straight into SP 2010 as the dev tools are much better, so I'll probably do that :)
