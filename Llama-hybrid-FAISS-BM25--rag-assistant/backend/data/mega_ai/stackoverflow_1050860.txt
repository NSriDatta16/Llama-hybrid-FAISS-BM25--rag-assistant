Catch, Handle, then Rethrow Exception?

I ran into an interesting dilemma today. I have a function that handles information and checks for duplicate values, then returns the next number that is not a duplicate. So, I have something like this: Public Function GetNextNonDuplicateNumber(NumberToCheck as Long) as Long //the non-duplicate the function will return Dim NonDuplicate as Long If CheckForDuplicate(NumberToCheck) = True Then Throw New DuplicateException() Else NonDuplicate = NumberToCheck End If End Function Then at the bottom of the function I have a catch block that handles the duplicate by incrementing until I don't have a duplicate any more, like this: Catch ex as DuplicateException NonDuplicate = IncrementToNonDuplicateValue(NumberToCheck) Throw ex Return NonDuplicate End Function As you can see, I want to handle the exception specifically, but I also want to throw it when I'm done because I want to alert other code outside the function. The problem is that simply throwing it exits out of the function with a null value. Am I thinking about a try/catch the wrong way, or is there a way around this?
