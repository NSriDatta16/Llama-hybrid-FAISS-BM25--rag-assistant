Modal Confirm Box Using JQuery in ASP.Net

I want a similar behavior of “confirm delete” option in ASP.Net Gridview, as this questions shows How to add a "confirm delete" option in ASP.Net Gridview? but using Jquery Confirm Box. I'm having a lot of problem with postback behavior and asp.net page flow. I want domething simple as: " OnClick="ButtonRemove_Click" OnClientClick="displayConfirmDialog();/> Some idea how I can fire the OnClick event in javascript, or how a can put a Panel as confirm dialog? *today I use ajaxcontroltoolkit, but as this was discontinued I'm trying to figure out some more elegant alternative.
