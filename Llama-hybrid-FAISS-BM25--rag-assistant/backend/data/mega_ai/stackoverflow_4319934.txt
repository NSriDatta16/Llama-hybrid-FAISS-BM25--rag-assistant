Windows share indexing

I'd like to index a Windows share for a workgroup of Win7 clients using open-source technologies. Users should be able to run full-text queries against the contents of .doc, .xls, .ppt, .pdf, .txt, .rtf, etc. files added through the UNC path via drag-n-drop, no need to manually trigger the index update. What's the software stack for this? Trying not to use Win Indexing here.
