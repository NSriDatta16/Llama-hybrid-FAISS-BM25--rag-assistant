Embeddable Java HTTP Servers

There seems to be multiple extremes when supporting embeddable Java HTTP servers. I have seen minimalist approaches such as NanoHTTPD and leveraging the com.sun.net.httpserver package to attempting to embed Jetty and Tomcat. The ideal embeddable HTTP server would be implemented such that it could be launched via Executor and come with Servlet/JSP support but otherwise should allow for using the logger of its parent and allow for integrating its JMX hooks. Likewise, it should also be modular enough where you can have the option of NOT including certain pieces of functionality. Has anyone ran across any Java-based HTTP servers with this characteristic?
