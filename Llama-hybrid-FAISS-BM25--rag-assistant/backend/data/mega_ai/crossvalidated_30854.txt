First, if your models are not embedded, i.e., if one is not a simplification/complexification of another, you cannot directly use the likelihood ratio test . The simplest way to answer the first part of your question is to direct you to information criteria like Akaike's AIC , Schwarz' BIC , and Spiegelhatler's DIC . These criteria lead to a numerical comparison of models by adding to the maximal likelihood under a given model $$ \max_{\theta_i} L_i(\theta_i|\mathbf{x}) $$ a penalisation term that corresponds to the "complexity" of the model. For instance, \begin{align*} AIC(M_i) &= 2k_i - 2\ln\{\max_{\theta_i} L_i(\theta_i|\mathbf{x})\}\\ BIC(M_i) &= 2k_i \ln(n) -2\ln\{\max_{\theta_i} L_i(\theta_i|\mathbf{x})\}\\ DIC(M_i) &= 2\hat k_i(\mathbf{x}) - 2 \mathbb{E}^{\theta_i}[\ln L(\mathbf{x}|\theta_i)|\mathbf{x}] \end{align*} where $DIC(M_i)$ involves a prior distribution for each model, $\pi_i(\theta_i)$, and where $\hat k_i(\mathbf{x})$ is the estimated or effective number of parameters, $$ \hat k_i(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}^{\theta_i}[\ln L(\mathbf{x}|\theta_i)|\mathbf{x}] - \ln L\left(\mathbf{x}\bigg| \mathbb{E}^{\theta_i}[\theta_i |\mathbf{x}]\right) $$ As a Bayesian ,and from a philosophical viewpoint as well, I do not have an answer to your second question! We need models (including nonparametric ones) to run the comparison. As Sherlock pounded on Watson , "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"
