Here is one quick note that may help. In this example, and based on your jQuery selector, I think you are expecing the id of each div to be "amico_1", "amico_2" and so on... perhaps based on the item id? In any case, the id attribute must be unique. " idAmico="" class="drag"> Notice also that I have added a class of "drag" to the div. This means your selector can be updated from this: $("div[id^='amico_']").draggable({ revert: "valid" }); To this $(".drag").draggable({ revert: "valid" }); And my last suggestion is that you've got a small mistake on this line... var index = $(".ui-draggable").attr('idAmico'); It should actuall be var index = $(ui.draggable).attr('idAmico'); You should notice that there is a parameter named ui that gets passed into your droppable event. This contains the current dragged element. Hope this helps.
