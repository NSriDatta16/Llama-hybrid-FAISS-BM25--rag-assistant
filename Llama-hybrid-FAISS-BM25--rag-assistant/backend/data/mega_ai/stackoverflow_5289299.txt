Another option is to left join your Results table with your existing competitors Table and find the new competitors by filtering the distinct records that donÂ´t match int the join: INSERT Competitors (cName) SELECT DISTINCT cr.Name FROM CompResults cr left join Competitors c on cr.Name = c.cName where c.cName is null New syntax MERGE also offer a compact, elegant and efficient way to do that: MERGE INTO Competitors AS Target USING (SELECT DISTINCT Name FROM CompResults) AS Source ON Target.Name = Source.Name WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (Name) VALUES (Source.Name);
