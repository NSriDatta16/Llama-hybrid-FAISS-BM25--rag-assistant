How can I aggregate rows to reduce the resolution of data in a SQL query?

I'm working with an MSSQL 2000 database containing large amounts of Windows perfmon data collected for all servers in the environment. I'm using SSRS 2005 to build a custom report chart to visualize the metrics over time. If I wanted to view, say, the last month the extensive number of data points would create an ugly report with unreadable labels on the X axis. I would like to reduce the aggregate the data by time down to n data points so to give the average value over the grouped time spans. I've tried building a query with fancy GROUP BY clauses, haven't been able to build something that executes. I figured this ought to be a common task for SQL, but I haven't found any answers online. The table structure basically looks like below. This is actually the MOM 2005 OnePoint database, but I think the application is irrelevant. CREATE TABLE PerfTable ( [time] datetime, value float, Server nvarchar(356), ObjectName nvarchar(225), CounterName nvarchar(225), InstanceName nvarchar(225), Scale float );
