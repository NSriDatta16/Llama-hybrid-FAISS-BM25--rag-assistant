you can use stty to disable echo this solution works without bash or certain features from read stty_orig=$(stty -g) stty -echo read password stty $stty_orig If you use this in a shell script then also set an exit handler which restores echo: #! /bin/sh stty_orig=$(stty -g) trap "stty ${stty_orig}" EXIT stty -echo ... this is to make sure echo is restored regardless of how the script exits. otherwise the echo will stay off if the script errors out. to turn echo back on manually type the following command stty echo you will have to type blindly because you do not see what you type. i suggest to press ctrl+c first to clear anything else you might have typed before. trivia echo means to echo your typed input back to your screen. this is from the time we worked on teletypewriters (that is what the tty means). a teletypewriter is like a typewriter but connected to another teletypewriter or computer. typically via telephone cable. the workflow on a teletypewriter is roughly as follows: you type in your command (or message for the other side). then the teletypewriter will print the response from the other side. when you work on a teletypewriter you see your input as you type. this is because the teletypewriter is also a typewriter and as such prints the characters as you press them. when teletypewriters where replaced by screens there was no longer a typewriter which types your input. instead we had to deliberate code an "echo" function which prints your input as you type. i do not know whether stty -echo also disabled printing on a teletypewriter. see here for a teletypewriter in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XLZ4Z8LpEE (first part is restoration. action starting at about 12 minutes in) more teletypewriter restoration: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-_93BVApb5-9eQLTCk9xx16RAGEYHH1q
