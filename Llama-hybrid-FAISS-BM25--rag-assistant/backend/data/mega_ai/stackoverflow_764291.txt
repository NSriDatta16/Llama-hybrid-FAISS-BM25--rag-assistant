There are some great options for you with the MVC Framework. One is having a hidden input on your form that stores the information for you. So when you hit a resort button then it keys in on that field to determine the sort order. A second more elegant way of doing it is having a value associated with your button, so if I hit title it sorts by title, if i hit author it sorts by author. The controller will be able to detect this. Lastly there are some excellent javascript controls you can use that automatically do all this for you. One that comes to mind is EXT Grid control which is absolutely awsome. It involves some work with javascript but its totally worth it! Hope this helps
