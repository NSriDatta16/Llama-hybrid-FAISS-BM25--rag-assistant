CoverageInfo.getCoverageStatus() vs CoverageInfo.isCoverageSufficient(), are they the same?

In trying to determing a if a specific connection is supported, I'm cofused about the difference between CoverageInfo.getCoverageStatus() and CoverageInfo.isCoverageSufficient() . For example: // check mds with getCoverageStatus() and bitwise check boolean hasMdsCoverage1 = (CoverageInfo.getCoverageStatus() & CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS) == CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS; // check mds with isCoverageSufficient() boolean hasMdsCoverage2 = CoverageInfo.isCoverageSufficient(CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS); Both hasMdsCoverage1 and hasMdsCoverage2 seem to return the same result, but why two different approaches? Is there ever a case where they'll return a different result? Ideally I'd like to use CoverageInfo.isCoverageSufficent() since this looks cleaner in code, but before I do so I want to make sure I'm not missing out on anything that getCoverageStatus() would provide. NOTE: I'm using this to check for valid connections via BIS, MDS, WAP and WAP2 protocols.
