If there was a general fast and easy method to do it, for any given data, people wouldn't bother themselves with criteria such as AIC, BIC as you listed. These are all heuristics. This problem is also prevalent in many clustering algorithms. You're lucky if your data is MDS which tries to preserve the distances between data points, and visualize afterwards. Note that while this might be helpful in some cases, it can sometimes fail you badly. For a good alternative, you might look at Variational Bayesian GMM , that doesn't need presetting the number of mixtures. It is also computationally cumbersome, but a quite different approach compared to classical ones.
