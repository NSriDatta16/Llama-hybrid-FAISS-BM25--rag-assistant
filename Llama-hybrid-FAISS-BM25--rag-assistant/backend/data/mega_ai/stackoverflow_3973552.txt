This is the website in question: http://www.ai-ad.com/2010Cwb/insidePage.html The issue is with the bottom left jQuery UI Tabs (there are five tabs named : 淡水、陽明山、基隆、烏來、石門水庫) In IE 6, when I move the cursor to other tabs, the content height under the tab will change. It seems to require a few lines of javascript in order to "tame" the "misbehaved" way that IE6 renders certain CSS code. Albert in Manila
