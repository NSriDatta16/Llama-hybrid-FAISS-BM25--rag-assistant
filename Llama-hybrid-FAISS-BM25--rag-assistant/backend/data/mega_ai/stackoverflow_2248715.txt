The Code Signing Identity setting (of either your project and/or target) sometimes contains your name (or your organization's name). So I'd clear out that setting (in all configurations) from the project file. All the really sensitive items (e.g., your private key) are kept in the OS X keychain, not in any project files. Inside ProjectName.xcodeproj , you'll find project.pbxproj and some other files. You only want to distribute project.pbxproj , the other files are specific settings for you/your computer. Also, project.pbxproj is just a text file. You can take a look inside and see what you're giving out.
