In general, dig into an advanced time series analysis textbook (introductory books will usually direct you to just trust your software), like Time Series Analysis by Box, Jenkins & Reinsel. You may also find details on the Box-Jenkins procedure by googling. Note that there are other approaches than Box-Jenkins, e.g., AIC-based ones. In R, you first convert your data into a ts (time series) object and tell R that the frequency is 12 (monthly data): require(forecast) sales You can plot the (partial) autocorrelation functions: acf(sales) pacf(sales) These don't suggest any AR or MA behavior. Then you fit a model and inspect it: model See ?auto.arima for help. As we see, auto.arima chooses a simple (0,0,0) model, since it sees neither trend nor seasonality nor AR or MA in your data. Finally, you can forecast and plot the time series and forecast: plot(forecast(model)) Look at ?forecast.Arima (note the capital A!). This free online textbook is a great introduction to time series analysis and forecasting using R. Very much recommended.
