Predictive models to predict sales with r

I would like to find a good model to predict which client will buy my product in 2018. I would like to have opinions on which method can fit my data to predict which client will the product A in 2018. I have the following data: client buyproductin17 buyproductin16 buyproductin15 all_day day_cnt product 22 1 0 1 34 5 2 23 0 1 1 56 11 2 24 1 1 1 122 45 3 client = client ID buyproduct17 = if the client buy the product A in 2017 or not buyproduct16 = if the client buy the product A in 2016 or not buyproduct15 = if the client buy the product A in 2015 or not all_day = total number of day the client spent with all my product day_cnt = total number of day the client spent with product A product = total number of product A the client has My first thought are a logistic regression model or a random forest. But which dependant variable can I use ? buyproductin17 ? Thanks a lot Dany
