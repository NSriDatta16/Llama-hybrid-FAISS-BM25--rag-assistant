The number of holes detected would be limited to the number of holes visible in the image (I mean obviously!:P). So you cannot count the holes for example at the back of the cheese since they wont be visible. With that being said this is a problem which requires a CNN (Convolution Neural Network) . You could train an object detection model to detect the holes in the image. Then simply add them up . This is the most straightforward/easy way to solve your problem. Try using YoloV5 as this is an easy model to train and is also state of art!
