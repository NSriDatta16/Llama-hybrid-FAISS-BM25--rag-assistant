Let me recall ( from my book ) the precise setting of Wald's characterisation of admissible estimators: first, Stein's theorems for admissible procedures to be limit of Bayes procedures: Charles Stein (1955) produced a necessary and sufficient condition : if (i) $f(x|\theta)$ is continuous in $\theta$ and strictly positive on $\Theta$ ; and (ii) the loss function $\text{L}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is strictly convex, continuous and, if $E\subset\Theta$ is compact, $$ \lim_{\|\delta\|\rightarrow +\infty} \inf_{\theta\in E} \text{L}(\theta,\delta) =+\infty, $$ then an estimator $\delta$ is admissible if, and only if, there exist (a) a sequence $(F_n)$ of increasing compact sets such that $\Theta=\bigcup_n F_n$ , (b) a sequence $(\pi_n)$ of finite measures with support $F_n$ , and (c) a sequence $(\delta_n)$ of Bayes estimators associated with $\pi_n$ such that there exists a compact set $E_0\subset \Theta$ such that $\inf_n \pi_n(E_0) \ge 1$ ; if $E\subset \Theta$ is compact, $\sup_n \pi_n(E) ; $\lim_n r(\pi_n,\delta)-r(\pi_n) = 0$ ; and $\lim_n R(\theta,\delta_n)= R(\theta,\delta)$ . Larry Brown (1986) provides an alternative, and quite general, characterization of admissible estimators. Consider $x\sim f(x|\theta)$ , and assume $\text{L}$ to be lower semi-continuous and such that $$ \lim_{||\delta||\rightarrow +\infty} \text{L}(\theta,\delta) = +\infty. $$ Brown (1986) shows that, under these conditions, the closure (for the pointwise convergence) of the set of all Bayes estimators is a complete class. Proposition If L is strictly convex, every admissible estimator of $\theta$ is a pointwise limit of Bayes estimators for a sequence of priors with finite supports. Second, the generic Wald (1950)'s complete class result: Theorem Consider the case when $\Theta$ is compact and the risk set $$ \mathcal R = \{(R(\theta,\delta))_{\theta\in\Theta},\ \delta\in\mathcal D^*\}, $$ is convex (where $\mathcal D^*$ denotes the set of randomised decisions). If all estimators have a continuous risk function, the Bayes estimators constitute a complete class. and a remark about cases when it does not hold: In the case of distributions with discrete support, the completeness of generalised Bayes estimators does not always hold and complete classes involve piecewise-Bayesian procedures (see Berger and Srinivasan (1978), Brown (1981), and Brown and Farrell (1985)). These results do not imply that every admissible estimator can be associated with a proper prior or an improper prior. Furthermore, even if this is the case, there are as many "admissible" priors as there are admissible estimators, hence no apparent restriction on the choice of priors. (This is why admissibility is a desirable feature rather than an optimality property per se.) In the same way that the notion of an "objective", "uninformative", "default" prior does not meet a consensus in the Bayesian community, there is no consensus about a default frequentist procedure that would lead to the notion of a "frequentist prior". Note in addition that associating a prior with a frequentist procedure is depending on the choice of the loss function L, hence varying with the quantity of interest.
