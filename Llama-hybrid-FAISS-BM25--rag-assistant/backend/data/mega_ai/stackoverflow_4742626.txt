Thats not a good practice, and i would discourage you from doing it. With that said (and bolded, haha) you should be able to copy the included schema into your project level schema and add the tableName key to each record definition. I know that modify the schema in this way works generally speaking because i do it regularly to add extra columns to sfGuardUser instead of using a full blown profile class... i assume that modifying the table name would work as well. That should after building the db you should see your table names. The thing is if there are cases in the actual plugin code where someone has hard coded the table name instead of using the alias defined in the model things may not work. I dont know that there are any situations like this, but you should test thoroughly before moving on with the project.
