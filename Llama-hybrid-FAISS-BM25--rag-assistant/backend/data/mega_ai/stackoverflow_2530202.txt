Personally, I find plyr not very easy to understand. I prefer data.table which is also faster. For instance you want to do the standard deviation of colum my_column for each ID. dt Three statements of this kind and a cbind at the end - that is all you need. You can also use dt do some action for only one ID without a subset command in an new syntax: result.sd.oneiD The first statment refers to rows (i), the second to columns (j). If find it easier to read then player and it is more flexible, as you can also do sub domains within a "subset"... The documentation describes that it uses SQL-like methods. For instance, the by is pretty much "group by" in SQL. Well, if you know SQL, you can probably do much more, but it is not necessary to make use of the package. Finally, it is extremely fast, as each operation is not only parallel, but also data.table grabs the data needed for calculation. Subset, however, maintain the levels of the whole matrix and drag it trough the memory.
