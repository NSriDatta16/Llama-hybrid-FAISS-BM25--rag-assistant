Pooling can refer to combining data, but it can also refer to combining information rather than the raw data. One of the most common uses of pooling is in estimating a variance. If we believe that 2 populations have the same variance, but not necesarily the same mean, then we can calculate the 2 estimates of the variance from samples of the 2 groups, then pool them (take a weighted average) to get a single estimate of the common variance. We do not compute a single estimate of the variance from the combined data because if the means are not equal then that will inflate the variance estimate.
