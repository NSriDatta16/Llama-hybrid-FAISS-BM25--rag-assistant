If you like to use a void signature, use a http:inbound-channel-adapter instead of http:inbound-gateway. In general, all gateways are two-way and all channel adapters are one way, so a gateway will wait for or generate a response, a channel-adapter will not. A service-activator can perform both roles, depending on the return type of the method it is wrapped around. This also turned out to be the cause of your problem. By the way: you can also have your method accept the payload of the message, which will make it easier to test and reuse. public StorageResult store(Storable s, Map headers);
