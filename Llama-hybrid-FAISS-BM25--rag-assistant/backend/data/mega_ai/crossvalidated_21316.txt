I think one should distinguish between terms confusing the public and terms confusing statisticians. The above suggestions are mostly terms well understood by statisticians and (possibly) misunderstood by the public. I wish to add to the list some terms misunderstood by statisticians: Bayesian: Originally referred to what is now known as subjective Bayes (a.k.a. epistemic, De Finetti). Today the term will be used anytime Bayes' rule shows up, rarely in the context of subjective beliefs, which is considered decision theory. Empirical Bayes: Originally referring to a frequentist setup with a non parametric prior. Today, will typically mean the parameters of the parametric (objective) prior are estimated and not known a priori. I.e., what was once known as type-II maximum likelihood. Non parametric: Sometimes refers to "model free". Sometimes to "distribution free". Has become practically uninformative in the days "parametric" models might include millions of parameters. Type III error: sometimes referring to a sign error. Sometime referring to a mis-specification of the model.
