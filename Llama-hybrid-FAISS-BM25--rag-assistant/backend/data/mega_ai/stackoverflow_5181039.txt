How to make a 50% transparent window?

I'm trying to do a semi-transparent window. There's my attempt: Although the text on the window is transparent, the window itself is not. I've read that it works only for panels, not windows, so I tried it with both and but none of then become transparent. I've tried the approaches used here , here , and here . But nothing works. Any idea? I just realized that while dragging a tab in Firefox 3.6.10, it shows a transparent window. I just need to know how it's done now.
