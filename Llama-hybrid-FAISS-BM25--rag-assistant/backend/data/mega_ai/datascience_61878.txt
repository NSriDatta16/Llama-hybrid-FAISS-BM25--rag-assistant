How prevalent is `C/C++` in machine learning development?

I am currently a data scientist mostly doing NLP, and I do most of my work in Python . Since I didn't get a CS degree in undergrad, I've been limited to very high level languages; Java , Python , and R . I somehow even took Data Structures and Algorithms avoiding C or C++ . I'm intending to go to graduate school to study more Natural Language Processing, and I'm wondering how much C/C++ I need to know. Deep-learning frameworks like PyTorch or Tensorflow are written in C++ , and CUDA is only available in C . I'm not going to be writing Cython libraries, but I would like to do research and build new models (i.e. like "inventing" CNN's, seq2seq models, transformers). I don't know how much C/C++ is used, and I'm unsure if it's worth learning the language-specific complexities that may be channeled into learning something else; hopefully somebody can let me know how prevalent the use of C/C++ is?
