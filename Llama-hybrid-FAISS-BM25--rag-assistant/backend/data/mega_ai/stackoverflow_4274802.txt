ASIFormDataRequest doesn't send post values

I try to send some values using ASIFormDataRequest. The problem is that even though the php script is executed no post data is received. Here is what I do: ASIFormDataRequest *request = [ASIFormDataRequest requestWithURL:url]; [request setPostValue:@"Ben" forKey:@"first_name"]; [request setPostValue:@"Copsey" forKey:@"last_name"]; [request startSynchronous]; In order to check what the server receives I have the following php test script: $handle = fopen("output.txt", "w"); fwrite($handle, count($_POST)."\n"); fwrite($handle, count($_GET)."\n"); fwrite($handle, count($_FILES)."\n"); foreach ($_POST as $key => $value) { fwrite($handle, "POST $key=$value\n"); } foreach ($_GET as $key => $value) { fwrite($handle, "GET $key=$value\n"); } fclose($handle); The same script works with the following html fragment: What is your name? Because the html fragment works with the php script I suspect the php and server are not the problem. But I don't have the slightest idea why ASIFormDataRequest doesn't work when called from my iPhone. Could somebody please help me? Regards, Sascha
