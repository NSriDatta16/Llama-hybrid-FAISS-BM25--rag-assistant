According to my findings, it should not make a huge difference. This is quoted from Time Series Analysis Forecasting and Control FOURTH EDITION (By George E. P. Box et. al, 2008) page 433: "Estimation of the parameters d, φ, θ in a fractionally integrated ARIMA (p, d, q) process can be performed by maximum likelihood (ML) (e.g., Sowell [268]). However, direct evaluation of the exact likelihood function is rather slow due partly to the complicated nature of the autocovariance function of the process. Therefore, for numerical convenience, approximate ML estimation methods have been considered by Beran [39, 40] and others. Another convenient approach is to obtain an estimate of the parameter d initially by certain methods (e.g., using a frequency domain nonparametric approach; see Geweke and Porter-Hudak [125]), and then estimate parameters φ, θ by relatively standard ML methods for the given estimate of d."
