Use the one which makes most sense in your application but do not mix different styles. If you have a question like: "Do you want to delete this item?" => Yes/No. "Would you like to save item before closing?" => Yes/No/Cancel "All changes will be lost when closing this window." => OK/Cancel As you see you really need to pay attention to the question/statement to display meaningful choices. But do not use different choices for the same question like: Clicking the X: "Do you want to Exit?" => Yes/No Selecting Exit in the menu: "Do you want to Exit?" => OK/Cancel
