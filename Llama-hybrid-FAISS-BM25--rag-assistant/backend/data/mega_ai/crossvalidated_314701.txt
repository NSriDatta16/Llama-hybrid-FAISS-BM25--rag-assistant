Why to use Neural Networks: They are useful for implementing complex non-linear functions in regression, classification and other methods. Due to technological advances in the past years and decades computers can store and manager larger and larger datasets and compute much more rapidly. Therefore you can use more complex models like Neural Networks. Tutorials: As tutorials I recommend Week 4 and 5 of Andrew Ngs Machine Learning course and this coursera course by Geoffrey Hinton who is an expert for Neural Networks. You can also start learning by coding with deep learning frameworks. As far as I know Tensorflow is the leading now in industry, but also other deep learning frameworks like Theano offer an opportunity to implement state of the art research.
