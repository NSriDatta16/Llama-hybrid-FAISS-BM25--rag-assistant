Yes. Keep in mind, machine learning algorithms are generalized to be data driven and rely heavily on sample data, and often do not incorporate domain knowledge. Many feature selection techniques are great, but you still need to use your head (domain knowledge). A common technique is to use Boruta All-Relevant feature selection to identify all of the important coavariates, then you could apply Recursive Feature Elimination to find a minimal-optimal covariate set. You could go one step further and build your own set using domain knowledge.
