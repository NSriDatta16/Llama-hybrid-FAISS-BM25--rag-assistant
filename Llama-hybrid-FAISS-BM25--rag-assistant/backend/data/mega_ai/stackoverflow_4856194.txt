To answer these questions, you must pay attention to the definition of big-O notation. So you must ask: is there any constant C such that 2^(n+1) (provided that n is big enough)? And the same goes for the other example: is there any constant C such that 2^(2n) for all n that is big enough? Work on those inequalities and you'll be on your way to the solution.
