@GateKiller when i speak of scaling i was talking about the cost of buying more servers and not clients. most workstations in an organization barely use 50% of their computing power right through the day. If i was to use a click once deployed application i would be using the grunt of existing workstations therefore not having any further cost on the organiztion.
