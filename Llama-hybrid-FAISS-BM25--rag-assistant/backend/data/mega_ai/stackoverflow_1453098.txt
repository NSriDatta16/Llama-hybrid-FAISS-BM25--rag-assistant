matlab: correct approach to add geometrical objects to image

please help with Matlab beginner challenge i need to create an image with few geometrical objects (circles, ellipses) and then to apply some projective transforms my problem is that i cant understand how to actually "draw" on image image is AFAIU generally defined as [X;Y;3] matrix, functions as SCIRCLE1 can compute/return collection of points representing circle, but the problem is that points are not discrete , coordinates are real numbers and not pixels how can i recompute the scircle output to be valid in image coordinates system ? i.e. how can i "pixelize" it? thanks for your attention, i really missing some basic concept and will appreciate your help John
