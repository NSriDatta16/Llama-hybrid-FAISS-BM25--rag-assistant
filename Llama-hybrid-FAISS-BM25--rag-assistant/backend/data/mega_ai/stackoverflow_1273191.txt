You can easily do this in O(1) space, but not in O(1) time ;-) Even though re-arranging a whole tree recursively until it is sorted again seems possible, it is probably not very fast - it may be O(n) at best, probably worse in practice. So you might get a better result by adding all nodes to an array once you are done with the tree and just sorting this array using quicksort on frequency (which will be O(log n) on average). At least that's what I would do. Even tough it takes extra space it sounds more promising to me than re-arranging the tree in place.
