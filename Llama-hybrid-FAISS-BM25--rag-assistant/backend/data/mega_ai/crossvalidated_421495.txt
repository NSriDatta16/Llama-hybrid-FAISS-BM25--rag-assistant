Best approach for dealing with continuous predictors with missing data in random forests

I was thinking about a problem I'm facing: I have wage data that I want to add to my model, but it's incomplete (data for about 70% of my observations). So, I was thinking about two approaches: Turn it into a categorical variable, based on intervals, and add a "No information" category. Keep it as a continuous variable, fill missings with -100 and add a dummy variable that takes value "1" if there's no information. Ideally I would like to implement the latter, so I lose less information. My intuition tells me RF might be able to infer between the negative values and the dummy that those observations are different, but I'm not quite sure. This has arisen several times while developing models, so I'd really appreciate any answers. Thanks
