Complete machine learning library for Java/Scala

Python is plenty of ML libraries (like the great scikit-learn). Is there any good for java/scala, containing many algos (regression, classification, clustering, cross-validation, feature processing), stable & maintained and able to deal with massive dataset? I've just found Mahout, Breeze/Nak, and Weka, but they're not looking as great as Python ones. Additionally, if there's no equivalent, how can I efficiently connect java code with Python?
