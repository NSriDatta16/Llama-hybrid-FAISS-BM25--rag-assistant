input_text_1.onblur = input_text_2.select();

In firefox, I made a web page, there are two input text elements: input_text_1 and input_text_2 . They behave like password verification: If the content of them is different, i.e. when onblur event of input_text_2 is activated, the onblur's handler will alert something and then select all text of input_text_1 . Actually, this is not easy to be implemented, as I think the events chain is not assured: Maybe, input_text_1 got text selected and then lost focus by some clicking. So, I just hack in the onblur's handler of input_text_1 as follows: setTimeout("document.getElementById('input_text_1').select()", 100); Is there a more elegant solution?
