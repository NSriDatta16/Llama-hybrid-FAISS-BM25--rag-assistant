Unless there is a very compelling reason, my opinion is that using clever tricks like that typically just make for more confusing code with little added value. The compiler writers are a smart bunch of developers and know a lot more of those tricks than the average programmer does. For example, dividing an integer by a power of 2 is faster with the shift operator than a division, but it probably isn't necessary since the compiler will do that for you. You can see this by looking at the assembly that both the Microsoft C/C++ compiler and gcc perform these optimizations.
