One option is cascading - putting machine learning models in a row where the output of one model becomes the input of another model. The first model is typically high recall, the second model is high precision. The first model reduces the size search by selecting any highly likely candidates, the second model makes sure all labeled items are labeled as best as possible. This hierarchical modeling is common in search engineering where models have to be fast and correct.
