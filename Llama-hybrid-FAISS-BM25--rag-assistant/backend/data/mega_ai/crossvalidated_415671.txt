What statistical model should I use?

I am trying to create a statistical model for my research. I am dealing with a surgery that has the chance of causing damage to the patient. I have found 5 signs, which I believe are indicators that the surgery will fail. Both the signs and the result of the surgery are binary. I am trying to create a model that will tell me the probability of surgery failing given that 1-5 of the signs are present. I was thinking of using multinomial logistic regression to create my model. Is there better distribution to use to create my model? Any other thoughts? Thank you for your help!
