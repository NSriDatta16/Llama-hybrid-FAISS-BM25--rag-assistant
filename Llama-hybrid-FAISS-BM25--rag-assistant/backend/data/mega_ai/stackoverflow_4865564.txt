Two ideas. 1. PHPPlaneta Check out the source code of PHPlaneta by Robert Basic: https://github.com/robertbasic/phpplaneta He uses the standard FlashMessenger action helper: $this->_helper->flashMessenger()->addMessage(array('fm-bad' => 'Error occurred') Then defines a view helper called FlashMessenger so that he can access the messages. In his layout or view script, he simply calls: flashMessenger(); ?> The view helper uses the key (ex: 'fm-bad' ) to set up CSS styling for the output message. 2. PriorityMessenger Check out the Priority Messenger view helper from Sean P. O. MacCath-Moran: http://emanaton.com/code/php/zendprioritymessenger The thing I like about this is that this whole business of saving messages for display on the next page load strikes me as something that should be completely within the view. So in your action, before your redirect, you populate the view helper with your messages and your priorities. Then, in your layout or view script, you output those messages with their priorities via the same view helper.
