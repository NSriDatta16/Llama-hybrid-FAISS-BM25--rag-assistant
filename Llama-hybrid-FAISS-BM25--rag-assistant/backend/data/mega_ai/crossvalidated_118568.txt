Random Forest confusion matrix

I've been creating some random forest models using the caret package in R. I don't have a large amount of data to work with so I'm using 10 x 10-fold CV in lieu of an independent test set. When I call the model with rfFit after tuning I can see that the best model has an accuracy of 0.928 for mtry = 2, and the confusion matrix generated from rfFit$finalModel suggests an OOB error of 6.53% - an accuracy of 93.47%. My questions are, why is there a (very minor) difference in the accuracies of rfFit and rfFit$finalModel ? why when I predict class membership of my training samples does the resulting confusion matrix give an accuracy of 100% and a kappa of 1? My code and output are below. Folds NIR] :
