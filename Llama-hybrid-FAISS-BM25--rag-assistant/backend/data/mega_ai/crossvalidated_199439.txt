It simply means that there is pressure to keep the sample size as small as possible and most likely smaller than could be desired by someone whose sole interest was in maximizing information quality - be if for inference, prediction, or merely for descriptive purposes. Many reasons can be imagined: social convention, monetary costs, ethical concerns (e.g., if subjects might suffer), time constraints, or avoiding precedents. It might simply be the case that the expected result is unwelcome and some party with influence over the research process is seeking to compromise the data. The party under pressure to minimize sample size need not be a researcher, either; it could be an organizational unit, a social group, a company. Indeed, researchers might themselves apply pressure, e.g., pressuring a colleague to keep sample sizes in line with their field's conventions, possibly to avoid setting a costly precedent (costly in terms of money or lost opportunity to publish spurious results).
