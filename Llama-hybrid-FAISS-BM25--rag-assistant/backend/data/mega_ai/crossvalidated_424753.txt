Yes, they definitely can be used. You will still enjoy many of the advantages (e.g. built-in sequentiality, increased gradient flow to early timesteps) even with relatively few timesteps. E.g. with 10 timesteps, a vanilla RNN still has to backpropogate the gradient through (at least) 10 layers. An LSTM will likely train a lot faster. That being said, the advantages of LSTMs will in general become much more apparent as the number of timesteps increases.
