As discussed in the comments, the main problem with inference from GLMs (such as logistic regression) with small sample sizes (at least in some categories) is the asymptotic nature of Wilks' theorem (which underlies p-values based on likelihood ratio tests and confidence intervals based on likelihood profiles). (This asymptotic constraint is much weaker than that used in Wald tests, which rely on the asymptotic normality of the sampling distribution of the parameters rather than the asymptotic $\chi^2$ distribution of differences in deviances.) There is a literature on finite-size corrections under the rubric of Bartlett corrections , but the methods are often model-specific and are not widely implemented. Das et al. 2018 review a series of small-sample corrections; they do not provide software ("SAS code available upon request"). One of the options they explore is Firth correction , which is implemented in several R packages ( logistf , brgml2 ) [I know Firth correction provides bias-corrected point estimates , I'm not sure how well it extends to inference.] Another option is exact logistic regression ; see Zamar et al. 2007 (their elrm package, which implements an MCMC computation, is archived on CRAN but can be installed via remotes::install_version("elrm", "1.2.4") ). They refer to Hirji (2005) for theoretical details.
