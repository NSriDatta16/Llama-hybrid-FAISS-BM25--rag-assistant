Arimax models : Differencing the xreg

I am solving some time series problem. For this, I am using auto.arima function from forecast package in R. I noticed in many threads that auto.arima does the difference for xreg given y (the dependent time series), while auto.arima estimates the parameters. So that makes my life easier. I do not have to worry about the stationarity of y , auto.arima will handele it automatically. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38505159/auto-arima-not-differencing-while-it-should My purpose is to understand how actually the forecast takes place in case of arimax models, so that I can explain the forecast to clients. To explore the forecasting part, I went through the forecast function, and then to stats:::predict.Arima function. In both of these functions, xreg is not differnced. I want to understand why is this? If while building models in auot.arima , we are differencing xreg for parameter estimation, why we are not differencing xreg , while predicting/forecasting. I hope the question makes sense.
