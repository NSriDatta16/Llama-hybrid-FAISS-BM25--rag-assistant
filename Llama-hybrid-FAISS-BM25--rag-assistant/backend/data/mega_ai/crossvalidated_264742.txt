You can use logistic regression for this. There may be other better models (e.g., mixed models). The most straightforward setup in SPSS is: Each row in the data file should be a separate observation. The first variable should contain 0 or 1, where a 1 indicates a death. The second variable should contain the copper level. The third variable should contain the EDTA level. Then, you fit a logistic regression, playing around with whether or not to treat the predictors as categorical and whether or not to interact them.
