Make sure that while importing of the Catalog Products, the required attributes of the products are provided with correct values in the import file. If this is not done properly, then Data re-index may not function correctly. Also before re-indexing, it is always advisable & wise to clear the cache from the " Cache Management " & from the " cache " folder of your Magento installation directory. Hope it helps.
