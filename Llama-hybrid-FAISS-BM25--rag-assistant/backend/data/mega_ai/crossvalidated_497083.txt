Compared to the difficulty of getting confidence intervals for quantiles in the frequentist setting, Bayes handles this most elegantly. It is easiest to do by taking a few thousand draws of the bivariate posterior distribution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , computing the quantile, e.g., $\mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1}(q)$ , and analyzing the distribution of these derived quantities. All uncertainties are taken into account.
