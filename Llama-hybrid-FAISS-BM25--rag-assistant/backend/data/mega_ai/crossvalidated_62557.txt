For confidence interval, I think you can just use the logistic regression outputs. For adjust p-values, refer to this wiki link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method To my understanding, you are first test an overall age group, then testing a nested hypothesis. I would recommend you test overall group effects first, then go deeper to test individual groups.
