Savage's text Foundations of Statistics has been cited over 12000 times on Google Scholar.[3] It tells the following. It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel. Doubtless, much of the disagreement is merely terminological and would disappear under sufficiently sharp analysis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_statistics So the point that Probability Theory is a Foundation of Statistics is hardly disputed. Everything else is fair game. But in trying to be more helpful, practical with an answer... However, probability theory contains much that is mostly of mathematical interest and not directly relevant to statistics. Moreover, many topics in statistics are independent of probability theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_and_statistics The above is not exhaustive or authorative by any means, but I believe it's useful. Commonly it has helped me to see things such as... Descrete Mathematics >> Probability Theory >> Statistics With each being heavily used, on average, in the foundations of the next. That is there are large intersections in how we study the next's foundations. PS. There's inductive and deductive Statistics, so that's not where the difference lies.
