input/output with Java Web Start

I'm working on converting a very simple java desktop application to run in java web start and I'm having all kinds of trouble with the input/output files. Most specifically I can't seem to find any information on how to handle i/o in a web start application. I tried placing the input files in the same folder on my web server as the jar and jnlp file, but it doesn't read it. I've got one input file that I want to keep on the web server and read into the application from there. I've got a second file that I want the application to generate on the client machine the first time it's run, and read in from there every time thereafter. If anyone knows what considerations I need to take for i/o in java web start or can point me towards a resource that explains it I would appreciate it.
