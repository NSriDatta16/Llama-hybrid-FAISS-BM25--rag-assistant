Logistic Regression - Two Dependent variables not playing well with each other

My name is Abhi and I trying to teach myself logistic regression by solving some of the problems available on the internet. I am using R and RStudio as the development environment Problem Statement Given the age, sex, class(first,second,third), ticket_id for each passenger can you predict if he survived or died when the titanic sank. Assume passengers in first class are more likely to survive. Assume passengers in certain areas of the boat (those near to part which hit the iceberg) are more likely to perish. I ran logistic regression for both these variables independently. Here are my results for passenger class Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4390 -0.7569 -0.7569 0.9367 1.6673 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.44679 0.20743 6.975 3.06e-12 *** Pclass -0.85011 0.08715 -9.755 Here are my results for Ticket Id Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.2624 -0.8909 -0.7040 1.0947 1.7415 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.19769 0.09974 1.982 0.0475 * Ticket2 -0.91681 0.22155 -4.138 3.5e-05 *** Ticket3 -1.46620 0.16052 -9.134 However when I add both passenger class & ticket id to the formula I dont get the results that I am expecting. It seems that both the features are cancelling each other out Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4431 -0.8649 -0.6772 0.9332 1.7806 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.1713 0.2171 5.396 6.80e-08 *** Pclass -0.5654 0.1110 -5.094 3.50e-07 *** Ticket2 -0.4361 0.2421 -1.801 0.0716 . Ticket3 -0.8311 0.2033 -4.089 4.33e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1186.7 on 890 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1067.8 on 887 degrees of freedom AIC: 1075.8 I ran the vif test on both these features & they do not seem to be collinear. What am I missing here? If both these features give great results separately why dont they give good results when used together. Any help would be much appreciated
