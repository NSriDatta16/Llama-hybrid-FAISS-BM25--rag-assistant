Which Machine Learning Algorithm should be used to predict Waveforms from an already existing collection of waveforms ?

I am new to machine learning and I was wondering what algorithm to use to predict waveforms from an already existing waveform data samples. I have the x coordinates and Y coordinates or (waveforms) for a few set of features for the different set of values. I want to be able to predict further waveforms for more values using this as training data. Which type of Machine Learning Algorithm should be used in such cases ?
