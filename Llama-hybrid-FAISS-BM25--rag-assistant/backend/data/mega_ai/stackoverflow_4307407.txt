Magento - Checking if a module is installed?

I have a small piece of code in a template file that I ONLY want to run if a certain module is installed. I found the below code, which you can use to find if a module is active, but I want to know if a module is installed. $modules = Mage::getConfig()->getNode('modules')->children(); $modulesArray = (array)$modules; if($modulesArray['Mage_Paypal']->is('active')) { echo "Paypal module is active."; } else { echo "Paypal module is not active."; } I'm thinking I could maybe get a list of names of all the modules that are installed, and then use if (stristr($modulelist, 'Name_Extension')) to show my code only if the referenced extension is installed. Anyone any ideas how to do that? Or any better solutions?
