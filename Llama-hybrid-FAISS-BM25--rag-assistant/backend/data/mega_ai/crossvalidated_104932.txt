Bayesian alternative or complement to the Student t-test

I was just recently using the Student t-Test to check whether values from two samples could have an identical mean or not. I was wondering whether there is a complementary technique in bayesian statistics that does a similar thing. Especially I am wondering about the $P$ values that I obtain as a result ( http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html ). With a sample size of 2 in my two samples, I figure that the resulting p value would probably fluctuate quite a bit if I added some more measurements or take some away.
