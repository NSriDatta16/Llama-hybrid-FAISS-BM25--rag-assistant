It is difficult to fit single model for very long time series. Even if you are able to fit a model, it will perform poorly while doing multi step forecasting. You can make use of sliding window method to fit the model to the most recent k observations and do single step forecasting. Then repeat the procedure. Unlike Neural networks, regular time series forecasting method (like ARIMA) do not work well for studying long term temporal variations. See this for some more details.
