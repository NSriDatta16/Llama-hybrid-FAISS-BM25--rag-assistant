Quarterly revenue data often exhibits rather strong yearly seasonality, because customers tend to sign contracts near the end of a quarter to spend remaining budget in their business year (and salespeople know that, and customers know that their salesperson knows that, and all kind of fun games ensue). It looks like your model has picked up on that: your most important predictors to predict 2022Q4 revenue are Avg_revenue_2021_Q4 (so just the average revenue from exactly one year before - using this alone would be a "seasonal naive forecast", which is an extremely common simple benchmark for seasonal forecasting) AVG_REVENUE_2022_Q2_trans_rate_2022_Q1 (I don't know what that one is) Total_revenue_2022Q3 (just total revenue from the last observed quarter, which would again be an extremely common benchmark forecast, the "naive forecast") To forecast the next quarter 2023Q1, I would now just take the model you have and feed in predictors shifted by one quarter: Avg_revenue_2022_Q1 in place of Avg_revenue_2021_Q4 (so again, just the average revenue from exactly one year before, but of course now that is 2022Q1, since we are forecasting for 2023Q1) AVG_REVENUE_2022_Q3_trans_rate_2022_Q2 in place of AVG_REVENUE_2022_Q2_trans_rate_2022_Q1 (shifting the predictor by one quarter, whatever that is) Total_revenue_2022Q4 in place of Total_revenue_2022Q3 (again just total revenue from the last observed quarter before the one we want to forecast for) Now, if you want to forecast out more than one quarter, e.g., for 2023Q2, you would need to feed in Total_revenue_2023Q1 in place of that last predictor. And you don't know that yet today. The most common approach would be to feed in the forecasted value which you obtained in the previous step. (Alternatively, you could build a separate model which forecasts two quarters ahead, using 2022Q4 as the training target, and only features up to 2022Q2 as training predictors.)
