There has been a problem reading physical fonts reported for all current releases of Java SE 6 when running on certain configurations of thin clients. I've not tried, but I guess you can copy the font files into the fonts directory of the JRE (assuming these are checked before the system/Windows directory). You might be able to put reda permission for the TTF file into the lib/security/java.policy file (can't remember how that is organised). Hopefully there will be a fix in a 6 update coming soon (I don't know, and can't promise anything). Apparent bug CR 6785424 and changeset . (Include all appropriate disclaimer here...)
