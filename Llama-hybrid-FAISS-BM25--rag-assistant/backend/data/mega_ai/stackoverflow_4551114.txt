Robots.txt will block it just fine. It's just important to remember BEFORE you publish a site - Google is pretty fast. Some search engines ignore robots.txt. Best thing to do is not have subdomains that don't really fit you situation. I recommend reading the true purpose of subdomains. You should not be serving the same site on different domains. You should use a 301 direct or have different contents on different (sub)domains... Unless stats.abc.com contains different material, it shouldn't be a subdomain. What exactly do you need so many subdomains for? You could detect the user-agent, and if it's a bot, return a 404 too
