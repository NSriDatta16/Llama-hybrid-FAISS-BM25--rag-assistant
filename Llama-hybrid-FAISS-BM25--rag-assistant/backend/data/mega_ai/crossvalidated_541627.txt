Difference between Multilevel I^2 and ICC?

I have been using the excellent metafor package for a work-related project and for some reason there's a concept that I can't wrap my head around. In his guide ( https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/analyses:konstantopoulos2011?s[]=multilevel ) Wolfgang outlines how to calculate the ICC for three-level meta-analytic models based on the following formula: This can be interpreted as the correlation in "true" effects within a cluster. In another guide Wolfgang describes how you can calculate a multilevel version of I^2 and also parse this into it's components (between and within) through the following. 100 * model$sigma2 / (sum(model$sigma2) + (model$k-model$p)/sum(diag(P))) This produces two values (one for within cluster, and a second value for between cluster), and represents the proportion of variance explained due to heterogeneity within each level, respectively. However, people often refer to ICC's as a measure of the variance explained/accounted for (for example by multiplying by 100 to get the value in percentage units), which confuses me a little when it comes to differences in the interpretation. My questions are: Is it correct to say that the ICC represents the similarity between two observations from the same cluster? What is the difference between the within cluster I^2 value and the ICC? If I^2 value for within cluster represents the proportion of variance explained by heterogeneity, then how is the ICC different when expressed as a %? Is this not also a measure of the proportion of the total variance explained?
