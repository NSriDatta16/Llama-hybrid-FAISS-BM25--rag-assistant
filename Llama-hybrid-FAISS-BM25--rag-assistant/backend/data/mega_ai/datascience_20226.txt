You could calculate the RSI (relative strength index) of your sales, over 1 month, 3 months, a year or however long of a time interval you wanted to measure if the current positive trend is outweighing the negative trend over that amount of time (or vice versa). You could also try ADX (average directional movement index) combined with +- directional indicators to again detect the strength of the trend, and also identify if it is a positive or negative one depending on which directional indicator outweighs the other. I'm sure there are many other traditionally stock oriented statistics you could use too.
