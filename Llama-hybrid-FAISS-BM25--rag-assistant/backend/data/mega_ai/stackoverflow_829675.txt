Like Robert said Regex will help. In command mode start a regex search by typing the "/" character followed by your regex. Ctags 1 may also be of use to you. It can generate a tag file for a project. This tag file allows a user to jump directly from a function call to it's definition even if it's in another file using "CTRL+]".
