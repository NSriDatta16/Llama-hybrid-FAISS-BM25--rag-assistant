How can I calculate and compare averages in a data set with different sample sizes?

I have a data set with about 1 million rows of data. The most important fields are the id, the date_time, the customer and the score. Firstly I want to calculate the mean score for each customer (straightforward) but I want to consider the count of the score against each customer. Eg Customer A has an average score of 0.3 based off 10000 records, but customer B has an average of 0.8 based off 100 records. Sure the mean of the customer B is higher, but it is based off a lower sample size. How can I compare averages between customers accurately? Is it the mean that I need to be considering? Secondly, I have calculated the standard deviation of the whole data set to be 0.058, the mean is 0.00457. Is this a high st deviation or a low st deviation. Do we compare the st deviation to the mean, in which case is this a high st deviation (data points far from mean)?
