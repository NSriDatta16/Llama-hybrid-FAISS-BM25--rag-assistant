Weighting hospital visit (independent variable)

I am interested in profiling patients that has high number of hospital visits in a year. However, I noticed that not all hospital visits are equal. That is, an inpatient visit is more expensive than an outpatient visit. In addition, an inpatient visits that has longer hospitalization days are also more expensive. I would like produce a single weighted variable of hospital visit based on average cost. Is there any way for me to do this?
