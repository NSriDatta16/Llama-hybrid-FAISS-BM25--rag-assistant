It's a trick question. The ratio stays the same (1:1). The right answer is that it does not affect birth ratio, but it does affect the number of children per family with a limiting factor of an average of 2 births per family. This is the kind of question you might find on a logic test. The answer is not about birth ratio. That's a distraction. This is not a probability question, but a cognitive reasoning question. Even if you answered 1:1 ratio, you still failed the test.
