Can we predict features from labels in machine learning

Given a dataset with 100 observations and 3 features plus one label(regression). we train the model with 100 * 4(3 features + 1 label) data. Now can we predict the features when the label is given as input. For eg: f1 f2 f3 Label 2 2 3 12.5 3 6 5 3.8 6 5 4 9.2 .......... .......... .......... .......... now the question is to predict f1, f2 and f3 when label is given ( if label=6.7 then predict f1,f2,f3). It would be of great help if any suggestion or resources is provided.
