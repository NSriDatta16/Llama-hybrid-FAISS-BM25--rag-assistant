Can PCA be reversed to predict original variables based off a random point in PCA space?

So, I recently read this answer: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/34724/reversing-pca-back-to-the-original-variables I wanted to make sure that I'm understanding this correctly. So, normally I fit PCA to a dataset, like the digits dataset. Then, I plot the resulting projections (that were created for my original dataset) onto a 2D or xy plot. My understanding was: I can select a random point x,y in the plot (that does NOT exist in the projections data I plotted, or is not a plotted point), and then reverse this x,y point with PCA to "PREDICT" the original data (e.g. predict what digit that point represents). Is my understanding of this correct? If so, doesn't this basically make PCA a prediction algorithm? Also, does this understanding also apply to the following UMAP article: https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inverse_transform.html ?
