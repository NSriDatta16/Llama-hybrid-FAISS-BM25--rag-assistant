You could use a quantile regression model. Just as regressions minimize the squared-error loss function to predict a single point estimate, quantile regressions minimize the quantile loss in predicting a certain quantile. The most popular quantile is the median, or the 50th percentile, and in this case the quantile loss is simply the sum of absolute errors. Other quantiles could give endpoints of a prediction interval; for example a middle-80-percent range is defined by the 10th and 90th percentiles. The quantile loss differs depending on the evaluated quantile, such that more negative errors are penalized more for higher quantiles and more positive errors are penalized more for lower quantiles.
