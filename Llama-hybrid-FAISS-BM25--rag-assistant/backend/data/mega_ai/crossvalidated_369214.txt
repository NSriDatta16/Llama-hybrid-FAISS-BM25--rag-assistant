Question about sufficiency

I learned in my (classical) statistics class that (if we have densities) $T(X)$ is sufficient iff $$f(x)= g(T(x))h(x)$$ I am reading " the Bayesian Choice " and there the factorization-lemma is quoted as $T(X)$ being sufficient if $$f(x|\theta)=g(T(x)|\theta)\cdot h(x|T(x))$$ I am slightly confused, why isn`t it $$f(x|\theta)=g(T(x)|\theta)\cdot h(x)$$
