Perhaps you can draw parallel between this format and XML. i.e. BeginSection " " EndSection " " Think of it as XML file with many root elements. What's inside BeginSection and EndSection will be your inner xml node with for example NestedKeyA = as node name and "One" as the value. .: seems to bee a comment, so you can skip it.
