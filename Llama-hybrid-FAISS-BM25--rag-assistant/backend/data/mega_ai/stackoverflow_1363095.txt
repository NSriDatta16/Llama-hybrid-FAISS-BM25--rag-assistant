Is it REALLY an activex control?

I have a fairly simple block of code. Sub Run(Name) on error resume next Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") if Err.Number = 429 then alert("Invalid Security Level.") exit sub end if objShell.Run Name if Err.Number <> 0 then Alert("Please verify your Operating System Choice") end if Set objShell = Nothing End Sub I'm using this with links on the website to allow the user to defrag their hard drive via: Defrag Windows Vista Defrag Windows Server 2003 SE or Windows XP As you can probably guess.. using: Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") Is causing a bit of a problem, and it is throwing an error that the object cannot be created. I can go into IE security and change the security setting for, "Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting" to "Prompt", and it will actually prompt me and run when I click yes. My question at this point is; Since this is not a seperate block of code coming from an asp server (htm page w/ no code behind). Do I really need to spend $20 to get it signed, and how would I do that in the first place on a vbscript in an htm page? Also.. the site that this will be implemented into DOES have an SSL cert. Is it possible to integrate into the existing cert in some way shape or form? All I want to do is have links that are like... "If you want to defrag your computer, click here" "If you want to run a disk scan, click here" And telling all our customers to go in and change their security settings is not an option.
