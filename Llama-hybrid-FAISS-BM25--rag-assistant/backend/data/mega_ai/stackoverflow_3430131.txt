svn storage compression

I've just moved to subversion. I've read somewhere svn transfers and stores data in a compressed form. I know compressed transfers mean 'http:' compression with apache. Does storage compression mean lazy copies and keeping only deltas for revisions, or is there a real compression like gzip used by subversion live for the storage? Currently in the repo db, I can see submitted text files in the clear text form. I use Windows for the server. Thanks!
