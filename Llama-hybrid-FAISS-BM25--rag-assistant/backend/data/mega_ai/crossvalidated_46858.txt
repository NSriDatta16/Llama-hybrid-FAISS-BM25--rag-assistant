(Technically, the P-value is the probability of observing data at least as extreme as that actually observed, given the null hypothesis.) Q1. A decision to reject the null hypothesis on the basis of a small P-value typically depends on 'Fisher's disjunction': Either a rare event has happened or the null hypothesis is false. In effect, it is rarity of the event is what the P-value tells you rather than the probability that the null is false. The probability that the null is false can be obtained from the experimental data only by way of Bayes' theorem, which requires specification of the 'prior' probability of the null hypothesis (presumably what Gill is referring to as "marginal distributions"). Q2. This part of your question is much harder than it might seem. There is a great deal of confusion regarding P-values and error rates which is, presumably, what Gill is referring to with "but is typically treated as such." The combination of Fisherian P-values with Neyman-Pearsonian error rates has been called an incoherent mishmash, and it is unfortunately very widespread. No short answer is going to be completely adequate here, but I can point you to a couple of good papers (yes, one is mine). Both will help you make sense of the Gill paper.
