Neural Network, dependence among outputs?

Is there a way to train a neural network in the following manner: You have $n$ observations in the training set. The neural net will start with random weights, and produce $n$ outputs. I want to then apply a function, $f$, on these $n$ outputs. $f$ will output a single real valued number $\alpha$. The goal of the neural net is to then maximize $\alpha$. That is, I don't care what the neural net outputs for any single observation. I want it to maximize some property of the outputs as a whole (e.g. I want to maximize the variance of the outputs). Are there neural networks like this, or other techniques for what I am looking for? Any insight is appreciated!
