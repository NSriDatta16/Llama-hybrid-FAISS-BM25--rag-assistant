How to obtain a signal/noise measurement from a video without a background control

I have a video with a periodic process that can be seen as a change in brightness of the frame. I am measuring the process by calculating the average brightness value of the frame and plotting it over time. My video looks like a star-field with stars pulsing in sync. I would like to quantify my signal/noise but I don't have a background video with this process not happening. What kind of approach would be appropriate in this situation?
