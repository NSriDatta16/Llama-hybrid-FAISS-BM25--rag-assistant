Magento - determine which xml layout file a page is using?

I tried reading the documentation but I still don’t really understand how magento's xml layout files work. In the directory app/design/frontend/default/modern/layout , i see a lot of xml files. How do I determine which xml file any given page on the website is using? For example, if I were on the home page at http://mysite.com , which layout xml file am I using? What if I’m on http://mysite.com/hello-world , which xml file then?
