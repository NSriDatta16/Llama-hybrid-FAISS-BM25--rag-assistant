For printing I don't set any width and remove any obstacles which keep your print layout from having a dynamic width. Meaning if you make your browser window smaller and smaller, no content is cut/hidden but the document just gets longer. Like this, you can be sure that the rest will be handled by the printer/pdf-creator. What about elements with a fixed width such as images or tables? Images Options I can think of: scale images down in your print CSS to a width which you can assume will fit in any case, use pt not px (but print will need more points/unit anyways, so this should hardly be a problem) exclude from being printed Tables remove the fixed width use landscape if you really have tables with loads of information don't use tables for layout purposes exclude from being printed extract content, print it as paragraphs http://www.intensivstation.ch/en/css/print/ or any other google result for combinations of: CSS, print, media, layout
