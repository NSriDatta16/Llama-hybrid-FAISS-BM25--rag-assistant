I guess these images aren't static, or you'd have stopped at this line? First thing to ease the load from the Tomcat is to use the Web server for serving static content like images, etc.. Even if not, you've got larger issues than a factor of 8: the purpose of his formula is to determine how many concurrent connections you can handle without the AART (average application response time) exceeding 0.5 seconds . Your application takes 5 seconds to serve a single request. The formula as you're applying it is telling you 9 women can produce a baby in one month. If you agree that 0.5 seconds is the maximum acceptable AART, then you first have to be able to serve a single request in Otherwise, you need to replace his value for maximum AART in ms (500) with yours (which must be greater than or equal to your actual AART). Finally, as to the question of whether his CPU term should account for cores: it's going to vary depending on CPU & workload. If you're serving large images, you're probably IO-bound, not CPU-bound. You need to test. Max out Tomcat's thread pools & add more load until you find the point where your AART degrades. That's your actual value for the second half of his equation. But at that point you can keep testing and see the actual value for "Concurrent Users" by determining when the AART exceeds your maximum.
