Tackling a 'regression' problem from a bayesian standpoint?

Let's say I have two variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the temperatures in room A and room B , respectively. Then I have $y_1$ and $y_2$ that represent a participant's rating of how comfortable room A and room B are. Let's say I want to find the optimal comfort level, such that the $\operatorname{mean}(x_1) I could run two linear regressions and get a set of equations which I could optimize based on that constraint. Or I could do a single regression, with all variables involved, and then predict over a range of temperatures, finding a set of 'optimums' that meet the constraint. However, I've gained some interest in Bayesian optimization, and was curious if this would lend itself well to a problem like this. I'm having trouble setting up the optimization problem (thinking primarily in terms of using a package like PyMC3 to solve it). How does one approach a problem like this from a Bayesian perspective?
