Blackberry Storm Emulator - TouchGesture events not firing, how to get a Swipe to work?

Been playing with the Storm Emulator and the 4.7 JDE, for the life of me I can't figure out how to fire gesture events in the emulator. Below is the touch event code for the RIM sample app EmbeddedMapDemo. It seems straightforward enough, but touchGesture.getEvent() == TouchGesture.SWIPE never seems to register to true. How can I register swipes in the Emulator? With my mouse I try doing left-click and drag but that does not seem to work. /** * @see Field#touchEvent(TouchEvent) */ protected boolean touchEvent(TouchEvent message) { boolean isConsumed = false; if(_mapField.isClicked()) { TouchGesture touchGesture = message.getGesture(); if (touchGesture != null) { // If the user has performed a swipe gesture we will // move the map accordingly. if (touchGesture.getEvent() == TouchGesture.SWIPE) { // Retrieve the swipe magnitude so we know how // far to move the map. int magnitude = touchGesture.getSwipeMagnitude(); // Move the map in the direction of the swipe. switch(touchGesture.getSwipeDirection()) { case TouchGesture.SWIPE_NORTH: _mapField.move(0, - magnitude); break; case TouchGesture.SWIPE_SOUTH: _mapField.move(0, magnitude); break; case TouchGesture.SWIPE_EAST: _mapField.move(- magnitude, 0); break; case TouchGesture.SWIPE_WEST: _mapField.move(magnitude, 0); break; } // We've consumed the touch event. isConsumed = true; } } } return isConsumed; }
