The only metric you can use to assess the added value of each feature, is the accuracy of your predictive classifier . You can simply include all three feature variables and build your classifier from those. Then you can remove each of the $3$ features and build the three possible classifiers from each of the remaining $2$ features (for example, 'appearances' and 'goals', 'appearances' and 'goals_per_game', and so forth). This analysis gives you the added value of each of the three features to your predictive accuracy. Note the apparent dependency between 'goals' and 'goals_per_game'. This strategy to feature selection is called sequential backward search . If you have an excess of $10$ features, more advanced algorithms like floating search and MCMC are likely to yield better performing subsets of features. In your case with solely $3$ feature variables sequential backward search should work fine.
