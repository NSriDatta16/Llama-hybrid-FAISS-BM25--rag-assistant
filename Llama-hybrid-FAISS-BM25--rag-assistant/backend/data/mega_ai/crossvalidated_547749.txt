How to decide model performance on validation data

I have built several neural networks to decide what choice of a hyperparameter is best. I want to use the validation data (not test data) to do this. To determine the performance of each model should one calculate the RMSE for the trained networks on validation data or should one just consider the final value of the loss function on the validation set during training?
