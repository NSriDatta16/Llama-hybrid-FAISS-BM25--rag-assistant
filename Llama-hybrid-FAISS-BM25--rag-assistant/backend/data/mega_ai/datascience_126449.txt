Segmenting time series of constant variance but varying mean

I have a time series of latitude values taken from a GPS receiver. The receiver is moved at intervals to different nearby locations. The data is noisy. Now assume the sample taken at the ith location is distributed normally N[m[i],s], that is the mean varies but the standard deviation is constant. How can I segment the series so each segment has a near constant standard deviation s? That is I need to recover the sample data at each location. The plot below is an example of the time series If it is of any help I have the corresponding longitude values available under the same assumption that the variance is constant but the mean varies. The number of samples at each location is variable, but will vary between the low hundreds and the low thousands. The number of locations is not known.
