How To Export to JNLP in Eclipse

I watched today as someone painlessly exported a NetBeans java project to a JNLP file and HTML file that he could just copy to his web server. Making JNLP files by hand is slightly obnoxious, especially given the codebase parameter. I would love if I could do the same in Eclipse, but I can't seem to find such a function or a plugin which does this. The only thing I've found is this article but I can't really parse it, it's a bit dense to me, for instance it mentions: Ensure that the org.eclipse.equinox.launcher plug-in is in the feature or in one of the included feature; But if that's even a grammatical sentence, I don't know how to ensure what it says.
