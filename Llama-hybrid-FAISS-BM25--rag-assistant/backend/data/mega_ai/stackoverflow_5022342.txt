GWT RequestFactory: inheriting interfaces into a RequestContext

I have my OrganizationRequestContext interface, which works great: @Service(OrganizationDAO.class) public interface OrganizationRequestContext extends RequestContext { Request findOrganization(Long id); InstanceRequest persist(); InstanceRequest remove(); } Now I want to take those last two functions and put them in a PersistentRequestContext of my own design so that I can treat all of my RequestContexts the same in my client code: public interface PersistableRequestContext { InstanceRequest persist(); InstanceRequest remove(); } ... @Service(OrganizationDAO.class) public interface OrganizationRequestContext extends RequestContext, PersistentRequestContext { Request findOrganization(Long id); } But this fails validation: the server complains that [ERROR] com.activegrade.shared.data.PersistableRequestContext is not a RequestContext If I make PersistableRequestContext extend RequestContext, then the server complains that it is not linked to any particular DAO service. Is there any way to extend a common interface besides RequestContext in my various RequestContext interfaces?
