What do you mean by "find?" I can tell you $\pi(\theta \mid x)$ is proportional to $$ f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta) \propto \exp\left[-\frac{(\theta - x)^2}{2} - \log(1 + \theta^2) \right], $$ but I don't recognize this density. You can use this fact in a number of techniques to sample from the posterior (e.g. accept-reject, importance sampling with resampling, MCMC, etc.). By the way, your prior is a $\mathcal{C}(0,1)$ prior, which has support $-\infty . Edit: You seem to be interested in accept-reject sampling. Say you're targeting $\pi(\theta \mid x) \propto f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)$ , but you want to simulate from the prior. First, check that $$ \frac{f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)}{\pi(\theta)} \le\sup_{\theta} f(x \mid \theta) = (2\pi)^{-1/2}. $$ So you want to do the following steps over and over again: Sample $\theta^i \sim \pi(\theta)$ Calculate $f(x \mid \theta^i) (2 \pi)^{1/2}$ Draw $U \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1]$ If $U accept the sample, otherwise throw it away and start again at step 1. You can also sample from any other $g(\theta)$ that has support on the reals. You just have to find a $c$ (hopefully as small as possible) such that $\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta) \le c g(\theta)$ . It works because: \begin{align*} &P\left( \theta \le t \bigg\rvert U \le \frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } \right) \\ &= \frac{P\left( \theta \le t , U \le \frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } \right)}{P\left(U \le \frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } \right)} \\ &= \frac{\int_{-\infty}^t \int_0^{ \frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } }g(\theta)1 \text{d}u \text{d}\theta }{ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_0^{ \frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } }g(\theta)1 \text{d}u \text{d}\theta } \\ &= \frac{\int_{-\infty}^t g(\theta)\frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } \text{d}\theta }{ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(\theta) \frac{\pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)}{c g(\theta) } \text{d}\theta } \\ &= \frac{\int_{-\infty}^t \pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta) \text{d}\theta }{ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \pi(\theta) f(x \mid \theta)\text{d}\theta } \\ &= \pi(\theta \le t \mid x). \end{align*} So these accepted draws $\theta^1,\theta^2, \ldots, \theta^n$ have as their distribution the posterior of interest, and we never had to figure out the normalizing constant. We did have to figure out an upper bound, though. In my opinion, that's the downside of this method compared with other methods where that step isn't necessary.
