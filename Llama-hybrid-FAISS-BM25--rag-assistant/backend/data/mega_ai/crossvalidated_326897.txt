Is random splitting of a time series suitable for neural networks training when temporal aspects are important?

Is random splitting of a time series, e.g., into 80/10/10, suitable for neural networks (NARX) training when temporal aspects are important? To the best of my knowledge ANNs can generalize that means that after learning data from a sample, ANNs can correctly infer the unseen part of a population. But, on the other hand, "a variation caused by different resamplings is higher than a variation caused by network conditions."
