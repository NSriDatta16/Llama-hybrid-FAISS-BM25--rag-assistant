How do you predict a response category given an ordinal logistic regression model?

I want to predict a health problem. I have 3 outcome categories that are ordered: 'normal', 'mild', and 'severe'. I wish to predict this from two predictor variables, a test result (a continuous, interval covariate) and family history with this problem (yes or no). In my sample, the probabilities are 55% (normal), 35% (mild), and 10% (severe). In this sense, I could always just predict 'normal' and be right 55% of the time, although this would give me no information about individual patients. I fit the following model: \begin{align} \text{the cut point for }\widehat{(y \ge 1)} &= -2.18 \\ \text{the cut point for }\widehat{(y \ge 2)} &= -4.27 \\ \hat\beta_{\rm test} &= 0.60 \\ \hat\beta_{\rm family\ history} &= 1.05 \end{align} Assume there is no interaction and everything is fine with the model. The concordance, c, is 60.5%, which I understand to be the maximum predictive accuracy the model affords. I come across two new patients with the following data: 1. test = 3.26, family = 0; 2. test = 2.85, family = 1. I want to predict their prognosis. Using the formula: $$ \frac{\exp(-X\beta - {\rm cutPoint})}{(1+\exp(-X\beta - {\rm cutPoint}))} $$ (and then taking the differences amongst the cumulative probabilities), I can calculate the probability distribution over the response categories conditional on the model. R code (n.b., due to rounding issues, the output doesn't match perfectly): cut1 Namely: 1. 0 = 55.1%, 1 = 35.8%, 2 = 9.1%; and 2. 0 = 35.6%, 1 = 46.2%, 2 = 18.2%. My question is, how do I go from the probability distribution to a predicted response category? I have tried several possibilities using the sample data, where the outcome is known. If I just pick max(probabilities), accuracy is 57%, a slight improvement over the null, but below the concordance. Moreover, in the sample, this approach never picks 'severe', which is what I really want to know. I tried a Bayesian approach by converting null and model probabilities into odds and then picking the max(odds ratio). This does pick 'severe' occasionally, but yields worse accuracy 49.5%. I also tried a sum of the categories weighted by the probabilities and rounding. This, again, never picks 'severe', and has low accuracy 51.5%. What is the equation that takes the information above and yields optimal accuracy (60.5%)?
