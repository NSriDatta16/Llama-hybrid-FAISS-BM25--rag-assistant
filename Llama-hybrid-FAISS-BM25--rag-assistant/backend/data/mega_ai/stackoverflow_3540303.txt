The linked site doesn't give much to test/work with. Maybe it's the language barrier, but it was not entirely clear to me how I am supposed to interact with the site so that I can try to reproduce the problem. In the future questions, try to add clear steps how to reproduce the problem. At least, I would revise the way of appending query parameters to end of URL. The symptoms make it much look like that you're blindly appending them to the very end of the entire URL without determining/filtering the URL itself. I suggest you to use window.location.search to obtain the current query string and then build on that further. It won't include the hash fragments.
