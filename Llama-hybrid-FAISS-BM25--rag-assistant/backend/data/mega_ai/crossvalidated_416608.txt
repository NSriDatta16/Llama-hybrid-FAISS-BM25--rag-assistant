If you are correctly incorporating day-of-the-week, day-of-the month, month, quarter, lead & contemporaneous & lag holiday effects and step/level shifts and local time trends AND accommodating one-time pulses and possible changes in day-of-the-week effects you probably only need (if any) short term arima structure. If your model requires some 30 lags , I would question the modelling procedure. In effect a 30 day forecast is made by bootstrapping predictions based upon the idea that predictions are a substitute for future values due to an expected error of 0.. This can be approached via SARMAX models or as it also known as a Transfer Function models where attention/remedial structure has been given to possibly both time-varying parameters and time-varying error variance. In this way your secondary questions/concerns are voided. It appears that your approach requires you to pre-fill the future values/expected values of the dependent variable which of course you don't have unless you make 30 runs and then use the 30 expectations as "actuals". This is grossly inefficient and requires programming support and NO routine ability to place confidence limits around expectations which should be part and parcel of any forecasting application.
