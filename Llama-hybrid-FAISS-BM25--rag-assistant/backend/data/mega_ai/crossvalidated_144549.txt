Return value of uniform distributions for MCMC simulations

I am confused about how what value should be returned from a uniform distribution when using MCMC simulations. The proper normal distribution is define as $$ p(\theta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1/(b-a) & \text{if} & a However, in the examples from the Python package I am useing ( emcee ), they instead use the improve definition $$ p(\theta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & \text{if} & a Now for the parameter estimation itself this makes no obvious difference. Unfortunately I am then using the output from the MCMC algorithm to estimate the marginal likelihood (the evidence). To do this I use the Harmonic mean approximation (which I know is deeply flawed, nevertheless it seems to be doing a reasonable job). In this case the choice of prior makes a significant difference. Can anyone explain which of these is really appropriate and why? I originally expected the two to reach the same answer, but there is a noticeable difference and it makes me somewhat uncomfortable. Since I am only in the learning stage, I thought it best to ask the stupid questions first.
