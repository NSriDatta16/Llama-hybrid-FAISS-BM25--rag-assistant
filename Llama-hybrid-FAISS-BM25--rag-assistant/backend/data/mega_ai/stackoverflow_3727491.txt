What I see is that you are replacing it wrong. You are putting the new XML you are creating inside a w:t tag which is a text tag If i'm not mistaken' Skip the Body creation and replace the InnerXml of the Paragraph p with the innerXml of m.Values parent. That is if I'm understanding this correctly.
