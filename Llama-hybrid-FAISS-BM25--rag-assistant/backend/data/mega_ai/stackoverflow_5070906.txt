Why can't I use SoapClient::multiCall on my server?

I am writing some php code for interfacing with a magento server and am trying to group my soap calls. The magento wiki suggests the use of SoapClient::multiCall and I am able to get that to work fine on my home machine. But If I try the exact same code on my server it tells me: SoapFault exception: [Client] Function ("multiCall") is not a valid method for this service The php manual for SoapClient doesn't even list multiCall as a method. My home machine is running php version: PHP 5.3.3 While the server is running version: PHP 5.2.14 I'm at a loss for what's happening here any help would be appreciated. Here is the code I'm running: $client = new SoapClient($wsdl_location); $session = $client->login($user, $pass); $client->multiCall($session, array( array(catalog_category.currentStore), array(catalog_category.currentStore) ) );
