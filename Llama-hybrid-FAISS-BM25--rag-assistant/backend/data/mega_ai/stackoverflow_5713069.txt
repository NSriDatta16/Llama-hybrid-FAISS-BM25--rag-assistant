Magento - Registration problem - User is sent to My Cart after entering billing information

When a user goes to checkout for their items, they are given the option to register. If that option is chosen, they proceed to enter their information. After entering their Billing Information and clicking Continue, they are sent back to the My Cart page and the registration process never completes. I attempted the fix located at the following SO question: Magento is redirecting to cart when continuing from Billing info - but it did not work. Background info - I'm using a template designed for 1.4.x with Magento 1.5.0.1 stable. Here is the URL for my site: http://allyourga.me EDIT1: Errors deleted because they were unrelated EDIT 2: This issue may be related to another one I'm having: Magento - Registration error - 1054 Unknown column 'ca.sort_order' in 'order clause' Error logs from that question have been relisted below: 2011-04-19T23:04:43+00:00 ERR (3): Notice: Undefined index: HTTP_USER_AGENT in /home/user/public_html/app/design/frontend/base/theme100/template/page/ie/ie6.phtml on line 2 2011-04-19T23:04:43+00:00 ERR (3): Notice: Undefined index: HTTP_USER_AGENT in /home/user/public_html/app/design/frontend/base/theme100/template/page/ie/ie6.phtml on line 3 2011-04-19T23:04:43+00:00 ERR (3): Notice: Undefined index: HTTP_USER_AGENT in /home/user/public_html/app/design/frontend/base/theme100/template/page/ie/ie6.phtml on line 19 2011-04-19T23:04:43+00:00 ERR (3): Notice: Undefined index: HTTP_USER_AGENT in /home/user/public_html/app/design/frontend/base/theme100/template/page/ie/ie6.phtml on line 20 Lines 2, 3, 19, 20 from ie6.phhtml have been reproduced below: 2 if(eregi("opera",$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) echo " "; 3 else if(eregi("MSIE 6.0",$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) echo " 19 else if(eregi("Mozilla.[4.]",$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) echo " "; 20 else if(eregi("Mozilla.[5|6]",$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) echo " "; EDIT 3: The errors posted from EDIT 2 are the ones that are related to this problem.
