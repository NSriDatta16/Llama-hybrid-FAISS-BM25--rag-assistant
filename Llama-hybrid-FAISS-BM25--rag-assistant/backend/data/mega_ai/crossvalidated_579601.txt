Time series regression with two dependent variables

I would like to find a suitable model for the relationship between multiple independent variables and two dependent variables simultaneously. Which model would you recommend me to use? If I understand correctly, VAR is not an option, as I am not interested in finding the lag relationship between dependent variables. Also, if I use multivariate multiple regression (like MANOVA), it does not apply to time series. Then which model should I use? Thanks in advance!
