I got it to work but am unclear exactly why. I was calling SaveBitmapImageToIsolatedStorageFile(...) after this code: BitmapImage bitmapImage = new BitmapImage(); bitmapImage.SetSource(e.Result); Image image = new Image(); image.Source = bitmapImage; If I call it before that code, then it works. Apparently SetSource() zeroes out the bytes in e.Result but keeps the length?
