You are getting off track by thinking that:"...you can't have one piece without a number of other pieces..." Story splitting is a skill. It takes practice and it can be a difficult to become good at. This page explains the concept and gives links to resources about story splitting. Here's one of your ideas that you were having trouble breaking up: As a business analyst ensuring all customers orders get processed When a user submits an electronic order and routing or accounting information does not validate I want the invalid accounting and routing information entered into the log and emailed along with the order file attached to the business analyst user group. unless the issue is because the database could not be reached to lookup the customer info due to network issues enter "database could not be reached to lookup the customer info due to network issues" into the log and send an email with the error message to the systems analyst distribution list. I see at least 4 stories in that paragraph: As a BA, during order entry failure due to invalid account and routing information, I want account and routing information to be emailed to the BA group with the order file so that someone knows to get correct information and re-enter the order. As a BA, during order entry failure due to invalid account and routing information, I want account and routing information entered into the log so that e have a permanent record of invalid information. As a BA, during order entry failure due to "can't reach database" , I want the error message "database could not be reached to lookup the customer info due to network issues" emailed to the SA list so that database/network issues can be analyzed and improved. As a BA, during order entry failure due to "can't reach database" , I want the error message "database could not be reached to lookup the customer info due to network issues" written to the log so that we have a permanent record of database/network issues. And if your team is doing TDD well, it shouldn't be too difficult to implement each of those stories separately. Your code will be guarded with tests so that if someone working on card 4 breaks card 1's functionality, hopefully a test will catch it.
