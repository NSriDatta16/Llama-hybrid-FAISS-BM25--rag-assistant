The way I've seen it work more or less ok is to try to do as much as possible of the non-functional/non-user-facing as PART of a related user-facing activity, or the first user-facing activity that requires it. This is the easiest to cope with, as it just reflects the needs of the development organization in order to maintain sustainable velocity moving forward. Additional work which cannot be related will be done using a percentage as described by JB King. The alternative of pitching it as an investment with such and such ROI to the PO is a theoretically sexy concept, but with real life POs I've seen it rarely works. Its very hard to get POs to understand the investment, not to mention actually being strong enough to delay functionality for it. Its sometimes the difficult role of the development teams to be the guys that "slow things down" in order to keep a sustainable situation. Dev managers sometimes feel really bad about this whole sitation, regardless of the chosen approach. My recommendation both as someone who's been in that spot, as well as an Agile coach, is that as long as you feel you are doing the right thing for the business, focusing on non-functional work that is required NOW and has a relatively quick ROI, you should feel ok about this. Cautionary note: This is an area where self-organization is really put to the challenge. Organization needs to trust the team to do the right thing, and the team needs to earn and not abuse that trust. Its a sign of maturity for an individual or a team to know the right balance.
