Tap a cell and show a new view, if your table view has a UINavigationBar: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { if (indexPath.row == myRow) { MyViewController *vc = [[MyViewController alloc] init]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:uvc animated:YES]; [vc release]; } } Then the user can tap back as well. You can present modally as well, but would need to implement a way to return to the table view, by using: [self presentModalViewController:vc animated:YES]; But the simplest base case is this, which you can see used in any template app's AppDelegate: [window addSubview:vc.view]; Remember that the OS is doing a lot for you, including teaching you about MVC by encouraging the creating of controller classes.
