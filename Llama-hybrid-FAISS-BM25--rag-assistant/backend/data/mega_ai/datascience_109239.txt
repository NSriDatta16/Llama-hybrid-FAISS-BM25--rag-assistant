I agree with Vineesh's answer, +1, but have some more details that won't fit well as comments. Historically, random forests were introduced by Breiman (taking inspiration from Dietterich, Ho, and Amit and Geman); Breiman also introduced the CART algorithm (with Friedman, Olshen, and Stone), so it's probable he meant for random forest to be based on CART trees. However, the method works for Quinlan-family trees (ID3, C4.5, C5.0) or others. As an example, the software package weka has its own implementation of C4.5 called J48, and that is the basis for their own random forest method.
