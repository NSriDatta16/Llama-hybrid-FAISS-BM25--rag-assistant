For a sample iPhone application the process of creating a connection to a UIButton (IBOutlet) so that you can make changes to the UIButton goes like this: myClass.h #import @interface myClass { UIButton *myButton; } @property (retain) IBOutlet UIButton *myButton; @end myClass.m #import "myClass.h" @implementation myClass @synthesize myButton; @end Then open your XIB file in Interface Builder and press and hold Control, the drag the mouse from the UIButton in your interface to the File's Owner object in the Document window (Command+0) in IB. Then choose the IBOutlet. For the Outlet to be seen when you drag normally requires that you build the project before going into Interface Builder, and yes secondly check that you have the class type for the IBOutlet that you created is correct.
