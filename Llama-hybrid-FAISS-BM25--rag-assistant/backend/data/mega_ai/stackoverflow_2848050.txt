This should be doable by taking any WYSIWYG editor, removing all text formatting capabilities and controlling the document's style by manipulating the body element's CSS: my_wysiwyg_editor.document.body.style.fontSize = "15px"; my_wysiwyg_editor.document.body.style.color = "blue"; Here's how to access the WYSIWYG document in CKEditor (the top rated answer is the correct one IIRC, I can't accept it because it was an expired bounty.) I'm not promising it will work out for you, though, and there will be quirks - the editors tend to add their own stuff to the HTML (e.g. wrap paragraphs into tags and such) which could make life hard. If you wouldn't need some of the WYSIWYG capabilities, I'd suggest a normal textarea - you can influence that in font size, colour etc. easily and it's way simpler than a full-blown WYSIWYG solution.
