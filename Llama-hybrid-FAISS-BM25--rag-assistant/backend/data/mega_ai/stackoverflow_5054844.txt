Find similar records in dataset

I have a dataset of 25 integer fields and 40k records, e.g. 1: field1: 0 field2: 3 field3: 1 field4: 2 [...] field25: 1 2: field1: 2 field2: 1 field3: 4 field4: 0 [...] field25: 2 etc. I'm testing with MySQL but am not tied to it. Given a single record, I need to retrieve the records most similar to it; something like the lowest average difference of the fields. I started looking at the following, but I don't know how to map this onto the problem of searching for similarities in a large dataset. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen_similarity_index https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_matrix
