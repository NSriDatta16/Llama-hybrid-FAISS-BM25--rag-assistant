I think of programming as an Art. An art that requires efficiency. Is efficient code incompatible with beautiful code ? I doubt that. In fact, i think that when you solve a problem creatively it may mean multiplied performance. I don't think that programming should only be about learning a new libraries for each new needs, nor about bug tracking and fixing. I think it should be about beauty. Of course code cannot be always art, and sometimes one should be pragmatic about the encountered problems.
