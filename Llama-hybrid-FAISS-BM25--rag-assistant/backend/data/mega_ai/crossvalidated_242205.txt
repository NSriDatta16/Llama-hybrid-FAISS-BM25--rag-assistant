L1 regularization can be employed in nonlinear estimation and classification problems. See for example the documentation in Python's scikit-learn package: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html This section includes a number of generalized linear models (linear and nonlinear), several of which include L1 regularization as an option (with logistic regression being one such example of a nonlinear model with "sparse variable selection" properties when L1 regularization is used). Note that L1 regularization is also frequently used in neural nets to moderate overfitting: http://scikit-neuralnetwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_mlp.html
