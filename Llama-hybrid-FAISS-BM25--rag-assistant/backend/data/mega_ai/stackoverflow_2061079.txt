This probably depends a lot on the audience. (How technical.. how much detail) Big milestones seems pretty simple to show on a simple timeline. If you are just trying to show some simple graphical representation you could just create a gantt chart . You wouldn't even need to use an app. You could make it in a graphics program. I used to keep a project wiki page that was ordered by date so that people would see my weekly progress on stuff, but I think that might be a bit more detailed than you are looking for. I am sure most of the project management applications will output HTML for you though. You just have to publish them though. Different types of project management tools .
