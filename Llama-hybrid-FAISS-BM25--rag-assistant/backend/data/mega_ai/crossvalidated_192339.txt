I agree with @j__'s answer. However, I would like to highlight the fact that splines are just a special case of Gaussian Process regression/kriging . If you take a certain type of kernel in Gaussian process regression, you exactly obtain the spline fitting model. This fact is proven in this paper by Kimeldorf and Wahba (1970) . It is rather technical, as it uses the link between the kernels used in kriging and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).
