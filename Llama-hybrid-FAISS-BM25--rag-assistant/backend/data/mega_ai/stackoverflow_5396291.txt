Help in solution more than one form in asp.net as to my logic its compulsory

As per my layout one form(all forms with runat=server) should be in header right top and the other one I want to place in section's article. So I will have no problem in positioning of contents. How do I solve it? My design: Login & logout are contained in form at header top-right; article:Embedding AJAX4 accordian & tab container but this requires it to be placed in form as should be in form having runat=server . (article has aside_left & aside_right near to it seperated and header at top seperated which contains the form) So any Solution for this? Do I have to change the logic? I am working with visual studio 2010 asp.net 4 IIS v6 of windows7 x86
