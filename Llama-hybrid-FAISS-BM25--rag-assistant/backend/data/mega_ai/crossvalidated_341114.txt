Robust error estimation and hazard ratio with non-proportional hazards

I recall having heard that the hazard ratio, estimated in a Cox model, can be made robust against the parallel hazard functions assumption. The key to this is using a Huber-White, or Huber-Eicker-White, or Heteroscedasticity Consistent (HC) "sandwich" standard error. In this case the hazard ratio is interpreted as a failure-time-averaged hazard ratio. Is this true? Is there a citation which I can refer to to claim this?
