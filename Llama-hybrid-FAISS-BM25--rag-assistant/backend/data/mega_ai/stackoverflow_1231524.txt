Accessibility and code organization problems in javascript with jquery

I'm having troubles with the order of my code in my program. right now I have some things with in document.ready(function() { } ); and some things out side of it. Whenever I move anything (to organize or improve my code) I end up breaking something, I'm guessing because of either order of declarations or access levels (ie. something outside of document.ready(function {}); cannot access something inside of it. Anyone have any insight as to where things should be located javascript wise? Should everything be within document.ready(function() {}); ? Is there any reason to have anything outside of document.ready(function() {}); ? Is the code within document.ready(function() {}); inaccessible by outer code?
