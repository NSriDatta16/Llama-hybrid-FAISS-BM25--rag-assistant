How to aggregate data from SQL Server 2005

I have about 150 000 rows of data written to a database everyday. These row represent outgoing articles for example. Now I need to show a graph using SSRS that show the average number of articles per day over time . I also need to have a information about the actual number of articles from yesterday . The idea is to have a aggregated view on all our transactions and have something that can indicate that something is wrong (that we for example send out 20% less articles than the average). My idea is to have yesterdays data moved into SSAS every night and there store the aggregated value of number of transactions and the actual number of transaction from yesterdays data. Using SSAS would hopefully speed up the reports. Do you think this is the right idea? Should I skip SSAS and have reports straight on the raw data? I know how use reporting services on raw data using standard SQL queries but how would this change when querying SSAS? I don't know SSAS - where do I start ..?
