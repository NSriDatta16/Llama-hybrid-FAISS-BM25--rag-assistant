The $1^{st}$ is all about productionization of machine learning solutions. OOPs and OOD are just computer programming paradigms that you use to achieve this, and you can learn this independent of your background. Python is used for production systems (among other things). Even though now you can get away with average programming skills in the future more and more of what now is machine learning and data science will be abstracted away and accessible via simple API calls. Take a look for example at FastAI or the newest GPT-3 almost everything is abstracted away behind API calls and even tough pytorch is underneath you do not even need to know it to achieve good results. Of course experts will be always needed but his will be a minority. Data science will be a simple tool kit in a software engineers knowledge base.
