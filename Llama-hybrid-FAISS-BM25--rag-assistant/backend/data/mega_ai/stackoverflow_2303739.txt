Installing unsigned x64 driver to work with libusbdotnet

I am currently in a Windows 7 dev. environment working to get a device to initialize with libusbdotnet . The device (a USB mass storage device) connects and runs using the default USB-MASS Storage driver for Windows. I want to replace this driver with the one created by the .INF Wizard in libusbdotnet. The operating system is a 64-bit, and by default the INF Wizard produces this driver, but I am unable to selected it because it is "unsigned" I believed, when I go to "Pick from a list of drivers" and point to the directory where the newly created device drivers are. I have enabled "TEST MODE" using DESO but I'm still unable to select this file. Anyone familiar with libusbdotnet, or directing devices to work with a specific driver that is unsigned in Window (do I need the .inf file? or the .sys???) do you have any advice about where I'm going wrong? Thanks!
