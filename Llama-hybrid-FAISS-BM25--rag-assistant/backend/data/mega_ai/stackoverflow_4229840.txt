jquery UI sortable - allow drag of image embedded in sortable div to result in start of div sorting

Sorry, I really have no idea how to phrase this, so apologies for the long title. I have a table column filled with divs that are sortable (using the jquery ui sortable plugin). Each of those divs has an image child. Currently, when I attempt to drag the div by clicking on the image portion of the div, the div does not drag. Obviously, I want to div to drag when I click on the image (or any portion of the div). Any suggestions?
