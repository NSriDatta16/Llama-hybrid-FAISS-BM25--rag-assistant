Launching java classes via windows drag-and-drop

I have a java class file with a main method. In Windows, I would like to be able to drag files onto a desktop icon/short/etc that would call supply the filenames to my main method. Basically, I want to allow users to drag-and-drop files at program execution instead of having type them on the command line. Any thoughts?
