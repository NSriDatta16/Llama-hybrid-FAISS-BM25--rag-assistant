Am I oversimplifying this mixed ANOVA?

I have 23 participants who completed 8x3 minutes training periods in each session. Participants completed 12 such sessions. Thus far, I have been averaging the results of these 8x3 training periods in each session and then comparing the averages across the 12 sessions using a mixed ANOVA (there were two different types of training). I'm just wondering if this feels like an appropriate course of action? Thanks so much in advance!
