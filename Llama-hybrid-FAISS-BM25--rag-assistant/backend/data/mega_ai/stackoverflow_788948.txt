Just to clarify about how tags and branches would be used in Vladimir's scheme. Let's say that version 1.x of your product is retired, version 2.1 is out in the world, and you're working on version 3.0: trunk In your continuous integration/build server, you're going to need 2 processes: one that points to the trunk in your version control system one that points to ReleaseBranch-2.0 on your version control system The book Pragmatic Version Control with Subversion is designed for Subversion, but does go into how to organize a repository as described above.
