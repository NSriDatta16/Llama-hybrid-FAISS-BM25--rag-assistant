This is an example of coding guidelines (see towards the end, "File organization"). There are many and not all agree on the order of class members. As a matter of personal preference, I prefer grouping constants, fields, properties, constructors, members (public first, then internal, then protected, then private) in this order using #region - #endregion blocks. The reason why I leave private members for last is that when I read code, I like to get the information of the class's interface to the outside world before knowing how it implements it in private members.
