you can't prevent crawling if the crawler REALLY want to, but you can make fun of them. Ways to detect bots by user agent by ip by log analysis (most of the time, bots load one page every x seconds) Make a javascript load an specific file ie [yadda.gif]. If you loaded a given page but didn't downloaded yadda.gif, you don't have js enabled and the odds are that you are a bot (or are using noscript) Possible punishments: redirect to microsoft.com :-) set the thoutput rate really low so it takes forever to download anything. you can do this with apache's mod_throughput or php's output buffering functions return gibberish, devowel the content or something like that.
