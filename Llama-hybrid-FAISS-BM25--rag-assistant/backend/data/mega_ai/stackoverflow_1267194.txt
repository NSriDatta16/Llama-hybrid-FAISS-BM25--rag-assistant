Just live with the concatenation. You'd be surprised how inefficient variable interpolation in strings can be . And while this could fall under the umbrella of pre-optimization or micro-optimization, I just don't think you actually gain any elegance in this example. Personally, if I'm gonna make a tiny optimization of one or the other, and my choices are "faster" and "easier to type" - I'm gonna choose "faster". Because you only type it a few times, but it's probably going to execute thousands of times.
