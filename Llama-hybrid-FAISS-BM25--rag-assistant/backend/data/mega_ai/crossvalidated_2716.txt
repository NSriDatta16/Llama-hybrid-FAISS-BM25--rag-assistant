OK, a totally non-math answer: If you have a bunch of variables on a bunch of subjects and you want to reduce it to a smaller number of variables on those same subjects, while losing as little information as possible, then PCA is one tool to do this. It differs from factor analysis, although they often give similar results, in that FA tries to recover a small number of latent variables from a larger number of observed variables that are believed to be related to the latent variables.
