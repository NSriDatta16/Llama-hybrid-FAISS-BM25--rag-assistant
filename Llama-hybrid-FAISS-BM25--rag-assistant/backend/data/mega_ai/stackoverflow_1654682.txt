While there may be overlaps between the two (some web servers may even be used as application servers) the biggest difference IMHO is in the processing model and the session management: In Web server processing model, the focus is on handling requests; the notion of "session" is pretty much virtual. That is to say that "session" is simulated by transferring the representation of state between client and server (hence REST) and/or serializing it to an external persistent storage (SQL Server, Memcached etc). In Application server the session is usually more explicit and often takes form of an object living in memory of the application server for the entire duration of the "session".
