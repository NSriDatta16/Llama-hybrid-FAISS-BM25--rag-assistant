Should partial (spearman) correlation be used on a time series data?

I'm trying to adapt my workflows to timeseries datasets and stumbled across this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpAf4N582bA It discusses partial correlation and it seems like a useful tool for investigating timeseries data where you can use the timepoint as the covariate for partial correlation: https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/generated/pingouin.pairwise_corr.html My question is if this is a typical way to identify monotonic relationships (if using spearman) between covariates in a timeseries data if you use timepoints as the reference covariate. If not, why doesn't this work and what should I try out instead? Timepoints are represented as days from t=0.
