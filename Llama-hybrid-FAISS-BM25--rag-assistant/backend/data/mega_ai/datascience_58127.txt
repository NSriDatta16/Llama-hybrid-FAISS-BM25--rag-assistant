Plotting ROC curve after re-sampling the data set

I am a beginner in Machine Learning. I am working on a project to compare the performance of three ML algorithms which are: LR, SVM and ANN on a dataset containing medical records. After exploring the data I have found that the dataset is imbalanced, and hence I have applied SMOTE. Then I applied PCA on the resampled data to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and to improve the performance of the Algorithms. After plotting a heatmap of the Confusion Matrices of each Algorithms I want to plot the ROC curves showing the AUC scores. Following is the screenshot of the heatmap of the Confusion Matrix of SVM. And this is the code that I have used to plot the ROC Curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc ### Fit a sklearn classifier on train dataset and output probabilities pred_val = svc.predict_proba(self.X_test)[:,1] ### Compute ROC curve and ROC area for predictions on validation set fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(self.y_test, pred_val) roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr) ### Plot plt.figure() lw = 2 plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=lw, label='ROC curve (area = %0.2f)' % roc_auc) plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=lw, linestyle='--') plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0]) plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05]) plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') plt.title('Receiver operating characteristic example') plt.legend(loc="lower right") plt.show() This is the result: Please tell me wheter the result shown by the ROC curve is correct or not.
