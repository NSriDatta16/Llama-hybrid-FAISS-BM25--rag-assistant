Firstly, it is optional that this is not a leakage - depends on your production environment: If "in production" you need to predict only 1 step ahead- you're all good. You use all the history, including the previous day or so, and predict the next. which is fine. On the other hand, if "in production" you would like to predict months ahead - you indeed have a leakage. The way you should handle it is by modeling the task as predicting the following X values. Some models can do that (depends on the data of course). Secondly, lightGBM is a great model, but it has some disadvantages when dealing with time series forecasting, versus other models created for these kinds of tasks. I'd start by considering an easier task than predicting numeric values months ahead. It's a tough problem, if possible at all. For any farther questions, feel free to comment and I'd try my best to assist.
