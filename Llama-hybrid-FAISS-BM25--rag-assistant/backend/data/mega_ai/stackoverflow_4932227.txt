Logging exception and throwing it further is actually an anti-pattern for several reasons . The rule of thumb is: if you can't do anything useful to handle the exception (logging is not handling the exception in most cases), let your framework/container do it for you. If you can (for instance use different storage when database is not available, queue packages when network is down), log the exception and proceed (always remember to log stack as well). If you have a checked exception, wrap it in runtime one and rethrow (create your custom exception or look for existing one that match your needs).
