I know it's not the toolkit you're looking at, but Dojo has a very good and very flexible hierarchical tree component. I'm pretty sure it allows full drag-and-drop rearrangement of elements. If not, it provides the framework for doing it. I agree with FractalizeR in that the JavaScript doesn't need to care about the method of generating the tree. NestedSet is a technique for relational databases, not interactive trees.
