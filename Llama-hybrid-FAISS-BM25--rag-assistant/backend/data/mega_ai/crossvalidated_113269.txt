From your comments, we have clarified that you have a binary outcome (dependent) variable that can take on these values 1. Extrovert, 2. Introvert . I use the different type of variables, independent variables (data type : numeric) but dependent variable (data type is categorical), so it is possible to apply logistic regression and Pearson? Yes, since the outcome variable is binary, you can use logistic regression. You can also use Pearson or Spearman or other types of correlations between each independent (predictor) variable and your outcome. Have a read on the different types of correlations and in what scenairos they can be used, here is an example. Also here are some other examples on how to call them in R. Or can someone give me some advice the better solution such as another methods for solving this problem. I would start with logistic regression (LR) first, and try to understand what it is doing, look at the coefficents for different variables and their p-values. The task you are eventually trying to accomplish is called binary classification . Apart from LR, there are a lot of different classification algorithms that you can use. But LR is good for a start.
