I think the best way would be to provide styles in a module. This way you will be able to easily restyle, or add "themes" for your controls. I'm doing a similar project which is hosted on github ( http://github.com/markovuksanovic/gwt-styles ), so you might want to check that out. You can download the jar file, include it in your project and specify in your module xml that you wanna use that style.. sth like I would suggest you to use new module for your styles so that you can easily switch among styles... (just change the inherits tag). So, for example, if one of your widgets used css class "my-widget", you would have a "style" module (or multiple modules) which would define that css class (in the css file) - this way you could have multiple modules that implement that css class and switching amongst them would be as easy as changing the module name in the inherits tag. This way you would a nicely decoupled code - styles will be independent of the technical implementation of the widgets. If you have some more questions, feel free to ask. P.S. I forgot to mention above - pay close attention on how the style module is built (build.xml), it's a little tricky. You can find some more information about creating modules at the following lication http://developerlife.com/tutorials/?p=229
