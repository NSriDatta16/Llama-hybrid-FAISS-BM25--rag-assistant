Using multiple bindings through a display pattern as Barry suggested sounds like the best approach, at least without knowing more about your UI. I've used the same thing in the past, where I built an inspector for an array of images and had the dimensions bound to a single text field. In general it's good practice to use value transformers or formatters if you can, but in cases of last resort there's nothing wrong with using a category. I've done this in the past when I had trouble binding to a date, but breaking it down into individual time and date pieces. A category is a good approach because it lets you maintain separation with the model, but you don't need to do anything crazy like binding directly to the controller.
