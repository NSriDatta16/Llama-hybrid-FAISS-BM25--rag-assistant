During model building you train your models on a training sample . Note that that you can train different models (i.e. different techniques like SVM, LDA, Random Forest, ... or the same technique with different values of the tuning parameters, or a mixture). Among all different models that you trained, you have to choose one and therefore you use the validation sample to find the one with the smallest error on the test sample. For this 'final' model we still have to estimate the error and therefore we use the test sample .
