Neural networks vs support vector machines: are the second definitely superior?

Many authors of papers I read affirm SVMs is superior technique to face their regression/classification problem, aware that they couldn't get similar results through NNs. Often the comparison states that SVMs, instead of NNs, Have a strong founding theory Reach the global optimum due to quadratic programming Have no issue for choosing a proper number of parameters Are less prone to overfitting Needs less memory to store the predictive model Yield more readable results and a geometrical interpretation Is it seriously a broadly accepted thought? Don't quote No-Free Lunch Theorem or similar statements, my question is about practical usage of those techniques. On the other side, which kind of abstract problem you definitely would face with NN?
