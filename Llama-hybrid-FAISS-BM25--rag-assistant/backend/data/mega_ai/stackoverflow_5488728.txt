Well, since we're at macro hacks already, here is mine :-) enum MyEnum { foo, bar, baz }; typedef __attribute__ ((deprecated))MyEnum MyEnum_deprecated; #define bar ((MyEnum_deprecated) bar) int main () { int a = foo; // yuck, why did C++ ever allow that... int b = bar; MyEnum c = foo; MyEnum d = bar; return 0; } This works with gcc, and it does not require you to break type-safety. Unluckily it still abuses your code with macros, so meh. But as far as I could figure, it's as good as it gets. The proposal made by Tom is much cleaner (works for MSVC, I assume), but unluckily the only message gcc will give you is "ignoring pragma".
