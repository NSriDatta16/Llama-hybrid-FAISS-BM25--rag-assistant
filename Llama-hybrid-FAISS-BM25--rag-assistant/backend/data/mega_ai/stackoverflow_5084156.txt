Magento: Rendering blank page when calling template from Ajax

First off, I must apologize for my lack of knowledge on the subject. I'm still new to Magento, and with the information I've come across, I should've been able to get this working. I started off here . I'm able to get the Ajax method to make a call, but I'm getting a blank 2column-left.phtml as my output (So I'm seeing the header, left column, blank main column, and footer). I have my files set up as so: app/local/MyModule/Featured/Block/Featured.php _controller = 'featured'; $this->_blockGroup = 'featured'; parent::__construct(); } } ?> app/local/MyModule/Featured/controllers/FeaturedController.php loadLayout()->renderLayout(); } } ?> app/local/MyModule/Featured/etc/config.xml 0.1.0 standard MyModule_Featured featured app/design/frontend/default/myLayout/layout/local.xml Ajax Code on Homepage custom phtml: var url = " getUrl('featured/featured/display') ;?>"; jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('#featured-products').load(url); });
