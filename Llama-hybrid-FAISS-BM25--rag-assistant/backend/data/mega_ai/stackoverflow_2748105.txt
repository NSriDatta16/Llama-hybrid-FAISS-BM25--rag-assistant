JQuery UI Autocomplete showing as bullets

The JQuery UI Demo page for autocomplete ( link ) has a nice looking search box and drop down with nice colors and highlights and such. When I implement it for myself, I end up with a bulleted list. How do I get my drop down of suggestions to look like theirs? A few notes/code fragments: I'm working in .NET land, so I'm using the tag with s inside it to get the hosted jquery.min.js (1.4.2) and jquery-ui.min.js (1.8.1) files from Google. My input box is fairly simple: Term: My autocomplete looks like: $(""#terms"").autocomplete({source:""GetAttributesJSON.aspx"",minLength:2}); I get the correct data back, so that's not the issue. I just want fancy graphics. Any thoughts would be much appreciated.
