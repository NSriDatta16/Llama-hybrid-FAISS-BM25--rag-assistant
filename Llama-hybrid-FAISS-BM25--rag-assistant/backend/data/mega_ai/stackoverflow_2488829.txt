The reason hard coding is a Bad Thing is only because when you put things in code that change, it's annoying (and expensive) - there's no other reason. Things that don't change, like pi, or the list of weekdays, can be hard-coded to your heart's content, and you won't incur any extra development cost as a result. So this problem isn't so much about not maintaining a manual mapping table - in code if necessary - as it is about only maintaining the mapping table in one place. We rolled our own data access class, several years ago now. And sure, we convert manually (in a VB.NET Select Case statement) from .NET types to SQL types. I think it changed once, when we had to add Enum types. That's once, in about four years. We do a release a week, on average - guess how worried we are about the 'overhead' of hard coding the .NET -> SQL type mapping? Do it in one place. Ensure that everything uses it. And then forget about it. There are other, much tougher problems to solve.
