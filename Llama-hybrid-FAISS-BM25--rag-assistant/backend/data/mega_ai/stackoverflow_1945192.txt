I like to think I know a thing or two about calendars, so let's see if I can clear a few things up. The Catholic Church defines the date of Easter in terms of lunar phases (this is why the date jumps around from year to year). Because of this, it needs to be able to calculate the approximate moon phase, and its algorithm for doing so is explained here . I have not done very detailed checking, but it appears that the NetHack algorithm is based heavily on the Church's algorithm. The NetHack algorithm seems to, like the Church's algorithm, pay attention only to the calendar date, ignoring time zones and the time of day. The NetHack algorithm uses only the year and the day of the year. I can tell from examining the code that, to be Y2K compatible, that tm_year has to be the year minus 1900.
