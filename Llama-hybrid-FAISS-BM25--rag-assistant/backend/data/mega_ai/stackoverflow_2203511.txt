Flicker of unstyled content in Firefox

I built this site a couple of years back and but am now in the process of moving it to a new server. However. I've noticed there is a split second of unstyled content show on page load when viewed in Firefox (3.5.7)? And on checking in IE8, a less frequent and slightly more raggged effect also happens but only prior to caching? The url is: http://www.rhubarbrentals.co.uk If anyone can suggest how to fix this I would be grateful.
