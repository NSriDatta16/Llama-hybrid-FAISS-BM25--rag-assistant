I had the same question too, but I didn't want to modify wordpress templates: Firstly I thought about adding the class "noLava" to every with depth > 1, so I tried to expand the Walker class with a custom one - with no success. Then I started to modify the lavalamp jquery plugin, and after having tried all day long I found the solution here , so I modified it as below, and it works like a charm :) {find `var $li = jQuery('li[class!=noLava]', this);` and replace with:} //var $li = jQuery('li[class!=noLava]', this); //default one //by Paolo Bergantino, via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/965816/what-jquery-selector-excludes-items-with-a-parent-that-matches-a-given-selector/965962#965962 jQuery.expr[':'].parents = function(a,i,m){ return jQuery(a).parents(m[3]).length Maybe the best solution is to preserve the original behavior and add this one. Edit: [online demo]
