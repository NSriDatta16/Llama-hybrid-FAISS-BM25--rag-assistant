Why Create a Generator Manually for Neural Network when Keras has Built-in Generators?

So many tutorials I see have manually created generators in order to use the fit_generator() command in the model-fitting stage. However, these seem to exist already in Keras. E.g., keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator() Is this not correct? E.g. can I do, train_gen = keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(someParameters) model.fit_generator(train_gen, someOtherParameters) Thank you in advance.
