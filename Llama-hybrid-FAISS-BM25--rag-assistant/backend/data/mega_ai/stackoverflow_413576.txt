I've been through this drill before. The best alternative is to add a column to the table or to a subsidiary joinable table that stores the inferred numerical value for the purpose. Then use iterative queries to set the column repeatedly until you get sufficient accuracy and coverage. You'll end up encountering stuff like "First, Third," "451a", "1200 South 19th Blvd East", and worse. Then filter new and edited records as they occur. As usual, UDF's should be avoided as being slow and (comparatively) less debuggable.
