Try something like this: function getRate($request) { // find a customer ID $admin_session = Mage::getSingleton('adminhtml/session_quote'); if($admin_session) { if($admin_session->getCustomerId()) { $customer_id = $admin_session->getCustomerId(); } } else { $customer_id = Mage::getSingleton("customer/session")->getCustomerId(); } // find customer attr if($customer_id) { $customer = Mage::getModel("customer/customer")->load($customer_id); if($customer->getSomeColumnValue()) { return 0; } } // fallthrough return parent::getRate($request); } Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe EDIT: good point ;) Looking through the adminhtml code, it seems to be far less useful than the normal customer code. I was hoping for a call to Mage::register but that's not happening. I found a possible solution, though loading sessions in Magento seems to have side effects. See above. RE-EDIT: to incorporate your fixes for posterity.
