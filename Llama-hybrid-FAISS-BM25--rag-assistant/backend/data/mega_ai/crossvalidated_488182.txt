If understand this correctly, you have 4 groups, which can be viewed as categorical variables. You can select one group and denote it as the 'refence'. A reasonable choice would be the group with the most observations. The estimated average for this group, $b_0$ , would be your intercept. For the others group estimate their respective averages and the difference between these averages and the intercept. Finally you'll have a model of the form: $Y = b_0 + b_1D_1X_1 + b_2D_2X_2 + b_3D_3X_3$ , where $D_1, D_2, D_3$ are indicator variables equal to $1$ if $X$ belongs to the respective group (otherwise $0$ )
