Content is not allowed in prolog

i'm trying to convert xml to html using xslt . Am using java.xml.transform to do this in java. it was working fine until i bumped into some xml . it said the following error. [Fatal Error] :1:1: Content is not allowed in prolog. javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Content is not allowed in prolog. so i made sure there is no character before the xml declaration. i even took care of BOM using the solution http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?messageID=10324562#10324562 STILL no luck and it happens only for one xml. i even opened the xml in editor and saved it in a file with utf-8 encoding. this is driving me crazy. any idea? UPDATE: You get this error when you have given the wrong path for the xsl file and a file not found exception happens. (this was my case. it might help somebody. thanks for your responses)
