Ah! I had "text-indent" in my regular text's CSS. sIFR interpreted this as indent everything--hence the shift. I deleted "text-indent" and am good again--I still do have it in my sIFR congfig CSS to indent the first line in the paragraph and it's fine there. (So, to indent in the non-sIFR text, I used tags which sIFR ignores.)
