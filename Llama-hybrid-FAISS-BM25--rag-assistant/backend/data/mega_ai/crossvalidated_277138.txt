Black borders in aligned face images, for face recognition

I have been working with face recognition with neural networks. My dataset has images which fall short of pixels on one axis, as required by the chosen face alignment method. These short pixels may vary from 4 to 7% of pixels on that axis. Which ends up causing black borders on the images. I would like to know if this is a common problem ? To what extent can it affect the accuracy ? How do people deal with it ? Thanks.
