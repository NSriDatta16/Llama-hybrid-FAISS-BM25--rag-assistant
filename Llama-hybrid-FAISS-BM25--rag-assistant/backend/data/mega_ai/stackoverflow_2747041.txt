Salvaging (and extending) the list from an old version of the Wikipedia page : Documentation Primer Cheat Sheet Quick Reference reStructuredText and Sphinx Reference Implementations Although the reference implementation of reStructuredText is written in Python, there are reStructuredText parsers in other languages too. Python - Docutils The main distribution of reStructuredText is the Python Docutils package. It contains several conversion tools: rst2html - from reStructuredText to HTML rst2xml - from reStructuredText to XML rst2latex - from reStructuredText to LaTeX rst2odt - from reStructuredText to ODF Text (word processor) document. rst2s5 - from reStructuredText to S5 , a Simple Standards-based Slide Show System rst2man - from reStructuredText to Man page Haskell - Pandoc Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read Markdown and (subsets of) reStructuredText, HTML, and LaTeX, and it can write Markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, PDF, RTF, DocBook XML, OpenDocument XML, ODT, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup, groff man pages, and S5 HTML slide shows. There is an Pandoc online tool (POT) to try this library. Unfortunately, compared to the reStructuredText online renderer (ROR), POT truncates input rather more shortly. The POT user must render input in chunks that could be rendered whole by the ROR. POT output lacks the helpful error messages displayed by the ROR (and generated by docutils ) Java - JRst JRst is a Java reStructuredText parser. It can currently output HTML, XHTML, DocBook xdoc and PDF, BUT seems to have serious problems: neither PDF or (X)HTML generation works using the current full download, result pages in (X)HTML are empty and PDF generation fails on IO problems with XSL files (not bundled??). Note that the original JRst has been removed from the website; a fork is found on GitHub . Scala - Laika Laika is a new library for transforming markup languages to other output formats. Currently it supports input from Markdown and reStructuredText and produce HTML output. The library is written in Scala but should be also usable from Java. Perl Text::Restructured - Perl implementation of reStructuredText parser Dotiac::DTL::Addon::markup - Filters to work with common markup languages - support reStructuredText Pod::POM::View::Restructured - View for Pod::POM that outputs reStructuredText PHP Gregwar/RST - A mature PHP5.3 parser with tests php-restructuredtext - A simple, incomplete (but functional) implementation C#/.NET reStructuredText for ANTLR - A C# based parser with tests (in progress). It also provides the language server behind reStructuredText extension for Visual Studio Code . Nim/C The Nim compiler features the commands rst2html and rst2tex which transform reStructuredText files to HTML and TeX files. The standard library provides the following modules (used by the compiler) to handle reStructuredText files programmatically: rst - implements a reStructuredText parser rstast - implements an AST for the reStructuredText parser rstgen - implements a generator of HTML/Latex from reStructuredText Other 3rd party converters Most (but not all) of these tools are based on Docutils (see above) and provide conversion to or from formats that might not be supported by the main distribution. From reStructuredText restview - This pip -installable python package requires docutils , which does the actual rendering. restview 's major ease-of-use feature is that, when you save changes to your document(s), it automagically re-renders and re-displays them. restview starts a small web server calls docutils to render your document(s) to HTML calls your device's browser to display the output HTML. rst2pdf or rinohtype - from reStructuredText to PDF rst2odp - from reStructuredText to ODF Presentation rst2beamer - from reStructuredText to LaTeX beamer Presentation class Wikir - from reStructuredText to a Google (and possibly other) Wiki formats rst2qhc - Convert a collection of reStructuredText files into a Qt (toolkit) Help file and (optional) a Qt Help Project file To reStructuredText xml2rst is an XSLT script to convert Docutils internal XML representation (back) to reStructuredText Pandoc (see above) can also convert from Markdown, HTML and LaTeX to reStructuredText db2rst is a simple and limited DocBook to reStructuredText translator pod2rst - convert .pod files to reStructuredText files Extensions Some projects use reStructuredText as a baseline to build on, or provide extra functionality extending the utility of the reStructuredText tools. Sphinx The Sphinx documentation generator translates a set of reStructuredText source files into various output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices etc. rest2web rest2web is a simple tool that lets you build your website from a single template (or as many as you want), and keep the contents in reStructuredText. Pygments Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software such as forum systems, Wikis or other applications that need to prettify source code. See Using Pygments in reStructuredText documents . Free Editors While any plain text editor is suitable to write reStructuredText documents, some editors have better support than others. Emacs The Emacs support via rst-mode comes as part of the Docutils package under /docutils/tools/editors/emacs/rst.el Vim The vim-common package for that comes with most GNU/Linux distributions has reStructuredText syntax highlight and indentation support of reStructuredText out of the box: reStructuredText syntax highlighting mode for vim VST (Vim reStructured Text) is a plugin for Vim7 with folding for reStructuredText Riv.vim - fresh vim plugin for authoring rst and Sphinx doc Previm : Vim plugin for live previewing of reStructuredText and other mark up documents Jed There is a rst mode for the Jed programmers editor. gedit gedit, the official text editor of the GNOME desktop environment. There is a gedit reStructuredText plugin . Geany Geany , a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment include support for reStructuredText from version 0.12 (October 10, 2007). Leo Leo , an outlining editor for programmers, supports reStructuredText via rst-plugin or via "@auto-rst" nodes (it's not well-documented, but @auto-rst nodes allow editing rst files directly, parsing the structure into the Leo outline). It also provides a way to preview the resulting HTML, in a "viewrendered" pane. FTE The FTE Folding Text Editor - a free (licensed under the GNU GPL) text editor for developers. FTE has a mode for reStructuredText support. It provides color highlighting of basic RSTX elements and special menu that provide easy way to insert most popular RSTX elements to a document. PyK PyK is a successor of PyEdit and reStInPeace, written in Python with the help of the Qt4 toolkit. Eclipse The Eclipse IDE with the ReST Editor plug-in provides support for editing reStructuredText files. NoTex NoTex is a browser based (general purpose) text editor, with integrated project management and syntax highlighting. Plus it enables to write books, reports, articles etc. using rST and convert them to LaTex, PDF or HTML. The PDF files are of high publication quality and are produced via Sphinx with the Texlive LaTex suite. Notepad++ Notepad++ is a general purpose text editor for Windows. It has syntax highlighting for many languages built-in and support for reStructuredText via a user defined language for reStructuredText . Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code is a general purpose text editor for Windows/macOS/Linux. It has syntax highlighting for many languages built-in and supports reStructuredText via an extension from LeXtudio .

RSTPad a standalone cross-platform editor with live preview Proprietary editors Sublime Text Sublime Text is a completely customizable and extensible source code editor available for Windows, OS X, and Linux. Registration is required for long-term use, but all functions are available in the unregistered version, with occasional reminders to purchase a license. Versions 2 and 3 (currently in beta) support reStructuredText syntax highlighting by default, and several plugins are available through the package manager Package Control to provide snippets and code completion, additional syntax highlighting, conversion to/from RST and other formats, and HTML preview in the browser. BBEdit / TextWrangler BBEdit (and its free variant TextWrangler ) for Mac can syntax-highlight reStructuredText using this codeless language module .
