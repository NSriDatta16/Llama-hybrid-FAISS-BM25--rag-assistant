R interpretation of STL() or decompose() results

How can I interpret the results of the decomposition of a time series, especially from the seasonal results? Example: timeserie_beer = head(ausbeer, 12) decompose(timeserie_beer) Results: $x Qtr1 Qtr2 Qtr3 Qtr4 1956 284 213 227 308 1957 262 228 236 320 1958 272 233 237 313 $seasonal Qtr1 Qtr2 Qtr3 Qtr4 1956 5.421875 -32.015625 -27.703125 54.296875 1957 5.421875 -32.015625 -27.703125 54.296875 1958 5.421875 -32.015625 -27.703125 54.296875 How can I calculate the 54,29 of the Qtr4? The mean of all values is 261 and the means for the Qtrs: Qtr1 = 272 Qtr2 = 224 Qtr3 = 233 Qtr4 = 313 In the plot of the base time series, I can see that the season is in Q4. And is there a possibility to comprehend the seasonal values - how are they calculated?
