This is called " bilevel optimization " where one problem is embedded (nested) within another. If there are more than one objectives at one or both levels, it is then called "multi-objective bilevel optimization". There is a rich literature on this problem, including the book Multilevel Optimization: Algorithms and Applications . Finding solutions to minimize the objectives often does not require machine learning, just linear programming .
