Does Ruby have a special storage for returning a value?

The following Ruby code def a(b,c) b+c end is the same as follows with Python def a(b,c): return b+c It looks like that ruby has the special storage(stack or something) that stores the final evaluation result and returns the value when a function is called. If so, what's the name of the stack, and how can I get that stack? If not, how does the Ruby code work without returning something?
