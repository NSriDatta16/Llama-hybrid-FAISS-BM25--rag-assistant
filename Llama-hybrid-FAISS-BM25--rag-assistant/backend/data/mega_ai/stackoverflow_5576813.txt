show search results on menu item click in magento

By default the search functionality is implemented this way. User enters some text in the input search box and on click of "search" button the search results come up. But I want the search results to show up on click of a menu item "Search" in top menu bar instead of the default "Search button". How can this be done. Please suggest. Thanx.
