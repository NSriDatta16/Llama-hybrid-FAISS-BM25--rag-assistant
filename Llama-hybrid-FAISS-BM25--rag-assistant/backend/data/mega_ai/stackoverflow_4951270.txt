jQuery Cycle simultaneous fade

I am having an issue with the jQuery Cycle Lite Plugin (http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/) The images seem to be fading out completely before fading in, and I want them to fade in/out simultaneously. http://hardingandwhitlock.com/v6/content/background I have the sync option set to 1 $.fn.cycle.defaults = { timeout: 2000, speed: 200, next: null, prev: null, before: null, after: null, height: 'auto', sync: 1, fit: 0, pause: 0, delay: 0, slideExpr: null }; any help is much appreciated!
