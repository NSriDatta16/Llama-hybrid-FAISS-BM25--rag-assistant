How to implement SCORM in Objective-C

Do you know how to implement SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) in Objective C for eLearning content? Let me explain you what exactly I am looking for. I have one MCQ (multiple choice question) application which has 4 questions. On attempting each question I want my application to interact with a SCORM compatible server with result (whether the user has attempted correct one or not). The communication channel should be to and fro. May be at the end of the MCQ I want to show result which will come from the server with some calculations**(like Score : 85% number of attempts : 16 average score:16.7% etc.)**. How should I go about it? Please guide if you have already achieved it regards Ranjan.
