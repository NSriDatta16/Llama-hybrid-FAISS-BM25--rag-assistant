What's the name of data points that trained model gets on input in production?

I need some machine learning vocabulary advice. What do you call input data that a trained model gets in production? I know that labelled or unlabelled data it gets during training is called training set or training data . When it's ready, after initial training, you deploy it in production to solve real problems. How do you call the input data that the model receives at that point?
