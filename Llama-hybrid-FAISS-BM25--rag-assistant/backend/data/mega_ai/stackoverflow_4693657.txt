For both Haskell and Erlang, the open source implementation is the standard, most efficient available implementation available. There's no reason that Haskell shouldn't be performant enough for your needs -- for video stuff I assume you'll be using matrices and such. There are quality bindings available for BLAS & co for Haskell. I don't know of a great deal of existing video editing work, but Alberto Ruiz (the author of HMatrix) has done work with Haskell and computer vision: http://dis.um.es/profesores/alberto/research.html There's also a great deal of work on sound libraries and processing in Haskell.
