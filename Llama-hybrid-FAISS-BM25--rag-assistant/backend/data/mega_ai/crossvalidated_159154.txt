Dealing with nonstationarity and autocorrelation

Relationship between interest rates and retail sales. I have a time series sample of quarterly data for 10 years. My dependent variable is retail prices and independent variables are interest rates, wages, population, inflation, disposable income and consumer confidence index. The Durbin-Watson is 0.97. How do I deal with the autocorrelation?
