Your focus should be on detecting unusual and therefore by indirection the usual. Accountants summarize data and provide statistical descriptive analysis thus essentially "believing the data". Statisticians develop inferential tools that speak to challenging the data for consistency via hypothesis testing and predictive models. The models provide for the detection of consistency ( the signal/prediction ) and potential anomalies which may be useful to help discriminate between stores and/or line of business. These anomalies should be used to help carefully identify omitted variables/causes. The idea of looking for patterns for this is not new but rather underlies scientific reasoning. Performing aggregation or smoothing using any assumed model is at best descriptive. Objective statistical analysis ( meaning time series analysis in this case ) should be used to determine how to weigh the past for inferential purposes. It is well known that an ARIMA model is a super-set of simple assumed moving averages as it empirically finds the optimal number of weights to use and the optimal values of these weights rather than assuming (24) and a set of weights that are uniform (1/24). Allow the data to speak !
