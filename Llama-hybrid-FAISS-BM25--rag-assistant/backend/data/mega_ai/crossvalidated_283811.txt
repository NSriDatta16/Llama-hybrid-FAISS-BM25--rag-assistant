Logistic regression with ordinal independent variable: How to interpret odds-ratio?

Basically what the title says. I have run a logistic regression with an ordinal independent variable (scale from 1-7) and get an odds-ratio of 2. I am unsure of how I interpret this? Do I find the odds of being in the "yes category" of the binary dependent variable given that the independent variable is 1 and then report that it doubles with each increase in the independent variable?
