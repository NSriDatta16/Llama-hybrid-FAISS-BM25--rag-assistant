Python: Count lines and differentiate between them

I'm using an application that gives a timed output based on how many times something is done in a minute, and I wish to manually take the output (copy paste) and have my program, and I wish to count how many times each minute it is done. An example output is this: 13:48 An event happened. 13:48 Another event happened. 13:49 A new event happened. 13:49 A random event happened. 13:49 An event happened. So, the program would need to understand that 2 things happened at 13:48, and 3 at 13:49. I'm not sure how the information would be stored, but I need to average them after, to determine an average of how often it happens. Sorry for being so complicated!
