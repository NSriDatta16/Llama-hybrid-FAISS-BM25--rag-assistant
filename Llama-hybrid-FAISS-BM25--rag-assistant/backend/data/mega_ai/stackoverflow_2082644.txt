A one-line answer: M = D==repmat(max(D),size(D,1),1) or more elegantly: M = bsxfun(@eq, D, max(D)) Update: According to the comments, if you want to be on the safe side and catch the accidental non-unique maximums, add the following statement: M( cumsum(M)>1 ) = false which will ensure that in the case of multiple maximums, only the first to occur has a corresponding one in the output matrix (this is equivalent to the behavior of the max() function's returned index).
