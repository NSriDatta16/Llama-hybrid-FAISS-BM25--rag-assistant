I think the answer to this question can only be empirical. Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically. The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc. According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994. You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample: $$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$ where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births. Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is: $$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$ You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year: $$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$ So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change. Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries. UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so. UPDATE 2: What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust. Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri. UPDATE 3: Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates: $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$ $$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$ UPDATE 4: Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform. The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days.
