If those select fields and text fields combined work as maybe a widget, then it makes much sense to package them as such in a Class like you have already done. Then as Justin said, operations on these controls should be managed by your class, including keeping all fields synchronized. If there are enough such widgets to care about, then I'd consider separating the data part of it from the views. Maybe create an additional class that represents the data, and pass an object of that data class to the widget. But pragmatism always comes first.
