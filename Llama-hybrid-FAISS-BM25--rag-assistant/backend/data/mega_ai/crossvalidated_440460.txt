Bayesian random variables VS. MLE fixed variables

"Bayesian inference treats model parameters as random variables whereas frequentist inference considers them to be estimates of fixed, ‘true’ quantities." (Ellison 2004) What does it mean in the Bayesian methodology that parameters are random? And how does this differ from Maximum Likelihood estimation where they are fixed? Isabella Ghement's response in this thread is a good start, but I still don't completely understand the "randomness" of the parameters.
