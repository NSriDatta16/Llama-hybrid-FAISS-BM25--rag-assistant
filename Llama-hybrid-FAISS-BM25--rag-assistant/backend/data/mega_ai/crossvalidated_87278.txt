Finding the best linear model for each response variable in multivariate multiple regression using R

I don't know if a similar problem has been asked before so if it has been, please provide me a link to the related/duplicate questions. I am sorry if I seem to be asking too much. But I really like to learn this stuff and this seems to be a good place to start asking. I have been teaching myself statistics through self-study and I found Logan's Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R very helpful in that it shows how the actual computations are done (in R) and how the results are interpreted. I particularly like the part about multiple regression (Chapter 9). I use R since it is the most accessible (and free) software that I can get my hands into. Right now, I am trying to learn multivariate multiple regression. But unfortunately, I can't find a good resource. My specific problem is finding the best linear model for each response variable for the following morphometric data of a plant species (that some of my high school biology students are investigating), where Leaves , CorL , CorD , FilL , AntL , AntW , StaL , StiW , and HeiP are the response variables and pH , OM , P , K (nutrient variables), Elev , SoilTemp , and AirTemp (environment variables) are the independent variables. I don't know if it is okay to proceed as in the case of only one dependent variable, but I went through the steps of Example 9B of Logan anyhow. lily.csv Leaves,CorL,CorD,FilL,AntL,AntW,StaL,StiW,HeiP,Elev,pH,OM,P,K,SoilTemp,AirTemp 55,213.4,114.6,170.3,10.6,2.35,210,6.7,0.93,1431,6.37,1,3,170,29,26 44,192.15,95.25,160.6,7.1,2.25,176.4,6.55,0.79,1471,6.02,1,0,180,25,23 38,156.75,95.5,155.2,5.65,1.8,170.9,4.4,0.78,1471,6.02,1,0,180,25,23 29,191.8,88.35,155.2,10,2.5,178.25,5.9,0.75,1464,5.99,1,3,150,25,22 36,200.85,99.4,161.9,6.5,1.55,187.4,6.15,0.8,1464,5.99,1,3,150,25,22 43,210.2,74,147,7,1,170,5,0.8,1464,5.99,1,3,150,25,22 34,183.2,97.3,149.5,6.9,1.85,168.8,5.45,0.71,1464,5.99,1,3,150,25,22 52,233.3,107.7,179.6,9.2,3.05,210,6.45,0.82,1464,5.99,1,3,150,25,22 43,205.7,108.8,164.6,9.4,2,190.9,5.15,0.66,1464,5.99,1,3,150,25,22 28,203.15,119.35,160.6,8.9,2.3,180,6.85,0.77,1503,5.98,3,2,240,29.5,25.5 45,188.85,100.5,150.6,6.4,2.3,174.85,7.7,0.84,1503,5.98,3,2,240,29.5,25.5 49,205.2,126.85,150.8,10.1,2.8,177.5,9,0.84,1487,6.09,4,4,180,26,25 35,187.7,102.35,142.1,5.55,1.85,175.35,5.75,0.56,1485,6.17,3.5,1,220,24,23 23,181.05,94.6,136.6,6.9,1.8,169.3,5.8,0.59,1485,6.17,3.5,1,220,24,23 31,172.5,63.7,113.6,5.2,1.5,151.2,4.7,0.57,1482,6.29,5,2,280,24,23 34,190.5,93.1,151.9,5.65,1.85,172.5,5.25,0.68,1482,6.29,5,2,280,24,23 41,185.85,85.2,148.6,5.9,1.05,169.6,5.9,0.62,1472,6.48,0.5,3,170,25.22,22.89 29,195,159.2,159.3,15,4,185,6.3,0.59,1472,6.48,0.5,3,170,25.22,22.89 31,115.6,108.6,165.8,8.5,3,200.5,7.5,0.83,1454,5.53,5,14,350,25.22,22.89 27,176.65,93.1,128.65,6.65,2.85,180.5,6.65,0.53,1454,5.53,5,14,350,25.22,22.89 33,210,119,148,7,3,193,6,0.62,1454,5.53,5,14,350,25.22,22.89 42,200,93,166,18.3,4.55,177,8,1.12,1454,5.53,5,14,350,25.22,22.89 42,205,101.4,166.8,9,2.5,190,8.2,1.12,1454,5.53,5,14,350,25.22,22.89 25,192.9,94.15,147.8,6.45,2.3,167.65,7.15,0.61,1445,5.59,4,7,260,25.22,22.89 36,187.95,65.05,150.2,6.55,2.7,177.5,6.55,0.52,1445,5.59,4,7,260,25.22,22.89 32,110.4,11.6,168.15,7.6,2,197.95,7.85,0.73,1481,6.29,1.5,1,80,25.22,22.89 29,185,80,143,9,2,179,7.5,0.69,1481,6.29,1.5,1,80,25.22,22.89 29,179.8,70.6,134.8,11.15,3.2,165.65,5.3,0.6,1481,6.29,1.5,1,80,25.22,22.89 Firstly, I tried to investigate for possible collinearity among the variables. library(car) lily = read.csv("lily.csv",header=T) scatterplotMatrix(lily,diag="boxplot") FilL , AntL , AntW , and HeiP seem to be non-normal so I made log10 transformations.

And it seems to be a long way still to assessing the best multivariate model. In the case of the one dependent variable case, I can use the MuMIn package to automate the determination of the best fit but it doesn't work in the multiple response case. How do I proceed from this point? I will also appreciate it very much if you can point me to a good book or online material (preferably with applications in R).
