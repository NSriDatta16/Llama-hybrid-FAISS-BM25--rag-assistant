Should you transform data (not just normalizing) before training a NN?

Let's say I have stock price data. If I were to do linear regression, I would find transformations of the data that help performance. Should I perform comparable steps when training a neural network or is it redundant? I have generally have gone with my intuition that it will either improve performance or speed up training. For example, let us say I have stock prices, and earnings. If I were to perform some function between the two to create a third column of data that is some linear or non-linear combination of the two, assuming that this third column is meaningful, would this help the neural network? Thanks for any enlightenment. Also, this is not about normalization of data. This is pre-normalization.
