time series data modeling for deep learning

what is the best format to feed the input data, which are time series with varying density over time, to a deep learning network, while at any iteration we want to feed a batch of data including a historical background? Is it better to consider a constant size of data records or a constant time window including variable data record size? Or is there a better way?
