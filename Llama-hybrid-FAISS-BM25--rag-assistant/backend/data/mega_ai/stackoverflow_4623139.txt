If you are dumping data to your local machine, put the field type as timestamp. TIMESTAMP makes dates to be shown in local mysql server's time zone: TIMESTAMP values are converted from the current time zone to UTC for storage, and converted back from UTC to the current time zone for retrieval In general my suggestion is to set server time zone to GMT (specially if date field types are not TIMESTAMP) to avoid confusion between developers/over time.
