I am a consultant at Infragistics and I've been working exclusively the last few weeks with the Infragistics XamPivotGrid. We've been working to make this control fast and memory efficient. As a user and a developer, I am highly impressed with the usability of this control. You can check out this control in the WPF and the Silverlight NetAdvantage Data Visualization products at www.infragistics.com! :-)
