Which test or method can I use to assess trend in dependent proportions over time?

Let's assume there are 4 time points, t0 (baseline) ... t3 At each time point I assess a % of successes of some outcome: p0, p1...p3. The denominators vary over time, so the counts itself do not suffice: n1/N1, n2/N2... n3/N3. The data are repeated observations - the patients are assessed, so within-subject covariances have to be accounted for. I need to say, whether there is a monotonous trend in them, non-increasing or non-decreasing. Ideally I'd also interested in quadratic or other trends. I was proposed: the Cochran-Armitage test for trend in proportions. But this doesn't assume they are dependent, as far as I know. GEE or mixed-effect logistic regression. I could use the time as a continuous variable. The times are equal for all subjects, so it should work. This would tell me if there is a trend over time, either linear or other (it the variable is squared or cubed) I could use the time as it is - ordered categorical variable and use a set of contrasts for trends: linear, quadratic, cubed. Do you have any other recommendation for that? Or do you find any issues with the proposed solutions?
