I would interpret the contact coefficient as: Wines fermented in contact with grape skins had an odds ratio of 4.61 for being reported in a higher category of bitterness. My problem with the authors' interpretation is two fold: The use of jargon (OR(Y >= j)). The point of interpreting results is to get away from jargon. It's a bit ambiguous verging on wrong. By referring to a specific category $j$ it's not clear they mean all categories. The strength (and limitation) of the proportional odds model is that the resulting effect is averaged up over every possible threshold , and that's why we can use vague event description of "reporting a higher category" to describe exactly what the cumulative odds ratio considers to be an event. Having said that, when I've written papers employing cumulative link models, I've usually had to provide model predictions to make the results completely understandable to the lay audience. Sometimes the correct answer is to treat an ordinal outcome like a continuous response for the sake of easily understanding the output.
