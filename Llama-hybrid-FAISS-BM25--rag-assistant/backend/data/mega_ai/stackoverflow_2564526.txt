Is there any fast library(s) for finding human eyes and mouth in Flash? (Actionscript)

So I have real time video stream. With 1 (one) person on It . It Is Black and White, I need to be able to capture this persons eyes and mouth (direction (at least X,Y), state (at least opened or closed) ) So Is there any fast library(s) for finding human eyes and mouth in Flash in such case? (pure Actionscript or Haxe\Java\C++\C port in SWC form...) What do I know Is - some libs are described in this presentation http://www.bytearray.org/?p=1040&cpage=1#comment-330183 Grate example for eyes is here http://play.blog2t.net/files/black-or-white/ Source for Face detection (AS3) http://www.quasimondo.com/archives/000687.php#comments Way to find mouth and eyes http://web.media.mit.edu/~jackylee/attention.htm But I have never seen mouth detection...( Starting points are not what I need at all. I need some working Open-Source CODE examples and SWC librarys.=)
