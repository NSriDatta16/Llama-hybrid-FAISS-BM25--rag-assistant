Why vim doesn't work correctly into a telnet session?

I use vim (7.1) on OpenVMS V7.3-2. I connect to VMS trough a telnet session with SmartTerm, a terminal emulator. It works fine. But when I start a telnet session from a VMS session (connected via SmartTerm) to another VMS session, some keys doesn't work properly. |--------------| telnet |-------------| telnet |-----------------| | Smartterm | ------> | VMS, Vim OK | ------> | VMS, Vim broken | |--------------| |-------------| |-----------------| Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp and PageDown are like ~ in normal mode ( upcase to lowercase or vice-versa ) Any idea ? ============================================= Edit I just realized that I didn't mention that the second telneted session is on the same VMS box. I do that because I need to do something with rights from another user.
