The long access tokens are the session tokens, and are used for operations that require a logged-in user. The short access tokens (the ones returned from oauth/access_token?type=client_cred) can only be used for a limited set of operations. Searching of user names requires a session token. In order to do searching of user names, you'll need to use either the web flow (oauth/authorize) or, possibly, the desktop application flow (oauth/authorize?type=user_agent). Either one, however, will require the Facebook authentication dialog to come up. You might just let the user login -- oftentimes, the user is already logged into Facebook, so authorizing through Facebook isn't a big deal. (Oddly, even though name searches require a session token, the Facebook directory is publically available and can be crawled).
