I think you're looking for information on Digital Signal Processing . It can range from very simple to very hard to understand. If, say, your pre-event signal was 0, and every signal after the relevant signal was 1, you could just look for the first 1, figure out the time at which it occurred, and you'd be done. That's basically the limiting case of simplicity, and it might be a good place to start. Implement that, and you've got the beginnings of a sense of how to answer your question. Now, then, you've got noise. So, say, pre-event might range from -10 to 10, and post-event might range from 90 to 110. Still simple; watch for the first value greater than 10. But of course it's never that simple. You might have to average a window of readings, might look for some threshold of change from previous measurement, etc. In advanced cases, you could find yourself using transformations into other spaces, applying filters, pattern matching, and the like. But from your description, it sounds like reasonably simple methods should do the job for you. Don't get intimidated by concepts like FFT - you probably don't need them, yet. For now, at least, assume that it can be solved simply. Start with a trivially simple (but insufficient) solution, and work your way towards the solution that works.
