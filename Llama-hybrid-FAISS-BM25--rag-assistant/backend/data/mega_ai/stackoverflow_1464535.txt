Language detection is a pretty hard thing to do. Some languages are much easier to detect than others simply due to the diacritics and digraphs/trigraphs used. For example, double-acute accents are used almost exclusively in Hungarian. The dotless i ‘ı’, is used exclusively [I think] in Turkish, t-comma (not t-cedilla) is used only in Romanian, and the eszett ‘ß’ occurs only in German. Some digraphs, trigraphs and tetragraphs are also a good give-away. For example, you'll most likely find ‘eeuw’ and ‘ieuw’ primarily in Dutch, and ‘tsch’ and ‘dsch’ primarily in German etc. More giveaways would include common words or common prefixes/suffixes used in a particular language. Sometimes even the punctuation that is used can help determine a language (quote-style and use, etc). If such a library exists I would like to know about it, since I'm working on one myself.
