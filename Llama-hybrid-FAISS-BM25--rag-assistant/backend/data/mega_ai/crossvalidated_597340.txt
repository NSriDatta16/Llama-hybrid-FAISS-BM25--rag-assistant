Size of Final TestSet

is there a rule of thumb of how large the final test set has to be in Machine Learning? Assumed I have 1.000 images how many images do I ignore and use only in the final run? My proposal: Select randomly 150 Images and ignore it until the end. There are 850 images left I can use. With 5Fold-CV my test size is 170. So I have a similarly large test set in the final run as also in the CV. Is that a desirable ratio? Are there any papers that address this question? Thanks
