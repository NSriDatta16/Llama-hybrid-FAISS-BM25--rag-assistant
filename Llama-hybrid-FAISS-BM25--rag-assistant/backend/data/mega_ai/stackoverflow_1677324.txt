Compiling Bochs on Mac os x Snow Leopard

Was someone able to compile the Bochs simulator under Snow Leopard. Leopard worked fine for me but under Snow Leopard I get alot of problems related to the Carbon library... Ok, some more information was request. I compile with make on the shell; stanard build process coming with the bochs sources I was successfully able to compile against the 10.5 SDK. Unfortunatley, it was not running under Snow Leopard... always crashed then I installed the latest XCode from the SnowLeopard CD and compiled against the 10.6 SDK; withot changing nothing but the isysroot flag to point to the 10.6 instead of 10.5 now the compiler has problems to find some carbon headers... (-framework Carbon is included as a parameter to g++) Here the error... it fails when it comes to compiling the carbon-based gui for bochs: g++ -c -I.. -I./.. -I../iodev -I./../iodev -I../instrument/stubs -I./../instrument/stubs -pipe -O3 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -framework Carbon -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-functions -falign-loops=16 -falign-jumps=16 -falign-functions=16 -falign-labels=16 -falign-loops-max-skip=15 -falign-jumps-max-skip=15 -fprefetch-loop-arrays -fpascal-strings -fno-common -Wno-four-char-constants -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Dmacintosh -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGE_FILES carbon.cc -o carbon.o carbon.cc:154: warning: non-local variable ‘ last_screen_state’ uses anonymous type carbon.cc:154: warning: non-local variable ‘ screen_state’ uses anonymous type carbon.cc:163: error: ‘CIconHandle’ does not name a type carbon.cc: In function ‘OSStatus CEvtHandleWindowBackdropUpdate(OpaqueEventHandlerCallRef*, OpaqueEventRef*, void*)’: carbon.cc:278: error: ‘GetWindowPortBounds’ was not declared in this scope carbon.cc:279: error: ‘BackColor’ was not declared in this scope carbon.cc:280: error: ‘EraseRect’ was not declared in this scope ... many more undeclared xxx errors thanks in advance Mac
