How slow is too slow for unit tests?

Michael Feathers, in Working Effectively With Legacy Code , on pages 13-14 mentions: A unit test that takes 1/10th of a second to run is a slow unit test... If [unit tests] don't run fast, they aren't unit tests. I can understand why 1/10th a second is too slow if one has 30,000 tests, as it would take close to an hour to run. However, does this mean 1/11th of a second is any better? No, not really (as it's only 5 minutes faster). So a hard fast rule probably isn't perfect. Thus when considering how slow is too slow for a unit tests, perhaps I should rephrase the question. How long is too long for a developer to wait for the unit test suite to complete? To give an example of test speeds. Take a look at several MSTest unit test duration timings: 0.2637638 seconds 0.0589954 0.0272193 0.0209824 0.0199389 0.0088322 0.0033815 0.0028137 0.0027601 0.0008775 0.0008171 0.0007351 0.0007147 0.0005898 0.0004937 0.0004624 0.00045 0.0004397 0.0004385 0.0004376 0.0003329 The average for all 21 of these unit tests comes to 0.019785 seconds. Note the slowest test is due to it using Microsoft Moles to mock/isolate the file system. So with this example, if my unit test suite grows to 10,000 tests, it could take over 3 minutes to run.
