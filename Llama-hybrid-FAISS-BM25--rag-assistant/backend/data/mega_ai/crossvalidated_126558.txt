Kernel SVM on sparse data

I have a sparse dataset where a lot of the columns (features) contain mostly zero values. Class labels are multiple discrete categories (10 classes to be precise). I'm wondering if this should trouble classifying the dataset by learning an SVM with kernel (say RBF, polynomial, or linear)? And which kernel should cause trouble, which should not? Empirically, I fit an SVM with RBF kernel using R (package e1071) and it throws a lot of warnings and the prediction accuracy is very poor. I'm not sure if this is the problem with SVM and RBF kernel or something else.
