Yes. Some Warnings can be important. It's best practice to turn a compiler's warning level to the highest setting, and to try to eliminate all warnings. If a warning cannot be removed through refactoring code, and it has been checked and deemed safe, then many languages have 'pragmas' to silence the warning. Update circa 2014: It is increasingly common to turn on a complier option that treats all warnings as errors. I personally do this.
