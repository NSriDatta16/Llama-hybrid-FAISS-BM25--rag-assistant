Even though people speak about Bayesians and frequentists, as if statisticians are some sort of followers of a religion, most of statistics is very straightforward and pragmatic without bothering too much about philosophy. Because of that there aren't many famous books about philosophy of statistics written by statisticians. I would regard instead as important statisticians' books or articles such things like Fisher (1925) Statistical Methods for Research Workers Kolmogorov, (1950 English)(1933 German) Foundations of the theory of probability Cram√©r (1946) Mathematical Methods of Statistics When you search philosophy on this forum then you may encounter some pointers in threads such as Who Are The Bayesians? or Who are frequentists? and discussions about the likelihood principle. But not much of it is more insightful than the ' against the mathematicians ' written over two millennia ago.
