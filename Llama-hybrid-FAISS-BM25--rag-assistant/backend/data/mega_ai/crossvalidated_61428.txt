Testing change in variance over 5 time points and regression to the mean

I searched regarding change in variance over time, but everything I saw was about relatively long time series. I have a series of 5 time points, equally spaced, but with different people missing at each time point. There are about 15 variables I am interested in, all medical things like levels of glucose and blood pressure and so on. For modeling, I am using a multilevel model; but plotting the data shows that for some variables, the variance declines. Medically, this is a good thing. Several of the variables are bad if they are too low or too high. But how can I test this change in variance? And might this lead to a way of distinguishing the amount of change I am seeing from regression to the mean?
