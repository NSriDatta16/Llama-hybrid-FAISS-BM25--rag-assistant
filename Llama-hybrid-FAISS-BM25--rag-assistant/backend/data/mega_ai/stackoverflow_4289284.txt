I have been looking for a similar solution for a while and I found this resource http://www.bdunagan.com/2009/03/15/ibtool-localization-made-easy/ It quotes toward the end of the article: ibtool will look through MainMenu.xib for every user-visible string and insert that string with an associated ObjectID into MainMenu.strings, essentially a dictionary of strings keyed by ObjectID. Even better, the tool sorts them by ObjectID, so versioned .strings files are nicely diff’able. I can easily see what strings are added, removed, or just changed. Let me repeat this because it’s so incredibly handy: .strings files diff well! Of course, these .strings files are unicode, so they are not grep’able. Below is an example of the output for a string: Go ahead and take a look I really hope it helps you as much as it helped me!
