GAM not actually using categorical variables?

I am very new to GAMs, but I am trying to use gam() from the mgcv package to fit a logistic regression model using cubic splines. I'm hoping to predict Type based on my other varibles. The continuous variables seem to work fine in the model, but for some reason it seems to be skipping over (not actually using) my categorical (dummy) variables even after I've formatted them as factors (which I've read is a common problem). Here's an example of my data (saved as data1 ): Type precip temp dummy1 dummy2 Good 3.47 12.25 1 0 Good 8.64 11.10 0 1 Bad 10.08 15.67 0 0 Bad 1.34 14.03 0 1 And here's the code that I've tried: data1 $dummy1 dummy1) data1 $dummy2 dummy2) require(mgcv) modeltest It's my understanding that the dummy variables should be linear, so they don't need the s() that's used to smooth the continuous variables. Also, I believe the bs=cr is supposed to use cubic functions for the splines (although I think I might be missing information about the knots?). I think the family=binomial is supposed to use a logistic curve for predictions (but I'm not quite there yet) and that the method = "REML" is the method used to fit the smooths. When I run all this, it looks like it works at first glance, but it doesn't provide plots for the dummy variables when I run plot(modeltest, residuals =TRUE) which makes me think it hasn't actually used those variables? Is this true? If so, how would I correct the model? If not, how would I get the plots for the dummy variables?
