Interpreting interaction coefficients between continuous and categorical variables + interaction plot with confidence bands

I ran a between-subjects experiment in which 114 people evaluated 1 innovative idea, and I manipulated the source of the idea (IV1 = source; categorical: internal vs. external) to see if it affected the idea evaluation (DV). My main hypothesis is individuals with a high level of innovator role identification (IV2 = identity; continuous) will evaluate ideas in the external source condition lower. I ran an OLS in R and I got the following results: QUESTION 1: Do I interpret the coefficients correctly: Coefficient 1: 2.6938 1.4225 1.894 0.06090 .** The idea evaluation increases by 2.69 points on average when the source switches from internal to external, while the level of role identification equals 0 (OR is held constant??) Is this coefficient meaningful, as the level of role identification in a firm is never 0? **Coefficient 2: 0.8085 0.2425 3.334 0.00117 **** The idea evaluation increases by 0.8 points when the source is 0 = internal. **Coefficient 3: -0.7152 0.3395 -2.106 0.03744 *** With each one-unit increase in the level of innovator role identification, the idea evaluation decreases by 0.7 points on average when the source switches from internal to external. QUESTION 2: The confidence bands do not overlap at the higher values of identity. Can I say the difference may be significant?
