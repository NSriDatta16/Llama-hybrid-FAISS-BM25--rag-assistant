Here are a few ideas: Add some Windows performance counters, and use them to measure and report average timing data. You might also increment a counter only if the time measurement exceeds a certain threshold. and Use tracing combined with Failed Request Tracing to collect and report timing data. You can also trigger FRT reports only if page execution time exceeds a threshold. Write a unit test that uses the Windows OS clock to measure how long your code takes to execute. Add a flag to your code that you can turn on or off with a test page to enable or disable your regex code, to allow easy A/B testing. Use a load test tool like WCAT to see how many page requests per second you can process with and without the code enabled.
