If you aren't able to use .Net Framework 3.5 (required by Cristian's answer ) and therefore don't have access to the System.Func delegates then you'll need to define your own delegate. Add to the class member: private delegate bool CanRenderDelegate(Shape shape) The expectation becomes: Expect.Call(sqr.CanRender(null)) .IgnoreArguments() .Do((CanRenderDelegate) delegate(Agent x){return x.GetType() == typeof(Square);}) .Repeat.Any();
