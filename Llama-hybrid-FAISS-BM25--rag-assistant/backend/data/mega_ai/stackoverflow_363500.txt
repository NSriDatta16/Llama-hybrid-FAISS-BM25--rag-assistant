Check that the image file (jpg) you're writing to the tempStorage has the proper permissions for the webuser account(aspnet or iis_wpg). You can set the TempStorage directory to replace permisson entries on all child objects. Right Click TempStorage folder and select properties Select the security tab (ensure the proper read/write/modify permissons are here) Click the Advanced button Check the second checkbox - Replace permissions entries on all child objects with entries shown here that apply to child objects. Now all files that you add to the TempStoreage folder will inherit the permissions allowing you webuser account to read the jpg file.
