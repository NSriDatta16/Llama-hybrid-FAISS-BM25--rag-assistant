I am actually in the midst of performing my own meta-analysis on a separate topic. However, the problem is generally similar in that I want to aggregate associations across a number of reports. For the sake of simplifying this example, I am going to try to provide some additional context to this problem. Let's say you have 3 different tissues with ~25 correlations each for each pair of proteins you are interested in. So that is a total of 75 effect sizes. And for simplicity's sake, let's say that you are interested in just evaluating a single moderator for the time being (drug treatment A vs. drug treatment B). You would also need sample size (number of pixels that went into each correlation) and the variance term for each effect (which can be calculated using the formula here ). Armed with this information you can get a data set that looks something like this (I simulated this data for illustration purposes): > head(DF, n=10) r pixel var_r drug tissue 1 -0.06 480.4290 0.002070824 B kidney 2 0.19 545.2076 0.001707259 B kidney 3 -0.01 391.8333 0.002558124 B liver 4 0.29 582.2123 0.001443316 A lung 5 0.46 436.5935 0.001426960 B liver 6 0.29 543.9229 0.001545105 A kidney 7 0.14 638.7524 0.001507143 B lung 8 0.44 428.2363 0.001522064 A lung 9 0.39 332.3729 0.002169563 A lung 10 0.40 481.4496 0.001468625 A liver Next, I need to add a few binary predictors so I can include them in the final model. #Need to recode predictors - so that they are included as binary predictors... DF$drug_bin The resulting dataframe looks something like this now: > head(DF, n=10) r pixel var_r drug tissue drug_bin liver lung kidney 1 -0.06 480.4290 0.002070824 B kidney 0 0 0 1 2 0.19 545.2076 0.001707259 B kidney 0 0 0 1 3 -0.01 391.8333 0.002558124 B liver 0 1 0 0 4 0.29 582.2123 0.001443316 A lung 1 0 1 0 5 0.46 436.5935 0.001426960 B liver 0 1 0 0 6 0.29 543.9229 0.001545105 A kidney 1 0 0 1 7 0.14 638.7524 0.001507143 B lung 0 0 1 0 8 0.44 428.2363 0.001522064 A lung 1 0 1 0 9 0.39 332.3729 0.002169563 A lung 1 0 1 0 10 0.40 481.4496 0.001468625 A liver 1 1 0 0 Now using the metaSEM library in R, it is pretty straightfoward to perform this analysis. The model will address whether the correlation between the two proteins differs as a function of drug treatment, controlling for tissue type (not sure if that is a sufficient simplification of one of your aims, but let's roll with it for illustrative purposes) > fit summary(fit) Call: meta(y = r, v = var_r, x = cbind(drug_bin, liver, kidney), data = DF) 95% confidence intervals: z statistic approximation Coefficients: Estimate Std.Error lbound ubound z value Pr(>|z|) Intercept1 0.1291222 0.0383024 0.0540509 0.2041935 3.3711 0.0007486 *** Slope1_1 0.1127022 0.0389916 0.0362800 0.1891243 2.8904 0.0038473 ** Slope1_2 0.1060882 0.0454696 0.0169693 0.1952070 2.3332 0.0196395 * Slope1_3 -0.0650920 0.0480204 -0.1592103 0.0290263 -1.3555 0.1752565 Tau2_1_1 0.0258275 0.0044716 0.0170634 0.0345917 5.7759 7.652e-09 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Q statistic on the homogeneity of effect sizes: 1699.04 Degrees of freedom of the Q statistic: 74 P value of the Q statistic: 0 Explained variances (R2): y1 Tau2 (no predictor) 0.0342 Tau2 (with predictors) 0.0258 R2 0.2444 Number of studies (or clusters): 75 Number of observed statistics: 75 Number of estimated parameters: 5 Degrees of freedom: 70 -2 log likelihood: -56.98144 OpenMx status1: 0 ("0" or "1": The optimization is considered fine. Other values may indicate problems.) In this example, we are primarily concerned with the intercept, which is the average correlation between the two proteins when taking drug B (B was coded as 0 and A as 1 in the syntax above), and Slope_1, which is the difference in the average correlation between between drug A and drug B users. This model would suggest that on average, the correlation is higher for drug A users, controlling for tissue type. This is a more simplified version of what you were interested in, but hopefully it helps generate some ideas about approaches you could take.
