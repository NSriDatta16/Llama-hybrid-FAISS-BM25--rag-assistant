In IE 6/7/8: HTML inserted into (with jQuery) not conforming to set width of the

So I've got this markup: with this style (redundant, I know): #text-container {display:block: width:220px; height:280px;} #text-container p {display:block; width:220px; height:60px;} and this bit of jQuery plugging simple content into the paragraph: $("#text-container p").text(data); Works in Firefox. The text wraps and stays inside the set width of the paragraph. But not in any version of IE. In IE 7/8, the text continues horizontally out of the paragraph even though the paragraph itself adheres to the set dimensions. In IE 6, not only does the text spill out horizontally, but it stretches the paragraph with it. I've tried using .html instead of .text, but that didn't work. Not ideal. Did I mention not ideal? Does anyone know how to get around this? Thanks.
