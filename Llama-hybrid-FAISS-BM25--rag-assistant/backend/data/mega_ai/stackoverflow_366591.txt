Code is poetry. Start from this point of logic and you can derive many of the desirable qualities of code. Most importantly, observe that code is read far more than it is written, hence write code for the reader. Rewrite, rename, edit, and refactor for the reader. A follow on corollary: The reader will be you at time n from the code creation date. The payoff of writing code for the reader is a monotonically increasing function of n. A reader looking at your code for the first time is indicated by n == infinity. In other words, the larger the gap of time from when you wrote the code to when you revisit the code, the more you will appreciate your efforts to write for the reader. Also, anyone you hand your code off to will gain great benefit from code written with the reader as the foremost consideration. A second corollary: Code written without consideration for the reader can be unnecessarily difficult to understand or use. When the consideration for the reader drops below a certain threshold, the reader derives less value from the code than the value gained by rewriting the code. When this occurs the previous code is thrown away and, tragically, much work is repeated during the rewrite. A third corollary: Corollary two has been known to repeat itself multiple times in a vicious cycle of poorly documented code followed by forced rewrites.
