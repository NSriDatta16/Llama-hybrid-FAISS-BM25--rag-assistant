In addition to the other excellent answer: The question of equivalence between Bayesian (B-) sufficiency and Classical (F-sufficiency) is answered in the abstract by NOT . But, this is based on abstract measure-theoretic definitions, and proofs are technical using measure theory. But, counterexamples to equivalence are artificial, models constructed to be counterexamples, not to be useful. As long as your sample and parameter space are (measurable) subsets of some finite-dim euclidean space, there are no counterexamples. In short: F-sufficiency implies B-sufficiency, but not the other way. [D Blackwell][1] gives the artificial example. They refer to a proof of equivalence in the dominated case, all the probability measures in the hypothesis space are dominated by some common, sigma-finite measure. That covers most models. The proof, says this authors, "follows easily from the results of [Halmos and Savage][2]". Another interesting paper, [K. K.Roy and R. V. Ramamoorthi][3] is working towards finding conditions under witch B-sufficiency will imply F-sufficiency. The conditions are technical, measure-theoretic conditions on the sample and parameter space and their sigma-algebras (Proposed by D Blackwell). That paper studies a special case of that condition (spaces standard Borel, sigma-algebras countably generated. "Interest in countably generated sigma-fields stems from the fact that these are precisely the sigma-fields generated by Borel measurable real valued statistics."
