The simplest method of profiling is to record the time before the function and record it after, subtract the former from the latter. Repeat this several times and you will have a rough idea. There are interfering factors, like current CPU usage, that can affect the outcome though. The browser's console might help you here: console.time("test"); // ... js code here ... console.timeEnd("test"); //-> "test: 25ms" You may also be able to profile using your browser's developer tools. The other option is to let http://jsperf.com do the profiling for you. jsPerf runs your code repeatedly and gives you a nice comparison between your test cases. It also records the results for each browser (based on the user agent string), so you can quickly compare the code in different browsers.
