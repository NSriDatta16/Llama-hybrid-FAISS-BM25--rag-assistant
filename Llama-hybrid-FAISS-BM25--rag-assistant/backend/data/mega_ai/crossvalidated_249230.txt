The propensity score (PS) is a balancing score indicating the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. In a randomized controlled Trial (RCT) the PS is known. Estimation and application of PS therefore, mimic some of the particular characteristics of an RCT and therefore are method of choice to estimate the treatment effect in an observational study, provided that you have no unmeasured confounders and all subjects have a non-zero probability of receiving Treatment. You can estimate the PS using logistic regression or generalized boosting methods and therefore, include all observed (continous and categorical) baseline variables. Notably, you do not include the outcome parameter. (There is an ongoing debate, which variables to include, however, Austin postulates it is safe to include all observed baseline variables https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144483/ ). It is important to underscore that you do not aim to find the best "predictive model" but instead the model that balances your covariates best. After application of the PS using stratification, matching, inverse probability Treatment weights or covariate adjustment (all of them have pros and cons and are somewhat dependent on your data), you can test the treatment effect on your outcomes.
