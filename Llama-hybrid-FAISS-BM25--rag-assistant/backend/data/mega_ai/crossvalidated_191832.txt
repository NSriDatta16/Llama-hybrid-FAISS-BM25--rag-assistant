After the moving average, the regressor in your model becomes more persistent, i.e. having stronger serial correlations. The OLS estimate would still be asymptotically consistent, but the finite-sample bias likely becomes larger. You could run a simple simulation study to see the finite-sample bias. In finance, there is a literature on forecasting stock return with financial/macroeconomic variables. These variables are often highly persistent, similar to the problem you are facing. It might be useful for you to have a look at the finance studies that investigate the impact of highly persistent regressors, e.g. "Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics?" by Ferson etc, Journal of Finance, August 2003. Hope it helps.
