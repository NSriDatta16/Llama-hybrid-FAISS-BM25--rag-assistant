The question seems to be mixing two issues: Is using an MCMC approximation reliable? Is returning the average of the MCMC sample a good Bayesian estimate? Concerning point 1., MCMC may fail to converge to the posterior with a given number of iterations, in which case the resulting sample is not a reliable approximation to a sample from the posterior, no matter which summary is used. When the posterior is rather flat, convergence is actually faster and this should not be a major concern. Concerning point 2., assuming the Markov chain has reached stationarity (after a burnin step has been eliminated) and each term in the Markov chain is marginally distributed from the posterior, the MCMC sample can mostly be used as any other Monte Carlo sample. The average of the sample is thus an approximation of the posterior expectation. When the posterior has a large variance, this is presumably an estimator with a large variance but the "exact" posterior expectation would similarly have a large variance. Using a more robust loss function would then be recommended, but this has nothing to do with MCMC. As a general point, Bayesian inference is not concentrating on returning point estimates but instead full distributions with an included assessment of uncertainty/variability.
