Bayesian probability of negative COVID-19 test

Suppose if the person is infected, the test will be positive with a probability of 70%. The probability that a healthy person gets a negative test is 99.5%. The prior probability of being infected is 0.1%. What is the probability that someone is infected after they have gotten a negative test result, given the test parameters above? My idea would be: $Pr(inf|neg)=\frac{Pr(neg|inf)Pr(inf)}{Pr(neg)}= \frac{0.3\times0.001}{0.3\times0.001+0.995\times0.999}=0.0003$ But can we write the same if it asks to express the posterior probability of being infected after a negative test result as a function of the testâ€™s sensitivity (i.e. how reliable it is at avoiding false negatives) and as a function of the prior infection probability. So: $Pr(inf|neg)=\frac{Pr(neg|inf)Pr(inf)}{Pr(neg)}= \frac{Pr(neg|inf)}{Pr(neg)}Pr(inf)?$
