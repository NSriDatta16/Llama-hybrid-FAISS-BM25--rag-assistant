What about canonical correlation analysis (CCA) ? CCA takes two sets of variables, one called the DVs and one called the IVs. It then identifies two canonical variables/variates, one for each set, which correlate at maximum. I like to think of these canonical variables as factors similar to FA/PCA, although the analogy does not strictly hold. You can then identify specific IVs and DVs which "load" high on their respective canonical variable. Depending on the canonical correlation and on the weights of the individual variables, you have identified two similar sets of variables. Of course, a second (third, ...) pair of canonical variables can be found up to $min\{k_{IV},k_{DV}\}$. Note that CCA reduces to simple regression if you have only one DV. I think pretty much every statistical software has it, but I don't know about the performance of CCA with 1000s of variables.
