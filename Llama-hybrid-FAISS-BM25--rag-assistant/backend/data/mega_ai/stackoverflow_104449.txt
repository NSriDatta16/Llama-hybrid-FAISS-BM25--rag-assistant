For large strings, you're pretty much stuck with the memory window - the tooltip would truncate eventually. Fortunately, the memory window is easy to get data from - I tend to show it in 8-byte chunks so its easy to manage, find your string data and cut&paste the lot into a blank window, then use alt+drag to select columns and delete the hex values. Then start at the bottom of the string and continually page up/delete (the newline) to build your string (I use a macro for that bit). I don't think there's any better way once you get long strings.
