You don't need to reduce your data set. Instead, you probably need to improve your implementation. One-dimensional data should not be handled with the average clustering techniques. Because these techniques were designed for multivariate data. One-dimensional data is special. It can be sorted consistently in $O(n \log n)$, and then you can use various algorithms in $O(n)$ time. A naive implementation of e.g. hierarchical ("agglomerative") clustering is $O(n^3)$ and that will of course kill you with large data. By any means avoid distance matrixes . They kill scalability. Sort your data Improve your algorithm to exploit this. You may also want to look at classic statistical approaches for this problem, such as kernel density estimation . Consider using local density maxima as clusters.
