Monotouch iPad project help landscape and more

a designer here, coding newb. I just created a mockup in photoshop, (a dashboard that shows graphs, with fancy sliders, drag drop, modal box) and want to make a prototype in monotouch, especially with the interface builder, but i got a problem with the screen orientation. i want to force it to landscape mode. I created a ViewController and place a ImageViewer inside in with the background and set it to landscape mode, but it still is portrait mode, even if it's forced to landscape mode. Also used the code public override bool ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation (UIInterfaceOrientation toInterfaceOrientation) { return ((toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientation.LandscapeLeft) || (toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientation.LandscapeRight)); } How would you start this project if you're looking at the mockup images? For me as a designer i want to add a background as main viewer and all the other boxes as subviewers in the interface builder so that a developer can code, but i'm kinda stuck with the forced landscape and i'm not sure how to proceed with the subviewers connecting with the main view, and if pressed on a subviewer a modal box will appear. I have added screenshots of the mockup and the files. Screenshot , downloading link
