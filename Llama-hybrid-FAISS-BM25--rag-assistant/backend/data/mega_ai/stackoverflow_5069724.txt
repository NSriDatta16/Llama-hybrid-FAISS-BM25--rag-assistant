Okay, based on the stack it looks like you're causing the VirtualizingStackPanel to access a list out of bounds. Could be a bug in the framework, but more likely you're doing something that it isn't expecting. Are you manually (programmatically) adding and removing things to the panel? Are you doing things when you detect scrolling? Look at how you're manipulating the StackPanel on that page. Also, they people suggesting that you're double-navigating seem to be wrong based on this new information as well as the content of the exception message. I originally thought that was the problem when I saw your title, so I understand where they're coming from, but the exception in that case is something like "Fragments are not supported". Which clearly isn't the case here.
