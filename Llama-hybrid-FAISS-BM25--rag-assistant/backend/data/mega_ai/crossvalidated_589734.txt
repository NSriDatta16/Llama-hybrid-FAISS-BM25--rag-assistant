In glm function if the family=binomial is chosen, then link function must be logit like L3 otherwise it will throw error. If link=linear is chosen then it is assuming a linear model and the purpose of Logistic Regression is lost. Secondly, if the logistic regression is implemented from scratch then either Frequentist way is to be adopted in which IRLS i.e. Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm is the most popular one or if Bayesian is adopted then there are two routes either by pure MH sampling or MH sampling within Gibbs approach can be adopted.
