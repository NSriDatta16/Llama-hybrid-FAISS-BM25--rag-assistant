lve algebraic equations. In 1912, he built an automaton for playing chess endgames, El Ajedrecista, which has been considered the first computer game in history. He also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic to computers for the first time. José García Santesmases (1907–1989) built the first analog computer and the first Spanish-made microprocessor. In 1967 he launched the Factor-P, the first computer manufactured in Spain. In 2016 and 2017 BQ became the third best-selling smartphone brand in Spain, with phones designed in the country. Towards the end of the 1990s and early 2000s several companies manufactured laptops in Spain, most notably Airis and Inves. By 2021, Primux, Slimbook, Vant and Mountain already designed and assembled their computers in Spain. Between 1987 and 2009 there was a large microchip factory in Tres Cantos, but it closed due to the difficulty of competing with the Asian market. Currently there are Spanish companies with microchip production capacity on a smaller scale, but which also have design capacity, such as Televés, a pioneer in Europe in the use of DIE electronic components (electronic components without encapsulation) and which also has the capacity to manufacture MMIC circuits, Ikor, and Anafocus, dedicated to the manufacture of CMOS image sensors. Software Between 1983 and 1992, Spain became one of the largest producers of video games, in what is called the golden age of the Spanish video game. Today FX Interactive, heir of Dinamic Software, is among the most prominent companies. Internet At the end of the 1990s IRC-Hispano was the reference as a social community in the Hispanic world. Other software companies that have achieved great repercussion are the search engine Olé, Terra Networks or Tuenti. Today, Wallapop, Fotocasa, Cabify and Rakuten TV stand out. Space The evolution of astronomical navigation, thanks to the contributions of astronomers such as Alonso de Santa Cruz, Juan Arias de Loyola and Jorge Juan y Santacilia was also key to Spain's preponderance in the oceans. Since 1968 the National Institute for Aerospace Technology has concatenated scientific satellite programs, starting with the Intasat Program, continuing with the Minisat program which was a qualitative leap in the 90's, and continuing up to the current Small Satellite Constellation Program. Many of the instruments used in space missions to Mars and asteroids are developed at the Astrobiology Center (CAB). Among the major contributors in the space area are Emilio Herrera, inventor of the stratonautical space suit, predecessor of the space suit; Enrique Trillas, promoter of space science programs; and Pedro Duque, the first Spanish astronaut.
