How would I make a clickable button using the 'real image'

I have not found an question like this in a few days so I thought I would post it here... So say I have a picture of a snowflake, I would usually drag in a uibutton and set to custom and add the image in but I do not want that because it will make a square border around the image and I want the button itself to be the image. So the border of the image would be the outermost part of the button and nothing more. How would I go upon doing this?
