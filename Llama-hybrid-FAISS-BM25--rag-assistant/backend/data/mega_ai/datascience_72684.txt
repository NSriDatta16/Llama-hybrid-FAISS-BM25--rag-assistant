F1 'micro' - the micro weighs each sample equally class 1 accounted for 40% of the data, F1 for this class is 0.8 class 2 accounted for 60% of the data, F1 for this class is 0.2 0.8 x 40% + 0.2 x 60% = 0.44 F1 'macro' - the macro weighs each class equally class 1: the F1 result = 0.8 for class 1 F1 result = 0.2 for class 2. We do the usual arthmetic average: (0.8 + 0.2) / 2 = 0.5 It would be the same no matter how the samples are split between two classes. The choice depends on what you want to achieve. If you're worried about class imbalances, I'd suggest using a 'macro'.
