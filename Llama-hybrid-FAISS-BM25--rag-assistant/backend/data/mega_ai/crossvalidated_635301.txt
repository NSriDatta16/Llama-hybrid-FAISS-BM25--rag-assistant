Because of the Replication Crisis in the early 2000s and other issues related to scientific discovery, the need for documenting steps taken in studies has increased. As a consequence, scientists have promoted the idea of pre-registration, which is the idea that one should explicitly outline the hypotheses, methods, sampling, analytic design, and other relevant information about a study before it is actually conducted. This is usually done online through portals like the Open Science Framework or other related organizations. To learn more about pre-registration, one can read more here.
