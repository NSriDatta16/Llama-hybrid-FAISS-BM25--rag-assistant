I would recommend Linear Algebra and Learning from Data by Gilbert Strang as a nice introduction for someone with an undergrad math background. It's not particularly wide in scope and contains some probably unnecessary summaries of linear algebra (insightful nonetheless) and probability (very basic), but the portions on data are nice introductions. You can see some sample chapters at https://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/
