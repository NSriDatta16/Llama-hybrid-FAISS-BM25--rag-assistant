ARIMA parameter estimation from scratch

I am implementing ARIMA from scratch, and I am trying to understand how to estimate the parameters by the MLE + innovations algorithm approach. The likelihood is given by (as in Shumway and Stoffer: Time Series Analysis and Its applications) \begin{equation} L(\beta, \sigma_w^2) = (2\pi\sigma_w^2)^{-n/2} (r_1(\beta) \cdots r_n(\beta))^{-1/2} \operatorname{exp}\left(\frac{-S(\beta)}{2\sigma_w^2}\right) \end{equation} with \begin{equation} S(\beta) =\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{(x_t-x_t^{t-1}(\beta))^2}{r_t(\beta)} \end{equation} and where $r_{t+1}=(1-\phi_{tt}^2)r_t$ with $r_1 =\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\Psi_j^2$ . I understand that I must approximate $\beta$ and $\sigma_w$ numerically, and that finding $r_i$ is done through the innovations algorithm, but how is the $r_1$ found? In the textbook they give examples of AR(1) processes where an expression for $r_1$ is easily established, but what of a general ARMA(p,q) process?
