What priors are typically used for the correlation parameter in a bivariate normal?

The Bivariate normal distribution contains a correlation parameter. I want to implement an MCMC sampler to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the bivariate normal distribution. I have already selected the priors for the mean and variance parameters. However, I was not sure how to choose the prior for $\rho\in(-1,1)$ , the correlation parameter. Are there any standard choices such as the Jeffreys prior or other noninformative priors? If so, what are they?
