SCM with locks vs. concurrent merges and team size

What is the ideal number of programmers for lock based SCM not to become a severe issue in development? Edit: Fundamentally, I am not asking if there are merits to locking or merging (that is an unresolvable flame war). I am asking for the number of programmers where locking becomes a serious problem. I myself have found 4 to a good number, but this assumes the following most everybody works in the same office within yelling distance work is mostly disjoint (which makes locking not an issue except for common files {side note: my experiences is that merging is the best when there are little to no common files to accomplish tasks, which could be a series of questions on how does one organize code to such that common files are not needed by more than one person). the build can't be broken by premature lock release/commit.
