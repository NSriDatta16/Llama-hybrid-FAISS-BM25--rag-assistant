How do I include a self-reference to a server control in an external method call?

I have an Asp.Net TextBox control whose enabled property I need to evaluate using a separate (from the code-behind of the containing page) class. The way I want to do this is: " ... /> The reason I need to pass a reference to the calling control is to see if there are other properties I may need to consider before disabling it. The 'this' keyword, however, refers to the page as a whole. And since my TextBox can be within a FormView, or GridView, I can't easily just get the control by examining 'page.myTB'. I don't want to have to start ploughing through GridViews on the receiving class file just to retrieve a reference to the TextBox. Does anyone know how to refer to the control inline in this way? EDIT 1: This will need to be done to several different types of server control, such as ListBox, CheckBox, RadioButtonList, etc. EDIT 2: The best I've come up with so far is: " which isn't too elegant, but it does give me that auto-reference that I need.
