The no-free lunch theorems suggest there is no classifier that is a priori superior to any other, and the choice of classifier depends on the nature of the particular data set. I wouldn't cmomit myself to a choice of classifier and would instead evaluate several methods. The classes are only mildly imbalanced, so I suspect that shouldn't be a key factor in the decision of which classifier to use. A more important question would be whether you wanted a simple discrete classification, or whether you wanted estimates of the probabilities of class membership, for examples because you have unknown or variable mis-classification costs, or relative class frequencies, or if it would be beneficial to have a "reject" option. In that case the SVM is not a good choice as it is designed for discrete classification, and rather than post-processing the output to get probabilities it is better to use a method that was designed to provide a probabilistic output in the first place, such as kernel logistic regression.
