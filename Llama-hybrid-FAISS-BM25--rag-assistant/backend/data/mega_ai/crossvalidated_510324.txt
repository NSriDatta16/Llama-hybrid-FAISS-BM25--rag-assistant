Comparing emmeans posteriors from a Bayesian linear mixed effects model

I've come quite a long way with Bayesian (G)LMMs recently, but sometimes there are things you can't quite google. Fortunately, someone was very kind to integrate emmeans with brms (a package for easy conversion of classic (g)lm(er) R syntax to apply to Bayesian models of the same kind). This makes much of my work much easier in this arena. My question is probably more methodological than implementational. Assume I have a fairly simple Bayesian linear model, setup with the formula error ~ condition*round . Assume error is continuous, and condition has two levels (group A and group B) and round has two levels (pre-training and post-training). If I draw posteriors for the estimated marginal means (EMMs) over the combination of condition and round , is it then appropriate to perform further comparison between these distributions? So assume my analyses thus far suggest there's an interaction where group A improves from pre- to post-training, but group B does not. Is it appropriate in this case to quantify a difference distribution, comparing the group A pre-training EMM posterior minus the group A post-training EMM posterior, and the same comparison for group B? Is it further appropriate to quantify the extent to which these difference distributions might differ from a null value, for example using a ROPE around that null? Such an analysis seems straightforward to me, and, in computing this analysis, the results agree with other analyses (e.g. the results generally accord with simply calculating the overlap coefficient between group A pre-training and group A post-training EMMs, but I want something a bit more quantitative than just the overlap coefficient). I just am not quite well-versed enough in some of these Bayesian methods to know if I'm secretly violating some assumptions about this model or these quantification techniques.
