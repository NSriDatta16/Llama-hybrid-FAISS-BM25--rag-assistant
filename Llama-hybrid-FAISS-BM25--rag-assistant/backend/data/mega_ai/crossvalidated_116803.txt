Check how you are coding race in your model. It looks like you have five values for race and are treating them as a continious variable. That probably isn't what you want. You may want to recode gender, fam_support, etc to 0 and 1 (dummy code) to make your coefficients more interpretable. For that matter, you may want to mean center a number of your variables. It seems likely that num_arr is not normally distributed or you have an outlier (max 62). You might want to look at that data more carefully. In a similar vein, plot everything to sanity check your data. Your leverage plot seems to suggest a number of data points of concern... look at those more carefully and maybe also consider Cooks D or DFFITs. Make sure your data is actually independent. What is the _cons variable, it didn't show up until your regression model results. Your outcomes are restricted in range between 0 and 1, it may make sense to use a link function (even though it probably won't change things all that much).
