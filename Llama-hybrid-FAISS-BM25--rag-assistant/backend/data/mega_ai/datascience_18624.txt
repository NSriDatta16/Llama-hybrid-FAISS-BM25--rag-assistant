If you have time series for good clients and time series for bad clients, I would suggest using something along the lines of dynamic time warping to get out of a time domain, and into a dissimilarity domain. From there you could just use just about any classifier that you can think of, I have a silly sort of toy example that detects whether or not it is a superbowl sunday based on traffic to a website. https://github.com/Rblivingstone/SuperBowl . But the nice thing is that now that you are in dissimilarity space you can classify based on a few exemplars, say two or three columns in dissimilarity matrix, and feed that into your classifier. It should be relatively easy to implement for your particular use case.
