htaccess rewriterule

I currently have this rule where I want the page to just render my static content. RewriteRule ^videos\/coverage\/view\/236159\-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+) http: //website.com/static/236159.html [NC] However, this doesn't work. It works with a L tag but then the URL is different: RewriteRule ^videos\/coverage\/view\/236159\-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+) http: //website.com/static/236159.html [L, NC] My goal is to keep the URL the same but the content different. Can anyone point out to what flags are needed in order to get this working properly? Thanks!
