To me, your hypothesis sounds like an interaction effect of the two factors "version" (of questionnaire) and "sex" (of participant). As the data are dependent / repeated measures, this should be taken into account by means of a multilevel aka hierachical aka mixed model. Instead of a linear model, you should use something like a logit link (cf. logistic regression) for your binary DV. Suppose your data are in long format, i. e., two rows for every participant, the first for the old version, the second for the new version. The DV is experience of crime 0/1. Data for 3 participants could like this: id sex version DV [1,] 1 1 0 1 [2,] 1 1 1 0 [3,] 2 0 0 1 [4,] 2 0 1 1 [5,] 3 0 0 1 [6,] 3 0 1 0 According to your hypothesis, you predict a cross-level interaction between the level 1-predictor "version" and the level 2-predictor "sex" (in ANOVA / repeated measures terms, this is an interaction between a within- and a between-factor). If you code your variables like this sex: female=1, male=0; version: old=1, new=0, then you probably predict a positive beta of the interaction and you could test this one-sided. Code in R using the package lme4 could look like this (could be done with any multilevel software): m1 HTH
