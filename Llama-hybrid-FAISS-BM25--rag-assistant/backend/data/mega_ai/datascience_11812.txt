One-class classifier for time series data classification

My problem is different from the common time series data problem. What I need to do is check if future time series data is in accord with previous time series data I already consider to be correct. In short, I need a one-class classifier applied to time series data, which have variable length (going from 110 to 125 points). Does anyone know any lib that might help me with this task? I usually use Python+scikit-learn, but I'm open to use any other configuration.
