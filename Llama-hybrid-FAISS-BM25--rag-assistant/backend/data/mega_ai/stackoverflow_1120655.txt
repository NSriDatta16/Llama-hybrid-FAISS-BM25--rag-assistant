Linq to Xml and creating elements

I have a string array: string[] authors = new string[3]; authors[0] = "Charles Dickens"; authors[1] = "Robert Jordan"; authors[2] = "Robert Ludlum"; I am using Linq to XML to read and write XML to a given XML file, but I cannot figure out how to use the XElement class to create XML that represents my authors array. I know it's something along the lines of XElement xEle = new XElement("Authors", from a in authors select new XElement("Authors", ???????
