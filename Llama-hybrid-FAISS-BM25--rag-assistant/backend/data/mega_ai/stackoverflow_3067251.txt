The BlueDragon family is an alternative CFML engine, that runs on Java, .NET and Google's App Engine. It comes in many different flavours, including commercial and open source versions. The commercial versions are maintained by New Atlanta. The open source version is a completely separate build, maintained by members of the community. The majority of the development is performed by aw2.0 http://www.aw20.co.uk/ and is released under a GPLv3 license, with an exception that lets you bundle the engine without you having to GPL your CFML code. The vast majority of CFML applications will run unchanged under BlueDragon and OpenBD. BlueDragon has been on the scene for over 10 years and has spearheaded many new functions and tags that have since been adopted by other CFML engines (CFDUMP, CFIMAP, CFTHREAD, CFINTERFACE for example).

Well basically, the ability to ship your solutions in one of the worlds richest languages, without incurring any license costs to you or your client.
