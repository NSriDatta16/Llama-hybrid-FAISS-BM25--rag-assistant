HTML5 applicationCache vs Browser Cache

With current applicationCache implemented in browsers, my appcache manifest file changes the version number which then triggers the applicationCache update event which forces browser to download fresh resources mentioned in the manifest files from the server. Let's say I have configured far future expiry headers on those resources. Will those files still be downloaded? Or will be read from browser cache itself? We implement a versioning based logic to invalidate browser caches (chaging the file name itself). I am wondering, with appcache in place, do we need a hybrid of versioning + applicationCache?
