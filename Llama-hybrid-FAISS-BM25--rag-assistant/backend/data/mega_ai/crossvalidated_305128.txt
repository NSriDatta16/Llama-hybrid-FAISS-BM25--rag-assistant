The short answer is no . For example, if you try linear model with MNIST data, you will still get ~90% of the accuracy! A long answer would be "depending on the domain", but linear model is widely used. In certain fields, say, medical study, it is super expensive to get one data point. And the analysis work is still similar to many years ago: linear regression is still plays an very important role. In morden machine learning, say, text classification, linear model is still very important, although there are other fancier models. This is because linear model is very "stable", it will have less like to over fit the data. Finally, linear model is really the building blocks for most of the other models. Learning in well will benefit you in the future.
