Is a new reference data put on the stack at each loop iteration (thus preventing garbage collection of the object data references), or is the reference reused in each iteration? I think your "main" question about re-use has been adequately answered but the parenthetical is extremely important. Your assumption that this prevents garbage collection is wrong . If the garbage collector detects that the only reference to "data" is the stack slot and that no one is ever going to read from it again then the garbage collector is allowed to reclaim the storage even with the reference on the stack . This could be bad if the thing consuming the stack slot is unmanaged code that the GC doesn't know about. If you need to keep something alive by holding onto it on the stack then you need to add a KeepAlive to the method .
