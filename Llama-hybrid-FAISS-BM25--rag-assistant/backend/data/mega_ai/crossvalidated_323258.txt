Thanks for your edit, your question makes more sense now. First thing to notice is that the sigmoid function is actually the inverse of the logit function. And thus you can rewrite this as $$\text{logit}(h(x)) = r\sin(x\beta)$$ Which looks almost like a logistic regression GLM. However, this is a nonlinear model, since the $\beta$ is inside the trig function. Solving this would involve a home-made MLE method. An interesting route to go would be to expand this by its Taylor expansion and simply perform a logistic regression.
