Sizers are used just to organize widgets spatially, as a matter of a fact they are 'invisible'. I think you're on the right track with putting a panel inside each cell and turning on it's borders. Try adding it with wx.EXPAND flag, it has a chance to help. Concerning documentation: wxPython is essentially a wrapper (well, with few extras) for the wxWidgets C++ library, so virtually everything you need can be found in wxwidgets documentation. I find this documentation browser useful. And here are some notes on interpreting C++ documentation for wxPython users, but usually everything is obvious enough. Also for borders you might be interested in wx.StaticBox or wx.StaticBoxSizer (that etched-line box around a group of controls, often with a label)
