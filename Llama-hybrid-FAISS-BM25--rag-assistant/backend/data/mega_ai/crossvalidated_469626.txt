User queries and neural embeddings for Recommendations

Google's Machine Learning Course includes a section on Recommender systems with Deep Neural Networks . In this architecture (diagram below) $X$ is meant to represent what they call a user query , which is transformed by hidden layers into a user embedding $\Psi(X)$ . This user embedding then goes through a SoftMax layer with weights $V$ where each $V_j$ vector is presumably learned and represents the embedding of an item j . Is this based on any particular paper/s? How are user queries supposed to be built / encoded? Would it be e.g. one-hot encoding? How exactly would one add user features to it? (just a concatenation on the query vector?)
