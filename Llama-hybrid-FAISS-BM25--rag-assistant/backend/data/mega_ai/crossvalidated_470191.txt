Your data lie on the 7-torus $T^7.$ It has many geometries, but two natural ones in this application would be based on the function $$\delta(a) = \left(|a| + \pi \mod 2\pi\right) - \pi$$ with values in the interval $[-\pi, \pi).$ This is the unsigned value of the oriented angle $a.$ Where all variables are considered approximately of equal weight in the analysis, for the distance between two vectors $\mathrm{x}=(x_1, \ldots, x_7)$ and $\mathrm{y}=(y_1,\ldots, y_7)$ use a function of the vector $$\delta(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}) = (\delta(x_1-y_1), \ldots, \delta(x_7-y_7)),$$ such as its $L_p$ norm for $p \ge 1.$ You can weight this norm by multiplying the components by positive weights $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_7$ before computing the norm. These are all valid metrics: they are symmetric and satisfy the triangle inequality. One way to prove this follows your suggestion: these metrics can be expressed in terms of metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{14}$ induced by the embedding $\phi:T^7\to \mathbb{R}^{14}$ given by $$\phi(\mathrm{x}) = (\cos(x_1), \sin(x_1), \cos(x_2), \ldots, \sin(x_7)).$$ However, you don't need actually to compute this embedding in order to compute $\delta,$ as you can see from its initial formula.
