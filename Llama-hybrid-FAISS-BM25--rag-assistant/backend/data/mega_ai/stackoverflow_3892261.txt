How to auto-select next row after deleting current row by core data context?

I am using Core Data to manage objects and using a NSTableView to display those objects. The table columns are binded to objects' properties through a NSArrayController . When users click the delete button, all selected objects in the NSTableView will be deleted. Then only remained objects are left in the NSTableView . This works smoothly. But after deleting selected rows, NSTableView does not select a row automatically. As a result, users have to type once arrow key or use mouse to select a new row. So my question is: how could I make NSTableView select the next or previous row after selected rows are deleted? Of course, I could just select a left row programmatically after deleting. But I am wondering whether there is a more elegant way to achieve this. Thanks
