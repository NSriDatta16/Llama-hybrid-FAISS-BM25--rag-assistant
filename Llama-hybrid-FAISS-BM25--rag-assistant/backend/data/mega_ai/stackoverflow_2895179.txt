You could use an 'institution' or 'organisation' lookup table, with a structure something like InstitutionId[PK], InstitutionType, LookupKey where LookupKey is the PK to either Company or College. Or, InstitutionId[PK], CompanyId[FK], CollegeId[FK] In both cases you link from user to institution, then onto Company and/or College. I personally prefer the second option, because it allows you to easily validate the FK relationship and also allows (if applicable) for a user to be a member of a company and/or a college.
