Which Android phone to use for development...?

I'm planning to port a couple of games from iPhone/Windows Mobile to the Android platform. The games are written in C++ so I plan to use the NDK with a thin java wrapper. I'm new to the Android platform and need some advice on which phone to buy for development. I suspect like Windows Mobile there is a level of fragmentation with different phones supporting different features (keyboard/ rotation/ screen size/ capacitive touch screen/ etc). What are the best device(s) for development on the Android platform...? They also have to be available in the UK/Europe. Thank you in advance. Nikos.
