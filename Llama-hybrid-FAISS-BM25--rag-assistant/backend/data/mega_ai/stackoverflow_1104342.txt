I would use a string tokenizer to split the string into words much like this: $string = "Stack Overflow is as frictionless and painless to use as we could make it."; $tokenized_string = strtok($string, " "); Then you can pull out the individual words any way you want. Edit: Greg has a much better and more elegant way of doing what you want. I would go with his wordwrap() solution.
