The entirety of the Wikipedia paragraph you quoted is (bolding added by me): The numerator corresponds to the likelihood of an observed outcome under the null hypothesis. The denominator corresponds to the maximum likelihood of an observed outcome, varying parameters over the whole parameter space. The numerator of this ratio is less than the denominator ; so, the likelihood ratio is between 0 and 1. Low values of the likelihood ratio mean that the observed result was much less likely to occur under the null hypothesis as compared to the alternative. High values of the statistic mean that the observed outcome was nearly as likely to occur under the null hypothesis as the alternative, and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The point to understand about likelihood ratio tests is the statement in bold. The null hypothesis will always have a lower likelihood than the alternative. The likelihood ratio will always be less than (or equal to) 1, and the smaller it is the better the alternative is at fitting the data. The reason the null model gives smaller likelihood is that it is a restricted model. It typically sets some parameters to zero. The alternative model is free to vary the restricted parameters in order to increase the likelihood of the data under the model, so the alternative model will always have higher (or at least as high) likelihood than the null hypothesis. The greater the likelihood increase under the alternative, the smaller the likelihood ratio.
