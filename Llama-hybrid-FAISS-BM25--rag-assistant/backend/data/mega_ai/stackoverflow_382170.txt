There is no data bound to any of the controls in the form (except for the dataProvider for the ComboBox). If you want to extract the data from the form with minimal modifications, assign an "id" property to each control and the access them programmatically from ActionScript: var obj : MyObject = new MyObject(); obj.beginDate = beginDate.selectedDate; obj.endDate = endDate.selectedDate; obj.organization = Organization(comboOrg.selectedItem); // etc
