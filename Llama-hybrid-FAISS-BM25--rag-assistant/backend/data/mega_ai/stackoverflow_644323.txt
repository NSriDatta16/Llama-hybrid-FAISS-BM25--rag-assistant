If you want an example of weather RSS feeds, you should definitely take a look at the RSS feeds that are produced by the Weather channel at http://www.weather.com I remember using those a few years ago to generate weather widgets for a small city's website I helped produce. We would parse out the RSS feed to get the temperature and cloud coverage of our specific zip code's weather.
