Found an analytical solution to this. Turns out all of the action is in the kernel; not in the sampling from the multivariate normal. The key is to compute a pairwise distance grid across the two input dimensions. This takes it from an n x n problem to an n^2 x n^2 problem. See code below. library("ggplot2") library("plgp") # kernel function rbf_D based on code from Robert Gramacy.
