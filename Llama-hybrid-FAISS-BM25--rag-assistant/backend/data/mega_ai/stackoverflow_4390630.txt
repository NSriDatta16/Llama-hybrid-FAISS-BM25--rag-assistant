Is it possible to embed a Flex Assets Class in a CSS declaration?

I have an SWC which includes a number of Assets for my project. Within this SWC is also a static AS file which contains Class declarations for each image in the library. For example, the SWF contains these images: /assets/foo/bar/img1.jpg /assets/foo/bar/img2.jpg And it includes an AS file which is like this: [Embed(source="/assets/foo/bar/img1.jpg")] public static const IMG_1:Class; [Embed(source="/assets/foo/bar/img2.jpg")] public static const IMG_2:Class; I would like to create a CSS declaration which uses these two images, but I don't want to embed the full path. Is it possible to do something like this? .mySampleStyle { upIcon: Assets.IMG_1; downIcon: Assets.IMG_2; } At the moment, this particular syntax is invalid -- I'm getting compile errors for the "." character in the style declaration. Is there another way of doing this without embedding the path (e.g. upIcon: Embed(source="/assets/foo/bar/img1.jpg") ) in the CSS?
