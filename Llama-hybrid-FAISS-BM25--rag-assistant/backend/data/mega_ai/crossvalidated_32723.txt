I'm not enough of an expert on neural networks (or other fancier machine learning methods like that, i.e. SVMs, etc.) to know what the state of the art is in terms of handling missing data in those areas. However, I do know that decision trees (I'm most familiar with the CART variant) are able to "handle" missing values relatively easily. I suspect that you may be able to get relatively far combining a large number of simple trees using either bagging or boosting . However, I would not treat this answer as particularly canonical. I suspect this question may receive better answers at stats.stackexchange.com , so I have flagged it for migration. If the mods agree, you do not need to do anything, it will be moved automatically.
