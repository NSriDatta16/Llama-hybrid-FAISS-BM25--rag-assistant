Your Page_Load event is going to fire before your button's Click event. It looks like you're setting the parameters used in your SQL call (intStartPosition and strResultsPrPage) in the Page_Load event based on the value retrieved from the textbox (tbPageNumberTop.Text) before the Click event has had a chance to update that value. You'll need to find a way to delay that SQL call until after your Click events have had a chance to update the current page value. You may want to have a look at the Page Life Cycle for clarification: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx
