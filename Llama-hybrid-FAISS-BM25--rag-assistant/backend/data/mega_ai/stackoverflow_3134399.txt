The iPhone does support cookies. You can see the support at http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/Classes/NSHTTPCookieStorage_Class/Reference/Reference.html If you are just doing simple HTTP Requests, I highly recommend using the source code from ASIHTTPRequest http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/ They make it REALLY easy to do simple requests for data and even handling the Async requests. I've been using the code in my application. NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://allseeing-i.com"]; ASIHTTPRequest *request = [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL:url]; [request startSynchronous]; NSError *error = [request error]; if (!error) { NSString *response = [request responseString]; }
