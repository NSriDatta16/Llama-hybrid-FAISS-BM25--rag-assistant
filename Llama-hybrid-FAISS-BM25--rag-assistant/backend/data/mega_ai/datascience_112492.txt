RNN basic doubt

Suppose if I have 2 sentences: "My name is Alex" "Alex is my name" If I am using a RNN, After processing both the sentences, Will the final output vector be the same? Because RNN basically shares the weights, And both the sentences have the same number of words,Shouldnt the final output after processing the last word in both sentences be the same ? I am well aware that when processing each word in RNN, The next word will be based on the current and previous processed words. But what about the full processing of both these sentences with same words. Will they have same final output?
