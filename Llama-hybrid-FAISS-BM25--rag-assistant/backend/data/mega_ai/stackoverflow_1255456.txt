If your database design already contains a connection ('constraint') between the primary key in your invoices table, and the foreign key (invoice id) in your invoice details table, then you should be able to access your invoice details from your invoice object like this: myInvoice.Details Linq to SQL should have created this relationship for you when you dragged your tables into the designer. In other words, you can reach out from your Invoice object, and access the details directly. If this relationship does exist, you should see it in the Linq to SQL designer as a line drawn between the invoices table and the invoice details table.
