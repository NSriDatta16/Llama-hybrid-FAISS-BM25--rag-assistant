Updating the weights (kernels) through the convolutional layer is done by convolving the (l+1) delta with the (l+1) weight. This gives the delta for updating the kernel. For a detailed explanation, check out deepgrid . Also, check out the github repo on CNN here , that implements backpropagation and updating the weights on a simple CNN.
