What test is appropriate for my data?

I have three types of food (Fish, Beef, Pasta) and for each food I have the average of the pH level. For each food and pH level, I have three repeated measures showing the amount of aluminum. I want to check whether the amount of aluminum in food depends on the pH of food by adjusting for the effect of the type of food. Type of food Fish Beef Pasta pH level 6.1 7.8 4.8 Amount of Aluminum 12.2 13.1 9.8 11.4 12 10.3 12.6 12.5 10
