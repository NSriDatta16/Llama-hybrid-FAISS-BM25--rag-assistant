Is partial correlation possible after Spearman's correlation?

I have two test groups that conducted an online task measuring response times (avg, avg(congruent), avg(incongruent)). I expected one group to be faster than the other but it turned out exactly the opposite way (significant). So now I'm trying to find one or more factors that are responsible for this unexpected outcome. My test data looks like this: participants conducted a Simon task and I measured their response times for each trial. In SPSS I have 3 variables, one for their average response times over all trials, one with their average response time for the trials that were congruent (place on screen and direction match), one with their average response time for the trials that were incongruent (place on screen and direction do not match). My groups are monolingual and multilingual. Literature suggests that multilinguals would score either higher averages overall, or higher averages for just the incongruent trials. My outcomes show that the monolinguals have a higher overall average and that the difference is the same between congruent and incongruent trials for both groups. For each group I know the following variables: age education level accuracy% sex lurking variables (yes|no) average response times (total, congruent trials, incongruent trials) first language Each variable in itself seems to be significant, but none of the variables seem to have a significant influence in combination with the original groups. I want to ensure that my test was not faulty and verify the validity of the test method. Maybe one other factor I didn't account for in my hypothesis is causing these results. It would either help me substantiate that my test is correct and that the results are valid, or provide a new angle for future research. I'm not sure what test to use. For my first comparisons I used Spearman's correlation. I was told once that I may not use partial correlations when using Spearman's correlation. Can anyone help me how to proceed from here?
