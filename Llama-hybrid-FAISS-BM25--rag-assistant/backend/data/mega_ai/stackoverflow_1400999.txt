Since nobody answered my question and I found the answer after long searches, I will post the answer for others to use if they bump into this problem. To access a plugin at runtime you must create and extension point and an extension attached to it into the plugin that you are trying to access. Adding classes to a plugin using a fragment is not recommended if you want to access those classes from outside of the plugin. So, the best solution for this is to get the plugin source from the CVS Repository and make the modifications directly into the source of the plugin. Add extension points, extensions and the code for functionality.
