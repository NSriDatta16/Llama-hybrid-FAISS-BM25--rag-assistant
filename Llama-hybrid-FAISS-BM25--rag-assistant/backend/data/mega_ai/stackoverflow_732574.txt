funny... I'm in the same boat, though perhaps I've been looking around for a bit longer. I came in from MS-land (C# too) and I went with Django, but only after I tinkered around with Google's AppEngine, which re-introduced me to Python. Django is well organized, internally consistent (as far as I could tell), and well supported with a vibrant community. Python is well organized, internally consistent (as far as I can tell), and extremely well supported with an amazing community. Anyhow, there's more to rapid Python web development than Django. You might want to search for: python wsgi framework. Pylons and TurboGears offer enormous flexibility and focus on "best of breed" components, web2py appears to have a very cool DAL/ORM that I'm itching to dig into, and web.py and werkzeug (amongst others) are minimalistic and don't try to dictate how you should build your app. And if you're sticking with Django, definitely check out the Pinax project - it might help kickstart your development efforts.
