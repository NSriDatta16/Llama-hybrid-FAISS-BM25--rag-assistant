To get CPU usage, periodically sample the total process time, and find the difference. For example, if these are the CPU times for process 1: kernel: 1:00:00.0000 user: 9:00:00.0000 And then you obtain them again two seconds later, and they are: kernel: 1:00:00.0300 user: 9:00:00.6100 You subtract the kernel times (for a difference of 0.03 ) and the user times ( 0.61 ), add them together ( 0.64 ), and divide by the sample time of 2 seconds ( 0.32 ). So over the past two seconds, the process used an average of 32% CPU time. The specific system calls needed to get this info are (obviously) different on every platform. On Windows, you can use GetProcessTimes , or GetSystemTimes if you want a shortcut to total used or idle CPU time.
