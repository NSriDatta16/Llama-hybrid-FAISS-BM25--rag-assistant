PivotTable Drillthrough not supported

We migrated our old ASP app to ASP.NET and can't seem to figure out the cause of this error. Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MS-RTC EA 2; MS-RTC LM 8) Timestamp: Mon, 12 Oct 2009 20:50:06 UTC Message: Object doesn't support this property or method: 'PivotTable1.Drillthrough' Line: 1173 Char: 2 Code: 0 URI: http:///DSS2009/HospitalVisitsCube.aspx Before, the page was hosted on a Windows 2000 Server, IIS 5.0 and SQL Server 2000. We migrated the app to a new environment: Windows 2003 Server, IIS 6.0, SQL Server 2005 w/ Analysis Services and now the pages are using ASP.NET (ASP.NET 2.0 to be exact). Anyone have a clue as to what's happening and a possible solution? My first thought was that IIS 6 supports ASP 3.0 which might have deprecated this method/property. However, I'm clueless and can't prove my theory because my ASP knowledge is very limited. Does anyone have any clue aso to what's happening?
