Most neural networks I'm aware of are nothing more than flexible interpolators. Backpropagating of errors is easy and fast, here are some possible uses : Classification of data Some games (modern backgammon AIs beat the best players in the world, the evaluation function is a neural net) Pattern recognition (OCR ?) There is nothing particularly related to human intelligence. There are other uses of neural nets, I have seen an implementation of associative memory which allowed for degradation without (much) data loss, pretty much like the brain which sees some neurons die with time.
