Does the Microsoft "Extensible Storage Engine" expose enough access to the storage manager to allow me to write a custom access method, for example a GiST ? Alternatively, is there a basic log manager / buffer pool manager project for Windows that I could extend to play around with GiST without re-inventing the entire wheel? (Access methods are the part I am interested in experimenting with, so I don't mind re-inventing that.)
