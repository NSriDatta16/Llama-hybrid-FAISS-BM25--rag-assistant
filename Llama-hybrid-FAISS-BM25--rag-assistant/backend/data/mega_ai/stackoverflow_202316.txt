You can simply write a call to the sftp command line client via a batch file if you want to accomplish that. Check out the Shell() function in VBA. Under the click event of the button on your form add in the code: mySFTPCall = "sftp " Call Shell(mySFTPCall, 1) I've used this before to just copy files straight across network shares etc. to share data from an in-house Access DB. Of course you could get more fancy if necessary.
