It is expected for at least two reasons: Extra supervision: The multilabel classifier can use the extra information about other classes eg. by inferring "I want to find horses. I also know houses and dogs. While horses/houses are easy to divide, I have to be careful about the division of horses and dogs.". More concrete: Think of it as transfer learning. Eg. when using any kind of neural network, early feature-extraction layers profit from the extra loss and are learned more generally when you train a single model compared to many binary models. Class balance Classes in your multilabel problem are guaranteed to be more balanced than classes in your binary problems are.
