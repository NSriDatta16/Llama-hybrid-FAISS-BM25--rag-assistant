Introduction to Machine Learning by Ethem Alpaydin is a good start for machine learning before reading the Bishop's book.The book of Allen B. Downey Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers covers basic statistics.For Gaussian processes, I used to watch the lectures of Nando de Freitas on youtube.He explains the GP excellently.Keep in mind that I'm still a student, not an expert.
