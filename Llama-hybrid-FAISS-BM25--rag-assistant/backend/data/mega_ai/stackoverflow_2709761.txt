Plenty of options came into my mind: Transitions by JS/CSS are well-tested & quick to implement. CPU usage is unlikely to be a problem. However, if you want to experience with the canvas option and support the Redmond-based browsing-thingy, you can simplify your life by drawing through RaphaÃ«l cross-browser API. Pure CSS transitions are the most elegant (arguably) method. Unfortunately folks outside Cupertino have been lazy to implement them, so their use is currently mostly limited to impressive extra eye candy. Retro way: pretend it's 2001 and these guys enables you to do some serious CPU burning for few hundred bucks.
