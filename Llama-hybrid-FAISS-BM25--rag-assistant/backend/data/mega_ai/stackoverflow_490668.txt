A class should do one thing and one thing only. If it has so many constructors it seems to be a tell tale sign that it's doing too many things. Using multiple constructors to force the correct creation of instances of the object in a variety of circumstances but 9 seems like a lot. I would suspect there is an interface in there and a couple of implementations of the interface that could be dragged out. Each of those would likely have from one to a few constructors each relevant to their specialism.
