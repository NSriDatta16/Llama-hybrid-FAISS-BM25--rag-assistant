I did find an answer to this one. I'm a little hazy on the details, as it was a few months ago, but the following was the jist of the solution: Create a table for each implementation of IAccountManager that has mappings. Make sure your DB is setup to use the HiLo id algorithm. Use union-subclasses in your mappings Union-subclasses would look something like this: ... more implementations Note the attribute "name" on union-subclass. This should be unique for (and match) each implementation of IAccountManager. Also, the ID, instead of being unique to each table, will be unique to all IAccountManagers (by leveraging hilo). When NHibernate sees an IAccountManager entity, it will use the instance's concrete type and the union-subclass definitions to figure out the correct table. Hope this helps!
