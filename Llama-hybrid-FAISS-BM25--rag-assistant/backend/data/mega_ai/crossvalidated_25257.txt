A question about a formula for lmer

I have been asking a number of questions about fitting mixed effects models. Thanks to a number of wonderful statisticians on here I have come far, and I thank you for you continued patience. I was going to ask this question live in chat but when I officially registered my username I lost my reputation and it has reverted from 23 to 1, so I apologise for yet another question. I now understand how to formulate a simple mixed-effects model, enter into the R package using lme4 and how to look at AICc etc. to compare models. However, one response variable may need a more complex design which I would appreciate help with if at all possible. I wish to see if habitat choice of broods at one site is different from the other. Each observation may have multiple habitats used so I have a proportion of use for each habitat type for each observation. I have six broods, three at each site. Maybe an alternate test is better, but as I only have six broods that I wish to compare (three at each beach) so using means makes the sample very small, and I cannot use chi-sq due to it being proportional data. So, I am not sure if a formula is available in a model that would then allow me to compare it to a null model to see if site has an effect on the response variable 'habitat'. However I have 7 habitats so have a variable (proportion of use) for each habitat within each observation. More importantly I would like to see how the use of each habitat affects a response variable such as mean foraging rate. Another study did this but their model contain one variable 'habitat' which made me think that they had only one habitat per observation. However they ended up calculating the Estimate for each habitat by averaging the two top models (AIC delta I hope that I am making sense.
