Questions from agency staff about C# , sharepoint , .NET position, what should I reply?

Recently I have applied for a job through the agency. She emailed me with this questions: Please email me back with your experience in the following: .NET Framwork .NET Remoting ASP.NET C++ C# Web Services Networking COM interop ADO.NET Sliverlight TDD Composite UI Application Block OO design 1) please detail what experience you have 2) and how many months/years experience you have, and gained from where i.e. I have worked on C#, .NET, Sharepoint for around 3 years, but with different organisations. Few are the concepts and you will not use all the time, but aware of this. In programming how can you count this experience in months ? Don't you think this agency people are asking stupid questions?
