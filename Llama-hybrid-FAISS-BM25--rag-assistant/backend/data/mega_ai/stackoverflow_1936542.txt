Tips for embedding a longer text in source code, as in languages like Perl?

Possible Duplicate: Something like print END In a shell script or in a perl program the so called "HERE" documents are commonly used for longer text, e.g. Perl: my $t= This style is very well readable, e.g. no need to escape quotes or to explicitly insert \n . I am wondering if there is a comparable elegant approach to embed a longer text inside a C/C++ program? #include ; int main(void) { std::string t; // t = ... the same long text as in the perl example in a HERE document fashion ... std::cout EDIT: Simplification: there is no variable interpolation needed.
