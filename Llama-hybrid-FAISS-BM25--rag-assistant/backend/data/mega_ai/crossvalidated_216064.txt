I've just had to solve this exact problem. We had a 9 point scale that was changed to a 5 point scale on a tracker going back 10 years. Not only that but some of the statements changed as well. And we were reporting as a form of Net Promoter Score. The solution we used apply's a paired design by asking each respondent a few of the old statements the old way (as well as all the new way). We only asked a couple the old way rather than all of them since this minimises respondent fatigue. We then take each score on the 9 point scale and find it's average on the 5 point score and use this to correct for the scale change AND the statement change. This is quite similar to what is called the "Semantic Judgement of Fixed Word Value" in some papers, but instead of using experts to decide the 'word value' we used respondents actual data. For example, if the average score on the 5 point scale was 1.2 for those respondents who answered 2 on the 9 point scale then to let us directly compare years with different scales on the 5 point scale we would replace all 2's on the 9 point scale with 1.2, then do the same for all the 9 point scores, and proceed as normal. We did a similar thing for reporting NPS. But first we converted the 5 point scale to the NPS scale of 1 (promoter), 0 (passive), -1 (detractor) e.g. if the average on the NPS scale was 0.9 for a 2 on the 9 point scale then we replaced it with 0.9, then do the same for all the 9 point scores, and then calculated NPS normally. To evaluate the effectiveness of this we first compared the 'uncorrected' NPS scores using the 9 and 5 point scales to see if there was actually any problem at all, and then the 'corrected' ones. I haven't got the data yet but will report back when we do!
