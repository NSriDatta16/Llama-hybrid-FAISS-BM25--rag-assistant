For the second question, the Friedman test compares multiple rank-orderings. Make sure you set it up so that you do the comparison you want: test whether there are there differences among rankings, as opposed to differences among players. For the first question, the answer would depend on what you are trying to accomplish, in particular how you want to evaluate the estimators. Do you want to find the estimator that gives the lowest average error among signals, or that gives the lowest median error, or that gives the most reproducible error, or that is the least likely to make a really big error, or something else? If all of the data points have values greater than 0, a logarithmic transformation might help remove the skew and help you visualize the data better.
