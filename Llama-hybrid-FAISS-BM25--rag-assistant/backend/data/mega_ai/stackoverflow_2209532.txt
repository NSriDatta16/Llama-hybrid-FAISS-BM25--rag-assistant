Properly compiling modules in subfolders (ocamlbuild)

I recently decided to organize the files in my project directory. I moved the parsers I had for a few different file types into their own directory and also decided to use ocamlbuild (the as the project was getting more complicated and the simple shell script was not sufficient any longer). I was able to successfully include external projects by modifying myocamlbuild with some basic rules (calling ocaml_lib , I'll use ocamlfind some other time), but I am stuck on how to include the folder as a module into the project properly. I created a parser.mlpack file and filled it with the proper modules to be included (eg, "parser/Date", et cetera), wrote a parser.mli in the root of the directory for their implementations, and modified the _tags file (see below). During the compilation, the parser directory is traversed properly, and parser.cmi , parser.mli.depends were both created in the _build directory; as well as all *.cm[xio] files in the parsers subdirectory. I feel I might be doing something redundant, but regardless, the project still cannot find the Parser module when I compile! Thanks! _tags debug : true : annot "parser" : include : for-pack(Parser) : use_curl : use_mysql or : use_str,use_unix,use_curl,use_mysql compilation error /usr/local/bin/ocamlopt.opt unix.cmxa str.cmxa -g -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/mysql mysql.cmxa -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/curl curl.cmxa curlIO.cmx utilities.cmx date.cmx fraction.cmx logger.cmx mySQL.cmx data.cmx project.cmx -o project.native File "\_none\_", line 1, characters 0-1: Error: **No implementations provided for the following modules:** Parser referenced from project.cmx Command exited with code 2. You'll notice -I parser is not included in the linking phase above; actually none of the parser related files are included! edit: Added new details from comments and answer below.
