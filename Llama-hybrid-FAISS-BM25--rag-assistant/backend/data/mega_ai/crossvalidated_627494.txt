What is the use of MCMC techniques in this context?

Currently I'm learning about MCMC techniques. . Exercise A researcher wants to sample $\theta$ from a discrete distribution with density function $$ f(\theta)= \begin{cases}p=1 / 6 & \theta=0 |\\ p=1 / 2 & \theta=1 |\\ p= 1 / 3 & \theta=2\end{cases} $$ He is only able to sample from the discrete distribution $$ g(\theta)= \begin{cases}p=1 / 3 & \theta=0 |\ p=1 / 3 & \theta=1 |\ p= 1 / 3 & \theta=2\end{cases} To sample $\theta$ from $f(\theta)$ hp uses a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. He samples from the candidate density $g(\theta)$ to obtain draws from the target density $f(\theta)$. Let $\theta^{(m)}$ denote the $m$ th draw of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. After convergence of the sampler, it holds that if $\theta^{(m)}$ is a draw of $f(\theta)$ then $\theta^{(m+1)}$ will also be a draw of $f(\theta)$ . Use the computed transition probability matrix to show that this is indeed the case for this sampler. Answer Question I understand all calculus behind this. I suppose that a entry in the transition matrix is the probability that you go from state $i$ in the parameter space to state $j$ . My question is regarding the concept. What is the meaning behind multiplying the pdf of the target function with the transition matrix? What does this actually mean?: "After convergence of the sampler, it holds that if $\theta^{(m)}$ is a draw of $f(\theta)$ then $\theta^{(m+1)}$ will also be a draw of $f(\theta)$ ."
