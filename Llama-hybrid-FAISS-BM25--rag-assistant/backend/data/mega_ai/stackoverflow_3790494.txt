You pass in TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew : TransactionOptions to = new TransactionOptions; to.IsolationLevel = ; using (TransactionScope scope = new TransactionScope( TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew, to)) { ... do work here scope.Complete (); } Be carefull though, there be dragons under that bridge. Specifically is easy to deadlock with yourself if the encompassing scope has pending uncommitted writes from its own transaction scope and you attempt to touch the very same entities in the inner standalone transaction (the new scope).
