This type of dataset is commonly called a skewed dataset. This is when a certain class is over-represented in contrast to the other labels in the dataset. There are many algorithms that are well suited to these types of problems. Specifically, anomaly detection algorithms are capable of learning the distribution a single set of labels (event not occurring) and then it will be able to flag when an anomaly occurs (event occurs). This is when an instance is sufficiently beyond the learned distribution. You can use this to get the probability of an event occurring based on a p-statistic test using the feature-space you have set up in contrast with those from your learned distribution. The simplest method would be doing a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). But, I think you will most likely find more luck using a K-NN based method for skewed datasets. Since you have a lot of data you can use ranking algorithms to generate your p-statistics. Look into rankSVM.
