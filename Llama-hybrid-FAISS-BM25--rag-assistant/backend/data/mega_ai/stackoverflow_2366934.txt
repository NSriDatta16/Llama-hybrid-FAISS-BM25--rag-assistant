Restoring just the org DB can lead to issues as some user info is stored in the config DB as well. In fact, there are entries in there mapping the user to the org (SystemUserOrganizations), so when you restore the Org DB, this mapping is now out of date. You would need to either go the Delete/Import route or manually do some unsupported cleansing of the Config DB Tables.
