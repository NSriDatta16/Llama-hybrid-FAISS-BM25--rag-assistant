odds ratio in logistic regression

I calculated univariate odds ratio as follows: table(d[,c("copd", "nsurgrespicatelectbpnards")]) nsurgrespicatelectbpnards copd N Y N 73 19 Y 26 31 m My intrepretation is that people with COPD (lung disease) have an odds ratio of 4.58 of having a postoperative respiratory complication ( nsurgrespicatelectbpnards ) compared to people not having COPD . 0.26 being the odds of having a complication while not having COPD ( i.e 19/73). Is that correct, disregarding regression diagnostics?
