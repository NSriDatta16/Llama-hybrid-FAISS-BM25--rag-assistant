which algorithm uses a multidimension array of average probabilities

Is there an algorithm that returns the mean probability of response from a multi-dimensional matrix? For example, if I have a set of features: customerClass = poor / middle / rich category = 11 / 20 / 35 offerValue = $1 / $2 / $3 and a response: usesCoupon = FALSE / TRUE Assuming I have enough samples, I want to predict the probability for a new sample (customerClass = rich , category = 20 , offerValue = $1 ) as the average probability for the population with the same three-dimensional value (rich, 20, $1) .
