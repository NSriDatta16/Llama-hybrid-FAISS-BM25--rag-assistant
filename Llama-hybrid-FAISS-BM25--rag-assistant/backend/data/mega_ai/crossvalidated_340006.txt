Simply put: A one sample test is used to test a sample mean ($\mu_0$) to a known population mean ($\mu$). Think about testing the height of a sample of females against the average female height according to the latest census. A two sample test is used to test a sample mean from one group ($\mu_1$) against a sample mean from another, independent group ($\mu_2$). This is why the required sampled size for a two-sample test is double the required sample size for a one-sample test. A/B tests should use a two sample test. For more information, there are a lot of resources on this site and online related to one sample vs two sample tests.
