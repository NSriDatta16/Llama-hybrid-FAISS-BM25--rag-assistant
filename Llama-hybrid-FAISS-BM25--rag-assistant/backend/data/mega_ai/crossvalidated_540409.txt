The seasonal pulse is ~+-2.5 which seems relatively small compared to the magnitude of the series. What type of decomposition method are you using? Decomposition methods will typically give you squiggly lines for seasonality no matter what. Which is fine in general since it doesn't impose too much error as the seasonality usually gets averaged closer to 0 if there is no seasonality(looks like that's what is happening here). There are way better ways to tell if you seasonality such as various seasonality tests or plots to review like acf or kruskal or looking at fourier spikes. Of course visually inspecting the decomposition is useful as well but you need to pay special attention to the magnitude of seasonality and not just see squiggly lines as evidence. On the other hand by just reviewing it looks like there could be some seasonality but it also looks like there are quite a few large drops that might add a ton of noise to this. Specifically the period between november and jan looks like it is fairly regular but the large drops to 0 right at november and in october will mess things up. What are these drops? Are they some events or holidays or something you could control for? Might clear things up a lot. Once you control for them then you can try reviewing the seasonality again.
