Selectively disable GCC warnings for only part of a translation unit

What's the closest GCC equivalent to this MSVC preprocessor code? #pragma warning( push ) // Save the current warning state. #pragma warning( disable : 4723 ) // C4723: potential divide by 0 // Code which would generate warning 4723. #pragma warning( pop ) // Restore warnings to previous state. We have code in commonly included headers which we do not want to generate a specific warning for. However, we want files which include those headers to continue to generate that warning (if the project has that warning enabled).
