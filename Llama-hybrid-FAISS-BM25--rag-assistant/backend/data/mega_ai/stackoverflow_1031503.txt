combine two arrays

Possible Duplicate: Elegant way to merge two arrays as key value pairs in PHP? I have two arrays: Array ( [0] => A [1] => B [2] => C [3] => D [4] => E ) Array ( [0] => APPLE [1] => BANANNA [2] => CRANBERRY [3] => DURIAN [4] => EGGPLANT ) I want to combine them so that first value of the first array will be the the first key of the second array. Array ( [A] => APPLE [B] => BANANNA [C] => CRANBERRY [D] => DURIAN [E] => EGGPLANT )
