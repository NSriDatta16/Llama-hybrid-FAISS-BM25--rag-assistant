Unbalanced target variable in Orange, how do I balance it?

So I want to perform a predictive model to predict churn. I have 2 datasets, one with churn and the other without (so I can later perform predictions). The issue is that I think my Confusion matrix is kinda bad since my target variable is highly unbalanced: which mostly leads to this confussion matrix: (Similar values for both logistic regression and decision tree). This is my workflow: Is there any way to balance the data? I can't find it in the Orange documentation.
