For some time series, like equity prices exchange rates and GDP growth, log returns are approximately invariant, meaning that it is stable over time. One way to see this would be to plot the histogram of the first and second half of the available data, which should be roughly similar, and check a scatter plot of the returns versus their lags, which should show no relationship. For these series, changes in prices are a function of the lag of the price. As the price increases, the change increases. This means that the mean and variance changes over time. So if you try to perform a regression of the changes of two series without incorporating this heteroskedasticity, then your standard errors will be wrong. The proper procedure (for these types of time series) is to use the log returns for estimation. If you want to forecast the original series, you have to first project the log returns to the future and then convert back to prices.
