Sounds like in your case organization is also an user. This is very similar to our database which looks like this, You have a table with every users and organizations. We call them principals. The organization and user are treated the same in this table. This is where you store your data like activities. You can add a column for the type (org or user). You would have another table for the relations. It just needs two columns, one column is organization and the other is users belong to this organization. Say an organization has 100 users, you would have 100 entries in this table for each user.
