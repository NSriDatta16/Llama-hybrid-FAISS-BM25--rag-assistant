SharePoint. I did not bother putting in a fuller answer as I knew I would be voted down either way... everyone hates MS right? If you have a Windows Server 2003 machine then you already have it as SharePoint Services 3.0 is included in the licence. Here it is then, based on my experience... Meeting minutes SPS provides a specific functionality for this; you can create a Meeting Workspace site... http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/sharepointtechnology/HA100656201033.aspx?pid=CH100649471033 software specifications, plans, notes about other organisations, documents for discussion and storage, agendas... There are 40 different Application Templates available for free, any number of which you can use for these purposes... http://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/windowsserver/sharepoint/bb407286.aspx Some specific ones that might help you are... Bug Database, Contacts Management, IT Team Workspace, Change Request Management, Knowledge Base, Project Tracking Workspace, Budgeting and Tracking Multiple Projects, Document Library and Review, Help Desk, Discussion Database, Product and Marketing Requirements Planning, Request for Proposal, Team Work Site, Timecard Management, Absence Request and Vacation Schedule Management easily link to files in SVN and Trac tickets. I donâ€™t know anything about these, sorry. A link is a link though, right? Advantages of Wiki: easy to grow organically, creating new pages on the fly, good at interlinkages. SharePoint has a Wiki template built in to it... it is one of the types of site you can create out of the box. Disadvantages: no support for structure/hierarchy Built in to SharePoint No per page/area permissions model. Fully granular permissions model is built into SharePoint No "workflow" support. Basic workflow is built into SharePoint Generally inferior attachment support. Outstanding attachment support is built into SharePoint, including versioning, check in/check out etc. torbengb | You should definitely use a wiki and not a CMS because in my experience: a wiki is about collaborating rather than broadcasting SharePoint is ALL about collaborating. a wiki allows edit by anyone Ditto for SharePoint, if you want, as long as you give them an account first. a wiki features revision history Ditto for SharePoint. a wiki allows attachments per topic (wiki page) and also keeps revision history for these Ditto for SharePoint. Anyway, good luck! Hokey.
