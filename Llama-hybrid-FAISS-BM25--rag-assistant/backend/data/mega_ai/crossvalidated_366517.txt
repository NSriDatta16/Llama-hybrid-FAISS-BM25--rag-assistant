Here is an analysis of some data that were collected according to a design much like you are considering. Such models are sometimes called a two-way ANOVA without replication, a (complete, unreplicated) block design (as in @SalMangiafico's Comment), or (one type of) repeated measures design. [A one-way ANOVA is something altogether different.] The analysis below, from Minitab statistical software, is similar to what you may encounter in your study. Data. We use data from a wine judging event reported in Amerine and Roessler (1976): Wines: Their Sensory Evaluation, Freeman, San Francisco. Each of four wines was tasted by each of five judges. Scores are sums of several components judges were asked to consider. Judge \ Wine 1 2 3 4 1 13 18 15 10 2 15 16 12 11 3 14 15 11 9 4 12 17 13 10 5 13 19 12 12 ANOVA Model for Block design. Based on the model $Y_{ij} = \mu + W_i + J_j + e_{ij},$ where $e_{ij} \sim \mathsf{Norm}(0, \sigma),$ for $i=1,\dots,4$ wines $j=1,\dots,5$ judges, here is the ANOVA table: Two-way ANOVA: Score versus Wine, Judge Source DF SS MS F P Wine 3 112.95 37.6500 21.72 0.000 Judge 4 8.80 2.2000 1.27 0.335 Error 12 20.80 1.7333 Total 19 142.55 The null hypothesis that wines are judged equal in quality is rejected and post hoc tests can be done to determine the pattern of differences. For example, it seems clear that the difference between wines 2 and 4 is significant. There is no evidence that judges differ significantly in the way they evaluated the wines (more harshly or leniently). Diagnostics: Scores are sums of several components judges were asked to consider, and so one might hope the residuals would be normally distributed. However, it seems that there are not enough extreme residuals in each direction for them to be consistent with sampling from a normal distribution. A normal probability plot of the residuals with an Anderson-Darling test of normality (normality just barely rejected at the 5% level): I am not sure departure from normality is sufficiently extreme to cast doubt on the finding of significant differences among wines. A plot of residuals against fits does not show any systematic nonrandomness or difficulty with unequal variances. Nonparametric block design. A Friedman test of the same data gives results below: Friedman Test: Score versus Wine blocked by Judge S = 12.78 DF = 3 P = 0.005 S = 13.04 DF = 3 P = 0.005 (adjusted for ties) Notice that the Friedman procedure provides only a test whether wines differ (not whether judges differ). Paired differences between wines could be assessed by several Wilcoxon signed rank tests, using the Bonferroni method to control the 'family error rate'. With only five judges, paired Wilcoxon tests may have poor power, but every judge prefers wine 2 to wine 4 by at least 5 points, so those two wines must be significantly different. All 20 scores lie between 9 an 19, so necessarily there are a few ties, but it seems not enough of them to spoil results of the Friedman test. Note: Amerine & Roessler p145 show the same ANOVA as above. Also, they get Tukey HSD 2.54 for significant differences among the four wines. With wine averages 17.9(2), 13.4(1), 12.6(3), 10.4(4), Wine 2 is significantly higher than all others, and Wine 4 lowest, but not significantly lower than Wine 3. They do not show results of the Friedman test.
