How long is a piece of string? Ultimately what makes a quality product? Bugs gives some indication yes, but many other factors are involved, Unit Test coverage is a key factor in IMO. But in my experience the main factor that effects whether a product can be deemed quality or not, is good understanding of the problem that is being solved. Often what happens is, the 'problem' that the product is meant to solve is not understood correctly and developers end up inventing the solution to a problem they have flesh out in their head, and not the real problem, thus 'bugs' are made. I am a strong proponent of iterative Agile development, that way the product is constantly access against the 'problem' and the product does not stray to far from its goal.
