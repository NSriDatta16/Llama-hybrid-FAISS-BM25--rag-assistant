What you want is basically exactly how my application is organized (with a second version I am fiddling around with that is View-based instead). There seems to be a bit of an issue with your Tabs XML file though. 1) Why do you have the xmlns:android tag twice? TabHost and LinearLayout both have it - remove the one from the LinearLayout. 2) Not sure about the match_parent layout params on the LinearLayout (this is likely not the issue though) - my first TabHost (later revised a bit) looked like this, which is very similar to yours (I imagine we followed the same tutorial off the Android docs ;)), and worked just fine: Try to fix the first thing and it should work just fine, I see no reason it shouldn't.
