I don't see a problem with #3. A reminder request isn't permanent "user data", it's temporary data that has no meaning after a fixed date. If a user requests 4 days notice and the organizer moves the meeting to be 3 days away, then the best way to honor the "request" from the user is to notify them immediately. To not notify them is to fail to honor their request completely. To look at it another way, when the meeting is moved such that the request is overdue, you've already lost the "user data". A request has no meaning or relevance after it has has been sent or expired. Your app has failed to honor the user request, simply because you can't anticipate flakey meeting organizers. I think you can salvage the scraps of the intent behind the request by sending an immediate reminder including a notice that the event has moved.
