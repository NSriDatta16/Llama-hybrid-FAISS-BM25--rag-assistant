VS2010 Winforms Usercontrol changes not showing in parent form

I've created a series of usercontrols. Dragged one of the controls to the main form. It shows OK. Went back and made a change to the design of the user control. Rebuilt project. Cleaned project. manually removed all project binaries including the obj folder. Change still doesn't show on the usercontrol hosted on the main form. Dragging a new instance of the control from the tool box only shows the old version of the control. Completely removed the controls from the toolbox and adding them again fixed the problem, but surely I don't have to do this everytime I make a change? All user controls are in the same assembly as the main form. Tool>Options>Windows Forms Designer>Auto toolbox Populate is set to true. Any ideas most appreciated. Thx
