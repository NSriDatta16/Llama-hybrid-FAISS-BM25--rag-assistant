Is there a way to cross locations of Sainsburys with BP garages to get places where they are together?

I've seen a photo I'd like to trace the location of. In it is a BP garage and a Sainsburys supermarket. Google Maps holds all the info and I'm sure many others do - what I'd like is to be able to quickly do a join-type operation on the data. It would ahve to be proximity limited but if this was using, say, the town name or the first 4 digits of the postcode (UK) that would be fine. Any ideas? It'd be great if this could be generalised so for example I could find all campsites with nearby indoor play centres, or whatever?
