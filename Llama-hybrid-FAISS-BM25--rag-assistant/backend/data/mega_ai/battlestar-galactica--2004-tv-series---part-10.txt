came back from the dead for no reason. The writers have basically admitted they had no plan for killing and resurrecting Starbuck â€” they just thought it would be a cool thing to do, and they would figure out the reasons later. And thus, we ended up with a year of Starbuck Interrupted, constantly shouting "You're going the wrong way!" and playing the piano while talking about her daddy. In a Commentary article on the prevalence of Bush Derangement Syndrome in popular culture, conservative political commentator Jonah Goldberg analyzed the show's "radically bizarre and nonsensical turn of events ... that led inexorably to its self-destruction": Originally, the series was very difficult to pigeonhole ideologically. ... When it came time to make the third season ... a show marked by gritty realism about how a decent but flawed civilization modeled on our own tries to cling to its decency while fighting an existential war against an implacable enemy veered wildly off course. The humans were no longer analogized to Americans; rather Americans were analogized to genocidal occupiers. In other words, we are no longer the inspiration for the futuristic Israelites trying to survive. We are now the Nazis. Fantasy author George R.R. Martin expressed his dissatisfaction with how the writers handled the ending of the TV series, commenting: Battlestar Galactica ends with 'God Did It.' Looks like somebody skipped Writing 101, when you learn that a deus ex machina is a crappy way to end a story... Yeah, yeah, sometimes the journey is its own reward. I certainly enjoyed much of the journey with BSG... But damn it, doesn't anybody know how to write an ending any more? Writing 101, kids. Adam and Eve, God Did It, It Was All a Dream? I've seen Clarion students left stunned and bleeding for turning in stories with those endings. Electronic Frontier Foundation's Chairman Emeritus Brad Templeton, an adherent of the show, penned an essay that greatly detailed the failings of Battlestar Galactica and its ending, noting that it was the most disappointing finale to a promising series due to the "God did it" deus ex machina, bad science around the Mitochondrial Eve aspect vis-a-vis Hera Agathon, and the inherent nod to the "ancient astronaut" pseudo-science that eschews Moore's "naturalistic science fiction" decrees relating to the pitfalls of pre-Battlestar science fiction television. Josh Tyler of CinemaBlend concluded that the series finale made no real attempt to resolve any of the plotlines or mysteries set up during the earlier run of the show. Wider influence On March 17, 2009, the United Nations hosted a Battlestar Galactica retrospective including a discussion with Mary McDonnell, Edward James Olmos, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick on human rights, terrorism, children and armed conflict, and reconciliation between civilians and faiths. The Discussion was moderated by actress Whoopi Goldberg and also included Radhika Coomaraswamy, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict; Craig Mokhiber of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; Robert C. Orr, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Planning; and Famatta Rose Osode, from the Permanent Mission of Liberia to the UN. Battlestar Galactica was the basis for a special session at the 2009 World Science Festival. The session included presentations from Mary McDonnell and Michael Hogan, as well as scientists Hod Lipson and Kevin Warwick. The Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle organised a special exhibition on the series with props of three spacecraft models and guest speakers starting October 23, 2010.
