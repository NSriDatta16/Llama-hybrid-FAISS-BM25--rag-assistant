Now I see. You do mean grammars. The grammar formats you specify are cousins of context-free grammars. There exists a research field around automatic learning of context-free grammars. Probabilistic Context-free grammars are central to this field. See Roni rosenfeld's Notes (PostScript) on learning PCFGs, the Bayesian version (zipped postscript) and unsupervised PCFG learning (PDF) . This is an active research fields, and has changed since these papers were written. Eugene Charniak is a prolific researcher in this field.
