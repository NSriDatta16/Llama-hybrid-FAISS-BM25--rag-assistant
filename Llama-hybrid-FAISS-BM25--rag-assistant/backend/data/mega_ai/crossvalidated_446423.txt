Feature subset selection by stepwise regression for a random forest model?

I would like to build a random forest model for regression. I have an abundance of potential features, and I expect only some of them to have a significant impact on the target variable. In addition, some of the features may be strongly correlated. By trial and error, I have found a subset of features which seem to work well (in terms of mean squared error on the test set), but I would like to see if I can do better. I was thinking of some sort of autmatic feature subset selection, such as stepwise regression. However, I have two questions Since random forest models already select features, is it possible to gain much by such a method? What would be a suitable information criterion for a random forest model? Since it's nonparametric, standard information criteria (such as AIC or BIC) one would normally use for stepwise regression, don't work.
