Magpasikat (lit. Show-Off) is an annual talent competition segment of the Philippine noontime variety show It's Showtime. The segment features the program's hosts and cast members competing in teams to showcase creative and performance-based productions. It is typically held as a week-long anniversary special in October, either during or leading up to the show's anniversary on October 24. However, the segment was held in November from 2021 to 2023. Jugs Jugueta and Teddy Corpuz currently hold the record for the most Magpasikat wins, with six victories. They are followed by Karylle with five wins, and both Jhong Hilario and Kim Chiu with four each. Background Magpasikat was first held on October 23, 2010, as part of It's Showtime's first anniversary celebration. It has since become an annual week-long tradition commemorating the show's anniversary. Exceptions occurred in 2020 and 2021, when the segment was held as a single-day event due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The name Magpasikat was also previously used in January 2010 as a temporary replacement for Showtime after it was suspended by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB). The suspension followed a controversial remark made by guest judge Rosanna Roces regarding teachers. This interim program retained the original format but featured celebrity contestants. It aired only for a few days before Showtime resumed broadcast under a temporary restraining order. Format The It's Showtime cast and staff are typically divided into five teams through a random draw, which also determines the order of performances. Teams perform daily from Monday to Friday, with results announced on Saturday by either the voice of Big Brother, a panel of judges, or ABS-CBN COO for Broadcast Cory Vidanes. A panel of guest hurados (judges) evaluates each performance. The team with the highest average score is awarded the top cash prize for their chosen beneficiary, while the remaining teams receive consolation prizes.
