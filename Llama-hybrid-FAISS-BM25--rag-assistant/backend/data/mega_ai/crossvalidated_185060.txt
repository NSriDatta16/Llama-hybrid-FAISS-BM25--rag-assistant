It's probably best to do a standard STL (Season, Trend, Level) decomposition. Here is what you'd do with dummy data: set.seed(1) series Note that "Time" here is in years, and that this algorithm already accounts for the trend, so you don't need to extract that beforehand. Afterwards, you can extract the components from foo$time.series , for example foo$time.series[,"remainder"] for the residuals. An alternative would be exponential smoothing or an equivalent state space model, but forecast::ets also doesn't work with frequencies greater than 24. You may want to look through some of our earlier questions on daily time series .
