I have to put a shout-out for Moq . It is a clean light mocking framework that guides you into the pit of success. The testing tools built into TFS are okay. They will get the job done but can often be a little cumbersome to work with. The generated reports, code coverage and a few other portions are particularly bad. They make you go bald at 22 rather than 50. If you are really loving the testing, consider trying some Continuous Integration. You will feel the pain from regression quickly and this pain potentially helps you get to the end goal faster. Regardless of what you do, try out a few and see which one is the most natural, if you have time. Good luck and happy coding.
