mean of autoregressive process

An autoregressive process of order p, AR(p), is of the form $x_t=\phi_1x_{t-1}+...+\phi_px_{t-p}+w_t$ where $x_t$ is stationary, i.e. $E[x_t]=\mu$ for all $t=0,1,2,...$ , and $w_t$ is white noise, i.e. $w_t\sim N(0,\sigma_w^2)$ . Hence, $E[x_t]=E[\phi_1x_{t-1}+...+\phi_px_{t-p}+w_t]=\phi_1\mu+...+\phi_p\mu=\mu(\phi_1+...+\phi_p)$ this implies $\mu=\mu(\phi_1 +...+\phi_p)$ . But this can only be true if $\mu=0$ . If I understand this right this implies that the mean of a stationary AR(p) process always has to be zero. So why do many books (e.g. "Time Series Analysis and Its Applications" by Shumway and Stoffer) say that if $\mu\neq0$ we can replace $x_t$ by $x_t-\mu$ eventhough $\mu$ can't be zero?
