Unable to browse some pdfs and docs

I have a web site that uses Microsoft Indexing Service to index and query a directory that holds various documents of type pdf, rtf, mht, and doc. The indexing and querying works well (for the most part); however, some files will load while others will not. This is a Windows Server 2003 box running the site using IIS 6. The indexed directory is a sub directory off of the site's root directory (i.e. http://my.domain.com/files/ ). The file paths are accurate in the URL; however, I can only access some of the files of each file type. The files that I cannot access give a 404 File Not Found. I am able to open all files via windows explorer;however, attempting to open them via a browser over http is hit and miss. Has anyone experienced this issue and know how to resolve it? Anyone have any idea why I could access some files but not others? Does anyone have any recommendations on what to look into to try this (i.e. does owner matter or something like that?)?
