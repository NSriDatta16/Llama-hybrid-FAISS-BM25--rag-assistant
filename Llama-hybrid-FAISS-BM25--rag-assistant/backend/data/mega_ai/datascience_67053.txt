Confusion about the MSE ERROR

I created a Random Forest regressor model and calculated my own error. I also want to calculate MAE, MSE and RMSE to compare my results to similar use cases. I am confused by the results as the values are far lesser. The random forest regressor function I used is the default one. So I am just curious if there is anyone who can interpret my MAE, MSE, RMSE? Or did I do something wrong? # Random Forest Regressor trainieren random_state = 42 rf.fit(X_train, y_train) These are the results of my own error: Testset size: 19688 mean error(AVG): 0.10146151388130142 median error (Median): 0.061079373768676316 These are the results that look confusing to me: # predict the testset y_pred = rf.predict(X_test) # Random Forest Basline Model evaluation print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)) print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)) print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))) #Mean Absolute Error: 0.027392195979941525 #Mean Squared Error: 0.00142917555312868 #Root Mean Squared Error: 0.03780443827288907
