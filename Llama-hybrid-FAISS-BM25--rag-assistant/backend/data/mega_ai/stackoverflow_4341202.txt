If the larger images are really large, such that do not fit onto screen, then it may be reasonable to split them into smaller pieces. If you have usually to display the images reduced (zoomed out) then you can ease your work by creating and storing the reduced versions of larger images. The whole cascade of reduced images with sides x 0.707, x 0.5 etc takes maximally as lot of storage as original image. For lazy unloading you can load images (or fragments, or reduced versions) and remember the time when these were latest displayed and as lot of memory they take. Once you hit threshold but need to load more images you can unload starting from oldest to free up space.
