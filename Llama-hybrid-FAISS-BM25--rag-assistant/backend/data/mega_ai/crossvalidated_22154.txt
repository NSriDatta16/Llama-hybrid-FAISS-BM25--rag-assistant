Your data seems to be of the form $u=f(x,y,z,t)$, i.e., a time series for each point in space, where the space coordinates are window size, number of windows and offset. This can either be seen as a 4-dimensional array (the function $f$) or a set of points $(x,y,z,t,u)$ in a 5-dimensional space (the graph of $f$). Here are a few ideas to visualize high-dimensional datasets. The "grand tour" (available in applications such as ggobi ) is an animation that shows the cloud of points rotating in space, i.e., several, more or less random, projections of the 5-dimensional space into the plane. Since, for this dataset, the first four coordinates $(x,y,z,t)$ are arranged in a grid, you would just see that grid. Parallel coordinate plots and general dimensions reduction methods (PCA, MDS) are likely to present the same problems, because of the presence of the grid: the data really is 4-dimensional. You may be able to adapt some of the plots described in J. Klemela's book, Smoothing of Multivariate Data (they are designed for densities, but should also work for functions defined on a grid, as here), but they are not very standard, and understanding what they actually mean takes a long, long time. You could slice the data: take points $(x,y,z)$ at random and plot the corresponding time series: you may be able to group them into different patterns (some could be increasing, others decreasing, others present a bump, some could be noisy, some could be smooth, etc.), either manually, or using some clustering algorithm. You could aggregate the data in the time dimension: for each point $(x,y,z)$, you could compute some "metrics" of the corresponding time series, e.g., maximum, minimum, average, range, absolute variation, etc. Each of those could be visualized as a 3-dimensional contour plot. You could aggregate the data in the space dimensions: plot $\sum_{x,y,z} f(x,y,z,t)$ versus $t$ (a single curve) or $\sum_{x,y} f(x,y,z,t)$ versus $t$ for all values of $z$ (many curves, either on the same plot or on different plots). You could replace the sum with the averge, the median, the standard deviation, etc.
