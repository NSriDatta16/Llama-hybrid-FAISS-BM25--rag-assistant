A SQL Server data page has 8k: 8192 bytes. From this a portion is reserved for the page header, leaving 8060 bytes the maximum lnegth a single row can have. In a row, the varbinary(n), varchar(n) and nvarchar(n) types cannot exceed 8000 bytes, which means that varchar(8000) is the maximum Ascii length and nvarchar(4000) is the maximum Unicode length (since Unicode stores each character on 2 bytes). The best explanation of all these details comes from Inside the Storage Engine: Anatomy of a page .
