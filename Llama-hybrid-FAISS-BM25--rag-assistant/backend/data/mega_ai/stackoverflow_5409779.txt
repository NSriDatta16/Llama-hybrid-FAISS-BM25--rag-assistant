too much reliance on localStorage?

I'm building a demo, and find that I am storing lots of data in localStorage, almost constantly writing and reading values, parsing and stringifying JSON, etc. etc. Do you find yourself relying on localStorage much? What are the dangers of overusing it? Are there dangers in regularly translating variables from and to JSON for storage? It seems to me that if I did a db storage of lots of this data, I'd significantly increase the number and size of queries to my db. The demo is very user focused, so I'm storing stuff like items the user has selected and input the user has provided. The data stored locally is only of value/interest to the user. If you were building something like a todo list with scheduled end dates and reminders, would you use localStorage? Why or why not? I know one limitation is that the user would only be able to view this content on one browser on one machine, but that isn't an issue for now.
