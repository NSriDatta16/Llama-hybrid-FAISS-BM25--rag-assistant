IF you string has a backslash in it, you should escape it twice : // value absolute_tag == "@#Pictures#zee\'s fav" select * from test where `absolute_tag` like '@#Pictures#zee\\\\\'%' From http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like Your query should look like SELECT id, absolute_tag, tag FROM c7_storage_tags WHERE users_id = 1 AND LOWER(absolute_tag) LIKE LOWER('@#Pictures#zee\\\\\'s fav%') Your original query was looking for a record with absoulte_tags begins with "@#Pictures#zee's fav"
