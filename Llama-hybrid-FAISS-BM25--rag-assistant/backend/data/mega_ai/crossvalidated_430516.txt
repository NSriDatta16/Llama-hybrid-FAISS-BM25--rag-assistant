Choose number or nothing with machine learning

I want to do supervised learning. I have a labeled dataset. Each label is normally a real number between [0,1] corresponding to a location of a certain object in the data, or NAN if the object is not present in the data. Is there a "recommended way" to convert my labels into valid labels? My ideas are: Train two different classifiers, one for existence of object, and one for its location Train one classifier, but with two outputs, one binary for existence, and one float for location Relabel all NANs as -1, and train one classifier that can be -1 or in [0,1]
