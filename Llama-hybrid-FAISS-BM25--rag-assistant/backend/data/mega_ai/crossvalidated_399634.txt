Is "the outcome" (second sentence) referring to the outcome of each arm of the clinical trial or to a single treatment effect (i.e. difference between the two arms)? Hm, hard to tell. My guess, based on the second paragraph, it's probably the difference for a pair, between the treatment vs non-treatment Why does the variance of two outcomes with a variance of 0.5 equal 1 when estimating the treatment effect based on a pair of observations? It assumes that the observations are independent. I.e., the variance of a sum equal the sum of the variances. Each $X_i$ is distributed $\mathcal{N}(\mu,1)$ , so why is $\bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,0.01)$ ? Remember variance is defined as \begin{aligned}\operatorname {Var} (X)=\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\operatorname {E} [X])^{2}\right]\\ =\operatorname {E} \left[X^{2}\right]-\operatorname {E} [X]^{2}\end{aligned} Here, you are comparing the variance of the random variable vs the variance of the sample mean. The variance of your sample is (where $\sigma^2$ is the variance: $$n\left({\frac {\sigma ^{2}}{n^{2}}}\right)={\frac {\sigma ^{2}}{n}}$$ (precisely, this is for the population variance and mean, but the article probably simplifies the concept of sample mean)
