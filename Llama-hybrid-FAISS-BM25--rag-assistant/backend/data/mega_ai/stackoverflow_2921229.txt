After playing around for some time, I found out how to solve my issue: First of all, everything depends on web.config and the tags it contains. For example, in my case, I was creating a separate config file for silverlight configurations, but at the end all I needed was to merge my silverlight's project web.config with the one I got on the main web site. Second, pay attention to connection strings used around silverlight project, in my case, I got many connection strings in some layers around the project, so I forgot to copy a couple of the on the main web.config and that was the reason I was having errors. Hope It helps somebody. Bye.
