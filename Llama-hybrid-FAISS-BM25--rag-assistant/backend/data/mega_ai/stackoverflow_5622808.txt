Control draggable movement in jQuery

how can I control de movement of a draggable in jquery? I need to do something similar to the "snap to grid" where the draggable moves every "x" and "y" pixels I can't use "grid: [x, y]" (2D) because I need to make the drag on an isometric grid (3D) (I will develop the grid later, I first need to controll the drag) for example: when I start the dragging, the draggable shouldn't move, it has to snap to another position when the "x" and "y" are under certain conditions thanks in advance!
