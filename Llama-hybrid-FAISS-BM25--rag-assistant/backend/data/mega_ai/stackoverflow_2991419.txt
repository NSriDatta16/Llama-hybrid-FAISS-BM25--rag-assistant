They take up different amounts of space and they have different ranges of acceptable values. Here are the sizes and ranges of values for SQL Server , other RDBMSes have similar documentation: MySQL Postgres Oracle (they just have a NUMBER datatype really) DB2 Turns out they all use the same specification (with a few minor exceptions noted below) but support various combinations of those types (Oracle not included because it has just a NUMBER datatype, see the above link): | SQL Server MySQL Postgres DB2 --------------------------------------------------- tinyint | X X smallint | X X X X mediumint | X int/integer | X X X X bigint | X X X X And they support the same value ranges (with one exception below) and all have the same storage requirements: | Bytes Range (signed) Range (unsigned) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- tinyint | 1 byte -128 to 127 0 to 255 smallint | 2 bytes -32768 to 32767 0 to 65535 mediumint | 3 bytes -8388608 to 8388607 0 to 16777215 int/integer | 4 bytes -2147483648 to 2147483647 0 to 4294967295 bigint | 8 bytes -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 0 to 18446744073709551615 The "unsigned" types are only available in MySQL, and the rest just use the signed ranges, with one notable exception: tinyint in SQL Server is unsigned and has a value range of 0 to 255
