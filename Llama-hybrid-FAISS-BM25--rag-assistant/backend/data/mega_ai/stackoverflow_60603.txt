I usually just have a PHP script that outputs the file directly to the browser with the appropriate Content-Type if(file_exists($filename)) { header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: private", false); header("Content-Type: " . $content-type); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"" . basename($filename) . "\";" ); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-Length: " . filesize($filename)); readfile("$filename"); }else{ print "ERROR: the file " . basename($filename) . " could not be downloaded because it did not exist."; } The only disadvantage is that, since this sets the HTTP header, it has be called before you have any other output. But you can have a link to the PHP download page and it will cause the browser to pop up a download box without messing up the content of the current page.
