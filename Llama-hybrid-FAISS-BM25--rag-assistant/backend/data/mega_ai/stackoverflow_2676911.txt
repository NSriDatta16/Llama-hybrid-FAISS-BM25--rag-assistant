Well, mostly this is not a tool issue, but one of organization - in the core. Tools: Look at TFS - it has integrated automatisms for source control, work item tracking and quality control in 2010. It has integrated reporting. You talk of many solutions with many projects - all organized in large trees possibly multiple projects under project management (different applications in a company, or stuff like Internet Explorer being on it's own development path). The rest really is organization. Architecture teams etc. - making sure it does not run down into one overloaded guy that stalls everything. MS does have a huge system - I hear the test farm for Visual studio (i.e. servers for running unit tests) is about 1000 machines or so. Many developers hit it constantly with validations ;) I also heard once that a full windows build took about a day ;) So, this really also runs down on enough machines - source control is nice ,but if you have thousand developers hitting you, a lonely file server is NOT enough.
