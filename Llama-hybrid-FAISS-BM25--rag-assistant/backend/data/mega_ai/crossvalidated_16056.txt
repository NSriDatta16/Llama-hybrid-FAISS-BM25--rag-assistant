Density related to sparseness measure

Are there any multi-variate continuous distributions whose probability distribution functions give high values for sparse vectors and low values for dense vectors, i. e. indicating the sparseness of the vector? I found one sparseness measure in [1] which is as follows for $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$: $$s(x) = \frac{\sqrt{n}-\frac{\sum |x_i|}{\sqrt{\sum x_i^2}}}{\sqrt{n}-1}$$ It gives 1 if the vector has only one non-zero element and 0 if all the elements are equal as given below (the image is from the referenced paper). This seems to be a good candidate for a potential instead of a density and it helps in my case since I compute the likelihood on the given data. I wonder if there exists any known distributions which can be used in this case. And how can I generate random vectors belonging to that distribution? [1] P. O.
