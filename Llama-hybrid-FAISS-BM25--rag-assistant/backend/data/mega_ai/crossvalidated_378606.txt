Bayesian interval estimation. Let $\theta$ be P(Success) and the prior distribution be $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(.5,.5).$ Then if you observe $x$ successes in $n$ trials, the likelihood is proportional to $\theta^x(1-\theta)^{n-x},$ so that the posterior distribution of $\theta$ conditional on the data is $\mathsf{Beta}(.5+x,\, .5+ n-x).$ Then a 95% Bayesian posterior probability interval uses quantiles .025 and .975 of the posterior beta distribution. (To get a one-sided interval with an upper bound, use quantile 0.95.) If you are willing to overlook the difference in interpretation between a Bayesian posterior (or credible) interval and a frequentist confidence interval, you might use the Bayesian interval based on the Jeffreys prior as a confidence interval. With $x = 3$ successes in $n = 100$ trials, the one sided 95% Jeffreys interval would give the upper bound $0.068.$ The corresponding two sided 95% interval is $(0.0085, 0.0779).$ [Computation in R.] qbeta(.95, 3.5, 97.5) [1] 0.06875679 qbeta(c(.025, .975), 3.5, 97.5) [1] 0.008520283 0.077887569 Frequentist Confidence intervals. In a frequentist context with a normal approximation, the Wald 95% CI is of the form $\hat \theta \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat \theta(1-\hat\theta)}{n}}.$ where $\hat \theta = x/n.$ If $\theta$ is far from $1/2$ and $n$ is relatively small, the Wald interval (originally proposed as an asymptotic interval) may not have the advertised 95% coverage probability: first, because the normal approximation may not be accurate; second, because the standard error may not be well approximated by using $\hat \theta$ instead of $\theta.$ In the cases $x = 0$ and $x =n,$ the Wald interval degenerates to a point. Agresti ("plus-four"), Wilson, and Clopper-Pearson intervals are substantially better, mitigating the second difficulty, but not the first. For comparison, the two-sided 95% Agresti CI (formula here) based on 3 successes in 100 trials is $(0.0070, 0.0892).$ n = 104; p = 5/104; pm = c(-1,1) p + pm*1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) [1] 0.006961131 0.089192715 True coverage probabilities of frequentist CIs vary as $\theta = P(\text{Success})$ varies. Because of the discreteness of the binomial distribution, the variation can be surprisingly large. For $n = 100,$ the actual coverage probability of the "95%" Wald interval is below 95% for 'most' values of $\theta.$ The performance is sufficiently bad that its use is now deprecated. Agresti 95% CIs generally have close to the promised coverage probability (and sometimes a little better near $\theta = 0$ and $1.)$ While other intervals may be a bit more accurate, the Agresti style of CI is widely used because its formula is easy to remember and use. When regarded as a frequentist CI, the Jeffries interval is reasonably accurate for most values of $\theta.$ (Regarded as a Bayesian posterior probability interval, the Jeffries interval always contains 95% probability according to the posterior distribution. So from a Bayesian point of view, if you believe the Prior and trust the integrity of the data, then you believe the interval. Remember that in a Bayesian framework $\theta$ is a random variable, not a fixed, unknown value.)
