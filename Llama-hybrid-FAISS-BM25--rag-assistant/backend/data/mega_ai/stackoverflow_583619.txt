Depends on what you mean by the central GPS point. You could simply take the average of all the points, as suggested by Stephen - but keep in mind that GPS coordinates are not continuous - this will fail spectacularly around discontinuities such as the poles. In most cases you'll need to convert to a coordinate system that doesn't have this issue. You could also look at all the points bounded by it, calculated all the distances to each GPS point, and minimize the sum of the distances to all the GPS points. You'll need to look into great circle calculations for this. Further, each GPS might have a higher or lower degree of uncertainty, you should take that into account and weight them accordingly. What exactly are you trying to find out? -Adam
