Your syntax is correct but I don't think that your system of equations has a solution. When I pushed them through Mathematica it returned an empty list which usually indicates that there is no solution. The version of MATLAB you are using uses MuPad as it's symbolic computation engine but they used to use Maple. I have the most recent version of the Maple version of the symbolic toolbox and when I put your expression into it I get Warning: Explicit solution could not be found. In solve at 140 ans = [ empty sym ] So I would suggest that there is no solution to this system of equations and the new Mupad symbolic engine simply doesn't handle this fact very elegantly. Update: Attempting to solve this numerically in Mathematica results in complaints about a singular Jacobian no matter what starting values I choose. I simply do not know how to prove that your equations have no solution but I strongly suspect this is the case.
