NSScrollView (or NSClipview) focus ring?

I have a custom NSView in an NSScrollView. I am trying to draw a focus ring round an NSScrollView (or perhaps the NSClipView) so that when my custom view receives a drag-drop hover the scroll view appears to get focus. How on earth do I do this? I don't want to have to subclass NSScrollView ... do I?
