Equivalence of regression models and ARIMA models?

I came across the below statement in this article : "An appropriate model for analyzing this time series in a least squares framework is to take the logarithm of the data and regress it on its lagged values at lag 1 and 12. This corresponds to a multiplicative SARIMA(1, 0, 0)(1, 0, 0)12 model fitted by OLS. Another possibility would be to take first differences instead of logs which leads to very similar results, with slightly inferior fits." Are there any general rules about when regression and ARIMA models are equivalent? (I want to use the R package strucchange for monitoring, but I am not happy with having to fit all my models as regression models) Thanks!
