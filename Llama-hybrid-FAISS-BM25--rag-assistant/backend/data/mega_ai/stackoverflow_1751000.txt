Function call vs. member function call overhead is unlikely to be the limiting factor, compared to file input and the algorithm itself. C++ iostreams are not necessarily super high speed. C has 'restrict' if you're really optimizing, in C++ it's easier to inline function calls. Overall, C++ offers more options for organizing your code clearly, but if it's not a big program, or you're just going to write it in a similar manner whether it's C or C++, then the portability of C libraries becomes more important.
