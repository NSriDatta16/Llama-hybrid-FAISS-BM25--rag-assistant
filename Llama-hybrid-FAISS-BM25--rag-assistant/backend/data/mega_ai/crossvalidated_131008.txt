This depends on if you are a purist, a pragmatist, or a data dredger. The purist will only ever try one transformation, and that is based only on the science and previous knowledge and will be chosen before any data is collected (or looked at). This is the safest approach, but can also loose out on gaining insight from the data. The data dredger will try every possible transformation until they find one that gives them the answer that they want. This can result in impressive results, but also ends in over fitting models and unreproducible results. The pragmatist (the largest and most productive group) recognizes that there are things that we can learn from the data, but also is wary of over fitting the data. They will look at a few possible transforms that are justified by the science, or try splines or other smooths with a reasonable smoothness constraint. They will also do things like cross-validation to make sure that their experimenting has not resulted in over fitting and reign things back if it has. They will then also be honest about what they did (explaining which transforms were experimented with in the discussion) and look for validation in a follow-up study. I recommend the pragmatic approach.
