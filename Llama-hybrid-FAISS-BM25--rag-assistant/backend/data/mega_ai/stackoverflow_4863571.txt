How to change the namespace of Silverlight RIA Service -- Remove tempuri.org

I am developing a Silverlight 4 application using RIA Services, and I have the RIA Services SP1 Beta tools. It would appear, upon inspection in Fiddler, that my Domain Service is in the namespace http://tempuri.org . I'd like to control the namespace. Is is possible to swap out http://tempuri.org for something more meaningful to my organization?
