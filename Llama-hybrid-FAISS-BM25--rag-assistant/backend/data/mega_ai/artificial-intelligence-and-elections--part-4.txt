the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion". For example, Spamouflage has increasingly used generative AI for influence operations. Outside of the US elections, a deepfake video of Moldova’s pro-Western president Maia Sandu shows her "throwing her support behind a political party friendly to Russia." Officials in Moldova "believe the Russian government is behind the activity". Slovakia's liberal party leader had audio clips faked which discussed "vote rigging and raising the price of beer". The Chinese government has used AI to stir concerns about US interference in Taiwan. A fake clip seen on social media showed a fake video of the vice chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee promising "stronger U.S. military support for Taiwan if the incumbent party’s candidates were elected in January". Ethics of AI use in political campaigning As the use of AI and its associated tools in political campaigning and messaging increases, many ethical concerns have been raised. Campaigns have used AI in a number of ways, including speech writing, fundraising, voter behaviour prediction, fake robocalls and the generation of fake news. At the moment there are no US federal rules when it comes to using AI in campaigning and so its use can undermine public trust. Yet according to one expert: "A lot of the questions we're asking about AI are the same questions we've asked about rhetoric and persuasion for thousands of years." As more insight into how AI is used becomes ever greater, concerns have become much broader than just the generating of misinformation or fake news. Its use by politicians and political parties for "purposes that are not overtly malicious" can also raise ethical worries. For instance, the use of 'softfakes' have become more common. These can be images, videos or audio clips that have been edited, often by campaign teams, "to make a political candidate seem more appealing." An example can be found in Indonesia's presidential election where the winning candidate created and promoted cartoonish avatars so as to rebrand himself. How citizens come by information has been increasingly impacted by AI, especially through online platforms and social media. These platforms are part of complex and opaque systems which can result in a "significant impact on freedom of expression", with the generalisation of AI in campaigns also creating huge pressures on "voters’ mental security". As the frequency of AI use in political campaigning becomes common, together with globalization, more 'universalized' content can be used so that territorial boundaries matter less. While AI collides with the reasoning processes of people, the creation of "dangerous behaviours" can happen which disrupt important levels of society and nation states.
