Support Vector Machine for Noisy neighbour detection in Openstack

What must the feature matrix (that is to be fed to the SVM classifier) comprised of, when you want to identify which VM (virtual machine) is the noisy neighbour in the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure? I am trying to form the feature matrix from the ceilometer logs from OpenStack. Can someone suggest what has to be done?
