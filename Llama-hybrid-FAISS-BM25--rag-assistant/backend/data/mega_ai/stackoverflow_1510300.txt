As you have D2007 and assuming all these component sets come with D2007 dcus as well, I'll advise you to first try reopen the codebase on D2007. And after that, go to D2010 because of the Unicode feature of the actual VCL - which can create some migration problems (which I'll not discuss here because it's deeply discussed on the web and here on SO ). I'd say that because somewhere between D5 and D7 (don't record exactly) happened an unit reorganization of the rtl (with the creation of the Variants.pas unit and many OTAPI units changed names, etc). So that will be where your first problems arise. EDIT:Not only Variants got relocated, but much IDE integration stuff too - to avoid unlicensed code to get deployed. If you have some OTAPI code (for example, code that allows published properties on inherited forms), it'll need to be relocated to a package project. As skramradt said, you may have to deal with the binary DFM thing.... After that, if all works, go to the Unicode thing. Depending on the app, it can be easy or not. For mine ones, not of great annoyance. But I know there are others facing greater problems with it than me.
