You mentioned this is for your personal website. On my personal site (for example, bobsomers.com) I just have a paragraph that says this: The best way to get in contact with me before the new site is up is to send me an email. My email address is my first name at this website. If you can't figure it out from that hint, well, you might find email more of a challenge than figuring out my address. People seem to be able to figure that out just fine, as I get legitimate email all the time. Sometimes the best solutions don't require writing any code. :)
