It depends on how you define elegant. So I;m going to go with my own definition: Symmetric. Readable. Avoids unnecessary complexity. With that in mind, I'd just go for: if( a ) { if( b ) { ... } else { ... } } else { if( b ) { ... } else { ... } } It isn't any less verbose than your idea but at least it's crystal clear what is meant there. Having said that, I find control structures like this highly suspicious. You can probably either: Use a (two-dimensional) constant array to fetch a value, if all you do is assign a value to a variable. Rephrase the whole block to avoid redundantly calling similar code. Maybe factor out one of the checks into a function. You may not need two separate booleans at all, a single variable with 4 possible values would be more expressive and you could then use a switch/case structure.
