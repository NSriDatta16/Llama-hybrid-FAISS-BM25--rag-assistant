Linear Regression with Category variables

I'm currently learning and exploring machine learning and understand the basics of linear regression based on two numerical variables, but now I wish to go a little further and need some guidance understanding how to go about it. Specifically, I'm now learning about linear regression with categorical variables , and I understand the gist of it: We just encode the categorical variable to some sort of numerical representation (like one-hot encoding) and put it in the model. Great. While there are many guides on how to do various encoding methods etc. online, I haven't really found a resource that explains the use-cases of such a method: under what kind of circumstances would using categorical data to predict a numeric value be useful? And what type of data format should I have my data in before doing the encoding? (does having two columns with one numeric results and the other the corresponding category work?) I would also like to know the different ways we can visualize and analyse the results of our model (and its predictions), especially if we have a sizeable amount of categorical variables. Sorry if this is too many questions in one post, I need some guidance on the concept. All the online resources are telling me how to implement the model, but not when and why to use it.
