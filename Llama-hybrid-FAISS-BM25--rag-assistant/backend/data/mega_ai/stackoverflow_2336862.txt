Organizing thousands of images on a server

I'm developing a website which might grow up to a few thousand users, all of which would upload up to ten pictures on the server. I'm wondering what would be the best way of storing pictures. Lets assume that I have, 5000 users with 10 pictures each, which gives us 50 000 pics. (I guess it wouldn't be a good idea to store them in the database in blobs ;) ) Would it be a good way to dynamically create directories for every 100 users registered, (50 dirs in total, assuming 5000 users), and upload their pictures there? Would naming convention 'xxx_yy.jpg' (xxx being user id and yy picture number) be ok? In this case, however, there would be 1000 (100x10) pictures in one folder, isn't it too many?
