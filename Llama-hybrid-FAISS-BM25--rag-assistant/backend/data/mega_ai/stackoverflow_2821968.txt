I'd recommend trying SpecFlow It's weird that no-one's mentioned it. There's a great article here about using BDD with Specflow and Asp.Net MVC It's open source and is hosted on GitHub Spec flow uses the GWT (Given When Then) syntax which I personally really like. We've had great success so far with BDD now trying to implement using SpecFlow. It's still early days yet but so far it's going well. Pros: Integrates into VS2008 & VS2010 with a nice plugin Uses popular Given When Then vocabulary Uses standard NUnit Test Runner Feature file lets you simply paste in Scenarios from Business Analysts Cons: the feature code behind is a little ugly, though nothing to bad As far as I know, the reporting format is fairly limited (i just use NUnit) I encourage you to give it a go.
