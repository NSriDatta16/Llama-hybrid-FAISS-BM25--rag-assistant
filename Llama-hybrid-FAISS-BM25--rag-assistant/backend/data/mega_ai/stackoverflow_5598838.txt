I would use region rather than match . Here is part of my manuscript syntax file that highlights speech: :syntax region msSpeech start=/"/ end=/"\|\n\n/ :highlight msSpeech guifg=#000088 It starts with a double quote and ends with another double quote or the end of the paragraph. It will highlight multiple lines if need be.
