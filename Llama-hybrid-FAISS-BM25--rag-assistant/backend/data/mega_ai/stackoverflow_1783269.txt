Oh boy, you won't be short of examples. Just Google PHP tutorial and every single one of them has enough holes to fill the Albert Hall. Result 1, w3schools. What's their first example to include user input? Welcome ! Bzzt. HTML injection, repeated throughout every piece of example code. What's their first database query? $sql="INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, Age) VALUES ('$_POST[firstname]','$_POST[lastname]','$_POST[age]')"; Bzzt. SQL injection, you lose. Next. Result 2, official PHP tutorial. What's the first example of outputting a variable? echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; Bzzt. HTML injection. Not an easily-exploitable one, but still, bad practice of the sort that is repeated throughout php.net's learning materials. Result 3, tizag.com. What's the first example of echoing user input? echo "You ordered ". $quantity . " " . $item . ". "; Bzzt. Result 4, freewebmasterhelp.com. Too basic to include much, but still manages: print "Hello $name"; // Welcome to the user Bzzt. Result 5, learnphp-tutorial.com. World! Bz... I could go on. Is it any wonder the general quality of PHP code in the wild is so disastrous, when this woeful rubbish is what coders are learning?
