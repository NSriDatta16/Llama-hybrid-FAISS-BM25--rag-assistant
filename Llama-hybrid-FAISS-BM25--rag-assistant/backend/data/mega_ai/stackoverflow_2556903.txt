touchesBegan is method of UIView class, and it should be implemented in subclass of UIView (or of UIImageView in your case). Not in some outer class where you implement animation block! So ensure that you create subclass of UIImageView e.g. RyuImageView and implement touchesBegan method. Then you should inform your object with animation block that ryuView was touched. You can use delegate method for this. See answer Xcode: How to change Image on Touching at an Image (same Position)? as sample. And yes, set UIImageView's userInteractionEnabled to YES because default value of this property of UIImageView is NO do it either in initWith... method of RyuImageView: self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; or in your animation block class: ryuView.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
