Calculate x/y point that 2 moving balls will collide

I'm trying to make what is (essentially) a simple pool game, and would like to be able to predict where a shot will go once it hits another ball. The first part is, I believe, to calculate if the cueball will hit anything, and if it does, where it collides. I can work out collision points for a line and a ball, but not 2 balls. So given the x/y positions and velocities of 2 balls, how do I calculate the point at which they collide? (PS: Im aware I can do this by calculating the distance between the two balls every step along the way, but I was hoping for something a little more elegant and optimal.) Example of setup: trying to calculate the red dot http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6202117/circle.PNG
