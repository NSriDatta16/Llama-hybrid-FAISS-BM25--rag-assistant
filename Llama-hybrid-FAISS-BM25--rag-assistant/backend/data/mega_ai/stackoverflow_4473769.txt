Splitting time and date in two separate date columns, in SQL server, is best practice?

Is it best practice to split a dateTime in two datetime SQL columns? For example, 2010-12-17 01:55:00.000 is put in two colums, one column containing a datetime for the date portion: 2010-12-17 00:00:00.000 one column containing a datetime for the time portion: 1900-01-01 01:55:00.000 I'm being told this is best practice because at some point SQL 2000 didn't allow to put time in a date? and that there are even data storage standards that enforce this and that some companies have ensure that all their data is stored in that manner to comply to some data storage standards? If this is the case, I'm sure someone heard about it here, any of this sounds familiar?
