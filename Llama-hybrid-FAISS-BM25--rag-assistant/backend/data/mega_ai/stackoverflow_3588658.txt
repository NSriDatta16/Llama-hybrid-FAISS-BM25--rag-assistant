How do I detect an animated GIF's ticks per second?

I'm looking for a way to detect the (average) frame rate of an animated GIF using Linux. PHP's Imagick class seems to provide this functionality but I rather avoid installing a ton of libraries to get it to work. http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagick-getimagetickspersecond.php Is there a simple way to do this?
