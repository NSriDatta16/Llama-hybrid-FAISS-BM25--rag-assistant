I thing Megamap is what you are looking for: http://megamap.sourceforge.net/ . Here is a short description of Megamap from its homepage: MegaMap is a Java implementation of a map (or hashtable) that can store an unbounded amount of data, limited only by the amount of disk space available. Objects stored in the map are persisted to disk. Good performance is achieved by an in-memory cache. The MegaMap can, for all practical reasons, be thought of as a map implementation with unlimited storage space.
