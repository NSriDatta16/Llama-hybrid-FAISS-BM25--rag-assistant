If you are looking for a good book going over how to Unit Test I would recommend Kent Beck's : Test Driven Development: By Example . He is the person who really started the idea of Unit Testing, so regardless of language this would be a great book to read to get a good foundation. Also, Don't let the title discourage you. It does talk about TDD, but it's really just a good easy overview, of how to write effective unit tests, and how they should affect your design which is a key component of writing unit tests.
