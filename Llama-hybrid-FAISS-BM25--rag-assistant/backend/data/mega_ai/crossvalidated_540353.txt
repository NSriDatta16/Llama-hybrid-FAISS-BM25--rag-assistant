How to interpret the ACF of the residuals

I am dealing with time series but I am not used to it and I am not understanding what the ACF of the residuals mean. I used the auto.arima package in R to find the best model specification for my data. By looking the plots bellow, the residuals seem to have mean zero and be normally distributed. But what about the ACF? Also, Ljung-Box test gave me a p-value = 0.05551
