The simplest and most widely used in-memory Key-value storage is MemcacheD . The introduction page re-iterates what you are asking for: Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering. The client list is impressive. It's been for a long time. Good documentation. It has API for almost every programming language. Horizontal scaling is pretty simple. As my experience goes Memcached is good. You may also want to look into MemBase .
