Your question is not specific for "games programming". You are asking how arbitrary data is organized and stored in bigger programs. There is no definite answer to this, there are lots of different approaches. A common general approach is to make a data model of all the things you want to store. In C++ (or any other languages with object oriented capabilities), one can create an object oriented class model for this purpose. This introduction to C++ contains a complete tutorial on object oriented modeling in C++. Lots of applications in general use a layered approach - the data model is one layer in your application, separated from other layers like a presentation layer or application ("game") logic. Your data modeling approach will have to deal with persistency (that means, you want to store all your data on disk and reload it later). This question was asked earlier here on SO . This fact will give you some restrictions, for example, on the use of pointers. EDIT: if your data model reaches a certain complexity, you might consider using a (lightweight) database, like SQLlite , which has a C/C++ api. Finally, here is a link that might give you a good start, seems to fit exactly on your question: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/26590-data-modeling-for-games-in-c-part-i/
