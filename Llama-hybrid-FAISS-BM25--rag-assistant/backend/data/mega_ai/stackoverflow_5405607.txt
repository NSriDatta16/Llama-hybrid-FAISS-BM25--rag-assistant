Gallery does not have the customization hooks to support doing what you want without a custom implementation. What you should take a look at is the source code for the Gallery widget: Gallery.java Use this as a starting point for a custom widget that does exactly what you want. In particular, pay attention to the method setSelectionToCenterChild() which is part of how the current Gallery does it's selection. Many of the methods are not private, so you may be able to get away with subclassing and overriding methods...but most likely you will need to take this source and create a new class. Hope that Helps!
