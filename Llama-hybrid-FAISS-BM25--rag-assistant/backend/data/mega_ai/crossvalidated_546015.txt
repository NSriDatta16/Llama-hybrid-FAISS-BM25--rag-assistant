How to: survival analysis study design

I'm struggling to understand what the correct start date would be for my analysis. I have cross-sectional data for an insurance company and the goal is to perform survival analysis to understand churn behaviour. Each record contains information for one insurance policy (so if the policy gets renewed, the record is the same, but if the terms change, then the record is terminated and a new one is generated). The two alternatives that I've seen in research concerning this topic are: The first option would be to only consider registries that correspond to policies bought after the start of the study (calendar time). The $T_0$ for each individual would be the start of the coverage. This is what's suggested in Gustafsson's thesis and this other paper . The second option would be to start the observation for each individual at the first renewal date after the calendar date set for the beginning of the study. This is how Fu and Wang, address the problem, although they use a panel data approach. Any clarification and comments regarding what approach makes more sense given the task at hand would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
