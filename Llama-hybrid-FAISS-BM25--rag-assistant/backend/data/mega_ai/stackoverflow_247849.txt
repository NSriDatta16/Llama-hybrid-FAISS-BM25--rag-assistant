How do you graph with Silverlight inside a ASP.NET v3.5 application?

I have the need to do some graphing (bar, chart, pie, trend) and instead of using Infragistics or manually drawing the graphs I want to use Silverlight. My current ASP.NET application was upgraded to 3.5 and I have added a Silverlight Application project. Consuming the output inside of the existing master.page layout or inside of user controls does not seem to be as intuitive as I was hoping for. Nor is the ability to create a graph from a generics listing of data even a control (like I have seen in several demonstrations at PDC08). Any ideas?
