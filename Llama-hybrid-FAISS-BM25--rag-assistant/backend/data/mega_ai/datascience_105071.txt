Can we use autoencoders to change an existing image instead of create one from scratch?

I'm trying to think if we can use autoencoders to edit an existing image instead of saying, creating a new one from scratch. To give an example, say I train my data on the MNIST dataset. If I now give my model a 9 and ask it to convert to an 8, would it be able to alter the pixels to create 8? If yes, can you point me to some resources for doing this?
