I don't tackle the question which one is best. If you want to handle text-files, I'd consider ConfigParser -module . Another you could give a try would be simplejson or yaml . You could also consider a real db table. For instance, you could have a table called userattrs, with three columns: Int user_id String attribute_name String attribute_value If there's only few, you could store them into cookies for quick retrieval.
