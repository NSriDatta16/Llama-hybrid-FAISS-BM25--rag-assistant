What are the security risks using cmdexec?

We are in the process of migrating from SQL 2000 to SQL 2005. We have hundreds of DTS pacakges, that the development team is reluctant to redevelop using SSIS. When migrating these packages to SSIS, I am faced with a problem - many of these packages read from Excel files. Given that my production Box is 64 bit, I am forced to use CmdExec sub-system to call the 32 bit runtime to execute these packages. My question here is : What are the security risks involved with using CmdExec subsystem to schedule these SSIS packages as SQL agent jobs? Thanks, Raj
