I finally found how to do it : I implemented ISelectionService and in the SetSelectedComponents function, I managed to select the label control associated with any selected control. I overrided the designer of the label, so that no border/resize-rectangle would show when the label is selected. This is a not very elegant solution, but it works well =).
