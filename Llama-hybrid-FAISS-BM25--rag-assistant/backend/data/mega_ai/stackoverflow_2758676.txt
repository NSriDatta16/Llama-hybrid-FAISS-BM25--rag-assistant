write client ip in iis 7.0 log over firewalls

I need a solution for IIS 7.0 which runs on windows server 2008 64bit to write my clients IP to IIS logs while the server is behind firewalls and proxies (Pass X-Forwarded-For header value). I've tried to install the an ISAPI Filter written by Joe Pruitt. it works great on Windows Server 2003 32bit IIS 6.0, but seems to do nothing at all on windows server 2008 64bit IIS 7.0. Did anyone try this ISAPI filter on this version of OS? or have another solution? link to the Joe Pruitt's (from F5) ISAPI filter: http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/Joe/archive/2009/08/19/x_forwarded_for_log_filter_for_windows_servers.aspx best regards, guy bertental
