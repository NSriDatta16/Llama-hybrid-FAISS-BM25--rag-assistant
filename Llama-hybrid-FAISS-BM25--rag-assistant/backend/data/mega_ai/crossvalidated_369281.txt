Multivariate Binary Logistic Regression with Multiple Binary Independent Variables

I am trying to predict a binary response based on multiple binary independent variables, some categorical data, and some continuous data. My data set looks similar to: Y B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 Ca1 Ca2 Co1 Co2 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 A A 1.5 1.7 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 B C 2.3 1.1 ... Unfortunately, my n is only 119 . Of these, y=1 in only 4 observations. I am assuming that I am therefore underpowered to detect much of anything significant. My end goal is to try to build a model whereby I can assign a weight to each variable to create a cutoff point where an 80% probability of y=1 exists. So for example, B1 is assigned 5 points, B2 is assigned 1 point, and so on. Then when added up, if points > 15 , then probablity > 80% that y = 1 . This is not dissimilar to the Canadian Head CT rule . What is the appropriate statistical methodology to undertake this kind of endeavor?
