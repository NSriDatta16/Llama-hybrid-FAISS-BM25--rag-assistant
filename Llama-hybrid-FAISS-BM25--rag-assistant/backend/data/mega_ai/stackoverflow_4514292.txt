Magento instance pointing to wrong database

Anyone ever have this problem? local.xml has been modified. core_config_data table has been modified for unsecure and secure url as well as cookie domain. Cache dirs have been wiped clean, session values have been cleared, log tables have been truncated. it is under version control with subversion. have also run find to locate where it could possibly be getting the production DB IP. find ~/path/to/application -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l "IP Of incorrect DB" yet still throwing an error on DB SQLSTATE[HY000] [2003] Can't connect to MySQL server on 'IP of incorrect DB' (4) Extremely baffled and can not for the life of me locate where it would possibly be getting the production DB's IP local.xml points to development address.
