Autoregressive (AR) models constants - Time Series Analysis

I'm currently struggling with different Model like AR or MA. If AR(1) is expressed as: $y_t = \beta + \beta_t \times y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $ How do I know what the $\beta$ 's would be? What are the dependencies? I think a simple example would help a lot.
