Kohonen said that a zero radius is equivalent to k-means. The general algorithm will always select a single node as the winner, but radius = 0 means that it does not share any of that information with its neighbours. What is most important to understand is that the neighborhood function has a very central role in the operation of the SOM, and its radius should never go to zero, because otherwise the algorithm would lose its ordering power and would be reduced to the classic k-means algorithm.
