Implementing an SNMP Reporter (agent) in C# (must run on Mono)?

I am attempting to implement some additional statistics gathering in a C# server application - I have about 20 or so variables I'd like to be able to report to network monitoring tools; so I am assuming (hopefully correctly) that SNMP is the correct way to go. There are however two problems: The application is an open source server that cant include proprietary components, and It needs to run on Mono under *nix environs as well as Windows via .NET. The "#SNMP" library at http://sharpsnmplib.codeplex.com/ appears to be a promising solution - but there are no samples I can find; and my knowledge of SNMP is lacking. Does anyone here have any (quick) examples of reporting data via SNMP? (ideally using a library under the LGPL, X/MIT, BSD or Zlib licenses) Help much appreciated Edit: The problem appears to be a lack of libraries capable of acting as SNMP servers, if anyone is aware of any - this would probably solve the problem nicely. Edit #2: Basically I'm looking for a SNMP server library or sample reference implementation.
