For layout-driven CSS, be sure to check out Everything You Know About CSS Is Wrong . It's a bit cutting edge, since IE 7 doesn't support display: table (pity, I know), but it does cover traditional layout CSS techniques like floating and absolute positioning, and provides a good transition from table-based layouts to CSS ones. I highly recommend it. I don't know if you're building off of any dynamic language or if you're just coding raw HTML, but you should also look at using SASS in your projects, as I think it helps force you to pay more attention to inheritance. Otherwise, reviewing more "rudimentary" tutorials (like CSS for Dummies) might actually be helpful, as they go over a lot of CSS's fundamental principals in detail.

Generally, I find it best to write my content with no regard what-so-ever to how it will look later, then use CSS later to make it gorgeous. As always, you can pick up lots of neat tips and tricks at CSS Tricks , which have always helped me learn more about the correct usage of the language (like when I learned about overflow: auto for contained floating elements! Genius!). Hope that helps!
