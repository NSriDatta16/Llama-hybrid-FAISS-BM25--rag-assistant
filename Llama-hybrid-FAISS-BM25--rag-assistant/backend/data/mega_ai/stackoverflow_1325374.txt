Research into Advantages of Having a Standard Coding Style

There are a couple of questions on Stackoverflow on whether there is any research or studies into what is the best coding convention/style. That's not what this question is about. This question is about whether there are any studies that research whether there are any advantages, productivity gains or other positive side effects to having an organization-wide coding convention and style. I have my own opinions on this, which is basically that there is huge benefits to having such standards in place. Honestly, I couldn't care less what style I am required to use as long as it is consistent in all the code I might have to work with. I just want to know if there are any studies that back my opinions or contradict them.
