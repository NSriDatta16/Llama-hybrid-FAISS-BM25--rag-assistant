How can I draw a circle on an image in MATLAB?

I have an image in MATLAB: im = rgb2gray(imread('some_image.jpg'); % normalize the image to be between 0 and 1 im = im/max(max(im)); And I've done some processing that resulted in a number of points that I want to highlight: points = some_processing(im); Where points is a matrix the same size as im with ones in the interesting points. Now I want to draw a circle on the image in all the places where points is 1. Is there any function in MATLAB that does this? The best I can come up with is: [x_p, y_p] = find (points); [x, y] = meshgrid(1:size(im,1), 1:size(im,2)) r = 5; circles = zeros(size(im)); for k = 1:length(x_p) circles = circles + (floor((x - x_p(k)).^2 + (y - y_p(k)).^2) == r); end % normalize circles circles = circles/max(max(circles)); output = im + circles; imshow(output) This seems more than somewhat inelegant. Is there a way to draw circles similar to the line function?
