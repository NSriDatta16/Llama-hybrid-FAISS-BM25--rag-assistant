Where can I get freely available audio, graphics, and other resources for games?

I've done a google search of this topic, but so far haven't found anything satisfactory. From your experience, what's the best place to get game resources, like sprites, backgrounds, sound effects, music, etc.? To be more specific, I'm looking for more of sound effects and music, which I'm currently lacking more than graphics. However, for graphics, I've tried getting random graphics from different sites, but they just don't match. I don't want to copy one entire graphics package either. The resources should be free and easy to obtain. The products I intend to make are free if not open source, and are unlikely to receive widespread attention or produce profit for myself, so I'd like something that I can use and distribute freely. I don't have enough graphics and musical knowledge to attempt to create resources from scratch and don't know anyone willing to do so. I'm working with Java. I'm sure I can read all kinds of file formats with it, or if not, I can always use software to convert resources.
