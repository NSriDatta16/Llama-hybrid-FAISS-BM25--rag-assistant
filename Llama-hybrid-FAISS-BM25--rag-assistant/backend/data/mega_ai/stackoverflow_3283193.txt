I'm in your shoes as well. I've got an upgrade to do as well, and trying to do it automatically didn't work out well at all. Here's the only upgrade path I've gotten to work: Install a fresh copy of 1.4.1.0 Backup 1.3.2.3 via Magento Move media files from 1.3.2.3 Bring skin over, convert to 1.4.1.0's new requirements Bring modules over - turn error reporting on, and check for issues (there were a ton with ours) Good luck. I'm still having some issues with ours :(
