The average money supply growth rate drops from $20\%$ to $15\%$ , or $5\%$ next year. In terms of standard deviations, that is $.05/.04 = 1.25 $ standard deviations next year. Since the correlation between average money supply growth rate and average inflation rate is $60\%$ , we can expect the inflation rate to be down $60\%$ of $1.25 \times$ its standard deviation next year, which is $0.06$ . expected inflation next year $= .25 - 0.60 \times 1.25 \times .06=0.205 $
