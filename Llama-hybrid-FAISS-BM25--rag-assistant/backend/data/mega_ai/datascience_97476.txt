Image classification with CNNs

I created an image classification model using CNNs for 235 classes and I got 71% accuracy on the test set. My dataset contains some classes with more than 1000 images and others with 30 images. For example, in the classification report I can see that I have 98% accuracy for the classes that contains a lot of images but less than 20% accuracy for other classes with few images. I used data augmentation but it still not good. This influences the performance of my model, can anyone help me to improve it? Thank you
