Do loadings in PCA describe variation around the mean?

I found this statement in one paper about statistical process control and monitoring: The P loading matrices contain all the structural information about how the variable measurements should deviate from their mean values at each observation Why is this true? Edit: Some reference for better understanding of the context of the question: Monitoring Batch Processes Using Multiway Principal Component Analysis - Nomikos & McGregor ( the paper from which the cite came. pp 8 ) Statistical process control of multivariate processes - McGregor & Kourti
