One cucumber step can do an awful lot of work, I don't think adding it to your code/test ratio would actually make sense. What information is it giving you? What if you are executing multiple dependent steps? Cucumber tests are integration tests, they are not a replacement for controller/unit tests, but are to be done in conjunction with them. You might be more interested in the resulting code coverage obtained by your cucumber tests, this will be a far more useful metric.
