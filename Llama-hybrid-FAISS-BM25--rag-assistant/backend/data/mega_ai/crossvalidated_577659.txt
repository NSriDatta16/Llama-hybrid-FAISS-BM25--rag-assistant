Regression Modelling with Sets of Vectors

Hi I've a regression Machine Learning problem of the following form: Input: $\{(o_i,v_i)| o_i \in R^d, v_i \in R , i \in \{1,2,3,...M\} \}$ Output: $s \in R$ I can use a neural model (probably deep sets ) however $o_i \in R^d$ is a feature vector that is a concatenation of multiple categorical and continuous variables. Are there research papers dealing with similar input? What other model options do I have? N.T. I have kept $o_i$ and $v_i$ separate as in the training dataset $o_i$ appears with a broad range of $v_i$ . Think of it as multiple amount ( $v_i$ ) of ingredients ( $o_i$ ) are getting added in different recipes and we are measuring measuring the 'hotness' of the food. Thank you in advance.
