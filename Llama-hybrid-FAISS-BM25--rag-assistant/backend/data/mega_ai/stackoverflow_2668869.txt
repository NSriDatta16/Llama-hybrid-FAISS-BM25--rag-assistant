This post discusses it a bit in the context of users. It would stand to reason that if the browser supports it (I'm assuming your hero has the requisite hardware...) you as a developer could access it. That said, it's possible that it's not part of the public api but even if that's the case, you could just use reflection to call the methods. This isn't a great answer, but you could download the cupcake source from the repo and dig through the browser code to see how they implement the multitouch stuff.
