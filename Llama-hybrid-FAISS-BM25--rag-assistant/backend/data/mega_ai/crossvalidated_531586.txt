Here are three slides from my statistical modelling course illustrating why the average log-likelihood function concentrates with the number $n$ of iid observations: This second picture represents $L_n(\theta;\mathbf x)^{1/n}$ as $n$ increases. This function stabilises around its (entropy) limiting function $$\exp\int\log p(x|\theta) \text dF(x)$$
