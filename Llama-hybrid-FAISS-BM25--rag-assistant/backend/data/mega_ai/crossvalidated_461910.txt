Multi-steps direct forecasting in AR(2) model through bayesian estimation of the model

I'm estimating an AR(2) model using Bayesian methods through Gibbs sampling and I want to perform 4 step ahead multi-steps direct forecasts. Inside the MCMC loop in each iteration I'm drawing the variance and the vector of coefficients (the intercept and the coefficients for the first and the second lag). Hence I can easily perform iterated forecasting, but what about multi-steps direct forecasting? Does somebody have a reference on this?
