Summary and integration from all the posts, after testing it myself; check the update for 4.x, 5.x below. As of 3.2 you cannot change the orientation of a running application from code. But you can start an application with a fixed orientation, although doing so this is not straightforward. Try with this recipe: set your orientation to UISupportedInterfaceOrientations in the Info.plist file in your window define a 480x320 "base view controller". Every other view will be added as a subview to its view. in all view controllers set up the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method (to return the same value you defined in the plist, of course) in all view controllers set a background view with self.view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 480, 320) in the viewDidLoad method. Update (iOS 4.x, 5.x) : the Apple iOS App Programming Guide has a "Launching in Landscape Mode" paragraph in the "Advanced App Tricks" chapter.
