Is there any way of limiting the matchable classes for data in SVMs?

Let's say I'm working on the " Recognizing hand-written digits " where we are using an SVM to analyze handwritten digits. Now imagine we have some additional information, for each image we are also given a subset of numbers where we know for certain the answer lies among them. This is true for both training and test data. ex: An image of the figure "4" is paired with the subset {1, 3, 4, 7} . I'm using the scikit-learn implementation in my work. Is there any way of helping the training and/or testing with this data? Would another method be more suitable to use with this data? I am fairly new to ML so all ideas are appreciated.
