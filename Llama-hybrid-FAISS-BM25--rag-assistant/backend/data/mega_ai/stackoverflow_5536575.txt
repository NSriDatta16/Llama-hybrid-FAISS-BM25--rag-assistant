Localization Example Issue

I am testing localization example given on http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/localization/index.html . For this i have created android 2.3.3 level 10 application. There is a step mentioned in the tutorial: Localize the Images As shown in Table 2, the application needs six more drawable folders, each containing a flag.png icon. Add the needed icons and folders to your project: Save this German flag icon as res/drawable-de-rDE/flag.png in the application's project workspace. For example: 1. Click the link to open the flag image. 2. Save the image in your-workspace/HelloL10N/res/drawable-de-rDE/ . But in the res folder i have three folders drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable-ldpi. I know that it is for different screen resolutions. Similarly i have values-dr folder containing strings.xml file. I have made drawable-hdpi-de-rDE folder for german and similar folders for other languages. But i am getting error: [2011-04-04 14:34:32 - HelloL10N] (skipping index file 'C:\Documents and Settings\abc\workspace\HelloL10N\res\drawable-hdpi\Thumbs.db') [2011-04-04 14:34:32 - HelloL10N] C:\Documents and Settings\abc\workspace\HelloL10N\res\values-fr\strings.xml:4: error: Apostrophe not preceded by \ (in Irai-je te comparer au jour d'Ã©tÃ©?)

One more thing i am curious to know whether i have to create three resources in place of one for e.g. i have one image file so i have to upload it in drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable-ldpi with different screen resolutions? Please help me on this Thanks Pankaj
