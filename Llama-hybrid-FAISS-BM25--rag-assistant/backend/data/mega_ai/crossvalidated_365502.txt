Multivariant time series forcasting

I have a multivariate time series data with Timestamps as( 'season' with four categories: 1,2,3,4, 'month' with 12 categories and 'day' with 5 categories excluding Saturday and Sunday) and I have to predict the target variable 'absenteeism as no of hours'. I have two questions : 1) How shall I deal with the timestamp 2) what category does this problem fall into like classification, regression, clustering? and how can I approach this problem? Any hint would be useful.
