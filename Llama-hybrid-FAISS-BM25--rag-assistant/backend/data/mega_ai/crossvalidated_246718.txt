Detecting abnormal shifts in Time Series data

What is the best way to know if recent time series data is abnormally different from the historic data, consider this: The data just beyond Nov 15 looks like it has shifted low - but what techniques can tell me if this shift is abnormal..? I'm currently using Changepoint detection in R from the changepoint package - but this will find multiple changepoints if all of the data is considered. And if I use only the more recent data it will find the change, but how can I know if its abnormal wrt the overall population..? Paul.
