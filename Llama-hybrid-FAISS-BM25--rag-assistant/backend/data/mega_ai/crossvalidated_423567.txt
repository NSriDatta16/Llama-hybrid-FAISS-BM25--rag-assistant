Welcome to this community, Fran. From what I see there's no universal or constant consensus on what's adequate, nor can we really speak of most accepted (and as scientists we should always be wary, even if something is "most accepted" â€“ the Ptolemaic system was most accepted for centuries). Some of the techniques you mention are widely used by a school or group of authors and criticized by another (often unawares of one another). And their use and popularity seem to be fluctuating with time. Also, the techniques you mention are not the only ones. For example there's the Bayesian technique that uses the evidence (technical sense). Take a look at MacKay's beautiful article Bayesian interpolation (see also http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/PhD.html ), where he explains and compares the "evidence" and other cross-validation-like techniques.
