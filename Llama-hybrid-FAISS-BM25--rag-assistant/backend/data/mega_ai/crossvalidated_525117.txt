Convolutional neural networks are very different from the standard feedforward neural networks. CNN use kernels that seek for features on a different part of an image (or sequence, or another type of data, since there are also CNN's for non-image data). The consequence is that they need to make much more computations than the dense layers, so obviously, they would be slower. We use them because applying a kernel to different parts of an image lets us discover the same patterns on different parts of an image . If your training data contains only the images with cars in the upper left part of an image, a feedforward network would know how to detect cars only if they appeared in exactly the same region of an image, while CNN would generalize to discovering them no matter where they are located.
