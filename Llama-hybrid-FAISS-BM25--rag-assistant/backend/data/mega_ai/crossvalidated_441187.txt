A note about the generative-discriminative dichotomy Although your formal generative-vs-discriminative definition is widely used and very useful [1], I agree with @shimao that it's somewhat of a false dichotomy [2] which starts falling apart when you consider that it's in fact a spectrum which you can even smoothly interpolate between [3], and many popular models do not neatly fall into this dichotomy [4]. Furthermore, it assumes the supervised learning setting and is less useful for classifying unsupervised or semi-supervised methods. A more general (but more informal) definition [5, 6] to complement it might be: Discriminative models learn the boundary between classes Generative models learn the distribution of data With that in mind... Addressing the claims TL;DR There is no blanket claim that can be made linking generative/discriminative models and unsupervised/supervised methods, since every combination of the two exists. | | Generative | Discriminative | |--------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------| | Supervised | GANs, Naive Bayes, [7] | SVM, logistic regression,deep neural networks | | Unsupervised | LDA, normalizing flows | monocular depth and optical flow models, [9] | Claim 1 : False. Many generative models---from the basic like Naive Bayes to complex like a GAN or this generative up-convolutional network [7]---are learnt in a supervised or semi-supervised fashion. Claim 2.1 : True. Unsupervised learning algorithms fall all across the generative-discriminative spectrum , e.g. k-nearest neighbours (kNN) is somewhere in between generative and discriminative [8] (formally generative, informally discriminative). Claim 2.2 : False. Many clustering algorithms are generative models, e.g. latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Claim 3 : False. There are discriminative models trained on unsupervised datasets, e.g. [9], and as @shimao pointed out, monocular depth and optical flow models. Claim 4 : False. In disproving Claim 1 we showed some examples of supervised learning algorithms with generative models (Naive Bayes, [7]). Also your phrasing is a bit strange since algorithm != model. "GANs are generative models that use supervised learning to approximate an intractable cost function" [10]. GANs, like VAEs, have both generative and discriminative components, but are commonly referred to as generative.
