if i get your question correct, here is proposed solution. off course there would be a button which will open the save button. but that button would be enabled when the service call completes. you can save that data temporary into isolated storage. Enable the button now. on clicking that open the save diag box, here is the code to save data into isolated storage temporary. public static void SaveLog(string data) { using (IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { using (IsolatedStorageFileStream isfs = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(fileName, FileMode.Append, FileAccess.Write, isf)) { using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(isfs)) { try { sw.Write(data); } finally { sw.Close(); } } } } }
