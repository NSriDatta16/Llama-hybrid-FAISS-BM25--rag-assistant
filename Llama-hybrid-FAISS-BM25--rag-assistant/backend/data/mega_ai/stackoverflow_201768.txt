Mixing jQuery and YUI together in an app, is it easily possible?

I have to preface this with the fact that I love jQuery as a JavaScript language extension and YUI as a rich set of free controls. So here is my question, is there going to be any problems down the line if I mix jQuery and YUI together in an MVC app I am working on. I want to use jQuery for the heavy lifting on the DOM and I want to use YUI for the rich user control set. This is an internal application and will never see the light of day outside of the organization I work for. If anybody has experience with mixing these two frameworks I would love to hear what your experience has been.
