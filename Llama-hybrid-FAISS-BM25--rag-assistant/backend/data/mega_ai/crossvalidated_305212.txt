Discrete variable explained by categorical variables

I am a linguistics graduate student, and I'm a bit lost regarding statistics. I'm performing a quasiexperiment, where I have three groups separated using a categorical variable (voice heard). Every person in each group listens to 40 sentences, which can be categorized according to two variables, predictability and intelligibility, also categorical variables (both can be just low or high). With respect to these last two variables, there is an equal number of sentences for each combination. After the test is taken, I'm computing the total score (from 1 to 10) for each combination of sentences. The number of people in each group is different. What I'm interested in is determining which one of the variables (or combination of them) is significant to the scores. I've read about ANOVA (1-way and k-way), Kruskal-Wallis, ordinal logistic regression, but it seems that none of them is really appropriate for my setup, a discrete variable depending on categorical variables.
