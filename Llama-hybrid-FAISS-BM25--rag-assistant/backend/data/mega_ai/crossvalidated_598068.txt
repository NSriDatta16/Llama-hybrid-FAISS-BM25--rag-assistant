If there are comparisons you don't think are appropriate, then you really shouldn't do them. And yes, it does affect the Tukey-adjusted P values. What I suggest instead is something like this (assuming the two factors interact): EMM Another thing that makes sense is contrast(EMM, interaction = c("consec", "pairwise")) which would compare the comparisons: Posttest - Pretest | EF with Posttest - Pretest | IF . Apparently, several influential people are suggesting that users run emmeans with pairwise ~ specs, and I wish they'd stop doing that. It requires only one command, but it often creates a mess. I would like to encourage users to instead get the means, then do the comparisons they need, as is done above.
