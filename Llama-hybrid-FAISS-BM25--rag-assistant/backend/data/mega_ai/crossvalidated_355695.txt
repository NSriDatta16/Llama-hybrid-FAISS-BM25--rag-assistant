Understanding parameter sharing within Bayesian Networks

I am learning about probabilistic graphical models and am a bit confused by the idea of parameter sharing. In the image below, I have been told that the parameters of time slice 0 are copied to time slice 1 and 2 etc. Now, I understand on a high level that, the way weather at t-1 effects velocity at time t will be the same regardless of our position in the sequence. But when we say that each of these time slices have the same "parameters" I get confused because, won't the probabilities associated with the CPD at time slice 100 be different than at time slice 1? How should I understand the concept of parameter sharing in this context?
