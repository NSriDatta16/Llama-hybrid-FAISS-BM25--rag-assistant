If by communitry this is about people, as what else is a community really, here are a few groups: Agile Project Leadership Network has the implication in its name that it embraces Agile approaches. Alt.Net strikes me as a group where you could bring various Agile practices and get various results as some may like them and some may have had problems with them. Agile is more about process rather than specific technologies usually, though. If your question is more about what technologies and frameworks do companies using Agile embrace, that is a whole other ball of wax with questionable value to my mind. The companies near me, in Calgary, Alberta, that embrace Agile may be vastly different than others,e.g. what companies in Bangalore, India or London, U.K. or Silicon Valley or New York City, New York or Seattle, Washington to give a few locations where there are some developers working, usually unless you mean companies like Thoughtworks that do Agile if you are near a large city where they have an office. Another line of thought would be to consider how some technologies may have various sub-communities or size that may cloud things here. For example, there are likely many Java and .Net developers that embrace Agile and many that loathe it. If some companies have a Waterfall methodology that works well for them, why should they switch to Agile? At the same time, some technologies may have really small communities and so they may be viewed in a much different light. There is also how well organized would the people using these new and emerging technologies be if that is a factor to your mind. Hopefully someone found this brain dump interesting... ;)
