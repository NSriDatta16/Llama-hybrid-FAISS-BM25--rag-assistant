Relationship between $\beta_1$ and odds in simple logistic regression

I am taking a course in logistic regression, and currently my class is about to finish our discussion about simple logistic regression. My professor said that the following statement is correct: For one unit increase in x, the odds(event) is increased (decreased) by the factor $\exp(β_1)/(1-\exp(β_1))$ when $β_1$ is positive (negative). I understand all of this except for the $(1-\exp(\beta_1))$ part. Why wouldn't the $\rm odds(event)$ just decrease by $\exp(\beta_1)$? Where $\rm odds(event) = P(event)/(1-P(event))$ and $x$ is a continuous predictor.
