Length of current selection in Eclipse

Do you know any easy way to find out what is the length of the current selection in Eclipse? i.e. I select a line fragment and would like to know how many characters are there? Usually, I count them manually, but that's stupid. When being desperate, I move to the start, check the column number, move to the end, check the column number, subtract, think a minute if I should add 1 or not... and my selection is lost.
