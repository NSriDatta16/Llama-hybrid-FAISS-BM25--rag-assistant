Test the significant differences between the coefficients obtained by logistic regression on two data sets.

So I run logistic regressions of same dependent variables and independent variables on two sets of data $S_1$ and $S_2$. I obtained two sets of coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. Now I suspect that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ should really be equal, since I don't think there are distinctive difference between $S_1$ and $S_2$. My question is, how do I test the significant differences between the coefficients? Thanks!
