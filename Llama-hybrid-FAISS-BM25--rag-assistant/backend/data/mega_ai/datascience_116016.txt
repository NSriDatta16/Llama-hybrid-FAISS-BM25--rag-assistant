Sentiment Analysis models trained on articles / alternative data

For a 6 class sentence classification task (emotion), I have a list of sentences where I retrieve the sentiment using a language model that was trained on Tweets (bertweet) . It works fine for simplistic sentences where the sentiment is also obvious (someone died, someone won something, someone was afraid of something, etc). However, when applying it to articles, it shows uncontrollable behavior. Two examples of the sadness class: How Your Family Can Volunteer During the Pandemic: 99% probability of sadness There was a massacre in Bosnia where many were slaughtered: 96% probability of sadness I have tried removing the softmax to break down the probabilities into absolute values in order to see if there's a difference there, but it seems that it is marginal and the first sentence again is "sadder" than the second one about the massacre. There are many more such examples for all the other classes. Is there any model that is trained on articles? Possibly click bait titles and the kinds?
