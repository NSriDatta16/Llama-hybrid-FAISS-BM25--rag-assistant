Firstly, If you dataset contains hourly data then the frequency of the time series should be 24. cooltemp = ts(training$vol, frequency = 24) Secondly, It is preferable for KPSS test, that you reject null hypothesis if p-value . p-value greater than printed p-value only indicates that the value has been rounded off to two decimal points. Your value for checkt will not be greater that 0.05 even if the statement was printed in the console. From the above outputs for checkl and checkt , we can say that your series is non-stationary on level and trend. You should consider differencing the time-series to make it stationary. Since you know there is weekly seasonality in the series, therefore I would suggest taking a seasonal difference as in the following r code: checkl If you wish to check the order of differencing and seasonal differencing are required to make the series stationary, you can try the following code: ns 0) { xstar 0) { xstar Source: Hyndman, R.
