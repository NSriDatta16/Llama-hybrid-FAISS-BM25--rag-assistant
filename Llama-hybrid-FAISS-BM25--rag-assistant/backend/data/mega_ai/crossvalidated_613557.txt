Odd ratio changes after adjusting, what does that mean?

I have been using logistic regression to measure the association between two variables. Let us say, we want to test the association between A and B. A is the outcome and B is the exposure. The association between A and B gives me an OR = 5, and it is significant when looking at the p-value. A ~ B Then I want to adjust for C. The association between A and B is still significant, but the OR for that association changed to OR = 4.7. A ~ B + C Later I adjusted for D, and the OR for A and B's association is now changed to OR = 5.3, and it is still significant. A ~ B + C + D My question is, what does this mean? These small changes, the decreasing and increasing of OR after adjusting? How is this interpreted? Maybe it means nothing?
