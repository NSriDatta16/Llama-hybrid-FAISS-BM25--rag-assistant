This should be handled by a callback assigned to the Dependency Property. The proper place for this depends on what is actually happening here: // Do stuff // Here be dragons There are three callbacks that can be assigned to a Dependency Property - If you just need to notify the legacy systems, then I recommend adding a Property Changed callback , and adding the notification there. If, however, this is performing something that amounts to validation via the Legacy system, it may be more appropriate to put these dragons into the ValidationCallback. I doubt that the CoerceValue callback is appropriate, given your scenario.
