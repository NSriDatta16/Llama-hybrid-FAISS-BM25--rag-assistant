Organizing R Source Code

All, I am starting to write object-oriented R code for the first time and anticipate having multiple R files with dependencies in between. I'm new to R and have not yet wrote anything outside of a single massive script to test ideas. Are there resources online that give tips on how one ought to organize code? Short of descriptions on how to build packages, I'm failing to find such guidance. At this point, I just want to organize the code in such a way that it makes loading and interacting with the collection of routines as straightforward as possible. Appreciate any guidance you can provide. Chris
