As others have mentioned, you should try XeTeX, and you should make sure you have the correct fonts installed. Use the command xelatex in place of pdflatex , to enable use of non-Latin characters in .tex files. You didn't say which font encoding you want, but the following two should work pretty well: Linux Libertine, and Computer Modern Unicode. The OpenSuSE package names are LinuxLibertine and cm-unicode ; hopefully it's similar on other systems. Add the following as the first imports in your document: \usepackage{xunicode,fontspec,xltxtra} \usepackage[english]{polyglossia} % EXAMPLE: \setotherlanguages{russian} % set as "other" so English hyphenation active and add the following after all other imports (so it won't be overridden by older package imports), \defaultfontfeatures{Mapping=tex-text,Scale=MatchLowercase} \setromanfont{Linux Libertine O} \setsansfont{Linux Biolinum O} \setmonofont[Scale=0.9]{Courier New} or, if you want Computer Modern fonts, \setromanfont{CMU Serif} \setsansfont{CMU Sans Serif} \setmonofont{CMU Typewriter Text}
