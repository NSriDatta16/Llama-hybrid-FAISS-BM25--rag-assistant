C++ IDE that supports Scott Meyer's advice: Prefer non-member non-friend functions over members

Scott Meyer's argument that non-member functions increase encapsulation and allow for more elegant design (designwise) seems very valid to me. See here: Article Yet I have problems with this. (And seemingly others too, especially Library developers, who usually completely ignore this) Code usually looks better and more logical when I use member functions. This may be an acquired taste though and just takes some getting used to looking at algorithms first and then on the objects. (shudder) So maybe I have only one problem: With member functions, me AND my IDE know what the class can do. For me this is huge! I use nothing that doesn't support member function code completion for programming. In well designed libraries it completely replaces documentation for me. And even if I would look at the api doc, looking through the member list just feels absolutely natural, logical and I can be sure that, well, this is the end. If the method is not in there, I can safely assume it doesn't exist and I can write my non-member non-friend. I put up with this in the STL, because, well, it makes sense to see algorithms apart from basic components and because of the you get used to it factor. I haven't seen an IDE that can tell me what non-member functions work on a particular class. And this actually is my question: Is there an IDE (or IDE feature) out there that helps with this code convention?
