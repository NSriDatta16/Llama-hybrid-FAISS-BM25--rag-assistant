The answer will depend on the specific DBMS. For Oracle, it is certainly possible to end up with fragmentation in the form of "chained rows", and that incurs a performance penalty. However, you can mitigate against that by pre-allocating some empty space in the table blocks to allow for some expansion due to updates. However, CHAR columns will typically make the table much bigger, which has its own impact on performance. CHAR also has other issues such as blank-padded comparisons which mean that, in Oracle, use of the CHAR datatype is almost never a good idea.
