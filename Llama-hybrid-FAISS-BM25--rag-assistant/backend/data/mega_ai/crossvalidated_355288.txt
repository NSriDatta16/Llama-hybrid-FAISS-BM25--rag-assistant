Interpreting low Cronbach's alpha value in CATPCA

I ran categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) on the data that I collected through a questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire was to understand pedestrians intentions and attitudes towards road crossing. There were 43 questions (5-point Likert type questions) in total which were expected to measure perceptions, intentions and attitude related underlying variables. After running CATPCA on the obtained data, I got the results as shown in the Figure. Only 5-dimensional solution is shown here. All these components have eigenvalues greater than 1 and they explain 44% of the variance. However, the Cronbach's alpha value is lower than 0.7 for the last two components. If I remove those two components, then the explained variance is only 33%. My questions are: If Cronbach's alpha value is less than 0.7 but eigenvalue is higher than 1 for a certain component, should I discard that component? Does total Cronbach alpha hold any value? I mean if individual Cronbach alphas are low but the total is as high as 0.9 (as shown in Fig), can we conclude that scale is internally consistent?
