As more applications are moved to the cloud and to online services you will see ADFS and other federated identity technologies increase in usage. Organizations with investments in Active Directory will likely move to this solution due the low cost of ownership. Is this a lasting technology and worth investing in (and specifically for a smaller sized ( If you plan on either providing hosted services to other companies or plan on taking advantage of them yourselves ADFS provides a fairly painless way to take advantage of your current security infrastructure. If properly implemented it should be fairly simple to replace on federation product with another. Are there any major companies out there that are actively using this? I'm only familiar with a government organization I've worked on, but I'm sure there are others. The nature of federated identity make if difficult to externally identify who. How likely is it that a partner would be willing to setup an STS if we wanted someone else to provide authentication for their company as a trusted issuer? Is there going to be a lot of push-back here? Is this going to end up being a configuration nightmare? Configuration is the most difficult part of ADFS. However, once you have the trust relationships built and policies created configuration will be hands off. Other companies will either have the infrastructure in place to support ADFS or won't. Even .NET applications require configuration changes to support ADFS and more likely will require code changes to fully support the federated identity model. If your partners have this in place it is likely they'll happily trust your STS. Ask your what your partners have in place, they may already have or be planning infrastructure today. Are there any other pitfalls to look out for when deciding whether to implement this? The most difficult problem I ran into was changing application developer practices. Applications need to either be designed around Federation or will need to be retrofitted with it. You can't logout of an ADFS application without logging out of all ADFS applications. When a federated session expires you must send a user back to the federation service for a new ticket. This could cause loss of post data if not handled properly.
