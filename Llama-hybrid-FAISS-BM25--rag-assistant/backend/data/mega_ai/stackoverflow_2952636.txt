Simple approach: insertion sort on every insert. Since your elements are not aligned in memory I'm guessing linked list. If so, then you could transform it into a linked list with jumps to the 10th element, the 100th and so on. This is kind of similar to the next suggestion. Or you reorganize your container structure into a binary tree (or what every tree you like, B, B*, red-black, ...) and insert elements like you would insert them into a search tree.
