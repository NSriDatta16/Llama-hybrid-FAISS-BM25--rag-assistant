The reason people say that a Singleton isn't necessarily a good idea is because it encourages a scenario like yours. Needing a static object is the bad part - a Singleton is just seen as an enabler. That said, I can't really comment on whether it's neccesary in your application, because you haven't detailed it. But if you REALLY need static data held in an object for the application's lifetime, go right ahead and use a singleton. You can make them thread-safe as well.
