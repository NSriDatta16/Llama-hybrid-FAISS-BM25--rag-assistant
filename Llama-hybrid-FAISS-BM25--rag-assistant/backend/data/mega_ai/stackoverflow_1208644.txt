How can I get the size of a memory block allocated using malloc()?

Possible Duplicates: How can I get the size of an array from a pointer in C? Is there any way to determine the size of a C++ array programmatically? And if not, why? I get a pointer to a chunk of allocated memory out of a C style function. Now, it would be really interesting for debugging purposes to know how big the allocated memory block that this pointer points is. Is there anything more elegant than provoking an exception by blindly running over its boundaries? Thanks in advance, Andreas EDIT: I use VC++2005 on Windows, and GCC 4.3 on Linux EDIT2: I have _msize under VC++2005 Unfortunately it results in an exception in debug mode.... EDIT3: Well. I have tried the way I described above with the exception, and it works. At least while I am debugging and ensuring that immediately after the call to the library exits I run over the buffer boundaries. Works like a charm. It just isn't elegant and in no way usable in production code.
