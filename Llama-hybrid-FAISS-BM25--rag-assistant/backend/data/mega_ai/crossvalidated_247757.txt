As the question is worded, it's hard to see a frequentist solution, because a frequentist would presumably treat the proportion who are voting for Clinton as a fixed, single value of the population. But it can be interpreted in a Bayesian fashion like this: if you get 75 successes from 100 independent Bernoulli trials with a true probability of success $θ$ , then what is the posterior probability that $θ > .6$ ? Use a conjugate prior for $θ$ (which will be a beta distribution) and you can get a closed form for the posterior distribution of $θ$ . The cumulative distribution function that corresponds to this posterior can tell you the final probability that $θ > .6$ .
