Is Flash becoming a dying web technology? (long-term)

I'd like to see what your thoughts are regarding Flash and it's purpose in the future. We all know what some of the pros and cons are for using Flash but with HTML5 growing rapidly, I can see Flash becoming less useful (perhaps even obsolete) unless new features are added to it. Take for example complex animation, fancy fonts, dynamic content, video, audio etc.. In many scenarios this can be achieved with HTML5 & CSS3 and/or a javascript library. For example: HTML5 Audio & Video HTML5 Local storage Canvas animation CSS3 animation CSS3 transform Font replacement(i.e. Cufon) & @font-face Dynamic content via AJAX and so on Of course, by using HTML your website will have proper semantic markup, making it easier for screen readers & search engines to access your content and index it appropriately. Also you don't have to rely on a 3rd party plugin and not to mention that your Flash site won't work on Apple's devices. Yes, there are cases where Flash is your only choice but for the general purpose (interactive) website - HTML5/CSS3 should be more than enough. What do you think?
