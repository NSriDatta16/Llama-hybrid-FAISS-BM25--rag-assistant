No, that's the Adobe-style standard markup. It works across all current browsers. It's ugly, doesn't validate and has to state each parameter twice, which is what the Flash embedding scripts you mention are attempting to address (plus sometimes also there's an IE ‘object activation’ workaround that is no longer necessary). If you don't care about that, you're fine as you are. If you do, this question has some discussion on alternatives.
