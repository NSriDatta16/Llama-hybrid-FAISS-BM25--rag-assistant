Horrible performance for a ^[a-z]{0,20000}$ regex compilation with regcomp

I'm wondering why the compilation of such a regex takes up to 70% of my RAM, leading to intense swapping and a load average of 16: strcpy(regexStr,"^[a-z]{0,20000}$" ); regcomp( &regex , regexStr , REG_NOSUB | REG_EXTENDED ); The execution time is in the order of minutes (had to kill the process before). The execution for a ^[a-z]{0,2000}$ (2,000, not 20,000) is around 100ms which is way to much to me. I use this to check a pattern and at the same time check the length. √è found regex to be convenient for both. Am I doing something wrong ?
