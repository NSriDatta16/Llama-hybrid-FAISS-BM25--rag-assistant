Add html content to a page in Liferay

Im new to Liferay . I have downloaded the Liferay Tomcat bundle v5.2.3 Community Edition from the Liferay website. I am able to run it successfully. I am now trying to create an intranet portal for our company using Liferay . I created an Organization in Liferay and added some pages and child pages to it. How to add content to a page ?. I mean, i would like to add some text and images etc to the home page and other pages on the portal. I tried the Web Content Display portlet, but it always appears minimized and i have to maximise it by clicking on the maximize button. And also the option to minimize/maximize the portlet is available only when im logged in. Is there any other way to add HTML content to a page, to make it look like a normal html page which anybody can view when they visit the portal ? Thank You.
