Implicitly, you are suggesting that there is one effect of your predictors on your responses, and that your responses really are "only" three different ways to measure this effect. If you want to throw them together, and if they additionally seem to derive from different distributions, I can only think of a hierarchical (Bayesian) approach: Option 1: model each response separately, but state that the model coefficients (with the exception of the intercept) are identical in all three models. In this way, you can control the distribution of each response, make one normal, the other neg.binom. etc. Option 2: a single model of a latent response, which is a linear combination of the three measured responses. Fundamentally, these two approaches should converge on the same statement: the effect of your predictors on a combination of responses. To the best of my knowledge, either approach will take you to specialised software (e.g. JAGS, STAN, Win/OpenBUGS), as SEM-packages typically do not offer the flexibility of different distributions in the latent variable. (No-one said it would be easy.)
