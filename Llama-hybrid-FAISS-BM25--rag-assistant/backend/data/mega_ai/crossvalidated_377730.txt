By definition, Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN) encode only interventional distributions (you can check definition 1.3.1 of Causality ), and involved counterfactuals such as $P(y_{x} \mid x', y')$ , cannot be computed (nor even defined) in CBNs (in english, this is the probability that $Y$ would have been $y$ had $X$ been $x$ , given that $Y$ was in fact $y'$ and $X$ was in fact $x'$ ). To see this in practice, you can create counterexamples where we have two different structural causal models that induce the same observational and interventional probability distributions (the same DAG), yet induce different counterfactual distributions. In fact, we have such examples here on CV, you can check them here and here . And also a more extensive discussion between the difference of interventions and counterfactuals here.
