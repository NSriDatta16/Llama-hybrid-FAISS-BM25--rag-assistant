If you're using a seperate assembly to store your control, you could right click the control toolbar and add an item for your assembly. You could then drag and drop your control just like any of the other builtin control. If you're looking for something a little less elegant, you could go into the Designer.cs file and change the type of the button from Button to HoverButton there.
