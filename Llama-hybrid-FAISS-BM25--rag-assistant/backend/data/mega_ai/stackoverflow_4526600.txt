ANTLR : How to replace all characters defined as space with actual space

My ANTLR code is as follow : LPARENTHESIS : ('('); RPARENTHESIS : (')'); fragment CHARACTER : ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9'|); fragment QUOTE : ('"'); fragment WILDCARD : ('*'); fragment SPACE : (' '|'\n'|'\r'|'\t'|'\u000C'|';'|':'|','); WILD_STRING : (CHARACTER)* ( ('?') (CHARACTER)* )+ ; PREFIX_STRING : (CHARACTER)+ ( ('*') )+ ; WS : (SPACE) { $channel=HIDDEN; }; PHRASE : (QUOTE)(LPARENTHESIS)?(WORD)(WILDCARD)?(RPARENTHESIS)?((SPACE)+(LPARENTHESIS)?(WORD)(WILDCARD)?(RPARENTHESIS)?)*(SPACE)+(QUOTE); WORD : (CHARACTER)+; What I would like to do is to replace all characters marked as space to be replaced with actual space character in the PHRASE. Also if possible, I would then like all continuous spaces to be represented by a single space. Any help would be most appreciated. For some reason, I am finding it hard to understand ANTLR. Any good tutorials out there ?
