Understanding the intercept in an unadjusted logistic regression

I have performed an unadjusted logistic regression using weights (obtained via genetic matching) as below. I am using the survey package to make working with the weights easier: fit group represents my intervention. Am I interpreting this correctly that since this is an unadjusted regression, the intercept in this case would represent the odds ratio when group = FALSE ? This doesn't seem to be the case by just looking at the incidence of the outcome in both groups: group outcomeFALSE outcomeTRUE se.outcomeFALSE se.outcomeTRUE FALSE FALSE 0.8980632 0.1019368 0.009810129 0.009810129 TRUE TRUE 0.8858308 0.1141692 0.007180766 0.007180766 A rough calculation of the odds ratio from this 2x2 table results in similar point estimates and CIs: epitools::oddsratio(c(898, 101, 885, 114)) $data Outcome Predictor Disease1 Disease2 Total Exposed1 898 101 999 Exposed2 885 114 999 Total 1783 215 1998 $measure odds ratio with 95% C.I.
