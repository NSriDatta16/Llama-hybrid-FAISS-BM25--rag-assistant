You have measured 3 variables, X-ray (pos or neg), sputum (pos, neg or not tested), new diagnostic (pos, neg or not tested), and you may have 9 outcome groups: group X-ray sputum new a 1 + + + a 2 + + - a 3 + + nt b 4 + - + b 5 + - - b 6 + - nt c 7 - nt + c 8 - nt - c 9 - nt nt You told us that the total number of applicants $N=\sum_{g=1}^9{n_g}=24000$, and that $n_1+n_2+n_4+n_5+n_7+n_8=1500$. You also told that the covariate age was available for everyone and correlated with X-ray and sputum. Assuming that you took independently 3 random samples from (a) the X-ray +, sputum + groups (1, 2, 3), (b) the X-ray +, sputum - groups (4, 5, 6) and (c) the X-ray -, sputum nt groups (7, 8, 9), you can fit logistic models within groups (a), (b) and (c) predicting new relying on the covariate age. Using the three logistic models you can predict the probability of being new + for each individual in groups 3, 6 and 9. Adding up these probabilities gives a point estimate of the number of new + applicants in groups 3, 6 and 9. (This is similar to your method 1.) A method to assess the uncertainty in these estimates may be multiple imputation. Let's see its details on the X-ray +, sputum + groups (1, 2, 3): Using multiple imputation on the dataset containing groups 1, 2 and 3 (with the logistic model of age as predictor) to impute the missing new values throughout group 3 should give you realistic new values in group 3. Taking multiple imputed datasets and counting the new + cases in each you will both cover the uncertainty stemming from the binomial distribution after logistic regression and the uncertainties (and covariance) of the coefficients estimated in the logistic model. A large number of imputations will minimise the Monte Carlo error. Your method 2 neglects that you want to do prediction on the finite population of your specific 24000 applicants.
