Your initial guess was not wrong. It simply corresponds to an estimator with a different constraint. For the ordinary least-squares estimator, you want to minimise the squared-error so you want: $\frac{\partial(Y-\beta X)^T(Y-\beta X)}{\partial \beta}=0$, which gives you $\beta=\frac{X^TY}{X^TX}$ If instead, you simply had the constraint that your estimator is unbiased (on average) and nothing more, then you want: $E(Y-\beta X)=0$, which gives you $\beta=\frac{E(Y)}{E(X)}$ However, as @whuber wrote in the comment, the second one is likely to fail in practice so it is extremely unpopular.
