You can use both 1D Convolutions and RNNs like LSTM for text classification task. It is hard to say which one is better because it depends on your neural network and dataset structure. Take a smaller sample from your dataset, then train and evaluate both networks. Pick the best model. Train with bigger data on this model. I think the most convenient method is this. I suggest you to read this and this articles to understand how LSTM works and what you can do with it. There are some examples and use cases. Decide is it appropriate for your data or not.
