As mentioned in comments, the Wikipedia page on 'Bimodal distribution' lists eight tests for multimodality against unimodality and supplies references for seven of them. There are at least some in R. For example: The package diptest implements Hartigan's dip test. The stamp data in the bootstrap package was used in Efron and Tibshirani's Introduction to the Bootstrap (the book on which the package is based) to do an example relating to bootstrapping on the number of modes; if you have access to the book you might be able to use that approach. Efron, B. and Tibshirani, R. (1993) An Introduction to the Bootstrap . Chapman and Hall, New York, London. -- There's a question on CV that talks about identifying (i.e., estimating rather than testing) the number of modes which @whuber's search turns up. It's worth reading the answers there. One of the responses there (mine, as it happens) has a link to a Google search which turns up this paper[1] by David Donoho on constructing one-sided CIs for the number of modes, which can of course be used as a test (e.g., if the one-sided interval doesn't include the unimodal case, you can reject unimodality). To the best of my knowledge that isn't one of the tests that Wikipedia mentions. I don't think there's an R implementation of that interval, but (in spite of the fact that Donoho tends to use fairly sophisticated tools in his discussion of it) it's actually a pretty simple idea to implement. That idea is directly related to the notion of using kernel density estimation. [1]: David L. Donoho, (1988) "One-Sided Inference about Functionals of a Density," Ann.
