Since the body-mass index is defined as $\text{BMI} = \text{weight (kg)}/\text{height (m)}^2$ , you can rewrite your reciprocal model (now dropping the units) as: $$\text{height}^2 = \text{weight} \times (\beta_0'+\beta_1'\text{Age}+\beta_2' \text{Gender} + \beta_3' \text{Age} \cdot \text{Gender} + \text{error}).$$ So, by modelling BMI as a reciprocal linear equation, you get height-squared as the product of weight and that linear predictor. This is certainly one model you could try, but the restriction of holding BMI fixed relative to height means that you are unlikely to get a realistic model. An alternative: One thing worth noting here is that you are working with a derived quantity that depends on two underlying quantities (height and weight). If you can get the underlying data for these two quantities then it is probably more sensible to try to model one of them in terms of the other (plus the other explanatory variables). In this context, it probably makes most sense to model log-weight in terms of log-height and the other variables, using a model of the form: $$\log \text{weight} = \alpha_0 \log \text{height} + \alpha_1 \text{Age} + \alpha_2 \text{Gender} + \alpha_3 \text{Age} \cdot \text{Gender} + \text{error}.$$ As a general physical observation, if a three-dimensional object growths proportionately in all dimensions then its log-volume will increase at three times its log-height, and if weight remains proportionate to volume then its log-weight will similarly increase at three times log-height. Now, under this "simplifying theory" we would have $\alpha_0=3$ in the above model. However, it is well known that living organisms like humans do not exhibit exactly this growth pattern, in part because they grow relatively thinner when taller. Nevertheless, you can look at the coefficient $\alpha_0$ by comparison to this theoretical baseline ---i.e., a value $\alpha_0 = 3$ follows this simplifying theory, whereas a value $\alpha_0 means that there is some reduction in relative volume as the object gets taller, relative to the simplifying theory.
