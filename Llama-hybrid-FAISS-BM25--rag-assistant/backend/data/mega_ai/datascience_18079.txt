why is SVM cost function the norm of the hyperplane parameters, and not the mean square error?

working through Dr. Ng's coursera course cost function intro : basically, you want to minimize the difference squared between your guess and the actual value cost function for SVM: this or this he says the cost function is now the norm of the vector representing the hyperparameters: sqrt(theta_1^2 + theta_2^2... ) Why is that the case?
