Turns out there really wasn't a good way to implement a prebuild plugin for this situation, the best way to do it for me was to implement a jQuery UI slider and on the stop event of that I then do an ajax get to load the appropriate data into a div with vertical scrolling. Maybe not the most elegant or prettiest solution, but it works for the situation and looks nice enough.
