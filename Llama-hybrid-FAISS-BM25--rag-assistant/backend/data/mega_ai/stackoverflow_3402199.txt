need rollover effect for row of 9 perfume bottles

For a perfumer's website I'm displaying a row of nine bottles on a shelf. It appears as one continuous photograph. I've cut it into nine seamless slices, each in its own table cell with its own id. I'm thinking to use jQuery as I want the following on rollover: Bottle blitzes instantaneously bright also triggers short sound file. After a millisecond or two, returns to normal state. Action repeats only if blurred and re-moused over. Effect the same for each of the 9 bottles. Mousedown (click) probably doesn't need an effect, just targets that particular bottle's page into the front page's iframe. I've made 9 alt. slices that are white-outs, but don't know how to write script with timed effect. Flash? Please, don't even go there; it makes me plain nuts. OTOH, I find jQuery to be elegant. Maybe momentarily putting a white sprite over the image at the beginning of rollover is easier? How would I go about doing that? Many thanks in advance!
