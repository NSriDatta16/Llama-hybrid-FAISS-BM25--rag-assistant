ClassNotFoundException for class file on classpath

I have the following code: // Test TODO remove try { System.out.println(System.getProperties().getProperty("java.class.path")); this.getClass().getClassLoader().loadClass("mypackage.MyClass"); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } Now the output shows me, that the class is on the classpath, i.e.: /...some/path.../workspace/project/target/test-classes:/rest/of/the/classpath java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: mypackage.MyClass ...here be stacktrace... I also made sure, that the class-file acutaly IS in the given location, i.e. this file exists: /...some/path.../workspace/project/target/test-classes/mypackage/MyClass.class Maybe the following is important: the shown code is executed in a javaagent attached to a jUnit test, that I start programtically (via Runtime.execute(...)) - so there is probably something beyond the obvious that can go wrong in the background... but still: if the classpath contains the folder with the class, how come it cannot be loaded?
