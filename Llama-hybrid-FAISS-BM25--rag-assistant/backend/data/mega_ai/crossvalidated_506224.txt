The expectation you wrote can't be computed efficiently and with an acceptable degree of accuracy -- about 3 paragraphs above where you quote, the authors describe this: Intractability: the case where the integral of the marginal likelihood $p_\theta(x) = \int p_\theta(z) p_\theta(x|z) dz$ is intractable (so we cannot evaluate or differentiate the marginal likelihood) ... These intractabilities are quite common and appear in cases of moderately complicated likelihood functions pÎ¸(x|z), e.g. a neural network with a nonlinear hidden layer
