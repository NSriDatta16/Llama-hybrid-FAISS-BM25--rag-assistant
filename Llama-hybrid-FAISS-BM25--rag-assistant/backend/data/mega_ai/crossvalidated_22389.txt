Isn't the derivative that you want actually $\frac{dy}{dx_{1}}=\frac{300}{x_{1}}-\frac{30}{x_{1}}\ln x_{1}$? Your derivative is the change in $y$ for a small change in $\ln x_{1}$. I think it's probably easier to think about about changing $x_{1}$ on the original (non-logged) scale. That shows that the marginal effect of $x_{1}$ starts out positive for small $x_1$ and declines steeply until $x_{1}=e^{10}$ and is negative for $x_{1} \gt e^{10}$. Here's some Stata code to make the graphs you asked about below. There might be a more elegant way to do the labels on the original scale, but that's all I got: #delimit; clear all; set more off; sysuse auto, clear; gen lmpg=ln(mpg); reg price c.lmpg##c.lmpg; /* yhat at x of 18, 20 & 25 */ margins, at(lmpg=(`=ln(18)' `=ln(20)' `=ln(25)')); sum lmpg; local mean = r(mean); local sd = r(sd); /* yhat at mean of ln(x) and at mean plus 1 sd */ margins, at(lmpg=(`mean' `=`mean'+`sd'')); marginsplot, xlabels(`mean' "`=round(exp(`mean'),,01)'" `=`mean'+`sd'' "`=round(exp(`mean'+`sd'),.01)'"); /* The MARGINAL effect of x on y at mean and mean of ln(x) plus 1sd */ margins, dydx(lmpg) at(lmpg=(`mean' `=`mean'+`sd'')); marginsplot, xlabels(`mean' "`=round(exp(`mean'),.01)'" `=`mean'+`sd'' "`=round(exp(`mean'+`sd'),.01)'");
