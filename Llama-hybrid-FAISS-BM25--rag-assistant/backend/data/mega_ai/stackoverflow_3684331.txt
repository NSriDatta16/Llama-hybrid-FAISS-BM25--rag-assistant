What are the best practices to generate "widgetized" content in Rails

On my previous projects built with usage of Zend Framework I extensively used Zend_view's "Action View" helper. It basically allows to initiate a separate cycle of request->dispatch ti action->view_rendering from a view script. Here is the link to an appropriate page of zend framework reference guide (search for "Action View Helper"). This helper is quite a convenient way to work with widgetized content for example on pages with portal layout where you can stuff a page with different widgets (like advertising blocks, currency informers etc). Although such an approach negatively affects response time of the page as it involves a lot of additional routing/dispatching activity, it allows to organizes widget code and views scripts into a rational structure. One widget is just a controller action, with linked view script. Unfortunatelly, I have not found any similar view helpers in Rails. Is there any way to elegantly solve this task in Rails?
