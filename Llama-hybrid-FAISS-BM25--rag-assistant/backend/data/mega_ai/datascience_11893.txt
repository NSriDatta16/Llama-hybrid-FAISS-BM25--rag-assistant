If a time series has random time events, how to detect patterns?

My app receives messages with a random number of bits at a random time. But two weeks ago I started to notice some almost regular patterns on the metrics of my app. I suspect they are some bots sending artificially generated data to my app. Specifically, I'm looking for sequential subsets of messages in a time series where messages has almost the same number of bits. I read about some methods but they use data where time is not a random variable. I appreciate any help you can provide, including books, web pages, tutorials (in Python if possible), etc.
