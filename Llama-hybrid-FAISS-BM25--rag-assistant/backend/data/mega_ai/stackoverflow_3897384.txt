Visual Studio: Add service reference to service in a different project in my solution?

I have a Silverlight app that I want to access Azure storage. I have two projects in my solution: a SL project and a ASP web role. The web role has a service. When I launch the project, I go to the service, and it works fine. (I am able to download the data.) I'm not entirely sure what I can do through "Add Service Reference", but I suspect that might be what I'm supposed to do here to make use of the full power of WCF. I open the dialog box, and hit "Discover" to find services in my solution. Visual Studio finds my service, but when I click "Go" it fails with a 404 error. This is not terribly surprising, given that my ASP localhost server is not up at the moment. It seems like I should be able to add the service reference when the devserver is running, but Visual Studio has the menu item to do so grayed out. What am I supposed to do here? Am I completely confused about what service references are for? Should I just use WebClient , hardcode the URI, and de-serialize the XML into objects myself?
