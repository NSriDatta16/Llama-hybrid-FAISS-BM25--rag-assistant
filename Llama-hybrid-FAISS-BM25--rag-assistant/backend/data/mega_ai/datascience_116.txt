Machine learning techniques for estimating users' age based on Facebook sites they like

I have a database from my Facebook application and I am trying to use machine learning to estimate users' age based on what Facebook sites they like. There are three crucial characteristics of my database: the age distribution in my training set (12k of users in sum) is skewed towards younger users (i.e. I have 1157 users aged 27, and 23 users aged 65); many sites have no more than 5 likers (I filtered out the FB sites with less than 5 likers). there's many more features than samples. So, my questions are: what strategy would you suggest to prepare the data for further analysis? Should I perform some sort of dimensionality reduction? Which ML method would be most appropriate to use in this case? I mainly use Python, so Python-specific hints would be greatly appreciated.
