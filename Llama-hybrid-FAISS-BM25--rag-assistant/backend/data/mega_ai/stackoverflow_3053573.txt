The problem with using the Python version that's shipped with your OS is that it may contain bugs, or be limited in other ways. If you install Python from Fink or MacPorts, you have the liberty of updating it. Another, important advantage of managing your own version of Python with a package manager (Fink or MacPorts) is that they help a lot with the compilation of module dependencies (for instance when you use a module that depends on compiled C code). Thus, installing Python modules is certainly easier if you do not use the Python shipped with OS X. This is an important point to consider, before making your choice.
