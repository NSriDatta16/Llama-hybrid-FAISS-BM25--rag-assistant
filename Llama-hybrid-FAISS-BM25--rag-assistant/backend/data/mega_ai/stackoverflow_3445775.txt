How to Declare Variables

I know this is a little dumb, but how do you do this? I've "RTFM" but I still don't understand concepts like this just don't exist in the languages I'm used to programming. Anyway, my question is simple: how does one properly set a global variable which can be used by all public void functions inside that class? Here is some example code, I will highlight the redundancy in case you don't see it: public class baketimer extends Activity implements OnClickListener { /** Called when the activity is first created. */ public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); final Button cupcake1 = (Button) this.findViewById(R.id.cupcake1); cupcake1.setOnClickListener(this); } public void onClick(View v) { switch(v.getId()){ case R.id.cupcake1: final Button cupcake1 = (Button) this.findViewById(R.id.cupcake1); new CountDownTimer(30000, 1000) { public void onTick(long millisUntilFinished) { cupcake1.setText("" + millisUntilFinished / 1000); } public void onFinish() { cupcake1.setText("Done!"); } }.start(); Toast.makeText(this, "Mmm cupcakes!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); break; How would I go about declaring cupcake1 for the entire class? Thanks in advance!
