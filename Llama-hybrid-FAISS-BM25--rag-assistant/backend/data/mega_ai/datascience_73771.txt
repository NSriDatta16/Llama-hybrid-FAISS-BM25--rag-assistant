Let me help you get started - you don't get a single value here like you get in linear regression,rather posterior distribution of the parameters. yes, The output here is generated from a normal (Gaussian) Distribution characterized by a mean and variance , nothing special I am afraid. But depending on the mean and variance you can determine which price is more likely to be. yes its not a real valued number like price here but the probability ,output is the likelihood multiplied by the prior probability of the data. Here is a very simple explanation, I couldn't put it in better words- https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-linear-regression-e66e60791ea7 And here is the more mathematical background with this chapter from stanford- http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-gaussian_processes.pdf and you are not alone as these Author's agree- "Gaussian process regression models, though perhaps somewhat tricky to understand conceptually, nonetheless lead to simple and straightforward linear algebra implementations"
