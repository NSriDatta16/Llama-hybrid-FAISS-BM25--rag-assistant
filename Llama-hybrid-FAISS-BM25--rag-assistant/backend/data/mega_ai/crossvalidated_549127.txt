You are given PACF for a stationary process: φ11 = −0.60, φ22 = 0.36, φkk = 0 for k ≥ 3. What time series model could have this PACF?

You are given PACF for a stationary process: φ11 = −0.60, φ22 = 0.36, φkk = 0 for k ≥ 3. What time series model could have this PACF? Identify model’s coefficients and write model equation. I am very confused on how to derive the model equation from just these two pieces of information.
