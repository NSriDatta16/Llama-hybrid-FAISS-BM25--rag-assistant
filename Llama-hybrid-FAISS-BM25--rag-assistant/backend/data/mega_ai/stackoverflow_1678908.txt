Applying Coefficient of Restitution in a collision resolution method

I have a collision resolution method in my physics engine, that goes like this: Vector2 n1pos = n1.NonLinearSpace != null ? n1.NonLinearPosition : n1.Position; Vector2 n2pos = n2.NonLinearSpace != null ? n2.NonLinearPosition : n2.Position; Vector2 posDiff = n2pos - n1pos; Vector2 posDiffNormal = posDiff; posDiffNormal.Normalize(); float totalRadius = n1.Radius + n2.Radius; float posDiffLength = posDiff.Length(); float interPenetration = totalRadius - posDiffLength; float averageRestitution = (n1.RestitutionCoefficient + n2.RestitutionCoefficient) / 2; Vector2 forceAmount = Vector2.Multiply(posDiffNormal, interPenetration); Vector2 n1force = ( (n1.Velocity * n1.Mass) + (n2.Velocity * n2.Mass) + n2.Mass * averageRestitution * (n2.Velocity - n1.Velocity) ) / (n1.Mass + n2.Mass); Vector2 n2force = ( (n1.Velocity * n1.Mass) + (n2.Velocity * n2.Mass) + n1.Mass * averageRestitution * (n2.Velocity - n1.Velocity) ) / (n1.Mass + n2.Mass); n1.ApplyForce(???); if (!n1.IsStatic) { n1.Position += ???; } n2.ApplyForce(???); if (!n2.IsStatic) { n2.Position += ???; } Now, i can't figure out what to apply to the bodies in my engine in order to get proper coefficient of restitution working. (the ??? parts). Can someone help?
