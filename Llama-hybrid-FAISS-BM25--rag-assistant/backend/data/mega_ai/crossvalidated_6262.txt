This game looks similar to 20 questions at http://20q.net , which the creator reports is based on a neural network. Here's one way to structure such network, similar to the neural network described in Concept description vectors and the 20 question game . You'd have A fixed number of questions, with some questions marked as "final" questions. One input unit per question, where 0/1 represents no/yes answer. Initially set to 0.5 One output unit per question, sigmoid squished into 0..1 range Hidden layer connecting all input units to all output units. Input units for questions that have been answered are set to 0 or 1, and the assumption is that neural network has been trained to make output units output values close to 1 for questions that have "Yes" answer given a set of existing answers. At each stage you would pick the question which NN is the least sure about, ie, corresponding output unit is close to 0.5 , ask the question, and set corresponding input unit to the answer. At the last stage you pick an output unit from the "final question" list with value closest to 1 . Each game of 20 questions gives 20 datapoints which you can use to update NN 's weights with back-propagation, ie, you update the weights to make the outputs of current neural network match the true answer given all the previous questions asked.
