What is the purpose of the discriminator in an adversarial autoencoder?

This is specific to the generative adversarial network (GAN) proposed in A. Makhzani et al. "Adversarial Autoencoders". In a traditional GAN, the discriminator is trained to distinguish real samples in $p(x)$ from fake generated samples output by the generator. On the other hand, the variational autoencoder uses discriminators over the latent codes $z$ instead of the original samples. What I cannot understand is how the discriminator is able to distinguish between the latent code's prior distribution $p(z)$ and the posterior distribution $q(z)$. What is the reasoning behind the discriminator model attempting to discriminate something that is not a sample $x$, as in the traditional GAN? And should this discriminator be trained before the rest of the autoencoder?
