Reconciling Lindley's paradox: Why would a frequentist choose a seq. of significance levels?

In this wikipedia link about the Jeffreys-Lindley's paradox, in the subsection «Reconciling the Bayesian and frequentist approaches», right in the first sentence, it's written « if we take a sequence of significance levels, $\alpha_n$». Why would a frequentist take such a sequence? Shouldn't the significance level be determined right at start, with a fixed level? Any help would be appreciated.
