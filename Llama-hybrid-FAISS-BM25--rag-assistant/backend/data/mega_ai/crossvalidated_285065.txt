The only problem that collinearity causes is in figuring out exactly which effect each predictor has and whether there is a clear evidence that a predictor matters. There is really no assumption of independence of predictors for regression, unless you want to do these aforementioned things. The conditional probability of the event of interest in logistic regression is also only the product of the conditional probabilites given one predictor, if the predictors are independent. It is not in general defined in this way. And to be honest, unless we are in an experimental setting, where you can manipulate each predictor independently from each other, predictors will in practice never truly be independent. As soon as you do not care about these things and do only care about prediction, then collinearity becomes somewhat irrelevant (whether we are in a machine learning, statistical or any other framework).
