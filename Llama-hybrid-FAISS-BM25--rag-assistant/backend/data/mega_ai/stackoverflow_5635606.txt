MapNetworkDrive will accept any password

I am writing a script for adding a network share to windows laptops provided for students at the school i work at. The script is written in VBS, and uses the MapNetworkDrive function, so it is very simple, just two dialogs asking for username and password. But when I test it with my own username it seams to completely ignore the password I enter and, presumably, use a password stored somewhere, as it allways maps the drive. Does anyone know where these credentials are stored in windows 7? (It is not stored in credential storage, i checked)
