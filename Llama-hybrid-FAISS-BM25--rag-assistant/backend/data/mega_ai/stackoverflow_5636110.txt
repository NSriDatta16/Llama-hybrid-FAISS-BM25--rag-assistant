SQL Agent Run SSIS package as Administrator

I'm trying to run a SQL Agent Job with a step that is a SSIS File, and I need this step to be run as administrator. My Package uses a Script task to download a file, as a Browser i Use WATIN . I'm using a thread to start this browser because this browser control requires the thread to be set as Single-Threaded Apartment. This browser control is requiring to be run as administrator. I've already created a Credential for a user that is Windows Admin, a Proxy SSIS account. (SQL Agent user is not windows admin). But the SSIS package is not run as administrator yet. I'm suspecting this is related to UAC. Some details: SQL Agent Account is not Windows Administrator Using Windows Server 2008 R2 My Package is run from the File System. The Package only works on BIDS if I run it as an Administrator (if not admin doesn't work) The Proxy account the job step is configured to run is windows admin. Any help is appreciated!
