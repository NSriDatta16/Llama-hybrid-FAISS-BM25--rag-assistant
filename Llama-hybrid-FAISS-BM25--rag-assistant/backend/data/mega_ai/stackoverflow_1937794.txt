WWW::Mechanize says that the get method is a "well-behaved" overload of LWP::UserAgent get . Looking at the docs for LWP::UserAgent, you can provide a content_cb key which is called with each chunk of the downloaded file: $mech->get( $someurl, ":content_cb" => \&callback ); sub callback { my( $data, $response, $proto ) = @_; # save $data to $i.flv # print download notification }
