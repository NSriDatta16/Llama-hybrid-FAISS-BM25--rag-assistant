I've been working with the DevExpress controls for about a year now (mainly XtraGrid). We switched to XtraGrid because the standard WinForms grid controls ran out of gas very early in the development of my application (a scientific instrumentation app). I agree with your comment about their controls being somewhat complicated and non-intuitive. There are so many features it's often hard to wade through all the properties, and understand how they interact. I don't agree "they are also seriously flawed in some design situations" - my experience has been the opposite. The overall design seems so powerful and well thought out that almost anything is possible (though I often need guidance from their tech support to implement the features I need). The excellent tech support (24 hour turnaround on all questions) is the key here - if I can't figure out how to do what I want relatively quickly, I just send a support request. This was a change in my work habits - I generally prefer to figure things out myself - but has been working well on my project. Overall, I'm very happy we went with DevExpress.
