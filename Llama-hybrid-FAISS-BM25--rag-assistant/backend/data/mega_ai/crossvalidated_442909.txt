Logistic regression is used when modelling the probability of an event happening, which will usually mean that the response variable is binary. The model provides odds ratios for the exposure. It can be used in both prospective and retrospective studies. Logistic regression can also be used as a predictive model for classification where the target variable is of two types. Cox regression is used for modelling time to failure (or more generally time to an event. In epidemiology this is often survival and is often used for prospective studies. The model estimates a hazard ratio, which Is the ratio of hazards in two groups (often treatment/intervention and control). Intuitively, this means is the rate of the event (e.g. death) so a hazard ratio of 2 means the rate of death in one group is twice that of the other. Cox regression make a "proportional hazards" assumption - that the hazard ratio stays constant over time.
