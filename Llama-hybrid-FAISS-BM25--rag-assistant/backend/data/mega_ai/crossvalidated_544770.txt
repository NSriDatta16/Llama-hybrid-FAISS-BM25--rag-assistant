I find this a strange question but one idea would be to construct the interval from a confidence distribution of the parameter of interest. In the iid normal case for $\mu$ the cdf of one such confidence distribution is $$ F(\mu) = F_{T_{n-1}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{n}(\mu-\bar x)}s\right). $$ where $F_{T_{n-1}}$ is the cdf of the student $t$ -distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. Then, choosing $c$ such that $$ F(c)-F(-c)=1-\alpha, $$ we may hope to achieve coverage of the interval $(-c,c)$ close to the nominal level of $1-\alpha$ . This indeed appears to happen for large $\mu/\sigma$ (black curve in plot below). However, as $\mu$ becomes small this procedure inevitably leads to an interval always containing $\mu$ . The interval $(-c,c)$ where $c=\max(|U|,|L|)$ and $(U,L)$ is the ordinary Student $t$ -interval for $\mu$ (suggested by @whuber in the comments) appears to achieve a confidence level of $1-\alpha$ if the confidence level of the interval $(U,L)$ is $1-2\alpha$ (red curve in plot below). This implies that it is always shorter than the one derived via the confidence distribution. It also appears to have coverage always closer to the nominal level (red curve in plot below).
