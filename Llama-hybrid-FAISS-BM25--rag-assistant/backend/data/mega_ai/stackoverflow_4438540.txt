Error compiler, cannot convert parameter 2 from MyStruct1 to const void*, for memcpy

I am trying to copy the data from on structure to another. The bytes are identical that each struct can handle are the same. My declarations and the memcpy are below: typedef struct{ CString strNumber; CString strAlpha; } _Number; typedef struct{ CString strIterration; _Number NumberOne; _Number NumberTwo; } _Store; _Store Data1; _Store Data2; Now let's say that the first struct Data1 has data and the second is just declared. I am using the following code: memcpy(&Data2, Data1, sizeof(_Store)); I cannot compile as the error appears. Any ideas? Any other approaches to copy the data?
