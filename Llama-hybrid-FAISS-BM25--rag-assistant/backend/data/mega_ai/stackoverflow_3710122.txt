When you declare a variable without allocation qualifiers, as you have, the compiler assumes you mean auto . An auto variable exists for the lifetime of the scope in which it is defined, and then goes away. This usually happens by (though not by fiat of the language itself) placing the storage location for those variables on the call stack. When the function completes, the memory used by those variables is reclaimed automatically when the call pops the stack frame for the function off the call stack.
