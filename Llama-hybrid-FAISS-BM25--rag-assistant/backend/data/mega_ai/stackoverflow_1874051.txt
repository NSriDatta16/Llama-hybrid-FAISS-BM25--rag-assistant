c++ multiple enums in one function argument using bitwise or "|"

I recently came across some functions where you can pass multiple enums like this: myFunction(One | Two); Since I think this is a really elegant way I tried to implement something like that myself: void myFunction(int _a){ switch(_a){ case One: cout now if I try to call the function with One | Two, I want that both switch cases get called. I am not really good with binary operators so I dont really know what to do. Any ideas would be great! Thanks!
