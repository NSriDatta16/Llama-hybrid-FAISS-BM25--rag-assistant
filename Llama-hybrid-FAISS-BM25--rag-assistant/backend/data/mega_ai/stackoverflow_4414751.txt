Google Maps API bounds error

I'm using the Google Maps v3 API to generate a group of locations for a given city. I want the map to load centered at the average position of all locations. To do this, I'm loading LatLng objects of all the locations I want to mark on the map into an array called locations and using the following code: if(locations.length > 1) { var bounds = new google.maps.LatLngBounds(locations[0], locations[1]); for(var x = 2; x However, in testing, I used this code to define the locations array: var locations = []; locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.11658, 8.68552)); locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.10026, 8.66941)); locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.10989, 8.68822)); locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.11074, 8.68269)); locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.1040552, 8.6936269)); locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.110206, 8.6818686)); locations.push(new google.maps.LatLng(50.10957, 8.69077)); and got a crazy result for center . If I remove the first location (the one at 50.11658, 8.68552), the code works. If I move it so that it's not the first location pushed into the array, the code works. I have no idea why or how that location would or could produce this error!
