Challenge: C# Foreach - Before, After, Even, Odd, Last, First

Since C# doesn't have a before,after,last,first etc. as part of its foreach. The challenge is to mimic this behavior as elegantly as possible with the following criteria: Must allow: before, first, even, odd, last, after events Give an option execute/not execute the primary function (function executed on all objects of the collection) during the events listed in #1 If you can exceed the above criteria, pleases do! I'll post my answer below, but its not elegant nor is it feasible, so I would like to see what the community can conjure up. hard coded for loops get annoying sometimes =(
