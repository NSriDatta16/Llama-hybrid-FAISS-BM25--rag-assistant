Xcode: How to set debug environment with multiple xcconfig files?

I'm using Xcode 3.2 with xcconfig files. The files are organized by target. For example, I have a debug.xcconfig file and a release.xcconfig one. Both uses common settings, so I added a shared.xcconfig file which is included by both. The shared.xcconfig file looks like this: GCC_C_LANGUAGE_STANDARD = c99 GCC_WARN_ABOUT_RETURN_TYPE = YES GCC_WARN_UNUSED_VARIABLE = YES GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS = SOME_COMMON_DEFINITIONS The debug.xcconfig file looks like this: #include "Shared.xcconfig" GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = 0 Now, I would like to add a DEBUG preprocessor definition in the debug.xcconfig file. As shown in this question , the following method is supposed to work: GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS = "$(GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) DEBUG" This doesn't work in Xcode 3.2. The Xcode documentation also explicitly mention that modifying variables is not possible, you can only overwrite them. How would you guys solve this problem?
