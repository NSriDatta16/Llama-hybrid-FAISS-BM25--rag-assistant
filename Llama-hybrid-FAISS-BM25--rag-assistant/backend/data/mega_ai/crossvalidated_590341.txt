If the dataset is of similar nature, the features extracted for the original (possibly very large) dataset, which is conceptually achieved in the first layers of a neural net, should be representative enough for the rest of the neural network to learn. Fine-tuning tunes the final parts of the network to better suit the problem at hand. Here, a feature extraction would mean training, or continuing training, the first layers as well, which is usually not desirable considering the computational cost.
