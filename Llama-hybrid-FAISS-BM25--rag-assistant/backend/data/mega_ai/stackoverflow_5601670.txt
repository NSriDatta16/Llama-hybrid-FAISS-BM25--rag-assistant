Best approach to streamvideo from android to PC

Hello I've been trying to stream video (Like webcam) from android phone ( 2.2 ) to a PC, yet without success, I've seen so many approches " Sipdroid, IMdroid " depend on reading the output of MediaRecorder and manipulates it to make it streamable, Droidcam, IPcam - which uses preview frames ( I supposed that because they stream in M-JPEG format)- even ffmpeg was suggested wich would access the video4linux cam directly - away from the os -. I guess for my case M-jpeg streaming is the simplest approach but till now I couldn't find any open source app that implements it. can anyone help ? can anyone suggest a simple code to stream video live from android phone to pc throw RTP, HTTP or any other possible protocol ?
