Auto correlation (Exogeneity) : If the observation of residual in t1 is dependent on the observation of residual in t0, then it basically violates the underlying assumption of OLS which states "Error term is independently distributed and not correlated" . This can bias the estimation of Beta coefficient of OLS term. When such trend is observed in the residuals, the residuals of regression model picks up the influence of those variables that are affecting the dependent variables that aren't part of the regression equation . The persistence in excluded variables is most of the times a cause for autocorrelation. This is more prevalent in Time series data. This can be mitigated by using some of the transformations techniques like, Paris Winston Transformation of Data Differencing the dependent variables Differencing all variables One simpler approach would be, estimating the linear model using OLS. Compute the residuals. Regress the residuals of all Independent variables and lagged variables. Use t-test, if the coefficient of lagged residual is significant, we can reject the null of independent errors. Test to detect Auto correlation: ** Durbin - Watson Bruesch - Godfrey This assumption/issue is violated/exempted if the explanatory variables are stochastic , for instance when they are measured with error, or are endogenous.
