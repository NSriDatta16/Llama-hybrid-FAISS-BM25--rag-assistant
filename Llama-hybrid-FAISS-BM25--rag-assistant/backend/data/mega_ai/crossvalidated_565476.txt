Generally speaking, 35 observations is not enough for ML model. You might consider more simple econometric model, for instance, logistic regression for classification problem. However, there is one solution. I would suggest bootstrap (sampling from 35 observations with replacement) since bootstrap requires no assumptions about the underlying distribution and reproduces distribution from the small sample in larger one. The problem is that sample with 35 observations only might be not representative for underlying distribution of data, so bootstrapped sample might become useless.
