Maybe the problem is you're expecting the WMP plugin to play MP4 files. With the default codecs present in Windows pre-7 it won't, in any browser. Maybe the problem is that you're not getting the expected media player plugin on the other browsers. WMP, QT and Real may all try to play ‘application/x-mplayer2’ embeds and which one wins is a matter of configuration and luck. Real and older QTs can't play MP4 either. And all plugins randomly fail because they hate you. Maybe the problem is the invalid URLs (spaces should be encoded as %20). Or maybe the problem is simply that you're embedding a media player plugin. This has never worked reliably. Never. Almost no-one even tries any more. It's a total dead loss. The world has overwhelmingly moved on to Flash video , with HTML5 coming up on the horizon but not mainstream yet; do yourself a favour and join them.
