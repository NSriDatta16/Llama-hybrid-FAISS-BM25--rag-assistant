What are my options for photo/video/audio encoding and storage APIs?

Users of my web application will upload video and audio clips and photographs. The media needs to be private within the web application, which I imagine rules out using YouTube for encoding and storage. I don't want to be responsible for storing the data on my servers, so some kind of pay-by-the-gb API seems appropriate. Amazon might do, but wouldn't help with encoding video that's uploaded. Which cloud services are out there for this purpose, and can you recommend any from first-hand experience? Cheers!
