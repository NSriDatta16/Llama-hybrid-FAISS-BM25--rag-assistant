Appropriate method that will allow statistical comparison

I have a data set looking into whether a farm experienced a livestock disease or not in the year 2011 and 2012 and if several factors could be predictors for the livestock disease. The independent variables were also collected for both years though some variables did not change e.g Thistles remained the same for both years. I am looking for an appropriate method that will allow statistical comparison between the two years rather than treating analysis as two separate sets of analyses (i.e not to treating 2011 and 2012 as two separate data set) Whilst trying to do the analysis I have created dependent variable as farm having the disease or not between year 2011 and 2012(Orf.Yes.No2011.2012)against the dependent variables using logistic regression: I'm just wondering whether I doing the right thing or what could be the best statistical approach which will allow for statistical comparison between the two years? Any help will be very much appreciated Here is the R output and sample of dataset: > mod=glm(Orf.Yes.No2011.2012~F2011+ F2012+as.factor(Breed)+ D2011+D2012,family=binomial, data=orf) summary(mod) Call: glm(formula = Orf.Yes.No2011.2012 ~ F2011 + F2012 + as.factor(Breed) + D2011 + D2012, family = binomial, data = orf) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.862 -1.293 1.023 1.065 1.318 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
