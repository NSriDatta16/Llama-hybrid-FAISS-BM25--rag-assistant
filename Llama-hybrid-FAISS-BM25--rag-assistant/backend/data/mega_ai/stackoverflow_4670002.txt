Flexible android layout for multiple screen sizes/densities

I am working on creating a card game for android. I am trying to come up with a layout that will allow the game to be played on all screen sizes and densities. I have read: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html However, I am still confused on the best way to do this. For this game, I need the cards laid out in landscape mode, in 5 columns. There are places above the 5 columns for additional cards. It is very similar to solitaire in this respect...but I only have need for 5 columns instead of 7. What size card images should be in ldpi, mdpi, and hdpi? What type of layout should I use (Table, Linear, Relative)? Should I create different layouts for the different screen sizes (small, normal, large)? Any examples you can point me to?
