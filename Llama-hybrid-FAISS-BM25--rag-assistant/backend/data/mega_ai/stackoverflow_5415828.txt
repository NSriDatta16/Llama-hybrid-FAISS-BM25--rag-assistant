Magento 1.4.1.1 ::: Exporting Products Leads to Fatal Error

I am exporting around 1200 products to csv via Magento's export profile feature. The export begins and then locks up. php has this to work with: max_execution_time 28000 memory_limit 1024M I get this error: [Wed Mar 23 12:48:33 2011] [error] [client 84.229.93.19] PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 24 bytes) in /path/to/lib/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php on line 292, referer: http://domain.com/index.php/admin/system_convert_profile/edit/id/10/key/598b0f0c45b13aba68a3fbe2b06a4d85/ Now, I know Magento 1.4.1.1 has a memory leak that directly affects this process,a nd I applied a patch to treat the issue: http://blog.ewtechnologies.com/magento-2/magento-memory-leak-1-4-1-1/ But I still have this problem. Does anyone have any other insights into this? Even if upgrading to 1.5.x will help?
