Don't do this I'm trying to encode certain nominal attributes as integers . Rather, use a separate binary feature for each value of each nominal attribute. The way SVMs are formulated, all attributes/features are numeric and class labels are nominal. Nominal attributes are essentially faked by using mutually exclusive binary features.
