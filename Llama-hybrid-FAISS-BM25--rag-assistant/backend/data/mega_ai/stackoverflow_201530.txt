How should I add multiple identical elements to a div with jQuery

I need to add multiple empty divs to a container element using jQuery. At the moment I am generating a string containing the empty html using a loop divstr = ' ... '; and then injecting that into my container: $('#container').html(divstr); Is there a more elegant way to insert multiple, identical elements? I'm hoping to find something that wouldn't break chaining but wouldn't bring the browser to its knees. A chainable .repeat() plugin?
