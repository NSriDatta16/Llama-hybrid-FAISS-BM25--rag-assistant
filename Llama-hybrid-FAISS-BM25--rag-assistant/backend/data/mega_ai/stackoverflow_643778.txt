There are many ways to solve this problem. Here's a simple way that would solve the problem with little code: Create a Dictionary to hold the conversions; For each of the conversion factor lines in the file you could do a conversionFactors.Add(from-to, value), where from-to is the concatenation of those two units - it's just a lookup key, so it doesn't matter much how you format it. The assumption is that the user's going to enter the same text strings. Then take the user's input, construct the from-to "key", grab the conversion factor "value" from the Dictionary by doing a dictionary[from_to] and do the multiplication. Certainly not elegant but it's probably a dozen or so lines of code. Sounds like homework, so I'll leave my solution at that.
