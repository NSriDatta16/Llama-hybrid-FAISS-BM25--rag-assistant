MS DataGridView.show fails to work

I used to have a single DataGridView (DGV) on a form. I formatted and populated this, then used DGV.Show to make it appear on my form. This worked fine. I upgraded my form, to included 2 DGVs. Within a sub I dim a new DGV, populate and format it as before then set this equal to whichever DGV on the form it's meant to be. For example: Dim pDGV as new DataGridView with pDGV .ColumnHeadersVisible = True .RowHeadersVisible = False .AutoSizeColumnsMode = DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.AllCells .ScrollBars = ScrollBars.Both .DataSource = pTable .AllowUserToAddRows = False .AllowUserToDeleteRows = False .ReadOnly = True end with frm1.DGV1 = pDGV frm1.DGV1.show During debug, I can see that Frm1.DGV appears to be indentical to pDGV, in that it has the same number of columns and rows etc. However, it fails to show. I can revert back to populating and formatting each DGV individually, but that duplicates a lot of code. I thought this would be more elegant. Any ideas as to why the .show won't work? thanks
