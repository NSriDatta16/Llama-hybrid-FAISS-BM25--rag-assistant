What is the most efficient way to store large amounts of data in a table in c#

I would like store large amounts of data (text) in a table with six columns and up to ten thousand rows. I will be building the table programatically. (Meaning I want to be able to add rows as I go) Is datatable my best option? I'm planning to bind it to a Telerik Grid Control for ASP.NET I am wondering I am better off going in with another type of class I do not know about. I will be using the controls ability to sort and page, but I don't know if that matters too much on the underlying object. Retrieval, then storage then programmer time should be considered for when I say efficiency.
