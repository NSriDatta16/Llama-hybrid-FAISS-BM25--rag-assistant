Do you see some serious problems we may have with this solution? Your solution only works as long as you can put everything in a single repository. This means the entire repository has to fit on a single disk (or storage pool) for the foreseeable future. Similar considerations apply for other server resources like network and disk I/O bandwidth. Splitting the repository later will require a big overhaul of your whole set-up, and might cause headaches when you need to rebuild or branch old versions. Your solution only works if you don't need to limit read/write permissions on a per-user basis If you need to give read/write permission for projectA, you'll actually have to give permission for /trunk/projectA, and /branch1/projectA, and /branch2/projectA etc. Branching then becomes a heavy-weight process that requires lots of permission tweaking. Say goodbye to feature branches .
