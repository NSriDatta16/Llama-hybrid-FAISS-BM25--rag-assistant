I wouldn't worry about efficiency until I had observed a problem and measurements told me that the FOP solution was the culprit. I'd propose an asynch call to a web service. Sent a message containing the XML input stream and the XSL-T stylesheet. Have the service write the PDF to its local disk. Add a mailbox to your UI to alert users when the PDF was ready to be picked up. Click on the link, and the PDF is streamed to the browser. The user can view or save to their local disk as they wish. Asynch is good in this case because you don't know how long the transform might take. Why make the user wait? Let them check back later. An AJAX call to check for the new PDF would be elegant.
