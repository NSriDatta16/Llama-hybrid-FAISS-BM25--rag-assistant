In my opinion a RNN is too computational heavy. You have to run it on a cloud service or on a GPU. Furthermore I think that based in the environment temperature you can not predict the wanted temperature by the user. You would need additional data such as humidity, because you have to learn how the user feels the temperature and this depends on several factors. If this aren't fake data, you can obviously see that there is no correlation. And it seems that you only record the environment temperature when the thermostat temperature changes. This is not enough for predicting. If you don't have any additional data I would suggest that you calculate the gradient of the temperature change over a specific time, as well. If you have more data I would suggest to start with plotting the data nicely to get an impression. Then I would try a multiple linear regression and a Perceptron or a multi layer Perceptron.
