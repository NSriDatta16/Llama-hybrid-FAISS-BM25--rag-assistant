This can happen if you have a time series that is N.i.i.d. and you construct an inappropriate ARIMA model of the form(0,1,0) which is a first difference random walk model with no drift then the variance (sum of squares - SSE ) of the residuals will be larger than the variance (sum of squares SSO) of the original series. Thus the equation 1-SSE/SSO will yield a negative number as SSE execeedS SSO . We have seen this when users simply fit an assumed model or use inadequate procedures to identify/form an appropriate ARIMA structure. The larger message IS that a model can distort (much like a pair of bad glasses ) your vision. Without having access to your data I would otherwise have a problem in explaining your faulty results. Have you brought this to the attention of IBM ? The idea of an assumed model being counter-productive has been echoed by Harvey Motulsky. Great post Harvey !
