Design a single stylesheet that works cross-browser. Get IE as close as you can, and then use IE Condition Comments to load the rest. IE Conditional Comments are the accepted way to load IE (including version) specific CSS rules. They are most definitely not a hack. Don't use anything that relys on user-agent as that is easy to spoof. I also stay away from client side CSS frameworks because (for the most part) they are just glorified table layouts (you can check out this StackOverflow post for more details on frameworks).
