Definition of the function for exponentially decaying weighted average

I feel really thick asking this question, but I'm afraid I don't really understand the Wikipedia article explaining how to do a weighted average with expontentially decreasing weights . I really have two questions, I guess: I don't see anywhere in the Wiki article an explicit statement of the actual function to implement, something along the lines of exp_dec_avg(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn) = ... I think the reader is supposed to infer the definition of this function from the details provided but there are gaps my unstatsy mind can't fill. Could someone give explicitly state the definition for me. More mundane, I was assuming that exp_dec_avg(3, 3, 3) = 3 but my probably horribly wrong implementation does not return this. Am I right?
