AllowDrop of *DragDropTarget not available in latest Silverlight toolkit 4

I know this has been discussed a number of times but I've been through all posts on the internet and nothing helped solve my problem. I am making use of PanelDragDropTarget but can't get it to build when used AllowDrop property in my xaml. I've of course registered both namespaces but still get following error: The property 'AllowDrop' does not exist on the type 'PanelDragDropTarget' in the XML namespace 'clr-namespace:System.Windows.Controls;assembly=System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit'. C:\MainPage.xaml or The property 'AllowDrop' does not exist on the type 'PanelDragDropTarget' in the XML namespace 'clr-namespace:Microsoft.Windows;assembly=System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit'. c:\MainPage.xaml The Toolkit library referenced is of version 4.0.5.0 and I also have referenced Toolkit.Internals. I am using VS 2008.
