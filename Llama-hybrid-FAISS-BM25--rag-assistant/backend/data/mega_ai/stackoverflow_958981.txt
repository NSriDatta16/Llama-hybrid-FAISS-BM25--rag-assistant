By default the TeamCity Build Agent service runs as the Local System account. If your tests or build script require something that cannot be accessed with that account (in my case it was a database connection) you have two options: Change permissions on the resource to allow access by the system account Change the account used by the build agent service Changing the service account is the same as for any other windows service - via Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services
