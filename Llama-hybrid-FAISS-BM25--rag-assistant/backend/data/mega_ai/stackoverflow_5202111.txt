If you really want to do incremental parsing, consider this paper by Tim Wagner. It is brilliant scheme to keep existing parse trees around, shuffling mixtures of string fragments at the points of editing and parse trees representing the parts of the source text that hasn't changed, and reintegrating the strings into the set of parse trees. It is done using an incremental GLR parser. It isn't easy to implement; I did just the GLR part and never got around to the incremental part. The GLR part was well worth the trouble. There are lots of papers on incremental parsing. This is one of the really good ones.
