I can direct you to the Fast Feature Selection based on R^2-values, based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient. This method was introduced for multidimensional MEG or EEG data, however it suits any binary machine learning problem. Put simply: it computes correlations of data and labels, then sorts obtained values, finally only the best scoring features are selected. I implemented the approach for MATLAB and LIBSVM found at github . In my implementation you can define the amount of features to be selected, e.g. 100, 1000 or everything above the mean of scoring values.
