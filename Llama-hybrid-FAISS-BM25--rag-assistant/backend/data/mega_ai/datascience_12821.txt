how to generate sample dataset for classification problem

I am a newbie to data science. I have a 'short text' categorization problem where input variables are either unstructured texts (names, definition, description etc) or categorical. There is not much semantic to the fields as they are product names, territory name, sales order type etc. Issue is I do not have any sample data set from which I can derive training, test, validation set or divided it into k-fold for cross validation. So how should I generate sample data? I have about 20 target classes. I can classify some dataset using regex or lucene rule based matches and manually verify them and make sure each class have equal amount of samples. But I am open to other suggestion.
