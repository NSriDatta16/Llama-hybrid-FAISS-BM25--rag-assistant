Encrypted Android Database (SQLite?)

Possible Duplicate: android database encryption I have a sensitive-ish SQLite database that I'd like to be able to store on the SDCard for more storage. Seems like there isn't a documented way to do this. Anyone have a method that works? Open to any ideas. Thanks!
