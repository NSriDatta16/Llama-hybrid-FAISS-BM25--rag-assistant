Are you doing cross-validation? It's possible that those are just internal debugging ids for the software. I edited my code to not be as verbose, so it usually just prints out summary statistics for me! Based on the fact that it's on the same line as the "optimization finished" statement, it may have to do with iterations while the model is converging. Either way, I don't think you have to worry. Have you read the papers associated with the software? Learning about the underlying algorithm, for me, goes a long way to demystifying it! You should read LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines . LIBLINEAR: A Library for Large Linear Classification is probably also worth a read!
