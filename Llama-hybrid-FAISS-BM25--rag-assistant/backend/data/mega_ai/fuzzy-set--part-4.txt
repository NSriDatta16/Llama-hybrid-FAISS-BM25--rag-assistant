 A ) = A 2 {\displaystyle CON(A)=A^{2}} is defined ∀ x ∈ U : μ C O N ( A ) ( x ) = μ A 2 ( x ) = μ A ( x ) 2 . {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{CON(A)}(x)=\mu _{A^{2}}(x)=\mu _{A}(x)^{2}.} Taking 0 0 = 1 {\displaystyle 0^{0}=1} , we have A 0 = U {\displaystyle A^{0}=U} and A 1 = A . {\displaystyle A^{1}=A.} Given fuzzy sets A , B {\displaystyle A,B} , the fuzzy set difference A ∖ B {\displaystyle A\setminus B} , also denoted A − B {\displaystyle A-B} , may be defined straightforwardly via the membership function: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ∖ B ( x ) = t ( μ A ( x ) , n ( μ B ( x ) ) ) , {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\setminus {B}}(x)=t(\mu _{A}(x),n(\mu _{B}(x))),} which means A ∖ B = A ∩ ¬ B {\displaystyle A\setminus B=A\cap \neg {B}} , e. g.: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ∖ B ( x ) = min ( μ A ( x ) , 1 − μ B ( x ) ) . {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\setminus {B}}(x)=\min(\mu _{A}(x),1-\mu _{B}(x)).} Another proposal for a set difference could be: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A − B ( x ) = μ A ( x ) − t ( μ A ( x ) , μ B ( x ) ) . {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A-{B}}(x)=\mu _{A}(x)-t(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{B}(x)).} Proposals for symmetric fuzzy set differences have been made by Dubois and Prade (1980), either by taking the absolute value, giving ∀ x ∈ U : μ A △ B ( x ) = | μ A ( x ) − μ B ( x ) | , {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\triangle B}(x)=|\mu _{A}(x)-\mu _{B}(x)|,} or by using a combination of just max, min, and standard negation, giving ∀ x ∈ U : μ A △ B ( x ) = max ( min ( μ A ( x ) , 1 − μ B ( x ) ) , min ( μ B ( x ) , 1 − μ A ( x ) ) ) . {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\triangle B}(x)=\max(\min(\mu _{A}(x),1-\mu _{B}(x)),\min(\mu _{B}(x),1-\mu _{A}(x))).} Axioms for definition of generalized symmetric differences analogous to those for t-norms, t-conorms, and negators have been proposed by Vemur et al. (2014) with predecessors by Alsina et al. (2005) and Bedregal et al. (2009). In contrast to crisp sets, averaging operations can also be defined for fuzzy sets. Disjoint fuzzy sets In contrast to the general ambiguity of intersection and union operations, there is clearness for disjoint fuzzy sets: Two fuzzy sets A , B {\displaystyle A,B} are disjoint iff ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ( x ) = 0 ∨ μ B ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A}(x)=0\lor \mu _{B}(x)=0} which is equivalent to ∄ {\displaystyle \nexists } x ∈ U : μ A ( x ) > 0 ∧ μ B ( x ) > 0 {\displaystyle x\in U:\mu _{A}(x)>0\land \mu _{B}(x)>0} and also equivalent to ∀ x ∈ U : min ( μ A ( x ) , μ B ( x ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\min(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{B}(x))=0} We keep in mind that min/max is a t/s-norm pair, and any other will work here as well. Fuzzy sets are disjoint if and only if their supports are disjoint according to the standard definition for crisp sets. For disjoint fuzzy sets A , B {\displaystyle A,B} any intersection will give ∅, and any union will give the same result, which is denoted as A ∪ ˙ B = A ∪ B {\displaystyle A\,{\dot {\cup }}\,B=A\cup B} with its membership function given by ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ∪ ˙ B ( x ) = μ A ( x ) + μ B ( x ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A{\dot {\cup }}B}(x)=\mu _{A}(x)+\mu _{B}(x)} Note that only one of both summands is greater than zero. For disjoint fuzzy sets A , B {\displaystyle A,B} the following holds true: Supp ⁡ ( A ∪ ˙ B ) = Supp ⁡ ( A ) ∪ Supp ⁡ ( B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Supp} (A\,{\dot {\cup }}\,B)=\operatorname {Supp} (A)\cup \operatorname {Supp} (B)} This can be generalized to finite families of fuzzy sets as follows: Given a family A = ( A i ) i ∈ I {\displaystyle A=(A_{i})_{i\in I}} of fuzzy sets with index set I (e.g. I = {1,2,3,...,n}). This family is (pairwise) disjoint iff for all x ∈ U there exists at most one i ∈ I such that μ A i ( x ) > 0. {\displaystyle {\text{for all }}x\in U{\text{ there exists at most one }}i\in I{\text{ such that }}\mu _{A_{i}}(x)>0.} A family of fuzzy sets A = ( A i ) i ∈ I {\displaystyle A=(A_{i})_{i\in I}} is disjoint, iff the family of underlying supports Supp ∘ A
