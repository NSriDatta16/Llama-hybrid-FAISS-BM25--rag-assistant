Restart agent thread-pool after calling shutdown-agents

If I call (shutdown-agents) from the REPL, and then later on try to use an agent later on, I get an exception saying the agent pool isn't available (of course!). The question is, how can the agent thread pool be re-started without having to re-launch the REPL and lose all of my state? Thanks!
