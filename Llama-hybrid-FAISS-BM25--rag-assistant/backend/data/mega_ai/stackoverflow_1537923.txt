Prioritize section of IF statement

I've got an IF statement that validates data. Basically looks like this: Dim s As String = Nothing If s Is Nothing Or s.Length = 0 Then Console.WriteLine("Please enter a value") End If Console.Read() I'd like to check to see if it's nothing first because if I write it this way, it throws a NullReferenceException. I've thought of re-writing it like this: If s Is Nothing Then Console.WriteLine("Please enter a value") ElseIf s.Length = 0 Then Console.WriteLine("Please enter a value") End If But if I do this I've got the same error message twice and I believe it's less clear what my intent is. I've also tried throwing parenthesis around the s Is Nothing clause, but it doesn't work. Is there an elegant what to test if the object is nothing and then test a property of it?
