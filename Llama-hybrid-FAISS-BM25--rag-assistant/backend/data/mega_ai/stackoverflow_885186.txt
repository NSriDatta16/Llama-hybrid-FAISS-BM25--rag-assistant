Image Library Software

I have a need for an Image Library within my organization and I was wondering if anyone knows of any that they could recommend. It will need to be able to integrate with any number of our own solutions (meaning it will have a set of services or APIs that one can use for integration). Also I would be great if it had: facial recognition, geo-tagging, indexing of colors, people, places, photo content, (meaning it can detect the primary colors used in the photo, read content from the photo, like OCR, tell where the focus of the photo is), search by any of these (i.e. color, geo position, etc). Basically a cross between, iPhoto (with its facial recognition, geo-tagging, etc) and iStockPhoto (with its color, content, focus placement detection, etc) for an Organization. As you can imagine I would prefer not to have to build this myself. Cheers Anthony Note: I am more after a commercial piece of software that is an Image Library and does the above, that allows for integration
