It is often the case in sports analytics that people ask questions about more ethereal concepts like momentum, clutch, or home-field advantage. At the surface it would sound silly to say that these things don't exist. However, whether or not they exist is a separate question from whether or not we can meaningfully use them in any sort of predictive analysis. Sometimes it takes so much data to separate the signal from the noise that the signal is mostly gone by the time it can be detected (this is largely, but not entirely, the case with clutch hitting in Major League Baseball for instance). Home-field advantage, on the other hand, is quite a significant predictor over a range of sports (often at least partially due to subconscious biases in officials). In the case of successive soccer matches, since the players are human beings with memory, of course matches will not be completely independent, but I don't think that's a very interesting question to ask. I think it's more interesting to wonder what meaningful predictive value might be found. This question is basically a variant of the so-called "hot hand effect." That is, does success in the recent past lead to more success in the future (after controlling for quality of teams, etc.)? I can't speak specifically about soccer, but this has been looked at numerous times across various sports (perhaps most notably in free-throw shooting in basketball where conditions are more homogeneous and outside forces are minimized). Typically any tiny effect that might be found in these studies tends to be too small to do much with. Perhaps soccer is different, but I wouldn't bet on it. If you wanted to investigate for yourself, you'd want to make sure you account for the skill and health of each team. If Team A won yesterday, I'd guess they are more likely to win tomorrow as well. This isn't because of a memory but because the knowledge that Team A won increases our belief that they are an above-average, healthy team. Also, there might be a fair amount of non-randomness in scheduling that you might need to account for. In Major League Baseball for instance, a large number of very good teams happened to be clustered on the East Coast, and teams from the West Coast tend to have their games against them clustered together. What might at the surface appear to be the team having a memory of their losses could just be a scheduling artifact.
