There is no way to ask the CPU to test and return the type of a byte/word/long. 0xFF may hold "255" or "-1" it all depends on what type of byte your program says it is. Constructs such as "type", "signess" etc only exist in higher level languages such as Java and not at the CPU level. In the end everything is a byte to the CPU it is up to our programs to organise and know how to intrepret and manipulate these values... The CPU flags found in the status do not enforce any paradigm it is up to your code to test and react accordingly. On Intel CPUs the MMX and FPU registers actually occupy the same registers. It is thus impossible to mix FPU and MMX type instructions at the same time, because values from one operation will trash the other. Programs that need either typically complete their actions in one mode eg issuing FPU instructions and then might start MMX but never both at the same time.
