You are right that, in a sense, frequentist hypothesis testing has it backwards. I'm not saying that that approach is wrong, but rather that the results are often not designed to answer the questions that the researcher is most interested in. If you want a technique more similar to the scientific method, try Bayesian inference . Instead of talking about a "null hypothesis" that you can reject or fail to reject, with Bayesian inference you begin with a prior probability distribution based upon your understanding of the situation at hand. When you acquire new evidence, Bayesian inference provides a framework for you to update your belief with the evidence taken into account. I think this is how more similar to how science works.
