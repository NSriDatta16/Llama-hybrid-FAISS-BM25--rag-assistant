Rails and Devise - Access session data

I have a Rails app with devise integrated. I'm using the Cookie Store session. I need to store some data in the session everytime someone signs in, Eg. their user id. How can i do so with Devise? May be there is some elegant way where i just dont need to do that and could access it with Devise itself.? Thanks!
