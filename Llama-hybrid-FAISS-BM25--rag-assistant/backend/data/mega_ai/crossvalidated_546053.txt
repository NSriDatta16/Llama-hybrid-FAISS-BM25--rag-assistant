I have a similar issue. I have Calculation, based on a formula that depends on X which in turn depends on A, B, C, D as subset features. The prediction has to be made based on X. A good analogy can be delivery time calculated by FedEx based on Postal Code. While the actual duration is based on statistical information of the postal code like rural or urban, distance from retail office, driving distance, road condition, service time etc. etc. How can we turn this into a machine learning model from historical data and actual delivery duration experienced, without writing a big formula for calculation.
