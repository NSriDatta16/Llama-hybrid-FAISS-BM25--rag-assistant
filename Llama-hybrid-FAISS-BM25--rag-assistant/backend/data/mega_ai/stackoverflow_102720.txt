CSS (Stylesheet) organization and colors

I just finished a medium sized web site and one thing I noticed about my css organization was that I have a lot of hard coded colour values throughout. This obviously isn't great for maintainability. Generally, when I design a site I pick 3-5 main colours for a theme. I end up setting some default values for paragraphs, links, etc... at the beginning of my main css, but some components will change the colour (like the legend tag for example) and require me to restyle with the colour I wanted. How do you avoid this? I was thinking of creating separate rules for each colour and just use those when I need to restyle. i.e. .color1 { color: #3d444d; }
