A lot of machine learning might not be that different from p-hacking, for at least some purposes. If you test every possible model to find that one that has highest prediction accuracy (historical prediction or out-group prediction) on the basis of historical data, this does not necessarily mean that the results will help to understand what's going on. However, possibly it will find possible relationships that may inform a hypothesis. Motivating specific hypotheses and then testing them using statistical methods can certainly be similarly p-hacked (or similar) as well. But the point is that if the criteria is "highest prediction accuracy based on historical data", then there is a high risk of being overconfident in some model that one does not understand, without actually having any idea of what drove those historical results and/or whether they may be informative for the future.
