I can confirm the problem. I have generated a similar AJAX response to the original submitter. Some initial info, then a loop through the data to create 8 different div's worth of content. When running the page, it would do the load, but IE would only show some of the data. One small change fixed this. I had a span on the page (for a set of video tags) within each div, so that I could truncate text if it was too long, and use the span with the title attribute as a hovertip. If the tag span was formatted this way: Tags: Miller, Jackson... it wouldn't work, whereas: Tags: Miller, Jackson, Brown worked fine. Of course, I noticed my error in that there is no span closing tag. Fixing this also worked, but the important thing that I noticed is that IE seems to be very intolerant of formatting errors on AJAX, or, more correctly, AHAH. I would, after having seen this, guarantee that there is some slightly malformed HTML in the return string. I had the exact same error, a fragment of information returned by javascript, that you did, and correcting the error fixed it for me.
