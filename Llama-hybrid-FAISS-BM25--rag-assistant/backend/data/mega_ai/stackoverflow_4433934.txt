Your current solution seems "dangerous" in that if the update raises an exception then the callbacks don't get put back into place which could seriously break any request after it. Self modifying code is a really bad idea if it can have persistent side effects for other threads, it's a bit like using globals. But I have the seem problem and I have been looking all around for a solution and yours has been the best I could find until now. I think Rails may need to add a more elegant way to do this to the Callback module.
