How support vectors is calculated on SVM example?

Question : If we map input data with following $\phi$ function to higher dimension via Hard Margin SVM then support vectors are $a$ and $b$ . How we can find support vectors of this example, i.e: calculating $a$ and $b$ . My solution: (I try this but not reached to solution of example as depicted in image). Update: I think one of support vector is wrong. any idea? Update: as one nice answer so none of them is SV in this example. as we know For the hard margin, the closest points to the separating hyperplane are the support vector so can we select one of these vector as SV's base on this criteria? Update 2: see my solution now.
