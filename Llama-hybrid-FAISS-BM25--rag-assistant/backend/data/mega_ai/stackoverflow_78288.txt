I assume that you've already ruled out the tools in "org.eclipse.swt.dnd" for some reason? There are some examples here on how to go about using them, in case you haven't. If what you really want to do is drag&drop, you're going to have to do some work with those tools. At that point, really the question becomes, what format is it in on the clipboard, vs in a file, and which is easier to integrate into your app.
