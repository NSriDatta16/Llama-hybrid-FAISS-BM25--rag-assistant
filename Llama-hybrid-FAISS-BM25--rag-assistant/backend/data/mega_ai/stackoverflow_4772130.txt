Showing additional data from a table on hover

I am making a small web application in which data is fetched from the server via a php script. This is done with Jquery's AJAX methods. Then about three columns are to be slid down in a table, and when the user hovers over a row, then the additional data is slid down under that row. My question is: (a). How do I slide down the table (I can append it to a div but it does not look very elegant). (b) How would I go about storing the additional data for each row, and slide it under that row in the table. Any help would be greatly appreciated, RayQuang
