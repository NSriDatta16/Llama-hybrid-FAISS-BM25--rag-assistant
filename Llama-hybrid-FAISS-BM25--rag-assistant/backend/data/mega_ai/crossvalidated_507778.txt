Is there an R package designed to find balanced stimulus lists?

Let's say I have two lists of 100 items. I want to select 50 items from each list that are as similar as possible on several variables. Is there an R package that can do this? So far I've come across: LexOPS which comes close, but it creates pairs of matches which is a bit too stringent for what I need; optmatch which I believe does the same. To be clear on why these don't work: I don't need there to be matched pairs of items across the lists, only for their average values on certain variables to be similar (i.e., not significantly different), and having the extra goal of needing pairs of items makes it harder to find groups that are simply similar on average.
