“which in Ruby”: checking if program exists in $PATH from Ruby

My scripts rely heavily on external programs and scripts. I need to be sure that a program I need to call exists. Manually, I’d check this using which in the command line. Is there an equivalent to File.exist? for things in $PATH ? (Yes, I guess I could parse the result of %x[which scriptINeedToRun] , but that’s not super elegant.)
