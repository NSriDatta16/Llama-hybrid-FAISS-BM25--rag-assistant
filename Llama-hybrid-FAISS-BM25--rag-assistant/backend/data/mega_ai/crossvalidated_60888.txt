Is PCA selecting variables or constructing new variables?

I know that PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction but there's something basic escaping me. Let's say I have a feature set $F$ of $n$ features. After I run PCA, which of the following are true about the resulting feature set: It will be a subset of the original feature set $F$ with $k It will be a feature set with $k What I'm trying to get crystal clear is does PCA simply reduce the number of features in the original set to a smaller group that are just as predictive as the complete set or does it create new hybrid features from the original set?
