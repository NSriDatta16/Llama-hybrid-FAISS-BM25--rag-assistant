It does indeed depend on the dataset. Not knowing the dataset it is difficult to know the exact reason, but most probably the 2 clusters you're trying to estimate do indeed exist in your data and are clearly distinguishable. To get an insight into whether this is the case, you could try to project the data points onto the 2D or 3D plane (e.g. via PCA or t-SNE) and visually inspect the data. The difference in clusters you mention may be due to bordering data points fluctuating between both clusters depending on the algorithm initialization. You could run multiple times each algorithm and get an estimate of the average values for your metrics. Another option is to plot different runs of the algorithm (after projecting on 2D) to check for consistency across runs. In summary, yes. You are obtaining almost identical results because of your dataset but that's not the rule. Distance, density and hierarchical clustering algorithms tend to produce different results (also because of the hyperparameters).
