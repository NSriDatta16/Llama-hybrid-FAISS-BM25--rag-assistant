What is the format of an authors file for git svn, specifically for special characters like backslash or underscore?

I am trying to clone Papercut, an smtp server emulator I'm getting the list of SVN authors with svn log -q https://papercut.svn.codeplex.com/svn | grep -e '^r'| awk 'BEGIN {FS="|"};{print $2}'|sort|uniq which is giving me RNO\_MCLWEB SND\krobertson_cp I created an authors.txt with the SVN_User = UserName format, but when I run git svn clone --no-metadata -A authors.txt https://papercut.svn.codeplex.com/svn papercut it complains "Author: RNO\_MCLWEB not defined in authors.txt file" I've tried with putting a \ before the '\' and '_' to try to escape them, and adding quotes around the name, but neither worked. I can't find any better description of the authors.txt file format than SVN_User = UserName
