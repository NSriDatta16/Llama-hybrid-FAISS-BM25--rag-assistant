Reward function in Reinforcement Learning

I am currently looking to apply reinforcement learning in my recurrent neural network. I am having trouble to define the reward function for my following application. In my current setting, I am running a recurrent neural network, and each action is equivalent to generating a vector [1x5], and then the network will terminate when it finish generating a 10 of them. Lastly, I will append them together, forming a 10 x 5 matrix. For this matrix, I will be running another algorithm to evaluate its reward, giving a final reward of scalar numerical value. [ Matrix A] ---> run algorithm ----> reward = 5.2 [Matrix B] ----> run algirthm ------> reward = 8.2 However, I am not sure how should I define the reward function for my network. Since there is really no reward for the intermediate step, should I give them a zero???
