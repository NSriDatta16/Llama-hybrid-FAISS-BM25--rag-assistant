One way of defining logistic regression is just introducing it as $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \P(Y=1 \mid X=x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\eta(x)}} $$ where $\eta(x)=\beta^T x$ is a linear predictor. This is just stating the model without saying where it comes from. Alternatively we can try to develop the model from some underlying principle. Say there is maybe, a certain underlying, latent (not directly measurable) stress or antistress , we denote it by $\theta$ , which determines the probability of a certain outcome. Maybe death (as in dose-response studies) or default , as in credit risk modeling. $\theta$ have some distribution that depends on $x$ , say given by a cdf (cumulative distribution function) $F(\theta;x)$ . Say the outcome of interest ( $Y=1$ ) occurs when $\theta \le C$ for some threshold $C$ . Then $$ \P(Y=1 \mid X=x)=\P(\theta \le C\mid X=x) =F(C;x) $$ and now the logistic distribution wiki have cdf $\frac1{1+e^{-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}}$ and so if we assume the latent variable $\theta$ has a logistic distribution we finally arrive at, assuming the linear predictor $\eta(x)$ represent the mean $\mu$ via $\mu=\beta^T x$ : $$ \P(Y=1\mid x)= \frac1{1+e^{-\frac{C-\beta^T x}{\sigma}}} $$ so in the case of a simple regression we get the intercept $C/\sigma$ and slope $\beta/\sigma$ . If the latent variable has some other distribution we get an alternative to the logit model. A normal distribution for the latent variable results in probit, for instance. A post related to this is Logistic Regression - Error Term and its Distribution .
