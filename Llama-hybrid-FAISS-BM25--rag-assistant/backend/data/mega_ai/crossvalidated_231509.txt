On-again, off-again time series

I have a simple problem but don't know how to search for its solutions in the literature. What keywords do you associate with this?: A man walks into a bar. He stays a while. He leaves. Hours later, he enters the bar again. He stays a while. He leaves. .... [there is no punchline]. In general, the duration of each visit and the time between visits is only semi-regular. The man is the bar's sole client. The bar owner wants to replace the bar tender with a robot, but he's not very good at robotics. The best he can do is make a robot that serves a drink every t hours, starting from some time $t_0$. If the bar's sole client happens to be there when the robot serves the drink, the bar owner earns C dollars*. Otherwise, the bar owner loses D dollars. Given historical data on the bar's sole client entering and leaving the bar, how should the bar tender choose $t_0$ and $t$ in a way that maximizes his expected future earnings? *Caveat: The client is totally smashed after a single drink, and will refuse any further drinks offered to him in the course of the same visit. Thus, the bar owner loses D dollars whenever the robot serves a second drink within the same visit. In the general case $C$ and $D$ can be different, but even a solution that assumes $C = D$ (or one that only notionally maximizes profit) could be of interest.
