You might want to err, explore KNMI Climate Explorer . It has projections from climate models, but it also has "reanalysis" data, which is gridded data that has been assimilated from station data using a climate/weather model. I'm not sure if it has cloud coverage, but it certainly has temperature and precipitation.
