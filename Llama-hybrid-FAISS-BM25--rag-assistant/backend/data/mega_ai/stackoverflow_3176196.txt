Note that you are saving the value to a variable Length byte array. If you save these byteArray, you need save also the length. You can see the protected Functions Write7BitEncodedInt from BinaryWriter and Read7BitEncodedInt from BinaryReader. These functions save storage on disk for positive numbers. A number 0-128 needs only one byte. Microsoft uses these functions to store/retrieve the String length prefix when save to Stream. To use these Functions, you can create own Class derived from BinaryReader / BinaryWriter.
