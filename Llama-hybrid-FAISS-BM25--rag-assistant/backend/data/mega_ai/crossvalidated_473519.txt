Let's start with the basics and consider a prediction interval for a future observation $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ as you asked, but to start, suppose we know $\mu,\sigma$ . Now given $\alpha$ , we want to find $[a,b]$ such that $$1-\alpha = P(a where $Z\sim N(0,1)$ . From here, it follows that if $z$ is the quantile such that $P(-z , then $\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma} = -z$ and $\frac{b-\mu}{\sigma} = z$ , and so you get that the prediction interval is $[\mu - z\sigma,\mu+z\sigma]$ and we are done. Now if we don't know $\mu,\sigma$ , we instead estimate them with our data, and so we use $\bar{X}_n$ and $s_n$ as estimators for those two parameters. Okay now let's really get to your question, but before doing so, let's simplify your question further and consider the case with known variance to really understand the $(1+1/n)$ .. the rest is just accounting for unknown variance. Suppose $\sigma = 1$ . Since we are dealing with normal rvs, we know that $\bar{X} \sim N(\mu,1/n)$ , and we also know that $X\sim N(\mu,1)$ . It's tempting to simply use our above interval, and replace $\mu$ with $\bar{X}$ (recall that $\sigma =1$ so no worries there). So let's try that! Our interval is $[\bar{X} - z,\bar{X}+z]$ . So far so good. Let's now make sure it has the $1-\alpha$ coverage property we want: $$P(\bar{X} -z \leq X \leq \bar{X} + z) = P(-z\leq X- \bar{X} \leq z) Oh no! We don't have the right confidence interval. Why? The simple answer is that $X-\bar{X} \not\sim N(0,1)$ as $\bar{X}$ is estimated from our data, so we can't just replace $\mu$ with $\bar{X}$ and pretend it's a constant. So what do we do? Well let's think about $X-\bar{X}$ . We know $X \sim N(\mu,1)$ , and $\bar{X}\sim N(\mu,1/n)$ , and recall the basic property of normal distributions that if $A\sim N(a,\sigma_a^2),B\sim N(b,\sigma_b^2)$ , then $A-B\sim N(a-b,\sigma_a^2 + \sigma_b^2)$ . Applying this, we thus have that $$X - \bar{X} \sim N(\mu-\mu,1 + 1/n) = N(0,1+1/n)$$ So it's not that $X-\bar{X} \sim N(0,1)$ , but rather that $\frac{X-\bar{X}}{\sqrt{1 + 1/n}} \sim N(0,1)$ , and so we build our interval as we did with the fixed case but with this distribution instead. Doing this exact same approach but with unknown variance will give you the prediction interval as you have... since variance is unknown, it's now a T distribution, but everything else is the same.
