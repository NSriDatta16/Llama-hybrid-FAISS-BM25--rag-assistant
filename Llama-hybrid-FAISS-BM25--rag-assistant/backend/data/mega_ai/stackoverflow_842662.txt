What you've got is a good start. Here is the rest: You have a cursor AND a select statement. You only need the cursor. Your next step is to call the drop statement using dynamic PLSQL. I'd use the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement. Its more elegant and preformance friendly to just select the name of the thing you're dropping and submit it as a bind variable to EXECUTE IMMEDIATE. In order to drop the objects of the schema calling the method and not the schema owning the method you have to use "AUTHID CURRENT_USER". See the Oracle documentation for more info. Other things to drop: packages, functions, procedures (the system will likely hang then timeout if you try to drop this method while its running), Java classes, triggers, views, types Lastly, this is obviously a very dangerous method so you may want to consider putting it in a script instead of a stored procedure so it isn't left in the database for anyone to run.
