I'm creating an RSS reader and having trouble with feedburner feeds

I'm using the Google Feed API to get feeds and the results contain an link field which is great however a feedburner feed returns something to the effect of google.feedproxy.blahblahblah and I need the actual url for the html. The google.feedproxy url will redirect. Is there a way using Javascript for me to get the url that is being redirected to? Or even just a more elegant way of getting the html url? Any help is appreciated.
