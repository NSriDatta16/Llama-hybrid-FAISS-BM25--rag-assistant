Find outliers in time series with unknown distributions

I want to detect outliers in time series data like the two outliers in the image below. At first I tried LOF, which didn't work well and outlier detection methods based on normal distributions wouldn't work. The detection method should detect an observation as an outlier when there is an untypical change in the time series. Any suggestions what would be a good approach? (I am using R so far btw.)
