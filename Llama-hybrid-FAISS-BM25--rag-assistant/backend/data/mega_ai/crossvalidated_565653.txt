Is a time series with a constant value stationary

I would like to know, if a time series with a constant value for every t is a stationary time series or not? So actually this time series has the same variance, expectation value and autocorrelation for every t which would imply that it is stationary. But on the other hand I read several times that a stationary time series does not have any predictable pattern in the long-term (e.g. Forecasting: Principles and Practice , Basic Time Series Analysis , An Introduction to IoT Analytics, Page 118 ). So I am a little bit confused as a time series with only a constant value definitely has a predictable pattern in the long-term.
