Unlike the classical statistical literature, typical machine learning methods do not assume the data generating process (aka the sampling distribution or the generative model). I thus suggest quantile estimation: You could try learning the $\alpha/2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ quantile of the conditional distribution. The intervals between these, can be seen as a $1-\alpha$ prediction interval.
