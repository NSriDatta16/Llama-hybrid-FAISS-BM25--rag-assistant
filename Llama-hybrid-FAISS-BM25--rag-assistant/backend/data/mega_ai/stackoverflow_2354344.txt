JQuery 1.3.2 with jsTree and draggables in IE

Question...I am using jsTree with JQuery 1.3.2, and have run into an issue when viewing my page in IE8. I have added a jsTree control to my page, and have also used the Draggable behavior from jQueryUI 1.7.2 in an attempt to allow the user to drag a tree entry (leaf node) to another control. I'm not using the draggable feature of jsTree. This all works fine in Chrome and FF, but in IE I cannot select the tree node for dragging. I can only grab the node if I carefully select "one pixel" (almost literally) to the right of my tree node text. Has anyone run into this issue?
