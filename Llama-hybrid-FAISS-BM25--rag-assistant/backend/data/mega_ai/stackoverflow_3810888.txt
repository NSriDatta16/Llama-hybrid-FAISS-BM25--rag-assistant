iPhone wheel not running smoothly

I am implementing a wheel for iPhone which should turn clockwise or anti-clockwise upon being dragged into that direction. Although it does this, there was some errors with smoothness. Sometimes it seems like it get confused regards which way it should turn. Any help please? -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; int len = [allTouches count]-1; UITouch *touch =[[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:len]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:[self superview]]; xfirst = location.x; xnext = xfirst; x = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:xfirst]; yfirst = location.y; ynext = yfirst; y = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:yfirst]; //NSLog(@"Touch began for wheel at %f and %f",xfirst, yfirst); //NSLog(@"Centre %f and %f",self.center.x, self.center.y); } -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch =[[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:len]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:[self superview]]; xlast = location.x; ylast = location.y; //dy / dx (gradient) if (((ylast-yfirst)/(xlast-xfirst) >= 0.3) || ((ylast-yfirst)/(xlast-xfirst) Any suggestions please?
