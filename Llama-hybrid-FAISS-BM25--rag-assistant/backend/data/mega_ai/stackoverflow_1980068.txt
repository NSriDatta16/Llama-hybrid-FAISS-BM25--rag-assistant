Embellishing for drag and drop etc... Yes, pretty much anything is possible. If you don't want to use a pie chart (which I recommend you look at because it might make a lot of the drawing code very simple) then you need to embellish the MyCircle class above to trap the mouseDown event and to enable dragging from it using a DragSource object. package mypackage { class MyCircle extends UIComponent { ...snip... // to initiate a drag from this object private function MouseDown(e:MouseEvent):void { var ds:DragSource = new DragSource(); if (data) { // I'm adding the object's data to it, but you need to decide what you want in here ds.addData(data, "MyDragAction"); mx.managers.DragManager.doDrag(this, ds, e); } } // to handle a drop private function HandleDrop(e:DragEvent):void { mx.managers.DragManager.acceptDragDrop(e.currentTarget); // you can get at whatever you put in the drag event here } } } You'll need to set these functions (and whichever else you wind up supporting for drag/drop) as event listeners on this object. You can do that in the object's constructor, you just have to make sure you are listening for the right event. You have some digging to do, and the adobe docs are your friend , but it is all perfectly possible. As you add more to MyCircle you will get greater benefit from having it factored out into a separate control.
