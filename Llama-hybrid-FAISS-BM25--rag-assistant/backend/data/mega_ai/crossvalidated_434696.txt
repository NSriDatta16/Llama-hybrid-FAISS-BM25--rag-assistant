To improve the posterior belief receiving a time-series from a fixed data source

Let data $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ come from one of the $K$ possible sources $\mathsf{S}\in \{1,2,...,K\}$ . The true $\mathsf{S}$ is unknown but it is fixed. The main task is to infer the true value of $\mathsf{S}$ by observing a sequence of $\mathbf{X}$ s. We have an uninformative prior on the true $\mathsf{S}$ (i.e. uniform). We also have access to an emprical classifier $\mathcal{F}: \mathbf{X} \rightarrow [0,1]^K$ that produce a softmax output reciving $\mathbf{X}$ . As an example, we are observing an audio signal stream and we want to infer the age of the speaker which is something in range $\mathsf{S}\in \{18,19,...,60\}$ . We already have an age classifier, $\mathcal{F}$ , that has been trained on a public dataset (not including the current speaker's data). Or, let's say: We receive $\mathbf{X}_1$ (at time $t=1$ ) and our previously trained classifier produces a guess about $\mathsf{S}_1$ . Then, we receive $\mathbf{X}_2$ , and we again use the classifier to guess $\mathsf{S}_2$ . Then, we receive $\mathbf{X}_3$ , and so on. So, at time $t=T$ we have $\mathsf{S}_1, \mathsf{S}_2, ..., \mathsf{S}_T$ . Now, the questions: By having multiple consecutive observations $\mathbf{X}_1, \mathbf{X}_2, \mathbf{X}_3,...$ (e.g. second by second audio signals), how can I improve my belief about the true $\mathsf{S}$ (e.g. speaker's age) over time, leveraging the available $\mathcal{F}$ (e.g. audio based age classifier): Is there any framework to calcualte some sort of confidnece interval over the predicted value and narrowing it down by obseving more and more data? A reference to a related subject or a link to the state-of-the-art method/article is also appreciated.
