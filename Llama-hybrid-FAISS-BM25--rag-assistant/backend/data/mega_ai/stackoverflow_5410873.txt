I would first look at your disk subsystem and make sure that it can handle the 2-5 TB load that you will do every day. Both Oracle and SQL Server have partitioning built in. In SQL Server you can also use compression to minimize storage on disk(not sure about Oracle) Will this be mostly used for OLAP or OLTP?
