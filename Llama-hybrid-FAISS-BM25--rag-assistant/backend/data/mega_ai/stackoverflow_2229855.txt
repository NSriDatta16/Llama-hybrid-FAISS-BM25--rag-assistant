Easiest: create a datamodel and import the file in a database and take benefit of JDBC and SQL powers. You can if necessary (when the file format is pretty specific) write a some Java which does import line by line with help of under each BufferedReader#readLine() and PreparedStatement#addBatch() . Hardest: write your Java code so that it doesn't unnecessarily keep large amounts of data in the memory. You're then basically reinventing what the average database already does.
