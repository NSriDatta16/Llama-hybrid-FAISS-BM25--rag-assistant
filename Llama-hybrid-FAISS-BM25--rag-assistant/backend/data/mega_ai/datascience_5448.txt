Excel allows only very small data and doesn't have anything that is sufficiently useful and flexible for machine learning or even just plotting. All I would do in Excel, is stare at a subset of the data for a first glance over the values to make sure I don't miss anything visible by eye. So, if his favourite tool is Excel, this might suggest he rarely deals with machine learning, statistics, larger data sizes or any advanced plotting. Someone like this I wouldn't call a Data Scientist. Of course titles don't matter and it depends a lot on your requirements. In any case, don't make a judgement by statements of experience or CV. I've seen CVs and known the people behind it. Don't assume. Test him! You should be good enough to set up a test. It has been shown that interviews alone are close to useless to determine skills (they only show personality). Set up a very simple supervised learning test and let him use any tool he wants. And if you want to screen people at an interview first, then ask him about very basic but important insights about statistics or machine learning. Something that every single of your current employees knows.
