As has been mentioned, it's your custom theme. Your app\design\frontend\default\template\wishlist.phtml file is calling $this->getPriceHtml() and passing a wishlist item when it expects a product. Example: $this->getPriceHtml($_item); When it expects: $this->getPriceHtml($_item->getProduct()); But you are assured to have more errors if the theme was written for and older version of Magento.
