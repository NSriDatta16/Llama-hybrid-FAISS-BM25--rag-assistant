It will not be able to be as good as a fellow programmer, but it will be a lot better then nothing, especially if you are new to the language. There is so much bad code out there and alot of it would be fixed atleast in part by StyleCop/FxCop. Its a step in the right direction. Other then that i would try to participate in some small open source project or at least read some open source code to see how other people are doing things. You could also try to attend user group meatings. For your special case: I think you are already way ahead of the average dev by thinking and caring about stuff like that and participating in places like SO, reading books and blogs. And if you are the only developer you might get away with taking more time to design what you are building. IÂ´m in the same position as you are so I know what it feels like to think about falling "behind" because you cant learn from anyone, but thats what the interweb is for:) If we work together we can atleast in part replace the missing team members
