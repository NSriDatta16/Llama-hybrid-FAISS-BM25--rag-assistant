Do these plots imply a good fit of a linear model with normal errors?

Edit: the most obvious way forward would be to convert the data to a linear form. The data below seem to be a polynomial of order five. My question is do we know of any way to convert a polynomial of order five to a linear form? I have data for the effective changing VPIP of a poker agent over 86 hands. Need help determining if I can indeed use a linear model and if errors are normal. Each data point is the average of a cumulative probability. Therefore the first data point is simply the probability of an event. The second data point is the cumulative probability of of a specific event at time 1 + an event at time 2, all divided by 2. The third data point is the cumulative prob of the events expected to happen at times 1-3 all divided by 3. Note that the "events" in question are the probabilities of a poker player receiving a one of a set of particular starting hands, where the set of starting hands increases at each time point. So the event at time 1 is the probability of getting 2 Aces (4 choose 2 divided by 52 choose 2). The event at time 2 is the player being dealt EITHER 2 Aces or 2 Kings. etc. In below plots, the response variable is called effective.vpip and the x variable I havent named (is just called c(1:length(effective.vpip)) Other notes If this turns out to be a good linear fit, then I will go on to transform the model into a dynamic linear model with drift i.e. a random walk with drift. so the linear model will be modelled as y(t)=y(t-1) + (drift term determined by slope of linear model) + (error term which is normally distributed and has time varying errors (just as in the data) which correspond to the errors of the data wrt the linear model).
