Yes, it is possible to automate the activity you have described using machine learning. The specific approach you take will depend on the details of your system and the data you have available, but one potential approach could be as follows: Collect data on the acceleration/decceleration of the system, as well as the torque and time data from the motor. Use this data to train a machine learning model that can predict the time at which the operator should start deccelerating the system in order to stop at the desired angle. This could be a regression model that predicts the time point based on the acceleration/decceleration and torque data. Test the trained model on a set of unseen data to evaluate its performance and determine if it is able to accurately predict the time point at which decceleration should start. If the model performs well, use it to automate the process of determining the time point at which decceleration should start. This could involve feeding the model with new acceleration/decceleration and torque data and using the predicted time point to control the decceleration of the system. Again, this is just one potential approach, and there may be other ways to solve this problem using machine learning. It may be worth experimenting with different approaches and algorithms to see which one provides the best results. Additionally, you may want to consider incorporating additional features or using more advanced modeling techniques to improve the accuracy of your predictions.
