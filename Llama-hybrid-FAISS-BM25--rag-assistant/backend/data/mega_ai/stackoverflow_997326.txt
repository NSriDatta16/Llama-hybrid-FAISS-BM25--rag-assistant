Can I add a custom "Send" button to Outlook?

I'm creating a secure message alternative to email for my organization. We exchange confidential patient information with outside treatment providers. To protect privacy, we cannot use email for this purpose. Rather than force the users here to use whole new inbox, outbox, and authoring interfaces in addition to the Outlook/Exchange email they're used to, is it possible for me to simply add a "Send Secure" button that will direct their message to my custom service rather than the email server?
