Monocle Studios has a whitepaper: introduction to cocos2d iphone . Pretty good place to start from. Touches can be detected by any Layer by settings isTouchEnabled property to YES. Any other CocosNode class descendant can implement the protocol TargetedTouchDelegate and StandardTouchDelegate and then register itself with the touch dispatcher: [[TouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self priority: 0 swallowsTouches:YES]; You must then implement: - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)ccTouchMoved:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event in that object. Hope that helps.
