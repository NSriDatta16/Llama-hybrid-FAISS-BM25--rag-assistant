Leads to detect rare events in human related multi-variable time series

I am currently working on a subject and struggling to find a way to tackle it. Ok, so, let's say I want to predict whenever a human is going to faint in a rollercoaster . I have multi-variables time series data for each "run". We have both rollercoaster related data (acceleration, height ...) and human related data (BPM, spO2 ...). We have labeled datas for fainting runs, we know which try and when the subject fainted. Unfortunately, this event doesn't happen often (about 20 times in 1700 runs so a bit more than 1%). So basically, I have : Extremely rare events. Multi variables time series (human and sensors data). Low number of labeled datas (20 out or 1700) I have been doing research on anomalies detection in time series but what I found was mostly about detecting sensors anomalies and not human correlated anomalies. I've seen people using LSTM AutoEncoders , Regression Trees , apply FFT on data ... But none of these seems to fit my problem. Again, I am not trying to detect sensors anomalies (like unexpected noise/weird values) but more human/medical related anomalies. I was initially going for a CNN1D into LSTM classifier and try to predict through classification for each point but with such a low % of positive labels (~21 000 timesteps out of ~12 000 000 timesteps), I've been told it won't learn anything. So here I am, willing to discuss about this subject, if any of you guys have an idea, a lead on how to tackle this problem, feel free.
