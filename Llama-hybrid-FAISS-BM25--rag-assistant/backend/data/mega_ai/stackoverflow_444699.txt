Some fractals are good visual examples for explicit recursion; if you have a hard time with that concept, they might be good problems to work. You can start with "turtle graphics" style fractal paths like the Hilbert curve, or the classic "snowflake" fractal. Many fractal-generation methods use heavy-duty number crunching (e.g., Mandelbrot and Julia sets). Number crunching is of course a field in itself, and tweaking your fractal generator to run as fast as possible can be a nice exercise in optimization.
