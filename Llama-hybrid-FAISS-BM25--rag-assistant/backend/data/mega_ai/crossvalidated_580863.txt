I think part of the problem is the phrase "regression to the mean". It encourages people to believe the gambler's fallacy. Suppose you flip a coin 10 times and get heads every time. It is an unlikely event, 1/1024 but quite possible. People think regression to the mean means that heads are less likely going forward. In fact it means this excess of heads gets swamped as we increase the number of trials. As long as we still believe it is a fair coin, we expect 5 heads in the next 10 trials. We expect 500 in the next 1000. If we flip another 10,000 times, the most likely total number of heads is 5,010. The standard deviation is 50, so the excess of 10 is nothing. The hard part is after the first 10 flips do you still believe the coin is fair?
