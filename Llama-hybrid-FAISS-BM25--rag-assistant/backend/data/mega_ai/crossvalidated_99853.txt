From a theoretical point of view you can approximate almost any function with one layer neural network. There are some examples where a two layer neural network can approximate with a finite number of nodes functions that with a one layer neural network can be approximated only with an infinite number of neurons. Try to increase the number of nodes in the one layer neural network or try to train your on layer neural network with another algorithm like PSO. It is often easy to fall in a local minimum.
