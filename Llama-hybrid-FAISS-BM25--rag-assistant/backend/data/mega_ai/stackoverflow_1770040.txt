I'm not entirely sure what the name of the class that is applied to items as they are dragged, but I believe it is ui-draggable-dragging but you could do something like the following for the start event of the drag. $(".ui-draggable-dragging:gt(0)").hide(); This will hide all but the first item. When the drag stop event is fired you should just be able to unhide them again by calling show() instead of hide() and replacing .ui-draggable-dragging by another class they have in common.
