I recommend you look into cost curves. These (shown on the right of the figure below) display the normalized expected cost (i.e., error) at different probability costs (i.e., class probability or cost function). This will not give a single score necessarily but will show the range of performance. Drummond, C., & Holte, R. C. (2006). Cost curves: An improved method for visualizing classifier performance. Machine Learning, 65 (1), 95â€“130.
