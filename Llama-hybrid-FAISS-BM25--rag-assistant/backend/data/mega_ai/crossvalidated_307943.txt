This is an interesting question I have also asked myself overtime. However, I came to the conclusion that the non-parametric Bayesian approach was not particularly appropriate or respectful or useful in this context. The fundamental reason is that the learning process in ABC is mostly based on the prior predictive, not on the data. The algorithm produces a huge reference table of $(\theta_i,z_i)$'s from the prior predictive and infer the connection between $\theta$ and $z$ from this table before applying the construct to the actual observation $z^\text{obs}$. This is thus a context where [machine] learning techniques [like neural nets and random forests] and cross-validation make more sense than Bayesian inference on $\mathbb{E}[\theta|z]$.
