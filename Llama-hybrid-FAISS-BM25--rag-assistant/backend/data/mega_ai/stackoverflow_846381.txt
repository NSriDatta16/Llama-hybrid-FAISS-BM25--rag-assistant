I was looking for an answer but I couldn't find it anywhere. Maybe everyone are hosting on sourceforge.net or Java Web Start is not popular at all. First I have found post on newsgroup saying that on code.google.com you can call .jnlp file directly form SVN. This encouraged me to play with sites.google.com and it occurs to be very simple. 1) Create page and embed all files there â€“ for this purpose 'file cabinet' page type will be the best. So you will have page http://sites.google.com/site/MyPage with bunch of jars attached to it. 2) In your launch.jnlp file put following edits: for codebase for any jars referenced: 3) Attach launch.jnlp to MyPage and that is all. 4) Clicking on launch file will start application. Organizing everything in more structured way doesn't break anything as long as you remember to update links in launch.jnlp.
