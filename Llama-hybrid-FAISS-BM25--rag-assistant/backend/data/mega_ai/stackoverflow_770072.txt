Check out Spring IoC (.net) a java/.net container. The documentation is quite good introduction. In a brief: You can think about IoC as an architecture that encourage: objects composition and programming to an interface . This gives you the following: the ability to unit test your code easily (you can easily test your objects in isolation by mocking up all its dependencies). An extremely advance configuration (because your program with IoC is just bunch of objects and an configuration that glues the objects together). The ability to extend or modify byte compiled application (this is true for Java I'm not sure if it is true for .net).
