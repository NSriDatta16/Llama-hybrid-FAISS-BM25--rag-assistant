Textarea value to paragraph html as text only

Maybe topic really doesn't explain my problem correctly. I'll try to explain more precise it here. So I'am having a and aragraph tags. If I'am entering some text in textarea, and then after button click I insert textarea value into paragraph html. If its text everything is fine, but if it's a hand written html code, its not right, because I don't want browser to parse that html code. Here is some simple example involved jQuery: $('.some_button').click(function () { $('p').html($('textarea').val()); }); So how I can insert html code as text to paragraph? Thanks in advance!
