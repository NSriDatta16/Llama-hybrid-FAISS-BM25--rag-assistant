Concordance of an ordinal time series

I have panel data with an ordinal outcome that was assessed by two independent reviewers - i.e. each is unaware of the others' assessment. The time points for assessment are not necessarily concurrent, and the lengths of the series are not necessarily equal. Specifically, there are 4 possible levels where the 4th level, when observed, is the terminus of the series. We can assume the duration of scanning is frequent enough that interval censoring does not apply, that is that the state of the series can be carried forward until the next state is observed. I would like to know what methods may be used to assess the concordance of these time series. Previously there was the concordance correlation coefficient of Lin that considers the orthogonal distance of observations from a concordance line for a continuous response. For these ordinal responses, I know that the "distance" between ordinal categories is too great to be considered continuous, but the specific value represents a range of possible continuous responses.
