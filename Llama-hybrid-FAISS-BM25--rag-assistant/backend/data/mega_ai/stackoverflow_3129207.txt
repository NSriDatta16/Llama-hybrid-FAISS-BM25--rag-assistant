I just opened the text and the textbook description seems fine to me. From what I understand the data-structure is something like: struct Set { LinkedListObject * head; LinkedListObject * tail; }; struct LinkedListObject { Value set_member; Set *representative; LinkedListObject * next; }; The textbook does not talk of any "auxillary" linked list structure in the book I have (second edition). Can you post the relevant paragraph? Doing a Union would be something like: // No error checks. Set * Union(Set *x, Set *y) { x->tail->next = y->head; x->tail = y->tail; LinkedListObject *tmp = y->head; while (tmp) { tmp->representative = x; tmp = tmp->next; } return x; }
