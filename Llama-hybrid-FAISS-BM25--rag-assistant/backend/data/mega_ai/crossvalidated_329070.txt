In fact we have a very similar question here on regression case. And we had a very good answer by @Matthew Drury Gradient Boosting for Linear Regression - why does it not work? Linear model (such as logistic regression) is not good for boosting. The reason is if you add two linear models together, the result is another linear model. On the other hand, adding two decision stumps or trees, will have a more complicated and interesting model (not a tree any more.) Details can be found in this post. In this link I derived why adding two linear models are not interesting. And I am showing the effect of boosting on decision stump iteration by iteration. How does linear base learner works in boosting? And how does it works in the xgboost library? Note that, decision tree / stump is not a "linear model" similar to logistic regression. See this post for details Is a decision stump a linear model?
