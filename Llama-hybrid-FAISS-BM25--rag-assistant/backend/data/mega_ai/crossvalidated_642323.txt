You should have given more information, such as sample size, and range of age variable, and shown some plots ... but: If the tange of age is large, effect may not be linear, so maybe spline it. Leaving out a variable, like age, which you know is important, cannot be sound, so always include it. So then fit two models, with and without protein, and calculate a likelihood ratio test. Standard output by standard software often use the Wald test, which for logistic regression only is approximate, and can be a bad approximation for usual sample sizes. Illustrating with R code, assuming age is splined: library(splines) mod0
