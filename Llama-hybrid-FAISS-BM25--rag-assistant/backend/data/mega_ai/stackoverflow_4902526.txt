Modifying default templates for FormView

I use the FormView control quite a bit, but I wish I had more control over the default templates. When I drag a FormView from the toolbox onto my page and point it to a DataSource control it prepopulates the ItemTemplate, EditItemTemplate and InsertItemTemplates, but it doesn't do it very well. For example, the InsertItemTemplate looks like this by default: id: ' /> Name: ' /> ... But what I would prefer is a good old fashioned html table id: ' /> ... I know I can use a DetailsView to get a table rendered out, but I end up modifying the form so much that I prefer to use the FormView. It's just that I would like Visual Studio to start me out a bit closer to where I want to end up. I would imagine that there is a T4 template somewhere in the guts of VS that I might be able to modify to get this done. Anybody had any luck with this kind of thing?
