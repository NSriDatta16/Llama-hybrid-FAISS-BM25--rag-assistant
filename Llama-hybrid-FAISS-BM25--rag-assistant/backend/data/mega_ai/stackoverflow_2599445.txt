Here is an interesting option to think of: ETCH from Cisco, available under Apache license (you pay no royalties and your software remains commercial and yours.) The idea is using Etch to communicate between components of your system, in a binary form. The format is resilient to version changes, and can handle missing fields etc' as your requirements state. The benefit is that you gain a more complete transfer system, on top of the binary format. It is considered very fast (a machine performing 900 SOAP XML transactions per second, made 50,000 ETCH transactions). You could store the binarize form in a lightweight RDBMS if you need multiple indices. If just one index would be enough, then a simple key/value store (CouchDB/MongoDB or even Cassandra for distributed environments) would give you wonderful storage performance as well!
