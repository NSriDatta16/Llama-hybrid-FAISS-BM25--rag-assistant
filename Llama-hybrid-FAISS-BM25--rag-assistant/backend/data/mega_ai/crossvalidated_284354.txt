Why R markdown / python Jupyter are widely used in statistical projects?

I personally hate R markdown file / python notebook, since they mix code and results all together (expose unnecessary details / show pre-mature progress in exploration stage). But I noticed there are lots of people use this as their Integrated development environment. What are the advantages of using it? Because the analysis / report can be automatically generated when data is refreshed? Also, is python Jupyter THE platform for python people machine learning? (instead of Eclipse or Pycharm)
