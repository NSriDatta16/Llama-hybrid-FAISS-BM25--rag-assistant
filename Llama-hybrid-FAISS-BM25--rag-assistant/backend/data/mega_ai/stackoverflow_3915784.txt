How to disable some element reaction to any mouse event without interrupting underlaying element events in jQuery?

I'm trying to make a simple pop-up that's designed to show mouse coordinates while a user is dragging a mouse pointer. This pop-up appears at the bottom on the right to the mouse pointer. The underlaying div has its own very important mouse event handlers (e.g. .mousemove() ). The pop-up div is quite far away from the mouse pointer (about 16 pixels downwards and 16 pixels to the right). Let's say, a user is resizing some object, and that pop-up is displaying a new size of that object. This is o.k. if the user is resizing the object slowly. But as soon as the user abruptly resizes the object and points the pop-up div , the underlaying div loses focus, and its event handler, that's responsible for resizing, gets "broken" (it's like the mouse pointer "forgets" the underlying div ) because it's not designed to cooperate with overlaying div -s at all. Is there any ability to suppress any pop-up div mouse events allowing the underlaying div events go strictly continuously ? I tried something like that: var BLACK_HOLE = function(e) { e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); return false; }; $popUp .click(BLACK_HOLE) .dblclick(BLACK_HOLE) .focusin(BLACK_HOLE) .focusout(BLACK_HOLE) .hover(BLACK_HOLE) .mousedown(BLACK_HOLE) .mouseenter(BLACK_HOLE) .mouseleave(BLACK_HOLE) .mousemove(BLACK_HOLE) .mouseout(BLACK_HOLE) .mouseover(BLACK_HOLE) .mouseup(BLACK_HOLE); It doesn't work the way I need. Did anyone get the same issue? Is it possible to bypass it? Perhaps, there's a complete jQuery plugin for that... Confused... Thank you in advance.
