Hierarchical Bayesian Negative Binomial model with Gamma prior on mean

I am interested in deriving the full conditional for the mean parameter in a Neg-Binomial model with a Gamma prior on the mean, as such: \begin{align*} Y|\lambda,\phi\sim & NB(\lambda,\phi)\\ \lambda\sim & Gamma(a,b) \end{align*} where $\lambda$ is the mean parameter and $\phi$ is the dispersion: \begin{align*} f_{Y}(y|\lambda,\phi)= & \frac{\Gamma(y+\phi)}{y!\Gamma(\phi)}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\phi}\right)^{y}\left(\frac{\phi}{\lambda+\phi}\right)^{\phi} \end{align*} I've been told that the full conditional ( $p(\lambda|y,\phi)$ ) for $\lambda$ should have a closed form. However, I just can't see how this can be. So far all I've done is multiply $f_{Y}(y)$ by the Gamma prior on $\lambda$ , and am not sure how to simplify beyond that. All help and tips greatly appreciated!
