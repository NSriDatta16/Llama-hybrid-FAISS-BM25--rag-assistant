Is ARIMAX(0, 0, 0) OLS?

I have been fitting some models to a time series I have and amongst these are an AIRMAX(0, 0, 0) model. I am using the statsmodels implementation of ARIMA(X) in python and have a simple question: Is an ARIMAX(0, 0, 0) model simply an OLS model? My interpretation of the sparse documentation is that it is. Can someone confirm this or explain why I am wrong?
