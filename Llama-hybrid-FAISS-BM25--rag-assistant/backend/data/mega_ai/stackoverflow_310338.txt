I have worked a bit with Python programming for Google App Engine, which I started out in Notepad++ and then recently shifted over to Komodo using two excellent startup tutorials - both of which are conveniently linked from this blog post (direct: here and here ). Komodo supports the basic organization of your work into Projects, which Notepad++ does not (apart from physical folder organization). The custom commands toolbar is useful to keep track of numerous frequently-used commands and even link to URLs (like online documentation and the like). It has a working (if sometimes clunky) code-completion mechanism. In short, it's an IDE which provides all the benefits thereof. Notepad++ is simpler, much MUCH faster to load, and does support some basic configurable run commands; it's a fine choice if you like doing all your execution and debugging right in the commandline or Python shell. My advice is to try both!
