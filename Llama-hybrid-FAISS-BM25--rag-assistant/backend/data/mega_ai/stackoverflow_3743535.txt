Making predictions from a CV

I have a database with many CVs, including structured data of the gender, age, address, number of years of education, and many other parameters of each person. For about 10% of the sample, I also have additional data about a certain action they've made at some point in time. For instance, that Jane took a home loan in July 1998 or that John started pilot training in Jan. 2007 and got his license in Dec. 2007. I need an algorithm that will give, for each of the actions, the probability that it will happen for each person in future time increments. For instance, that the chance of Bill taking a home loan is 2% in 2011, 3.5% in 2012, etc. How should I approach this? Regression analysis? SVM? Neural net? Something else? Is there perhaps even some standard tool/library that I can use with just the obvious customizations?
