This is standard practice, and anyone paying attention to version "numbers" really ought to be aware of this anyway . The only reason there might be any misconception is if your version "number" only has a single dot, e.g. "1.13", in which case it might potentially be confused with a decimal number (by an unaware reader), which is unfortunate because they represent quite different things although using the same notation. Do you use revision numbers? If so, this makes it a lot more clear that the versions aren't decimals, e.g. "1.13.2". I would tend to recommend this practice anyway from a design point of view. Side point: If you want to compare versions of assemblies programmatically, you can just use the Version class, which overloads the comparison operators so you can check easily which is more recent just by evaluating versionA > versionB .
