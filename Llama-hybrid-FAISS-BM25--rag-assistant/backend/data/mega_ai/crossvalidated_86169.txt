The type of interval indicates what type of method you used. If a credible interval (or Bayesian variant), it means a Bayesian method was used. If a confidence interval, then a frequentist method was used. Re: Or is it that in practice, they are so often overlapping that it doesn't matter at all? As long as the conditions to use methods are reasonably satisfied (e.g. "independence of observations" is a requirement for many methods), the Bayesian method doesn't use an informative prior, the sample that isn't very small, and the models / methods are analogous, the credible and confidence intervals will be close to each other. The reason: the likelihood will dominate the Bayesian prior, and the likelihood is what is typically used in frequentist methods. I would suggest not fretting about which to use. If you want an informative prior, then be sure to use a Bayesian method. If not, then choose a suitable method and context (frequentist or Bayesian), check to make sure the conditions required to apply the method are reasonably satisfied (so important but so rarely done!), and then move forward if the method is appropriate for the type of data.
