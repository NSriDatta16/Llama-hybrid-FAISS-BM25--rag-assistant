Don't use pure red and green. On safety devices such as traffic lights, the red is actually a red and orange mixture. If I remember correctly the green is also mixed with a little yellow. It still would be a good idea to use a secondary method to indicate success/failure in addition to color. This can be text, a symbol, or something that attracts attention such as have the red failure back ground be an alternating color that flashes instead of being static. For example alternating the red with yellow.
