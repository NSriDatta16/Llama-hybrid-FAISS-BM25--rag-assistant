Statistics cannot tell you if an interaction is synergistic! You need to characterise the dose-response relationship of both agents and see if both together yields an effect that is greater than expected from an appropriate increment of dose for both agents. It's is not easy where the synergism is modest. You will find a large (and inconsistent, I'm sorry to say) literature on determining synergy in the pharmacological literature. I'll say it again: statistics cannot tell you if an interaction is synergistic! What you need is a carefully devised experimental design.
