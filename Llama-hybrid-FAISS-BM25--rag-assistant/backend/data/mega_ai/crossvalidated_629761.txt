Time series with Holt-Winters method in R

I'm trying to implement the Holt-Winters method in R. I have a time series whose data contains measurements over 24 hours of the day. I have a total of 5 years of data, that is, 43824 observations. I divided them into 43656 training and 168 tests. When I apply the method, I see that the values such as RMSE and MAPE are not bad, but when I plot them, it is seen that the real data and the predictions are not compatible. I'm sharing the codes: do you think I'm doing something wrong? Also, I can set the parameters of the Holt-Winters method with a for loop or something like a grid, but is there anything I can set in a shorter time? data date hour tem 1 2018-01-01 00:00:00 1899-12-31 00:00:00 7.68 2 2018-01-01 00:00:00 1899-12-31 01:00:00 7.30 3 2018-01-01 00:00:00 1899-12-31 02:00:00 7.21 4 2018-01-01 00:00:00 1899-12-31 03:00:00 7.53 5 2018-01-01 00:00:00 1899-12-31 04:00:00 7.78 6 2018-01-01 00:00:00 1899-12-31 05:00:00 7.93 ts df2 decompose code HW5 output ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE ACF1 Theil's U Test set 0.1607322 1.272415 0.8948736 0.7688493 28.02144 0.9874498 5.969364 graph test%>% autoplot() + autolayer(test, series = "actual")+ autolayer(HW5_for$mean, series = "fit")
