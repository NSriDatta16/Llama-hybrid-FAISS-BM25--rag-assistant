The MCMC algorithms are used to simulate from a given target distribution and not to be confused with stochastic optimisation algorithms such as the simulated annealing algorithm or the Robbins-Monro algorithm . Both groups of algorithms used Markov chains to reach their goal, but the theories behind them differ. I suggest you read some introduction to the topic , either on-line or in a textbook .
