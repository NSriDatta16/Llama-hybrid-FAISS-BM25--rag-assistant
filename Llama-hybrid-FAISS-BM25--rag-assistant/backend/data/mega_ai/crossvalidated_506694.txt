Representation is a word and the exact meaning will significantly depend on what is said before or after (the context) than the word itself. In the 3 examples of usage drawn from the classic literature one can see the same word being used to refer to different concrete things: representation as the way the registers are encoded in order to be used by an algorithm representation as a pattern or regularity in the data representation as a definition of a family of functions From those few usages, we can extrapolate that an representation is an abstraction, a model, a way to refer or describe something else, the ojects (or its properties) which will be concretely defined, instantiated or manipulated in a different point/place/instant. Finally, Representation is not a specific term of Machine Learning field terminology or even an mathematic jargon. Representation is basically an word find in general epistemology and/or linguistic. Thus, the best reference for it is a good dictionary .
