Interpretation of regression coefficients with lagged variables included

I want to model the impact of a firm's degree of operational diversification ($D$) on its firm value ($Q$). To do so, I use the following regression equation: $$Q_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_2D+\gamma X'+u_{it} \tag 1$$ The subscripts indicate the time ($t$) and the firm ($i$). $X'$ is a vector of control variables. When estimating this model with firm and industry fixed effects, I receive an estimate of $\beta_2$ which is $0.1336$. What I am interested in is the diversification premium of an average firm. To derive the average diversification premium I multiply $\beta_2$ with the mean of $D$ (${\rm Premium} = \beta_2\bar{D}$). In a second model, I include a lagged value of firm value: $$Q_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1Q_{t-1}+\beta_2D+\gamma X'+u_{it} \tag 2$$ My question is if I can derive the diversification premium from ($2$) in the same manner as in ($1$) by ${\rm Premium} = \beta_2\bar{D}$? Or do I have to account for the lagged value of firm value?
