Jquery - Truncate Text by Line (not by character count)

I need a Jquery script to truncate a text paragraph by line (not by character count). I would like to achieve an evenly truncated text-block. It should have a "more" and "less" link to expand and shorten the text paragraph. My text paragraph is wrapped in a div with a class, like this: Headline The paragraph Text here The closest solution i could find on SOF is the one below (but it`s for textarea element and does not work for me): Limiting number of lines in textarea Many thanks for any tips.
