PCA to initialize Convolutional Neural Network

I've read these following papers: Wagner et al. (2013) . Learning Convolutional Neural Networks From Few Samples. Ren et al. (2016) . Convolutional Neural Network Based on Principal Component Analysis Initialization for Image Classification. And they mention "PCA to initialize Convolutional Neural Network". I don't really understand, how did they do that? PCA result is a eigenvector matrix, is it used as kernel in CNN? but does it make the kernel size is too big? or is it used as feature map? I hope somebody can help explain to me.
