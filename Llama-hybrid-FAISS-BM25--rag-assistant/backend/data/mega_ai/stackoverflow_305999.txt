The grid is a means of viewing contents, not of storing the representation. Ultimately, your grid is made of cells which have contents and therefor your underlying model object is perhaps best embodied by the cell. There are a number of ways to design the underlying storage for a Sudoku game and the bigger challenge will certainly lie in the generation of puzzles. However, the advice to take from this is to not determine your model based on how it appears on screen - the view layer is totally separate and so doing something like storing the board a a two-dimensional array would be a bad idea.
