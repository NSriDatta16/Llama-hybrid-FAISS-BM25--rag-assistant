Discrimination vs Calibration - Machine Learning Models

I came across a new term called Calibration while reading about prediction models. Can you please help me understand how different it is from Discrimination . We build ML models to discriminate two/more classes from one another But what does calibration mean and what does it mean to say that "The model has good discriminative power but poorly calibrated/calibrative power`?" I thought we usually only look for separation only between 2 classes. Can help me with this with a simple example please?
