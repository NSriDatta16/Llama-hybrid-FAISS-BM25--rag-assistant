How to model probability of a web click using bayesian modelling with constraints?

I'm trying to model clicks in a Google AdWords campaigns. This is a function of impressions, the probability of a click (CTR) on that impression, the cost per click (CPC), and the budget of the advertiser. It's essentially $$\text{clicks} = \text{impressions} \times \text{CTR}$$ subject to $$\text{impressions} \times \text{CPC} \times \text{CTR} \leq \text{Budget}$$ How should this constraint be incorporated into my model? Happy to provide more info if it'd be helpful.
