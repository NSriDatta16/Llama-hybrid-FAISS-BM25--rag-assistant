Integrating/embedding flash in Android applications ? Possible?

From what i have googled out so far, it seems that we will have to host the flash file(swf) in a website and load the html page in the application in a webview... Is'nt there any other way to do it ?? Is there any library or something to integrate them ? Flash lite ?
