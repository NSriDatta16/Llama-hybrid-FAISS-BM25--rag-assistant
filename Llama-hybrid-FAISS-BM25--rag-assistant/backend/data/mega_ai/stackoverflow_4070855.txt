This looks like a too broad question. Information is stored as data in many different ways but ultimately the way you interpret it will give it some meaning. For instance a word document written in Chinese will be stored as data and interpreted by someone who knows how to read mandarin. If you are talking about information retrieval using AI techniques, that's another story, also very broad. So be more specific to help yourself. Finally, the way you store data some times is related to the way they are represented in real life. An image, a matrix, note a tree for example. Some more complex information, like a huge DNA sequence, are stored in a way that is more suitable for computers (to speed up pattern analysis for instance). So there is also a translation from information (suitable for humans) to data (suitable to computers) back and forth. That's why there's job for us!
