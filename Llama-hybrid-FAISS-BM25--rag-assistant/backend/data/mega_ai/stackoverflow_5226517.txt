DragDrop - Change Cursor to USER-DEFINED CustomCursor

Maybe I have missed something obvious. Currently I am using the feedback interrupt to change the cursor to one of the Windows supplied cursors (thanks to being put on the right track by Hans Passant in answer to a previous request for help - thanks). Instead of using the pre-packaged cursors, is it possible to use my own custom-cursor (icon), and if so - are there any rules re size etc., or can I use something like a png/jpg etc.. ? Regards, Oliver
