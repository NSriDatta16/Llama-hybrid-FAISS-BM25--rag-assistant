Thanks for your answers. It's very helpful to me. I'm sorry I didn't mention that the list and its items have to manage drag-dropping with other controls. Then, I suppose that items have to be separate controls. Also, list would be dynamic and would not contain more than 30 items. So, if I understand your advices, I should create a custom UserControl for the list and one for the item.
