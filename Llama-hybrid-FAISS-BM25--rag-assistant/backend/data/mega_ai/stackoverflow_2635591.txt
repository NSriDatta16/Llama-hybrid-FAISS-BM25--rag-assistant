If you're looking to batch up some changes into a single sort of commit, the only option I can think of is to generate a diff of all the stuff that you've done (TortoiseSVN has an option to do this, or you can use the svn diff command if you're command-line friendly), but that only works once really unless you know you'll be working on separate files for each batch. I've done this a few times in the past when I didn't want to create a whole new branch for a feature that was very experimental but didn't want to check it into the central repo either. I could then share that patch file with others, but it was still a relatively fragile way of doing it since it was only guaranteed to apply to the revision I generated it against.
