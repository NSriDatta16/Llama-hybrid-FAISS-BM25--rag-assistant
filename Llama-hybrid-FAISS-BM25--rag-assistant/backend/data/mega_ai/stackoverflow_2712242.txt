Formatting in a UITextView

im having problems with formatting for a UITextView. my app pulls in XML, saves some of it to a string , and then displays the text in a UITextView. it understands if you put a return in there, and it starts a new line. but i want to put paragraphs in there, any idea how i can pass that information without doing multiple UITextViews Thanks :)
