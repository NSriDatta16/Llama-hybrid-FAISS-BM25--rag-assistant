IP supports packets up to 65535 bytes including a 20 byte IP packet header. UDP supports datagrams up to 65507 bytes, plus the 20 byte IP header and the 8 byte UDP header. However the network MTU is the practical limit, and don't forget that that includes not just these 28 bytes but also the Ethernet frame header. The real practical limit for unfragmented UDP is the minimum MTU of 576 bytes less all the overheads.
