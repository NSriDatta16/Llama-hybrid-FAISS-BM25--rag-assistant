I worked in NLP (Natural Language Processing) for an industry leader for a while and what you want to do is no trivial task. I know one of the creators of nltk and I have used it myself; it's a high quality open source tool and I'd recommend you use it (do you have a particularly compelling reason to use C#?) POS tagging is typically implemented by training a model of language on hand-annotated data, then applying that model to new text, predicting the parts of speech and giving a confidence . nltk has tools that do this, and they also have some models (if I'm not mistaken). You'll find that most tools are written in C++, Java, and Python. If you don't know any of the languages look at this as an excellent opportunity to learn something! See Wikipedia , especially the links at the bottom, for more information and other software available to use for such tagging.
