They are almost the same, but I don't think they're quite exactly the same. But we can check it using the binomial distribution. Let p denote the probability of success in 1 average chance. Then $\mathbb{P}$ (at least 1 success) $ = 1 - \mathbb{P}$ (no successes) $ = 1 - (1-p)^{52}$ . The alternative is $52p$ for the higher chance probability. Bernoulli's inequality says for $x \geq -1, (1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$ . So we know that $1-(1-p)^{52} \geq 1-(1-52p) = 52p$ SO the probability obtained from lots of smaller chances is almost the same as one larger chance (due to $p$ being so small), but there is a very very small difference between them.
