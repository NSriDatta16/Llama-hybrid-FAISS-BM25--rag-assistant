Compiling OpenSource Packet Capture softwares

I am trying to compile open source packet capture softwares called JPCAP (http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/Jpcap/doc/). I am trying to build this software on ARM processor. I get the following error when I execute the make. I am a java developer and I use this JPCAP in my Java application. Please help me understand this error. Simplified Make Command: gcc -fPIC -I/home/skolli/native/java/include -I/home/skolli/native/java/include/linux -I/usr/include *.c -o libjpcap.so -lp cap Error: init.c:(.text+0x30): undefined reference to `main' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
