It's mainly a question of presentation versus contents. The first approach makes you maintain the numbering as contents, whereas the second approach displays the numbering by itself, also allowing you to customize the presentation via CSS. In the case you have to modify the text, for example to add or remove paragraphs, using numbers explicitely will force you to edit every paragraph to either increment or decrement numbers, possibly causing errors. I can't be sure about SEO, but if it's important that the numbering appears in Google results, for instance if people search for legal article paragraphs via official numbers, then it's important that the number appears explicitely in the text, since the ordered list doesn't specify the number format that the crawler must understand.
