You need to use Context#getFileStreamPath(String) where the String is the filename of the File object you are trying to access. Then you can call File#exists on that object. So: File file = getFileStreamPath(mGameData.pilotName + STATE_FILE_EXTENSION); Gives you access to the File object that points to the correct place in your private app storage area. What your code is going atm is accessing the file / which is on the root path. You file obviously does not exist there.
