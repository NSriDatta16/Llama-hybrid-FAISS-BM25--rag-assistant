Consider a dependent variable $Y_t$ which is an original time series or a transformation (such as log-returns) thereof. ARMA models its conditional mean as time varying in a particular way. When the cond. mean of $Y_t$ follows ARMA, the cond. variance of $Y_t$ can be constant, follow GARCH or whatever. (See this answer for details.) GARCH models its conditional variance as time varying in a particular way. When the cond. variance of $Y_t$ follows GARCH, the cond. mean of $Y_t$ can be constant, follow ARMA or whatever. (See this answer for details.) Consider a basic example of ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1): \begin{aligned} y_t &= c+\varphi_1 y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}, \\ \varepsilon_t &= \sigma_t z_t, \\ \sigma^2_t &= \omega+\alpha_1\varepsilon_{t-1}^2+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2, \\ z_t &\sim i.i.d(0,1). \end{aligned} Given the estimated model, a one-step-ahead estimate/forecast of the conditional mean and variance of $Y_t$ are the following: \begin{aligned} \mathbb{E_t}(y_{t+1}) &= c+\hat\varphi_1 y_{t}+\hat\theta_1\hat\varepsilon_{t}, \\ \text{Var}_t(y_{t+1}) &= c+\hat\alpha_1\hat\varepsilon_{t}^2+\hat\beta_1\hat\sigma_{t}^2. \end{aligned}
