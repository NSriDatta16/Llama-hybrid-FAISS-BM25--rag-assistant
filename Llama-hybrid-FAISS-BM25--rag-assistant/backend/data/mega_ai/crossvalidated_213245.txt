Well so I ended up asking this to my Professor. And he replied back with this. Your proposal to have the ward-level variance change from hospital to hospital is very sensible. In fact, the simpler model is often considered for convenience, and sometimes for ease of interpretation. But that does not automatically mean that the model would be fitting well to the data. In a Bayesian setting, adding a hyper-prior for this variance, as you mention, is a sensible and, for that matter, practical way forward. The hierarchy can be taken into account by two random statements indeed, one at the school level and one at the teacher level. Accommodating the heterogeneity that you mention in proc mixed is not so easy; in principle, you can use the GROUP= option in the RANDOM statement, but using, for example GROUP=ward would allow a different ward variance per hospital. That sounds great, but these variances would not considered to be drawn from a distribution; in fact, there would be an entirely different variance parameter per ward. This would work only with a sufficiently small number of wards. Arguably, a Bayesian analysis is more promising.
