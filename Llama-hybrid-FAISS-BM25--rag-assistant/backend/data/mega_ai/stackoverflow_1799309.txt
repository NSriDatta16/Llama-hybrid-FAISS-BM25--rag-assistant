Server Side Checkout vs Agent Side Checkout

I've been reading through the TeamCity 4.x documentation, and I am confused what the difference between a server side checkout and an agent side checkout is, as mentioned in this snippet from their help section: Exclude checkout rules will only speed up server-side checkouts. Agent-side checkouts emulate the exclude checkout rules by checking out all the root directories mentioned as include rules and deleting the excluded directories. So, exclude checkout rules should generally be avoided for the agent-side checkout. What is the difference between a server-side checkout and an agent-side checkout?
