XGBoost regressor hyperparameter tuning with hyperopt leads to overfit

Using hyperopt to hyperparameter tuning on XGBoost regressor, I am receiving overfiting on the train set. There is any suggestion how to solve it ? I have used cross validation with early_stopping_rounds and it still doesn't improved. I have tried to tune the gamma, colsample_bytree, subsample, max_depth, min_child_weight and eta and still couldn't reached to good enough results without overfitting. Would appreciate any help. Thanks, Roi.
