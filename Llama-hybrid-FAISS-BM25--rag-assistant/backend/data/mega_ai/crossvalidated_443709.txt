Interrupted time series analysis for short time series in R

I am trying to analyze the effect of an intervention on the same outcome in different countries. In addition, I want to control for other time-varying variables that could potentially affect the independent variable. For my analysis, I want to use R. As the outcome was measured yearly, the different time series are rather short, ranging from 20 to 30 data points. So far, my research has pointed me towards segmented regression analysis (e.g. Wagner et al., 2002 ; Bernal et al., 2017) however, as far as I understand, this method is considered rather weak and I haven't found any good explanations on how to control for possible confounders this way. Unfortunately, I am a layman when it comes to time series analysis in general. I don't want to forecast data, I only want to estimate the effect the intervention had (or didn't have) on my dependent variable. Can anyone point me towards helpful resources (articles, tutorials etc.) that not only offer code but also theoretical background?
