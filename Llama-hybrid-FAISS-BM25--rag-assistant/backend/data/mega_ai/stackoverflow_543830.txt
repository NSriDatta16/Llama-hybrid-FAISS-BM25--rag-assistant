How to Set User-Agents in an HttpRequest (Unit Testing)

I've got a method that takes in an HttpRequest object and performs differently based on what User Agent is set. I'm trying to unit test it and am having a heck of a time tracking down how to set the User Agent string. I've tried the raw HttpRequest object and a variety of other objects that eventually yield it to no avail. Does anyone have any idea how to set the user agent string for an HttpRequest object? Thanks!
