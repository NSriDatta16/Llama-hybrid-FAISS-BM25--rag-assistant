It's a transformation. By analogy with other procedures, you might call it transformation to uniform scores. "Uniformification" is certainly an ugly word and I strongly recommend against it. But the best name depends at least partly on how you do it. In particular, the transformation to ranks, with averaging for ties, achieves a uniform distribution, except in so far as there are spikes and gaps as a side-effect of the ties. Unless you violate a principle that identical values mean identical transformed values, it is difficult to see how you could make a distribution more nearly uniform. Naturally, scaling ranks to fit in $[0, 1]$ or any other interval is just cosmetic or a matter of convenience. UPDATE (updated) The idea, and the terminology, of transformations within statistics are completely compatible with the ideas that transformations can be applied in sequence; that a given transformation can be a composite of others; and that a transformation can be a family, i.e. tuned by one or more parameters. An example of moderate historical importance is the so-called angular transformation, which is arcsine of square root of proportions. (Note that in this case, the proportions could, and indeed usually would, be transformations of some original data.) I say within statistics but I would assert that this idea and terminology are consistent with mathematics generally. In sum, what you are doing is a sequence of transformations; the target is a uniform distribution; it doesn't need a special or novel name, and none obviously exists at present.
