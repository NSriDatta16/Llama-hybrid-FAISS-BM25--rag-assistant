Markov Chains: Do different transition probability matrices imply different stationary distributions?

As in the title. We know that irreducible Markov chains have a invariant distribution which is reached after enough steps (Reference: Billingsley's Probability and Measure, Theorem 8.6). Question: If two irreducible Markov chains on the same underlying state space have different transition matrices, is it necessary that they have different stationary or invariant distributions?
