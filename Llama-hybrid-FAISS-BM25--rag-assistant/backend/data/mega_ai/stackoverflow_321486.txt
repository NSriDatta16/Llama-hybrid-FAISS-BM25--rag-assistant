How do you 'spec' a web server to support a given application?

I am having real trouble trying to get decent answers to my questions from VPS and dedicated hosting provider's sales people. I have a fairly simple set of requirements - how do I select a server spec / package and be confident that I have got it about right? Are there metrics to use - number of Http requests per minute for example? are there other benchmarks? How do you approach it? Initial requirements are: must support a private ASP.NET application supporting upwards of 200 users (possibly up to 1000). user activity will be largely continuous throughout the working day the application is more intensive than your average 'website' (but not unduly so) users will be uploading and downloading large files requires a MS SQL Server database - (would workgroup edition suffice?) must support another 5 public domains with low traffic levels and little to no database activity Follow Up: Thanks for the responses guys. I have got access to a system I can configure for profiling, so can anyone recommend any profiling / load testing tools?
