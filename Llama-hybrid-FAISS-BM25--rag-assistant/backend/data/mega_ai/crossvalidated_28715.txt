Test for IID sampling

How would you test or check that sampling is IID (Independent and Identically Distributed)? Note that I do not mean Gaussian and Identically Distributed, just IID. And idea that comes to my mind is to repeatedly split the sample in two sub-samples of equal size, perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and check that the distribution of the p-values is uniform. Any comment on that approach, and any suggestion is welcome. Clarification after starting bounty: I am looking for a general test that can be applied to non time series data.
