Multinomial Logistic Regression with Likert, Count and Categorical data

I want to predict a variable that has a likert format (satisfaction 1 to 4). However, the independent variables available to me are a series of count variables (e.g. counting frequency up to 6 incidents) and categorial (e.g. race or sex). I started to fit a multinomial logistic regression model (using multinom() in R), but then realised most of my explanatory variables may not be not suitable. Could I treat count data as continuous? I don't think so, but I would appreciate some advice from somebody with experience in this type of situation. Or is there a better statistical approach I could take? Thank you
