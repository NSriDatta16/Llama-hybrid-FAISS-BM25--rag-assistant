Assume x person in df table has visit_data and scheduled visit for Y person, initally calculate the difference and create that as your target variable. there after you can create a model and predict the no.of days, once you predict the no.of days add same to your visit date to get the schedule date. below is the process in code #calculating the differnce in visit and schedule visit df['#.of days']= df['scheduled_visit']-df['visit_date'] #now my table as below visit_date|#serial.no|#.of days #create Regression or ARMIA model on serial.no and #.of days #start predicting the values for next 30 events, you will get to know the no.of days values #finally add those values to your visit_date you will get the schedule visit date Start with small model like ARIMA and check with results instead of deeplearning models(RNN),choose your model based the data size.
