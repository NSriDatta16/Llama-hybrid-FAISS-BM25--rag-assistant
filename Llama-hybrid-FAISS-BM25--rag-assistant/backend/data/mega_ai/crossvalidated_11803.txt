Rather using trying logistic regression, I would consider trying the techniques in Dixon, M.J. and S.G. Coles, 1997. Modelling Association Football Scores and Inefficiencies in the Football Betting Market . Applied Statistics. In this paper, they use Poisson regression to model football scores. Basically, the number of goals a team can score is modelled using a Poisson distribution, adjusted for: a home advantage an attack rating a defence rating For non-British readers: football == soccer.
