Joanna's answers are both correct (though ivar synthesis doesn't kick in on 32 bit Mac OS X). The reason, though, is because allowing a subclass to synthesize access to a superclass's internal state would quite explicitly break encapsulation. The decision was made to explicitly not allow that particular pattern in all cases, even within a single framework. If a superclass provides storage for something, it should provide the access control and encapsulate the management of said memory. If a subclass needs to customize access, do so with care by overriding the getter/setter [and, preferably, calling the super to actually get/set the value].
