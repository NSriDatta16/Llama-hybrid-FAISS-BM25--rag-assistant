Machine learning - training step

When you're using Haar-like features for your training data for an Adaboost algorithm, how do you build your data sets? Do you literally have to find thousands of positive and negative samples? There must be a more efficient way of doing this... I'm trying to analyze images in matlab (not faces) and am relatively new to image processing.
