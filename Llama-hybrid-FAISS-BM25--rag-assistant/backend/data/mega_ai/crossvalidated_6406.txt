You need additional data on the players and their characteristics in the time-span you have data about home-runs. For the first step add some time-varying characteristics such as players age or experience. Then you can use HLM or panel data models. You will need to prepare data in the form: First Last Year HR Experience Age 1. Bobby Abreu 2005 15 6 26 The most simple model would then be (the function lme is from package nlme ) lme(HR~Experience,random=~Experience|Year,data=your_data) This model will heavily rely on assumption that each player's home-run number relies only on experience allowing some variability. It probably will not be very accurate, but you at least will get a feel how unlikely are Jose Bautista's numbers compared to average player. This model can be further improved by adding other player's characteristics.
