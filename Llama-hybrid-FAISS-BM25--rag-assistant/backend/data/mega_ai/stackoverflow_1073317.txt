I would recommend a couple of things: Read about some design patterns. The original Gang of Four book helps with OO design. If your are writing Enterprise applications I can't recommend Martin Fowlers Enterprise Application Architecture book too much. Patterns give you the essential words to describe designs both to yourself and to others. Just reading about the different approaches makes you see new possibilities. If you are looking at J2EE, patterns like Inversion of Control are essential. Obsess about loose coupling The essentials of good design is preventing tight coupling. Anything that can be used to move your code in to loosely couples layers is going to help your overall design. Read other people's code. Study some high profile open source code in the your technology area. Just studying other peoples code quickly gives you a feel for nice looking designs compared to cluttered Big Ball Of Mud approaches.
