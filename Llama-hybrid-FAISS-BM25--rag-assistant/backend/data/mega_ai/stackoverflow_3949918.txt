Copy email to the clipboard with Outlook VBA

How do I copy an email to the clipboard and then paste it into excel with the tables intact? I am using Outlook 2007 and I want to do the equivalent of "Click on email > Select All > Copy > Switch to Excel > Select Cell > Paste". I have the Excel Object Model pretty well figured out, but have no experience in Outlook other than the following code. Dim mapi As NameSpace Dim msg As Outlook.MailItem Set mapi = Outlook.Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") Set msg = mapi.Folders.Item(1).Folders.Item("Posteingang").Folders.Item(1).Folders.Item(7).Items.Item(526)
