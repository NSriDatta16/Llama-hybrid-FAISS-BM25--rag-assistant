The system proposed by Florin, which is the right way to try to sample from an autoencoder, only works if you have a good estimate of the distribution of features $P(z)$. However, this doesn't scale well since in most cases the features have structural information (they are correlated or anti-correlated) and so you cannot just model them independently. Also their distributions are usually far from Gaussian so it's not easy to model their variation from the mean. If you want to sample from your model, you should just use a generative model.
