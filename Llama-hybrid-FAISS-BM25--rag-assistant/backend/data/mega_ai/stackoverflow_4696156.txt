I took the liberty of setting up another jsfiddle example . What I have done there is animate the closing submenu to 1px and then removed the style attribute (so it inherits the default styles again). Because it is only 1px the and the fade effect is complete the slight jump isn't really noticeable. Please note that I have only tested this on Chrome - I am not certain of performance on other browsers. Hopefully that gives you something to work with!
