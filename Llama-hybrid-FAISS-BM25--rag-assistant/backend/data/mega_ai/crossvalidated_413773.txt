Determine if two total values from different surveys are significantly different

I have the responses from two surveys, one from this year and one from last year. Respondents could select what kind of organization they belong to (e.g., Library). I have only been given the total tally from last year's survey (e.g., Library = 124) and the total number of respondents (e.g., n = 1603). How can I determine if the amount of respondents who belong to a library this year is significantly different from last year?
