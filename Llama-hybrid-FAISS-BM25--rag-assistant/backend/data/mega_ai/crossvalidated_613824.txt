Regression model for binary input

I've run into the following problem that I can't seem to find good sources for: I have a 2d binary matrix, mapping various combinations of a group, in other words, every row is a group with every 1 in the row meaning that a person is present in that group. Columns obviously correspond to the specific people. Given this data, I now want to predict the strength of those groups, which I have in the form of a continuous variable for every group in the dataset. What regression model would work best for such a task? The problem when researching myself arises with the keyword "Binary" giving me mostly sources either suggesting logistic regression which is used a lot more for binary classification (and while I'm aware it could be implemented in a way to give continuous values, this type of regression seems very wrong for the task) or just in general on sources about binary output. A good alternative seemed Random Forest Regression at first, however with the team size being relatively small, the data matrix is quite sparse, meaning that if I were to pick random features for every tree, most trees would end up getting built either on zeros only or a fraction of a team. I can imagine barely any trees getting exactly those features that correspond to multiple full teams, in which case, how good of a prediction can the tree even make? Is there something that would work best for this type of task, or is my only option taking five different regression algorithms and just seeing what works the best?
