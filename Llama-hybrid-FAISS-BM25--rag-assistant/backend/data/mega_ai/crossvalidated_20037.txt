Sorry, but this is a question every textbook will deliver. I would suggest Time Series and its Applications . So I will restrict my answer to the basics and a small example in R: AR par(mfrow=c(2,3)) ar1 Where the parameters of AR are 0.95 in the first and -0.95 in the second case. MA plot.new() par(mfrow=c(2,3)) ma1 Here we vary the MA parameter with .95 in the first and -.95 in the second case.
