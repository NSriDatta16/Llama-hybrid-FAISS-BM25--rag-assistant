Put your extra code in a module and use ‑M . That’ll run before the loop. You might even be able to sneak something in via $ENV{PERL5OPT} , although the switches are pretty limited; no ‑e or ‑E , for example. I suppose you could do something outrageous with $ENV{PERL_ENCODING} too, if you really wanted to. This is all Acme:: territory. Please don’t. ☹ EDIT: The only solution I much like is the very uncreative and completely straightforward INIT{} .
