Does forward filtering result in OLS estimate for each time point?

I'm learning about dynamic linear models and was trying to think about the relationship between GLS and forward filtering (Kalman filtering where the state is the vector of parameters). Here's my model: \begin{align} y_t &= \mathbf{F}'_t\boldsymbol{\theta} + \epsilon_t, \qquad \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, v) \end{align} Assuming I start with a noninformative prior on $\boldsymbol{\theta}_1$, if I perform forward filtering on a time series, will the state estimate of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ I get for each time equal the OLS estimate I get had I seen data up to that point beforehand? Furthermore, if $v$ is time-varying (i.e. $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, v_t)$), will the state estimate for each time equal the GLS estimate had I known all the variances up to that point?
