You can have both continuous and binary values when making a classifier. You're model will have what is known as dummy variables in it. As a first pass, I would give a go at logistic regression , but there are many, many different types of ways to do this. Let's say you had a problem wanting to predict if someone will vote (so your binary outcomes) and you have two features: gender and income. In r you would try something like: logistic_model = glm(Vote ~ Income + Gender, family=binomial, data=mydataset)
