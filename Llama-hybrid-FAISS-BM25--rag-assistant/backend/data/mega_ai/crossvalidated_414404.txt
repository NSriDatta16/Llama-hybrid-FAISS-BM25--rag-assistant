Machine Learning model for time-series traffic prediction for medium term (1-year)

I am working on traffic prediction per city for a medium term 3-6months ahead based on time-series daily input 6-month data. The traffic data has trends as well as seasons. Wondering if anyone could suggest/recommend models for the prediction. I am starting with Holt-Winters but seems failing at long term. Also, thinking of LSTM but would it suit for data with trends? Your hints/comments would be much appreciated. sample dataset
