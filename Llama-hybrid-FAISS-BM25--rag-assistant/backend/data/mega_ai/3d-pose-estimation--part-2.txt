ware posest, a GPL C/C++ library for 6DoF pose estimation from 3D-2D correspondences. diffgeom2pose, fast Matlab solver for 6DoF pose estimation from only two 3D-2D correspondences of points with directions (vectors), or points at curves (point-tangents). The points can be SIFT attributed with feature directions. MINUS: C++ package for (relative) pose estimation of three views. Includes cases of three corresponding points with lines at these points (as in feature positions and orientations, or curve points with tangents), and also for three corresponding points and one line correspondence. Nvidia FoundationPose, a unified deep learning foundation model for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking, supporting both 3D model-based and 3D model-free setups.
