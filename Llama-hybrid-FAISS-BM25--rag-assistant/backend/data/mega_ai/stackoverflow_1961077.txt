best way for building a disconected-ready application in silverlight

I would like to make a SL app that could save certain data in local and access it if it is disconnected. I think that I could expose the entities in the services (no dtos), and saving it in the isolated storage. WCF ria services for the services, but what about the SL app? Which is the best way for having a "local disconnected cached model"?
