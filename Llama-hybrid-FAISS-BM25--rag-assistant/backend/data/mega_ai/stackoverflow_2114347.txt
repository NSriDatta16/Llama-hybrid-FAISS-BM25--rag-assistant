Raster graphics in xterm?

No, not ASCII graphics, see the screenshot here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m How is that even possible? I checked the source and it only prints character sequences. However, I am unable to find any reference to graphic drawing or image embedding escape sequences in xterm documentation or elsewhere. w3m also seems to be the only software doing this. There are vector graphics in Tektronix emulation, but this is done in VT mode. Maybe I am looking for the wrong thing? Any idea?
