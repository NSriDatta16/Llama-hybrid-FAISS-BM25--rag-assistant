$P(Y|X)$ is a conditional probability representation where Y can be any output given input X. kNN can also be represented in this form please check this answer !. SVM can also be represented similarly. $f:X\to Y$ denotes a function mapping between input X and output Y. which means there is a function that maps X to Y and our aim in the machine learning or statistical problem is to learn this function.
