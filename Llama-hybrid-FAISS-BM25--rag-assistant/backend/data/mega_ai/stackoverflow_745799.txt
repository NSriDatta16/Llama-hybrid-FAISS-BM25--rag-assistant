This may be obvious, but for use case like this, a Stax parser might be a better fit. Since application controls reading via iteration it can close the parser and the underlying stream at any given point. With SAX you will have to throw an exception, which is not particularly elegant or efficient. Plus you can only do that from within handler. For extra points, StaxMate can make use of Stax more pleasant; without it Stax has similar low level of abstraction as SAX. Finally: if your problem is that of blocking due to sockets, it may be hard to solve with traditional blocking-IO based xml parsers. There is one open source xml parser that can do non-blocking (async) parsing, but that's rather little known so I'll leave that discovery to interested readers. :-)
