In short, no. It depends on the hardware. However, most modern CPUs either do byte alignment (e.g., Intel x86 CPUs), or word alignment (e.g., Motorola, IBM/390, RISC, etc.). Even with word alignment, it can be complicated. For example, a 16-bit word would be aligned on a 2-byte (even) address, a 32-bit word on a 4-byte boundary, but a 64-bit value may only require 4-byte alignment instead of an 8-byte aligned address. For byte-aligned CPUs, it's also a function of the compiler options. The default alignmen for struct members can usually be specified (usually also with a compiler-specific #pragma).
