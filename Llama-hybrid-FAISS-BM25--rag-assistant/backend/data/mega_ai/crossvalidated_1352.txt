References for how to plan a study

In an average (median?) conversation about statistics you will often find yourself discussing this or that method of analyzing this or that type of data. In my experience, careful study design with special thought with regards to the statistical analysis is often neglected (working in biology/ecology, this seems to be a prevailing occurrence). Statisticians often find themselves in a gridlock with insufficient (or outright wrong) collected data. To paraphrase Ronald Fisher, they are forced to do a post-mortem on the data, which often leads to weaker conclusions, if at all. I would like to know which references you use to construct a successful study design, preferably for a wide range of methods (e.g. t -test, GLM, GAM, ordination techniques...) that helps you avoid pitfalls mentioned above.
