Do they really have to be sampled in turn? There are MCMC algorithms that deal with high dimensional problems really well and in fact move through the parameter space much more efficiently than Gibbs sampling. In particular I am thinking of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). rstan may be your answer, since you can specify any log-likelihood and it deals with high dimensional problems really well by using the No-U-turn HMC sampler.
