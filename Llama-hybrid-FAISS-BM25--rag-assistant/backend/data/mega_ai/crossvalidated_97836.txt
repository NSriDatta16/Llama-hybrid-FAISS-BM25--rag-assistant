A joint test of significance could be the way to go, but to answer your question, Yes -- factor analysis or another dimension reduction method could be used to transform your variables. You would then do your logistic regression on the transformed variables. However you want to test out the data reduction on different data from that used to create the transformation, or clusters (or whatever method you are using). You need to build the model in one step; validate in another. If you really believe that a factor model is appropriate -- in the sense that the response is caused by an underlying factor or factors that are manifested by your predictor variables, then you can do a structural equation model. Classic SEM assumes normal (or at least continuous) variables throughout, but methods exist for categorical variables as well. The assumption is that the categorical variable represents a cut point of an underlying continuous distribution. SEM is an elegant approach that allows you to account for the structure in the independent variables and their relationship to the response in one model. However it depends strongly on the validity of the model you are using.
