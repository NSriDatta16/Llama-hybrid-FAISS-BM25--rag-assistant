The only further comment I would make is that the approach need not be Bayesian and the model need not be a mixed or random effects model. In the simplest case if you had two series in x the mean model may be: y = b01 + I*b02 + b11*x + I.b12*x Where I indicates a sample from the 2nd series. An omnibus F-test can be used to determine whether the additional parameters are required to maintain distinct series (Ho: b02 = b12 = 0). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_test This can be extended to more series, but it soon becomes more efficient to use a mixed or random effects model.
