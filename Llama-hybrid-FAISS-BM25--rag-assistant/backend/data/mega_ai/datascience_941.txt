I agree with @ssdecontrol that a minimal reproducible example would be the most helpful. However, looking at your code (pay attention to the sequence Error: ... Warning: ... ), I believe that the issue you are experiencing is due to an inappropriate setting of R's global warn option . It appears that your current setting is likely 2 , which refers to converting warnings to errors , whereas, you, most likely want the setting 1 , which is to treat warnings as such, without converting them to errors. If that is the case, you just need to set the option appropriately: options(warn=1) # print warnings as they occur options(warn=2) # treat warnings as errors Note for moderators/administrators : This question seems not to be a data science question, but purely an R question. Therefore, I think it should be moved to StackOverflow , where it belongs.
