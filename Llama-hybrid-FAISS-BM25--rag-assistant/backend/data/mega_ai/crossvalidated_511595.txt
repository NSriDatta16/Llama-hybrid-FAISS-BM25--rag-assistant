Is GAM appropriate for these data

I am strangling to find the right modeling method for my data. Short explain of the dataset : I have a variable called alpha diversity ( Alpha diversity refers to the average species diversity in a habitat or specific area. Alpha diversity is a local measure) and we want to see the effect of environmental( n=9) variables on it Here is the scatter plots of each variables x Alpha diversity(Shannon) As you can see the relationship is not at all linear and that's why I decided to use GAM. But I am not sure if its the appropriate way of modeling because for some variables( e.g distance from the city) the distribution its not continuous. I will appreciate any help on it [UPDATE] Hey again I took some time to think yours comment. I checked the relationships again by superimposing a loess fit via geom_smooth and it looks like this ( blue line linear , red loess) I get that in some of the variables we don't see any relationship e.g ( Shannon-Distance from the city) However I ran a GAM as follows GAM1 The summary : From the edf I see that many of the variables are close to linear ( edf=1) So I run the model again like this GAM4 And the summary : My questions are : Is this the right strategy ? How to handle the multicollinearity? When I ran LMM for the same data I used the VIF strategy I would really appreciate any help Thanks again, A
