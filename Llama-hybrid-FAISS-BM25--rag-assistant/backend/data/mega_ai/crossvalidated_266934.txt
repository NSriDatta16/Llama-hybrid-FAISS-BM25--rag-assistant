In linear regression, the reason we need response to be continuous is combing from the assumptions we made. If the independent variable $x$ is continuous, then we assume the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $$y=\beta_0+\beta_1 x+\epsilon$$ where, the residual $\epsilon$ are normal. And form the formula we know $y$ is continuous. On the other hand, in generalized linear model , the response variable can be discrete / categorical (logistic regression). Or count (Poisson regression). Edit to address mark999 and remapt's comments. Linear regression is a general term that may people use it differently. There is nothing to prevent us to use it on discrete variable OR the independent variable and dependent variable are not linear. If we assume nothing and run linear regression, we still can get results. And if the results satisfy our needs, then the whole process is OK. However, As Glan_b said If you want to perform hypothesis tests or calculate confidence or prediction intervals, the usual procedures make an assumption of normality. I have this answer is because I assume OP is asking the linear regression from classical statistics book where we usually has this assumption when teach linear regression.
