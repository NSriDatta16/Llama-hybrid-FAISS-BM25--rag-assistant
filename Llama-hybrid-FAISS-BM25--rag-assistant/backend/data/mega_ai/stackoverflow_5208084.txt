Simulating a drag & drop operation using SendInput

Can SendInput be used to simulate a drap & drop operation? I've got an application that accepts files of a certain format that are dropped on it, but not from the command line, and I want to associate it with a file. I thought I'd create a small tool that finds the window, and simulates a drag & drop of the file - is this at all possible? Do I need to use SendInput or possibly SendMessage ? What would be the parameters?
