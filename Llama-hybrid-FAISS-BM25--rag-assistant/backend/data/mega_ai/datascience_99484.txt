Can the 'Rainbow Algorithm' be scaled up and sped up?

What's the proper way to train the algorithm with bigger batches or otherwise speed it up? The 'Rainbow Algorithm' is a Deep Q, Reinforcement Learning algorithm with two neural networks that I would like to speed up or scale up during training. You can read the paper here . Training is fairly slow because the observations have to be converted to tensors and updated to the model after each step. It's kind of a special and unique model, so I hope someone special can answer. I haven't gotten any results skipping the back prop at each step so I know I can increase the batch size in my case but I'm wondering if this does any good, or might even harm the results at each step. If I increase the batch size should I increase something else, like the buffer size? STARTING_BALANCE = 10_000 GAMMA = 0.99 BATCH_SIZE = 8192 BUFFER_SIZE = 80_000 MIN_REPLAY_SIZE = 1000 EPSILON_START = 0.59 EPSILON_END = 0.001 EPSILON_DECAY = 90_000 TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ = 1_000
