What kind of machine learning model would be best suited for correlated multiple outputs?

I have a dataset with 15 input columns, and 4 output column names. These 4 outputs are related to each other. I have fitted four different GLM models to predict them. But I want neural networks/random forests/other machine learning techniques. What would be the best approach for this problem if I want to have: A single model with multiple outputs (Continuous values) Preferably gives me the distribution of the output rather than a single value. Takes into account the correlation in the output space. These four values are somewhat related to each other. X1>X2>X3>X4 always. Any articles/guides etc would be greatly appreciated.
