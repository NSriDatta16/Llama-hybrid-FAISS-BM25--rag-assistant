How to find "dependency" between categorical variables and the dependent variable, also categorical

Please edit the title if the wording is incorrect Imagine to have a dataset of recipes that works like this: each row is a recipe, where the ingredients are predictors and the dependent variable would be the cuisine (i.e.: Italian, Chinese, Mexican, ...). E.g.: recipe | ingredient 1 | ingredient 2 | ... | cuisine ----------+----------------+----------------+-----------+------------- pizza | dough | tomato | ... | italian ----------+----------------+----------------+-----------+------------- burrito | bread thingy | guacamole | ... | mexican ----------+----------------+----------------+-----------+------------- carbonara | spaghetti | eggs | ... | italian ----------+----------------+----------------+-----------+------------- and so on... Logically I can imagine that recipes that include "pasta" and "rag√π" are more likely to be Italian, whereas recipes that have "rice" and "soy sauce" could be more easily Chinese. Conversely, if I have "eggs" then I expect that there's no particular cuisine associated to it because all the world uses eggs. I'm looking for a way to show these relations, to answer questions like: "what are the 2 most important ingredients in Italian cuisine?" or "if I have avocado and garlic, which is the most likely cuisine associated to them?" . I know that the first step would be to one-hot-encode the ingredients, but then I'm lost. I've looked for answers here and elsewhere but most I could find was related to continuous variables. Keep in mind: I'm not trying to make a ML model for this, I'm just trying to figure out the relationships between ingredients and cuisine. Also, my dataset is much simpler than this (I only have 5 predictor variables with limited choices), but the logic is exactly the same as described. Btw, not relevant to the question per se, but I'm using python, so if you already have a pre-cooked solution to this predicament feel free to share.
