You can use AIC to compare them. The BIC is appropriate if you're doing a Bayesian analysis or it better captures what you theorize to be a good or useful information criterion. If you don't know what any of that is then use AIC. Some have recommended using BIC to assist in deciding marginal AIC values. A lower value is better in both (smaller implies closer to 0?). Usually the cutoff for deciding better vs. inconclusive is about a difference of 6. If you need to report values of AIC report delta values because the absolute value of the AIC is relatively meaningless. In some measures there is some qualitative, and perhaps quantitative, difference between finding values of 1 and 9, and 10001, and 10009. This isn't so for AIC and the absolute measures just confuse matters.
