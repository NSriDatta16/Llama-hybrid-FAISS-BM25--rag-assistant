painting on glassPane is slow

I'm building a domino game in java and I am using modified rectangle2d's to draw my tiles. To drag a tile I use mouse events to change the tiles coordinates and redraw the JPanel. This all works great and very smooth, until I start using the frames glassPane, I use the glassPane to be able to drag a tile from one JPanel to another. It works, but rendering is quite slow when I paint on the glassPane. I've tried to use clipping when repainting, but it makes no difference. Does anyone have an idea? thnx.
