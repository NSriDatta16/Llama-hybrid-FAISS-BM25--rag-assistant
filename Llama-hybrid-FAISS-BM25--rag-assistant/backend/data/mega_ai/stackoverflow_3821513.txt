Silverlight 4 screenshot OOB

Currently I'm trying to do create an out of browser application that captures the whole screen. Not just the Silverlight application. Now I know that this is not possible with plain Silverlight & C#, but you need to do some dllimports and stuff, it needs to run OOB and you need an elevated application. That is no problem at all. I found some code on the internet, but I'm stuck. Since Silverlight doesn't have a System.Drawing namespace and thus no Bitmap . Now I can't cast my GDI+ pointer to something I can display in my Silverlight application. The code I'm using is from this link: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/DesktopCaptureWithMouse.aspx Can anybody kick me in the right direction? ;)
