Heroku and carrierwave don't load my s3 configuration

I have an application on Heroku that uses the Carrierwave gem to upload images to S3. I have set the s3 configuration in an initializer called carrierwave.rb CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.s3_access_key_id = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' config.s3_secret_access_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' config.s3_bucket = 'XXXXX' config.storage = :s3 end This works fine in development on my local machine, however once I deploy to Heroku I get the following error A Errno::EACCES occurred in events#update: Permission denied - /app/public/uploads /usr/ruby1.8.7/lib/ruby/1.8/fileutils.rb:243:in `mkdir' Obviously it's trying to write to the heroku server which is read only and not picking up my s3 settings. Does anyone know how I can get heroku to send my files to s3?
