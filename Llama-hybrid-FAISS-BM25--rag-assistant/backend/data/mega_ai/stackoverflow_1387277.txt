Consider SHA1 or an even stronger hash instead of MD5. You're salting it, though, that's good. Back to your question: yes, that's fine. However, implement measures to make sure sessions are not hijacked. Wikipedia actually has a fairly good article on it . In most of the systems I've written, I've included logic to verify the remote IP hasn't changed. You can store that in the session, too, since the session vars don't get passed to the user (only the session ID). If you really want to get creative, you can add other checks -- user-agent, and what not. You also have to account for session attacks. Check referrers. If you have a disastrous operation, let's call it a POST to DeleteMyAccount, I can write a form submission plus javascript to hit DeleteMyAccount in a forum post on an unrelated site, counting on that session to be present in the user's information.
