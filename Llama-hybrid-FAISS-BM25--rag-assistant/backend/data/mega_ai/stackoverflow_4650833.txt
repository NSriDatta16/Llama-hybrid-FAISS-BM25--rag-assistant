If you want a script on http://one-domain.com/ to be able to read from the database of http://another-domain.org then no -- the Same Origin Policy is applied to localStorage and Web SQL databases, which means that only scripts running on the same domain as the script that created the database are allowed to have access to the database. Your best bet in that case would be to send the data from one-domain back to the server and have the server of one-domain push the data over to another-domain (or else, if they are on the same network, provide a shared resource they can communicate over.)
