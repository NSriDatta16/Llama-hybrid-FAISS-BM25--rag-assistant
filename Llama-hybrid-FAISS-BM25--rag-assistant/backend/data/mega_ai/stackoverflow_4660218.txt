Timer issue in jbpm embedded in grails

I followed this link http://www.intelligrape.com/blog/2010/05/14/embedding-jbpm-4-3-in-a-grails-1-2-2-application/ to embed jbpm in my project. The issue is timer is not triggered. I found that jobexecutor is not started. Can anyone help me to make it work? Iam using jbpm4.4 and grails 1.3.5 Thanks in advance rams
