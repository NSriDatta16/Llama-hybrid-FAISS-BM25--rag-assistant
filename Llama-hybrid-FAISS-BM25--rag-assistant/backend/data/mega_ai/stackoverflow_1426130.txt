I'm not sure why do you need that but I suggest you to try to use a vector of union to solve your problem, something like this union DataType { int intVal; unsigned uintVal; } std::vector vec; Or probably more elegant way is to use boost::variant instead of the union. Maybe if you give us more details about your problem you get a much better asnwer. Good luck!
