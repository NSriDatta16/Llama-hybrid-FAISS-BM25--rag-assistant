This is not really a multivariate problem. Basically it's a hypothesis testing problem. The basic question is "has the value improved?", or in statistical terms "has the expectation value changed". In general when counting something, the Poisson distribution would be the right fit. Which means, that you have a uncertainty of the expectation value $\mu$ of the size $\sqrt\mu$. Here you have a different kind of uncertainty added on top of that -- the inaccuracy introduced by GA. So, if the number of participants in the A/B testing is high enough, you will still have a Poisson fluctuation plus the GA inaccuracy. Do you have a way of knowing how large the uncertainty from GA is? If yes, take that number an add in quadrature to the Poisson uncertainty (the variances add up); the two sources of uncertainty are independent. Then do the hypothesis testing. Addition: if the total number of lost elements is known, but not their association -- e.g. the mismatch between the accounted number of transactions from the independent database, but not how much in type A or B -- then one can estimate the resulting uncertainty. One can make a guess to estimate this uncertainty as being proportional to the relative rate of A and B that GA delivers. The most simple assumption is that the number that GA deliver are consistent and unbiased -- so in short a fairly good estimator of the true values. On average this will be the true answer. One should note that the extreme cases (all elements are lost in only one case, and only in the lower count) are not represented by this. Very conservatively one could take these specific cases and also calculate the confidence levels for this and say that the "true" answer lies somewhere in between. If the numbers are large enough, the difference will be small. If none of the above, think of a good number and do the same. If your assumed error is too large, you will see an improvement only when it's large enough. If it's too small, you might trick yourself into believing it's become better. As a side note: the uncertainties are binomial, but if the number of counts is high enough the Poisson distribution is a good approximation. At some stage, at least for central regions Gaussian distribution will be good enough as well.
