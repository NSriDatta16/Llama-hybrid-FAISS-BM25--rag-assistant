The issue here is that it is difficult to work out the back transformation for the summary although relatively easy for the individual studies. Sometimes also referred to as the double arcsin(e) transformation described by Freeman and Tukey here $$ y_i = \sin^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{r_i}{n_i+1}} + \sin^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{r_i+1}{n_i+1}} $$ Where the $i$th study has $r_i$ successes out of $n_i$ trials. We can weight each $y_i$ by the inverse of its variance. $$ V(y_i) = (n_i + 0.5)^{-1} $$ The weights $w_i=(n_i+0.5)$ are then applied in the usual way. Having formed the weighted average $y$ it is usual to back--transform it onto the original scale by noting that for large $r_i, n_i$ reduces to $$ y = 2 \sin^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{r}{n}} $$ and using $$ p = \left(\sin \frac{y}{2}\right)^2 $$ Incidentally Miller gives a more accurate formula for small $n$. $$ p = 0.5\left(1-\mathrm{sign}(\cos y) \sqrt{1 - \left(\sin y + \frac{\sin y - \frac{1}{\sin y}}{\tilde{n}}\right)^2}\right) $$ where $\tilde{n}$ is the harmonic mean of the study sizes, $$ \tilde{n} = \frac{k}{\sum{n_i^{-1}}} $$ The problem for software is that this demands the step of forming the harmonic mean and the required information has not usually been supplied to the function. So the fairly simple calculations need to be done separately outside the function. There is an extensive example of how to do it using a different package (metafor) available here which you should be able to use to work out the code you need to do this using your preferred package, or indeed using any other software system.. Note that the Freeman--Tukey transformation although often referred to as variance stabilising only stabilises the variance for equal $n_i$ hence the need for the weighting step.
