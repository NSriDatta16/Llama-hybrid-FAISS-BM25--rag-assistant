What is the time complexity of learninig phase of Hopfield neural network?

It really intrigues me what is the time complexity of learning phase of Hopfield neural network, how it depends of the number of training examples and number of attributes? Source code of Hopfield neural network Can we say that time complexity of Hopfield neural network quadratically depend on the number of training examples or quadratically depend on the number of attributes? Thank you!
