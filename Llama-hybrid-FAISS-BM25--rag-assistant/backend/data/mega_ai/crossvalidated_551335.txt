Short answer: Any uncertainty (confidence) we have surrounding an unknown population quantity is due to the sampling variability of the estimation or testing procedure that uses a limited sample size. Full answer: To the frequentist, population-level quantities (typically denoted by greek characters) are fixed and unknown because we are unable to sample the entire population. If we could sample the entire population we would know the population-level quantity of interest. In practice we have a limited sample from the population, and the only thing one can objectively describe is the operating characteristics of an estimation and testing procedure. Understanding the long-run performance of the estimation and testing procedure is what gives the frequentist confidence in the conclusions drawn from a single experimental result. What the experimenter or anyone else subjectively believes before or after the experiment is irrelevant since this belief is not evidence of anything. Beliefs and opinions are not facts. If the frequentist has historical data ("prior knowledge") this can be incorporated in a meta-analysis through the likelihood and does not require the use of belief probabilities regarding parameters. If fixed population quantities are treated as random variables this can introduce bias in estimation and inference. I find confidence curves to be a particularly useful way to visualize frequentist inference, analogous to Bayesian posterior distributions.
