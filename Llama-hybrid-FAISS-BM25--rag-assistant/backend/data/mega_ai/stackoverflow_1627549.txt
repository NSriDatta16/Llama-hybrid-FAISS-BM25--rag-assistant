tsql- set options

I am rebuilding indexes using a script which reorganises or rebuilds indexes according to a predefined fill factor. It is on SQl 2000. I have the following SET options in my script: SET ANSI_WARNINGS OFF SET ANSI_NULLS ON SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON I am getting the following error: DBCC failed because the following SET options have incorrect settings: 'ANSI_WARNINGS, ARITHABORT' So, is it telling me that i should turn ANSI_WARNINGS OFF AND INCLUDE ARTHABORT TO ON? I am confused with this. Any advice?
