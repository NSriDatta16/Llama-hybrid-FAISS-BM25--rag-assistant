Disadvantages of using a regression loss function in multi-class classification

Given $k > 2$ classes, consider the following loss function $$ \sum_i||y^{(i)} - \hat y^{(i)}||^2 $$ Here $y^{(i)} \in \{0,1\}^k$ is the $i^{th}$ one-hot encoded true label and $\hat y^{(i)} \in [0,1]^k$ is the prediction (obtained after applying a sigmoid to the output logits of some neural network). What are the theoretical and practical disadvantages of using such a loss over something like the cross-entropy loss?
