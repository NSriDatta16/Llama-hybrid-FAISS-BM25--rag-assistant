I am using a main window to hold pages (creating a navigation style program), and in the code behind of my main window, I inserted this... protected override void OnMouseLeftButtonDown(MouseButtonEventArgs e) { base.OnMouseLeftButtonDown(e); // Begin dragging the window this.DragMove(); } ... and it works like a charm. This is with windowstyle=none. Its nice in the sense that you can click anywhere on the app and move it instead of just being limited to a top bar.
