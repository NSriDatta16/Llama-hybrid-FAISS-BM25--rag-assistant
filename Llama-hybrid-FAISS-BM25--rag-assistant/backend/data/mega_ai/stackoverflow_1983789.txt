EDIT: Now that I see the screenshot, I realize you really are referring to MATLAB Version 4.2c (R7). I thought perhaps you were mistakenly referring to the MATLAB Compiler instead, since I didn't think anyone would still be using a version that's over 15 years old ! The oldest version I've used was when I first started learning MATLAB in 1996 on Version 5.0 (R8)! The basic matrix and vector operations probably haven't changed much since Version 4.2c, although there are some newer functions to manipulate matrix data in different ways, like ACCUMARRAY , BSXFUN , and ARRAYFUN to name a few. Virtually everything else has probably changed in some subtle or not-so-subtle way: the MATLAB Desktop and Editor , graphics and plotting tools , creating graphical user interfaces , etc.. You can also do object-oriented programming now using MATLAB classes . Anyhow, for all MATLAB releases starting from the newest Version 7.9 (R2009b) and going all the way back to Version 7 (R14, 2004) you can find the release notes on The MathWorks website . These release notes highlight the new features and bug fixes added to each MATLAB version since the previous release. For example, in order to see the difference between Versions 7.6 and 7.9, you'd have to look through the release notes from 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9. If you really need release notes going farther back in time, you will probably have to contact the MathWorks directly . P.S. I may actually still have my old notes from my first MATLAB course, which I'm tempted to dig out of storage and take a look at just to see what may have changed since then. ;)
