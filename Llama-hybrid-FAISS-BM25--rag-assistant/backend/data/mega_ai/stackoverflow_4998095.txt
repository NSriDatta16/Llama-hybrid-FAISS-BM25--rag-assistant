Which class is added while sorting?

As you know, on jQuery UI Dragable interaction, the element being dragged gets .ui-draggable-dragging class. Is there anything like this for sorting? Example here . I want to change element's background-color while dragging. Which class is added while element is dragging? .ui-sortable-dragging ?
