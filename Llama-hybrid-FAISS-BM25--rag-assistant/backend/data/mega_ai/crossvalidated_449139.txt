When to apply data transformations when building ml model

I'm experiancing quite severe overfitting when building my model and wanted some clarification. I am applying feature selection, scaling , over sampling and outlier removal. 1) Should I transform the data PRIOR to cross validation OR 2) Fit each transformer on the Training data on each fold. I believe it to be option 2 and was on the understanding that you fit/transform on the training set and only transform the validation set? But... reading this article it seems he believes scaling should be done prior? https://towardsdatascience.com/a-short-introduction-to-model-selection-bb1bb9c73376?gi=3b4c661086bd What about preprocessing such as feature selection? As a rule of thumb, supervised preprocessing (involving the data labels) should be done inside the (inner) CV loop [2]. In contrast, unsupervised preprocessing such as scaling can be done prior to cross-validation.
