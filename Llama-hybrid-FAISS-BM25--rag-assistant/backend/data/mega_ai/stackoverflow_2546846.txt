Image rendering on browser or temporary images?

I'm trying to make a statistics page where it will show several data and charts. The charts need to be pictures so that the user can save it/drag-and-drop to his/her personal reports. I'm using Gruff Graphs for Ruby to produce the charts but I don't know the best way to display the results safe and protected. Some of my ideas/tries are: save the chart to a file (jpg, png)? problem: data is available to anyone (don't have access to cron, to delete data from time to time) render in the browser (has to work on IE)? Use javascript (Raphaël—JavaScript Library) or Google API and output a PDF report (need plugin or gem, right)? use send_data? i've tried to output other way than inline, because I needs to show other data, is it possible? Thanks for any help.
