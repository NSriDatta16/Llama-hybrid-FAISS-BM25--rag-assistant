Since you're not actually using the dictionary for lookups, but just for storage and iteration, instead of using a Dictionary , you can just use a List > . The main difference from a code perspective would be changing .Add to: methodList.Add(new KeyValuePair (parameters.AddSection1, this.Section1)); Then, when you use, switch to: foreach (var entry in methodList) { // if the switch is on // call the method if (entry.Key) entry.Value(); // Execute "value" directly } That being said, you can take this one step further, potentially, and just store a List directly. Only add actions to the list where the condition is true, then execute them all.
