Clustering leading to visually overlapping clusters on scatterplot

I am dealing with a dataset with 13 features. After going through some standard scaling and missing data imputation, I use kmeans from sklearn to create clusters. Now the point is that, although the elbow method indicates a 7 cluster model, when I visualise the results I get a colored cloud that to human eye tells nothing. As you can imagine I do not have much experience with clustering so this results tells me personally that the clustering has failed. What I want to ask here is that apart from the different metrics that may describe the performance of kmeans, shouldnâ€™t the scatter plot of two features be clear in terms of clusters? Another approach I have taken is that I performed PCA to extract the 2 most important features however I get that I these two only explain ~35-40% of the variance. Nevertheless when I then run the clustering algorithm only on those two features the clusters are extremely well segregated from each other. Am I missing something ? Apologies if the context here is not clear but any insight are more than welcome.
