I'll offer up a few suggestions to get the creative juices flowing. First, since you have two tasks, you could consider two models configured as a Generative Adversarial Network where One model generates musical passages One model classifies musical passages The output from the generative model is then evaluated by the classifier. The output from the classifier can then be used to improve (train) the generative model. I imagine these would be trained on the same labeled data set. I would use a Recurrent Neural Network to train the classifier and tune the snot out of it (so to speak). I would use a Generative Neural Network for the generative model. Maybe you were looking for more direction. If so, sorry to disappoint. I figured you may have been looking for better ways to search for help. Best of luck.
