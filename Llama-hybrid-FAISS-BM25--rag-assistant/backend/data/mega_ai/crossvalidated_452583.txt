To certain extent the two terms are exchangeable, but, depending on the context, they may refer to different aspects of Bayesian approach. Inference typically means estimating parameters, which in this case may be done, e.g., using the maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP estimate) as opposed to the maximum likelihood (ML) in frequentist approach. Updating would imply improving the existing distribution using the new data. Note that though the inference is usually done using all the data at once, the updating may be done sequentially, as the data arrives. In some problems this difference may be quite important.
