Accessing the web in Java, command-line arg?

I have written a program that reads in a File object (really an XML file) to parse the information I want. I have an example program to basically just dump data from the net (program below displaying a webpage). I want to use the code below in accessing the web, to parse that data with my current xml parser with the command line. Like if I did java xmlParser http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml Then the program would parse that feed and display just the fields I want in a nice format. First, is that poassible? I'm having trouble just opening up the webpage through the command line instead of what I have below. Second, how do I take this feed from the net and make my program parse it since it currently just parses a hard-coded XML file. Although not an elegant solution, I could see possibly writing the data from the web into an xml file and parsing that with my XML parser. Any thoughts? Thanks. Code: import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.net.URL; import java.util.Scanner; public class DumpIO { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { URL url = null; if (args.length == 0) url = new URL("http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml"); InputStream is = url.openStream(); Scanner in = new Scanner(is); while (in.hasNextLine()) { System.out.println(in.nextLine()); } } }
