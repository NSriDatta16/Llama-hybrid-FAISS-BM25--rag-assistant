Application design for 5 years

My question is not technical. It's more of a philosophical and really down to individual preference. I am designing and developing an application (web + desktop) and this just occurred to me and was wondering if you guys (programmers and designers) ever came across this before: Some designers believe in making applications that will run 3-5 years down the line and any changes that come to them will be reflected on them without any need to resort to system core changes. As a programmer I know for a fact that this is never the case. Small cosmetic changes do occur but usually they die away after a year or two, as time progresses there will be changes that will require core changes and eventually you will make a new application. Given the fast paced changes of technologies, designing an application for 5 years down the line is rather absurd, IMHO. Well I mean not designing, but the idea that this application will run for 5 years and the belief that we will not need to create a new one I think is living in a fool's paradise. I mean really, fellow programmers, most mission critical or basic small application that have a running flow usually are re-made/re-structured/re-organized/re-coded few years down the line anyway. So my question is why keep to this attitude of having this perfect application that will run for a decade. It's stupid really, because you know for a fact that technology will change every year; new frameworks, new methods, new technologies will emerge and your client will want them . So, if you forgive my use of this phrase, WTF is the point? I keep telling my designer that the application will be redesigned in a few years anyway, there is no point in trying to make it shoot lighting from its @ss because it just won't, ever. There is no such thing as a perfect application. I hope you guys get my drift. Have you guys felt the same way too. BTW I have been in the software programming business for about 7 years now. If you really think about it, do you really think Facebook will remain the same 5 years down the line, for sure the design will change every year or so to remain "funky" but the core will change every couple of years. I am dead sure of that. Am I paranoid or what? Please tell me there are other programmers in the same road as I am. Anyone?
