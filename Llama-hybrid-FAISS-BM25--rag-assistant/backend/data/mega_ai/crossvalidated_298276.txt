If you vote for me, I'll do the following: listen to you. I'm just like you: come here for answers and go about my own business immediately after getting an answer. I don't hang out here all day, because my family and my boss need me too. politely ask OP to compress their thoughts into fewer words and better a picture whenever I see a question that doesn't fit into my screen in its entirety maintain a balance between brief answers and deep answers all moderators seem to be male caucasians, so I'm going to bring the female minority perspective be open to new approaches and trends that come from practice. These days it's a lot of machine learning, so I'd be encouraging us to answer their questions so that they keep coming here My goal in life is to kill Data Science SE (long overdue) by making it obsolete and everyone forget the words "data science" once and for all. Final point: first three candidates in this election -- amoeba, gung and Tim -- are obvious choices, a la "isn't he already a moderator?!" I'm throwing myself into this as a "no way this guy is in the office" kind of an alternative for you. War and Peace Aksakal
