To iterate through the controls on a window, use code like this: ListBox1.DeleteAllRows For i As Integer = 0 To Self.ControlCount-1 ListBox1.AddRow(Self.Control(i).Name) Next (For this example, be sure to add at least one ListBox to the Window.) Properties are set just like you describe: ObjectInstance.PropertyName. If you are in the event of an object that has been dragged to the window, then you can modify its properties using Me.PropertyName. Otherwise you would use the object name.
