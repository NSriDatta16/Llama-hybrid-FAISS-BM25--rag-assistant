What supervised machine learning techniques will evaluate the raw image data itself - either for training or testing? Can manually annotated data sets or clustered data sets provide a direct model for training data? That is to say, are there supervised machine learning algorithms which accept pure pixel data as models for training? This is more or less the idea behind Representation Learning. For image feature extraction, Convolutional Neural Networks have established themselves as the reference.
