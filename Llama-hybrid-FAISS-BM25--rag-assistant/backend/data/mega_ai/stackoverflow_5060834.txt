I suggest you don't simplify this code because you may gain some kind of readability but you would also increase computation time. And that's a thing I would prefer to improve more than readability (code is executed a lot more often than read in plain text). Why is that? An expression like yours consisting only of or conjunctions will end right the moment the first 'true' value is found. So in best case PHP will just evaluate empty($action) with true and leave the if-header without evaluating all the other parts. In worst case it will check every part till the end. So in average - without further knowlege about the data you will check - you are running and computing half of the if-header. But if you use something like in_array($action, array('a', 'b', 'c')) than you will construct the whole array with all elements and search in it. So your PHP interpreter has to create all the elements and the array just to match one of the first ones. Which is anyway more computation than your current line. So think twice about readabilty vs. code complexity.
