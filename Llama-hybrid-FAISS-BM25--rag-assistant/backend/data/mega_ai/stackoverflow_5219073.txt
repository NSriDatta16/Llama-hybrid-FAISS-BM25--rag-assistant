json deserialization problem

Have an array, when the size is 1, the json data I received does NOT contains [] ; like {"firstname":"tom"} when the size is larger than 1, the data I received contains [] , like [{"firstname":"tom"},{"firstname":"robert"}] Currently my class contains an array property String[] firstname; //getter setter omit here Code to handle this likes ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(); MyClass object = mapper.readValue(json, MyClass.class); When the size is larger than 1, the deserialization works. However when size is 1, the deserialization failed. I am currently using jackson, any solution for this problem? I am wondering if jackson/gson or any other library can handle this?
