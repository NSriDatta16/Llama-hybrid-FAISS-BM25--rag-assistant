What to do when CI won't run in logistic regression?

I used exp(confint(m)) for models and for most models it worked. I got the following error for one model. Any ideas as to if there's something I can do so I can get CI? Error in zetafun(np, ns) : profiling detected new, lower deviance In addition: Warning messages: 1: In zeta(shiftpar, start = opt[seqpar1][-w]) : slightly lower deviances (diff=-2.62048e-11) detected 2: In nextpar(mat, cc, i, delta, lowcut, upcut) : Last two rows have identical or NA .zeta values: using minstep 3: In zetafun(np, ns) : slightly lower deviances (diff=-1.28665e-10) detected 4: In nextpar(mat, cc, i, delta, lowcut, upcut) : Last two rows have identical or NA .zeta values: using minstep 5: In nextpar(mat, cc, i, delta, lowcut, upcut) : Last two rows have identical or NA .zeta values: using minstep Full code used is: lr1.9b
