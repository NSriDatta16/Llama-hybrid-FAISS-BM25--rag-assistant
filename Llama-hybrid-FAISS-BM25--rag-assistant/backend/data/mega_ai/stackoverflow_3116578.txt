If you really want to resend packets from a .pcap file in a loop in C# you can use Pcap.Net . See Reading packets from a dump file in Pcap.Net tutorial to understand how to read the packets from the .pcap file and Sending Packets in Pcap.Net tutorial to understand how to send the packets. I hope this would help you.
