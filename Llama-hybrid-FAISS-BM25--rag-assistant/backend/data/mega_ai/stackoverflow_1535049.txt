How to use javascript (or something) to make a grid with dragable points that will modify a curve in realtime?

I want to make a box on the page that contains a graph with a curve on it, then user can drag a few points around modifying the curve. Preferably javascript or something I can easy share variables with DOM and ASP.NET. I want to get out a certain number of the points. Creating new points and deleting them would be great too. This way I could have a movable curve as well as an ability to select the number of coords they can save to database. Oh yeah the curve is log(n) base, whatever I guess 10 default?
