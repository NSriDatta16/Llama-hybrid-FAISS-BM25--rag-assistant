Is there a machine learning algorithm that swaps out variables in a model?

Let's say that I have a model that uses three variables, and each of those three variables have different variants. For example, variable two could be species diversity, but there are different variants such as Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's, Inverse Simpson's, etc. Is there a machine learning algorithm (preferably in R) that could test different combinations of the variable variants? Any help would be greatly appreciated, and please let me know if you have any clarifying questions.
