Speaking from a practical viewpoint - possibly unpopular here - if you have data measured on different scales, then go with correlation ('UV scaling' if you are a chemometrician), but if the variables are on the same scale and the size of them matters (e.g. with spectroscopic data), then covariance (centering the data only) makes more sense. PCA is a scale-dependent method and also log transformation can help with highly skewed data. In my humble opinion based on 20 years of practical application of chemometrics you have to experiment a bit and see what works best for your type of data. At the end of the day you need to be able to reproduce your results and try to prove the predictability of your conclusions. How you get there is often a case of trial and error but the thing that matters is that what you do is documented and reproducible.
