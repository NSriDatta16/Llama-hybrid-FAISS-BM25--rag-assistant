jQuery droppable item overlap

I have 1 draggable div and 2 droppable divs. Those 2 droppable divs also are draggable so there might be a chance those 2 divs are overlapped. In that situation, when I drag the draggable div and drop to the overlapped divs, is there anyway to make sure it is dropped on the top one?
