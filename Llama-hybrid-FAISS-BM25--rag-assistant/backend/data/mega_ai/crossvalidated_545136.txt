Bias-Variance tradeoff with Clustering algorithms

I'm investigating the bias-variance tradeoff in well-known machine learning algorithms. However, I'm not sure this concept applies in the case of unsupervised methods such as clustering algorithms. Is it safe to say that in clustering, a small number of clusters will lead to a high bias (underfitting) while a large one will provide a high variance (overfitting)?
