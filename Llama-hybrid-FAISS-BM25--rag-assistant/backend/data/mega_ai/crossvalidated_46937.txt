Bayesian analysis- Normal distribution with unknown mean and variance

Suppose we have some data points that we believe they follow $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, and both parameters are unknown . I want to assign conjugate prior distributions on both $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, and then obtain the posterior distribution. How this can be done in R?
