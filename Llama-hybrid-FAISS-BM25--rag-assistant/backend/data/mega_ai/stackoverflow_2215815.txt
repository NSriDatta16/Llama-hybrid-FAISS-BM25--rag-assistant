No extension is required. Just use the only directive. (old link, from original 2010 post) https://web.archive.org/web/20100129001557/http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/misc.html#including-content-based-on-tags (latest link) https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#including-content-based-on-tags It works like this: .. only:: latex The stuff in here only appears in the latex output. .. only:: html The stuff in this block only appears in the HTML output. It's often useful to use this directive with it: .. raw:: html It's good for embedding stuff, like video.
