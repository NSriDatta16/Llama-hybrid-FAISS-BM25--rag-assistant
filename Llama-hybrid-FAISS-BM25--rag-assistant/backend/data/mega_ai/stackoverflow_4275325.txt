Don't try to see C# + these features. Also because there is not a strict pragmatic answer to your question. Start from a functional programming point of view, for example try to learn F# to get inside what and when lambdas are used (actually everywhere inside a functional language) and then you'll understand things better. It will open your mind and make you think differently about imperative programming or mixed languages like C#.
