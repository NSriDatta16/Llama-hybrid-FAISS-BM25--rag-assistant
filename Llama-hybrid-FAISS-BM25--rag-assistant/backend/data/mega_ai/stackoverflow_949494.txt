Latex: Citations in section headings put into table of contents first

I have some citations for sections of my document that I have put in the section heading: \section{The title \cite{abc}, \cite{def}} Text I am also using the table of contents function, but Latex must look at the citations in the headings (for the table of contents) first and assign them the first citation rankings, regardless of their place in the overall document. So, any citations inside of \section or \subsection will be assigned [1], [2], and so on, and the citations within the text in the section follow after. Has anyone encountered this problem before? Is there any way of getting around this other than simply putting the \cite command somewhere inside the paragraph? I'd like to avoid this if possible. Cheers in advance!
