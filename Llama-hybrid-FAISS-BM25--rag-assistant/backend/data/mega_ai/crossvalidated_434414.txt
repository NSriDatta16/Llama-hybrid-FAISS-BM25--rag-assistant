Create tsData with specific ARIMA coefficients

Suppose for a time series, the arima output is: Series: tsData ARIMA(0,1,3) with drift Coefficients: ma1 ma2 ma3 drift -0.8970 -0.3765 0.5342 -0.8579 s.e. 0.2025 0.2576 0.2041 0.1107 sigma^2 estimated as 5.751: log likelihood=-63.23 AIC=136.47 AICc=139.19 BIC=143.13 I would like to create a tsData with the same coefficients ma1, ma2 and ma3 but changing de drift value to -0.6156 starting with ts value 73, with a periodicity of 1 and a total of 28 periods. Does anybody know how to deal with this problem? Thank you
