You have two ways to deal with date issues like this in MDX. One is to use a VBA date function to build a string using the date you want. If you make this string match the member name in your dimension you can then convert it into a set. See Sql Analysis Services Current Date The second way, which I think you need to look at, is to use MDX functions to find out which is the last (i.e. most recent) member in your [CurrDate] dimension. You can then use that member in your query. This will work fine as long as your dimension contains only dates in the past. I once implemented this idea and then found a future date of 2015 crept in the cube by accident, and then my MDX didn't show me todays date (which was usually the most recent member). The set you need might be: {[CurrDate].[Date].members.Item([CurrDate].[Date].members.count-1)} Or the equally un-elegant: { [CurrDate].lastChild.lastChild.lastChild.lastChild.lastChild}
