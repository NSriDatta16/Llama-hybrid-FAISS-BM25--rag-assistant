I prefer using the full name (Class.getName()). When packages are organized correctly, this allows tuning log4j to handle differently log messages originating from different parts of the java packages tree. For example, you can easily configure all classes in packages starting with "com.mycompany.infra" to use a specific appender, and log only messages of level WARN or above.
