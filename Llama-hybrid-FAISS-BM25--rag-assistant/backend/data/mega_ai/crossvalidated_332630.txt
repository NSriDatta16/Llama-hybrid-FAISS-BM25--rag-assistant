multi-class classification and imbalanced classes

I have a data set of 145 images that I divide in to 96 images for training and 49 others for test. I have three classes which are imbalanced in Training set as well as in test set. In training set: class one:16 images; class two:56 images and class three: 24 images. I used matlab to implement the multi-class (SVM) one against all, but i have a poor results in terms of Accurity mainly precission. I want to have a good classification so i can have a good measure of these images. Is there any one who can help?
