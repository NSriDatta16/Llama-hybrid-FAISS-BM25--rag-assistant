1 RoomType may have many Features 1 Feature may be assigned to many RoomTypes So what type of relationship do i have? M:N ? You have there a many-to-many relationship, which has to be represented by an extra table. That relationship table will have 2 fields: the PK of RoomTypes and the PK of Features. The PK of the relationship table will be made of those 2 fields. If that's usefull, you can add extra fields like the Quantity. I would like to encourage you to read about database Normalization, which is he process of creating a correct design for a relational database. You can Google for that, or look eventually here (there are plenty of books/web pages on this)
