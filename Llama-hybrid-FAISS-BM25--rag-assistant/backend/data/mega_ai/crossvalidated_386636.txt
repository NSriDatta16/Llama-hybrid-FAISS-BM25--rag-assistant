It is strange no one else mentioned this, but you can have inference only in cases where you have a probability distribution. Here to quote Wiki, which quotes Oxford dictionary: Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution (Oxford Dictionary of Statistics) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference In case of traditional neural networks, k-NN or vanilla SVMs you have no probability density to estimate, nor assumptions about any density, thus, no statistical inference there. Only training/learning. However, for most (all?) statistical procedures, you can use both inference AND learning, since these procedures possess some assumptions about the distribution of population in question.
