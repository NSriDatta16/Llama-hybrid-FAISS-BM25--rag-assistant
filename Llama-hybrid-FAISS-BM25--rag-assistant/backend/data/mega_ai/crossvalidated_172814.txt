No, it is not correct because each combination of classifier and city should have its own ROC curve that is obtained by changing the classifier's threshold. What you can do is compute ROC area for each (city, classifier) combination and then average by city to compare classifiers. You could also plot those ROC values using three boxplots, one for each classifier.
