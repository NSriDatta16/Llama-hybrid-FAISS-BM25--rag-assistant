Executing two sample t-test This is a general practice and I don't see red flags until your data are very not symmetric. Executing two sample t-test between Group1 Vs Group2, Group1 Vs Group3, and Group2 Vs Group3 with calculating average book rating per user (Each user has a single record which is average rating). One does not apply t-test function (I don't specify whether it's R or Py) to samples with only one observation which is the mean value of a sampled variable. Instead one have to follow that part of t-test methodology that starts after calculating the mean and standard deviation values form their samples. This is basically just that: find a pooled standard deviation, calculate the t-statistic using mean, pooled s.d. and degrees of freedom, and the desired effect size (>= 0), and find the p-value using a table, or a special function.
