You should only use differencing for removing stochastic trends (unit roots), not deterministic trends (linear, polynomial, seasonal or otherwise); beware of overdifferencing (see e.g. Bob Nau "Identifying the order of differencing in an ARIMA model" . Other than that, ARIMA will fit your time series equally well (or equally poorly), just the $d$ parameter will be different depending on whether you pre-difference or not.
