Finding out the events on a page and what are attached to an element

I'm trying to use firebug to debug some pages. What I want to do is look at what the events are against a particular element. For example : http://jsfiddle.net/2LN5G/ , I want to use Firebug and select the "Drag me to my target" and for it to take me to "$( ".drag" ).draggable({" section of the page or the JS file. Is this possible ?
