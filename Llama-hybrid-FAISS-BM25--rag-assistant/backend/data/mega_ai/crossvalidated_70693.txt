Restricting minimum subgroup size in a bootstrap resampling study - why is this approach wrong?

I'm currently doing a simple re-sampling study where I compare different methods for generating the confidence interval for linear regression models. I'm trying to follow Burton et. al's (2006) recommendation and I'm mostly interested in how well the confidence interval covers the true value (the coverage) from my original sample. Since a few of the confidence intervals are based upon the bootstrap procedure I figured, based upon this CV-question , that it would not be fair to use bootstrap re-samples where one of the categorical variables has a category with less than 8 individuals. I therefore re-sample if I get a sample that contains that criteria. One of the statisticians that I co-operate with tells me that this procedure violates the distributional assumption and that this is bad practice. Unfortunately his arguments have not convinced me and I therefore hope that someone here can aid in explaining the flaw in my logic. In my mind I would never use bootstrapping for a sample that for instance has only 2 women and 23 men in it as the two women couldn't possibly contribute enough to generate reasonable randomness from the bootstrap procedure. I'm aware that I can't say anything about the samples that I've discarded but why is it wrong to say something about the samples that satisfy the criteria? Minor update After Bill's interesting answer I just want to clarify a little. The original sample has "enough" in each category to allow for drawn samples to contain at least 8 individuals in each category. The boostrap stat-function is always the same (I use the R boot -package): #' Gets the coefficients for the bootstrap function #' #' This function also catches errors that may #' occur in the lm() call and then returns a NA vector. #' As I lack controle over the data this is necessary #' since there can be unexpected problems with the #' lm() call. #' #' @param formula The lm() formula #' @param data The data set that is to be bootstrapped #' @param indices The indices that the bootstrap #' provides the function see the library boot() #' function for details. If the function is used for #' the asymptotic confidence interval then the indices #' should be provided as a simple sequence - 1:nrow(data) #' @param true_vals The true values. Only used so that #' the function can return a result that contains the #' same number of estimates even if some coefficients #' were missing for this bootstrapped data set #' @return vector Returns the coefficients as a #' vector, in case of missing those are marked as NA #' at the apropriate positions. bootstrap_lm length(ret)){ empty As @jbowman commented in his answer - it is not of interest to compare a situation where one of the confidence intervals will by definition not work. I'm comparing regular, robust and bootstrapped confidence intervals and I want the comparison to be as fair as possible. Comparing on samples with less I guess I'll have to go by the conventional methodology and skip this criteria or I wont get published - it seems though that if that is the case then the statistical community will have articles that are biased against bootstrapping (in comparative studies like mine). If someone out there has a good paper that can support my approach I would greatly appreciate it.
