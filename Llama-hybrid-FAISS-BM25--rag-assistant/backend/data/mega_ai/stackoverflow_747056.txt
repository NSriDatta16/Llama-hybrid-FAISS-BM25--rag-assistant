Maybe SCRUM is overkill here. Organize into work packages and underlying tasks. The best way? Keep it simple stupid. Don't bloat the project with to much management overhead. You don't have to use a software for your scrum tasks. Issue trackers like Redmine / JIRA are nice to track your progress and assign tasks. But you can also use a whiteboard with a few magnets and memos (task name). So you can assign tasks via the board ;)
