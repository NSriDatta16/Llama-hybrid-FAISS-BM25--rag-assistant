Even in J2SE you should consider a Jar file as read only. In J2SE the only way to do it is either using external tools or recreating a new Jar file and overwriting the old one with the new. My recommendation would be to find a storage location as listed below and use your XML file as a default, if you need to change the just put the new one in the storage location. Your data storage options are the following: As per http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html These are the possible storage locations you have available: Shared Preferences - Store private primitive data in key-value pairs. Internal Storage - Store private data on the device memory. External Storage - Store public data on the shared external storage. SQLite Databases - Store structured data in a private database. Network Connection - Store data on the web with your own network server.
