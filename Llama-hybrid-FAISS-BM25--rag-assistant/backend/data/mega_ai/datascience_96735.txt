They are two implementations of different algorithms. SHAP offers two model-specific explainer DeepShap and GradientShap for explaining neural network models. The former combine the idea of DeepLift and Shapley values, the latter combines the idea of IntegratedGradients and Shapley values. SHAP also offers a model-agnostic algorithm named KernalShap, which uses ideas of LIME but with modified weights for local perturbated samples. The DeepExplain package offers different algorithms in a unified framework, including DeepLift and IntegratedGradients. Here's a useful article of SHAP https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html . Some brief explanations of these algorithms can be also found in Captum's doc, https://captum.ai/docs/algorithms .
