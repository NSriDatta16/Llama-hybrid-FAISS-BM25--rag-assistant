We have a similar file lifetime problem - the (winforms) application can fetch a document from a central repository store for the user to view, but the user should be able to close our app without it affecting the file they are viewing. Due to security concerns the document files need to be cleaned up so they aren't lying around too long. The solution we use is to create a folder with a date-derived name in the users' isolated storage area and use that as today's cache. At application close-down and start-up we check for previous dated cache folders and delete them (and contents).
