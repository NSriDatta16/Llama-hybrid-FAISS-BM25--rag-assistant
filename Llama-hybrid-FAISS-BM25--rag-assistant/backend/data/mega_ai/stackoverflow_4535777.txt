As far as I know, in Python a variable is just a name referring to some object instance. You can have many names pointing to the same instance; the instance is not aware of its names (nor should be, IMHO); the same name can be reused later to point to other instance from a complete different class. Given the Python data model is hard to see why would be useful for the object to know how it is named in some namespace. You can store references to your instances in a class variable or another container, but it is not very common in Python - because namespaces are such natural and elegant containers.
