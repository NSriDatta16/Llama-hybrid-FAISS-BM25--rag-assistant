Why should we use t errors instead of normal errors?

In this blog post by Andrew Gelman, there is the following passage: The Bayesian models of 50 years ago seem hopelessly simple (except, of course, for simple problems), and I expect the Bayesian models of today will seem hopelessly simple, 50 years hence. (Just for a simple example: we should probably be routinely using t instead of normal errors just about everwhere, but we don’t yet do so, out of familiarity, habit, and mathematical convenience. These may be good reasons–in science as in politics, conservatism has many good arguments in its favor–but I think that ultimately as we become comfortable with more complicated models, we’ll move in that direction.) Why should we "routinely be using t instead of normal errors just about everywhere"?
