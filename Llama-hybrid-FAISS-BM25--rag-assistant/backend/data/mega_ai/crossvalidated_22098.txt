How to explain poor classification performance of recall when using SVM?

I applied SVM to perform the classification against several data sets. It turns out that the performance metric of recall is pretty bad for one data set. It has recall around 50% while other data sets have recall around 80%. For this kind of scenario, what are the possible approaches that are available to improve the recall? Besides, why some data sets can have a poor performance in terms of recall? How to analyze this kind of problem?
