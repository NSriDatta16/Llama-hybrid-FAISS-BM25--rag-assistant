If I understand you correctly, the reason you don't want to use the line graphs is that you have too many weeks and the graphs would get messy. If this is the problem then you can divide the time series into components: Daily variation Weekly variation Long term trend Anything else. William S. Cleveland shows a nice example of this in one of his books (I am not at my office and can't remember which of his books has the example but it is either Visualizing data or The elements of graphing data ). Both R and SAS have tools for doing this. Do you have access to either of them?
