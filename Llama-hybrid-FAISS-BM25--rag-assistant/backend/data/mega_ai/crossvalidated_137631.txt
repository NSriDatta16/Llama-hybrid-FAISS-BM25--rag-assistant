Is it appropriate to do an ANOVA on a feature selected via inspecting PCA results?

I've been given a dataset consisting of 8 dimensional feature vectors for 4 classes of objects. I was asked to find the features that best distinguish the classes, and write up a short report. My first instinct was to do a PCA on the data. This yielded the following plot, among others. From visual inspection, it seems that the squares have higher 8000 Hz values than the other symbols. My next instinct, on seeing this trend, was to do a one-way ANOVA on the 8 kHz feature, followed by a Tukey HSD test, to reassure myself that the difference between classes was significant. These test came to mind not because I know them to be appropriate, but rather because they're the only tests I'm familiar with. I have no idea whether or not they're well suited to this context. My questions: is an ANOVA, followed by a planned comparison, the right course of action here? Or would some other test be more appropriate?
