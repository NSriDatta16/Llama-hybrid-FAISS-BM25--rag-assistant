Any caching I have done in winforms I have done with static variables, but if I were doing something non trivial, I would probably be using a DI framework and just use its caching. http://blogs.conchango.com/owainwragg/archive/2008/10/31/caching-with-castle-windsor.aspx Not a complete solution though. It makes sense for caching of objects returned from the DI kernel, but not nessicarily arbitrary values.
