You seem to mix up worst-case behaviour with average-case (expected) runtime. The former is indeed O(n) for hash tables in general (i.e. not using a perfect hashing) but this is rarely relevant in practice. Any dependable hash table implementation, coupled with a half decent hash, has a retrieval performance of O(1) with a very small factor (2, in fact) in the expected case, within a very narrow margin of variance.
