Why does my ARMA forecast get smaller over time?

I am a beginner to time series modeling but I am trying to build an ARMA model to describe a set of 24 observations. -6.73217 -2.86888 -5.37159 -6.51274 -4.17106 -5.7385 -3.34395 -1.94488 -5.46411 -3.18918 -3.6847 -2.1683 -2.32984 -0.76198 -2.18903 1.094239 -4.8123 0.784199 -1.56708 0.143964 1.131119 2.899746 -0.49872 3.121624 The ACF pattern seems to indicate that this is an AR process. The PACF shows a significant corrleation at lag 2. Based on this, I fit a ARMA (2,0,0) model to the data fitdata This resulted in the following model Series: tsdata ARIMA(2,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 mean 0.1023 0.6691 -2.0834 s.e. 0.1489 0.1652 1.3511 sigma^2 estimated as 3.987: log likelihood=-49.69 AIC=107.39 AICc=109.49 BIC=112.1 I then tried to predict 6 time periods ahead but as you can see the predictions get consistently smaller over time and do not seem to capture the overall trend of the data. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? pred EDIT: I should have mentioned earlier that according to a Dickey Fuller test the current time series is stationary. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: tsdata Dickey-Fuller = -4.0131, Lag order = 1, p-value = 0.0228 alternative hypothesis: stationary
