If you want an embedded client application, the Java Web Start (the better Google keyword is JNLP ) is less or more the successor of the legacy Java Applet. Alternatives to this are Adobe Flash and MS ClickOnce. If you want an RIA (Rich Internet Application), then JavaFX is the better Java based choice. Alternatives to this are the MS SilverLight, Adobe Air and Adobe Flex.
