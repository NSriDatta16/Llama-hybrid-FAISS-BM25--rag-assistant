Iphone multitouch handling

I'm writing an iPhone app, and I want to handle multitouches. I'm using cocos2d libs. So I've made a CCLayer subclass and set it to be a CCStandartTouchDelegate . For some reason I don't want to use UIGestureRecognizer and to build a correct logic I should know the answers for these questions: If I tap the screen with one finger, and then with the other one. How many touches will be caught in ccTouchesBegan ? If I tap the screen with two fingers and then will move only one of them. How many touches will be caught in ccTouchesMoved ?
