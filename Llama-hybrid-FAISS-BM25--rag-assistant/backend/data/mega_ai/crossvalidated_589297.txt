Software implementations of the same model often use different estimation methods, so the fact glm and JMP (which I am not familiar with) produce different results is no surprise. Further, even if they both used the same estimation algorithm they may do so with different default settings (e.g., convergence criteria, starting values), which may also lead to different results. So the fact that one implementation of your logistic regression model did not converge is not surprising. If I were in your position, I would compare how glm and JMP estimate your model parameters. However, if you are not interested, I would suggest simply using results obtained from JMP (i.e., the software where your model converged) since convergence issues should never be ignored . Finally, you could try using point estimates obtained from JMP as starting values in glm . It would be interesting to see if this would help with convergence.
