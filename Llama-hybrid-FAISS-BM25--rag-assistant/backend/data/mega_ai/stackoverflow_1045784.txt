This isn't a perfect (or probably even a "good") fit for what you're trying to do, but I mention it primarily for awareness and to possibly give you some additional ideas (and warnings). SharePoint's storage architecture leverages two different back-end stores: one for metadata (always SharePoint's SQL databases), and another for BLOB storage (also SQL by default). In its current form, though, SharePoint allows you to "wire-in" your own BLOB storage provider via a type that implements the ISPExternalBinaryProvider interface. Wiring in a type that implements this interface allows you to continue storing metadata in SQL while storing documents and other BLOB item types in a different store of your choice. This probably sounds somewhat promising, but there are a couple of serious considerations: Wiring-in your own ISPExternalBinaryProvider has a farm-wide impact. It's all or nothing, so once the provider is wired in, all sites and libaries will use the new provider. You'll need to dive into unmanaged code, as the ISPExternalBinaryProvider is doing to require you to work with some IDL. You can read more here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb802976.aspx My take is that the external BLOB storage (EBS) system is something of a "prototype" at this point -- not ready for prime-time. If nothing else, though, it gives you something to think about. SharePoint Server 2010 will hopefully do more with it and make it more attractive and easy to implement. For what it's worth!
