Detect/Parse Mailing Addresses in Text

Are there any open source/commercial libraries out there that can detect mailing addresses in text, just like how Apple's Mail app underlines addresses on the Mac/iPhone. I've been doing a little online research and the ideas seem to be either to use Google, Regex or a full on NLP package such as Stanford's NLP, which usually are pretty massive. I doubt iPhone has a 500MB NLP package in there, or connects to Google every time you read an email. Which makes me to believe there should be an easier way. Too bad UIDataDetectors is not open source. I know this question has been asked before, but there were no conclusive answers, so here's my try.
