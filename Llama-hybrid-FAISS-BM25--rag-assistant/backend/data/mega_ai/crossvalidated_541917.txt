Ratio between two values with confidence intervals

I have two integer values, each with confidence intervals, and I want to calculate the ratio between the two values. My strategy would be to find all the pairs of integer values within the CIs and then calculate the ratio between them, so as to find the distribution of the ratio between the two values. I can then calculate the average value, which I can interpret as the average value of the ratio between the two values with their CIs. My questions are: Is this strategy sounding or are there any issues? Can I interpret the minimum and maximum ratio value I identified with the previous procedure as the Confidence Intervals of my ratio? In the case the previous one is true, and considering that the starting confidence levels are 95%, is 95% also the confidence level of the ratio? R code for a simple simulation: # simulate data # x = 250 ± 100 # y = 200 ± 50 x $Var1/comb$ Var2 # summary and histogram summary(ratio) hist(ratio)
