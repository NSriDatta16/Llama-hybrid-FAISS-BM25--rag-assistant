The meaning of units on the axes of a PCA plot

I've used the R packages DESeq2 and ggplot2 and the following code vsd to produce the following PCA plot: I know the axes are the principal components but I am confused by the units displayed. I thought the axes of a PCA plot are unit-less. But then I did image search on Google for "PCA plot" and saw tons of plots displaying units on their axes. Does anyone know what is the meaning of these units?
