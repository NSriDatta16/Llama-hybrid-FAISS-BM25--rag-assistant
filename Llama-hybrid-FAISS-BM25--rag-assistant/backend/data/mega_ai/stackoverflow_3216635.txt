Checkbox setState:0 on app launch

I'm having a problem with a checkbox. I want to set it to 0 (unchecked) on app launch, but the checkbox is controlled by another class "myClass" for example. Here's what I did: I opened Interface Builder and put a checkbox (NSButton) in my window, dragged NSObject in my MainMenu.xib window, renamed it to say "myClass". Added an outlet called "myCheckbox" (NSButton) and linked it to the checkbox I created earlier. Finally, I added some things. Here's the code for my myClass.m: #import "myClass.h" @implementation myClass - (void) changeState { [myCheckbox setState:0]; } @end myClass.h #import @interface myClass : NSObject { IBOutlet NSButton *myCheckbox; } - (void) changeState; @end Then I made some changes in the AppDelegate files so they execute some things when the app is launched: #import "UntitledAppDelegate.h" #import "myClass.h" @implementation UntitledAppDelegate @synthesize window; - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification { myClass * someClass = [[myClass alloc] init]; [someClass changeState]; } @end UntitledAppDelegate.h: #import @interface UntitledAppDelegate : NSObject { NSWindow *window; } @property (assign) IBOutlet NSWindow *window; @end The purpose (if this works) is to set a value to the check box depending on the setting stored in the Defaults file. The problem might be easy or too simple but I'm only a beginner... Some help would be appreciated, Thanks !
