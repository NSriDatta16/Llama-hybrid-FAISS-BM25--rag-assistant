There is a very nice library of online machine learning algorithms from a group at NTU, called LIBOL . This would be a very good place to start experimenting with the algorithms. The accompanying user guide , and associated JMLR publication are very nice introductions to the basic algorithms in this field. Avrim Blum has an older and more technical survey paper on online learning algorithms.
