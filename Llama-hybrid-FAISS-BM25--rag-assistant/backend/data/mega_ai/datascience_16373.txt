I would highly recommend the platform - https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/ AnalyticsVidhya is an amazing community for data science. Not only contests, but they also have technical articles on their blog ( https://www.analyticsvidhya.com ). Though I used to blog for them, but my opinion is not biased by that fact. I used to follow them for a couple of years before that and I felt lucky that I got a chance to contribute to the community. In terms of interesting problems, I would recommend the following: The Smart Recruits The Creative Analyst Date Your Data Sorry I'm new here and not allowed to post more than 2 links. You'll find these competitions on their website. The datasets are available and you can make submissions to benchmark yourself. Also, I would suggest sign up for their emails. They conduct short 2-3 day hackathons which offer great learning experiences. Hope this help!
