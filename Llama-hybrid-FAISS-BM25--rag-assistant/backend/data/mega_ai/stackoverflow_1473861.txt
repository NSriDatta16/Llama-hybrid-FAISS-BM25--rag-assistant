Feedback on a session storage class design

I have a session class that basicly just sets and retrieves session variables, the reason I made it was so I could easily change it to use sessions or something like memcache to set the items and have them accessible on multiple pages without hitting the database I then have this user class which uses the session object to get session variables in it. I am wanting to add to this user class though, to make it more encapsulated I would like to be able to set the variables that I am retrieving in this class so right now I can display the userid with $user->userid; I would like to first have a method or something that sets its value from the session object I guess Does this sound lke a good idea or possibly a lot of overhead? And if what I am trying to do is a good idea maybe you could suggest/show example of how I should do it? I am thinking that if I add that method in that possibly I should move the code in the __construct method into it's own method Basicly, I have the variables listed in the top part of the class that are used in the construct method, if I have multiple methods in the class though would I need to set them all at the top like that? get('auto_id') != ''){ //set user vars on every page load $this->userid = $session->get('auto_id'); //user id number $this->name = $session->get('disp_name'); $this->pic_url = $session->get('pic_url'); $this->gender = $session->get('gender'); $this->user_role = $session->get('user_role'); $this->location_lat = $session->get('lat'); $this->location_long = $session->get('long'); $this->newuser = $session->get('newregister'); }else{ return false; } } } //with the class above I can easily show some user variables I have saved into a session like this below $user = new user(); $user->userid; ?>
