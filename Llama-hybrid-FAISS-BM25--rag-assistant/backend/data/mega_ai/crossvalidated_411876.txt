It appears that you have a sample size in excess of 200 or so . The confidence limits are quite small due to the large sample size thus are of little meaning . I would say p=0,q=0 ... since the pacf doesn't suggest decay .. I might guess that the reason for your non-stationarity might be the presence of level shifts or time trends in your data. OR the need for a seasonal structure . Only your data knows for sure .. see Why doesn't ARIMA work on my time series data? for a discussion of how the acf/pacf might be misleading in suggesting the ar/ma structure. misleading is an understatement !
