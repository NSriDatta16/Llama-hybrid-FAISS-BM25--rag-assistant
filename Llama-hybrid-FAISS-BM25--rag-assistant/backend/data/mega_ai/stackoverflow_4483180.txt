How to rewrite to mobile.myUrl.com if user is mobile? (use Apache or inside Webapp?)

If a user is viewing my Website www.myUrl.com with a mobile Browser, I would like to redirect them to mobile.myUrl.com. I read this thread Auto detect mobile browser (via user-agent?) , which says, that you should detect the user-agent and then redirect the user. But I havent found a thread, which tells me HOW to redirect to mobile.myUrl.com. Should and can I use Apache for that? Or should I instead do it inside my Webapp?
