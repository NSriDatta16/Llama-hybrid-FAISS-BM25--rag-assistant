Effectively, you have five observations to compare the experimental treatment with the control treatment: 3 treatment and 2 control. You can do either of two things. First, you can compute the average of the measurements for each culture. Then do a t-test or a nonparametric test to compare the means of the two treatments. Your control culture averages might be more reliable since they are based on more measurements. If you want to evaluate this you will need a hierarchical model. You have two treatments. Nested within treatments is a random factor, culture number (numbered 1 to 5). Nested within each level of culture number you have another random factor, call it measure, numbered from 1 to 70. You can use an analysis of variance with these three factors and with this nesting. The denominator for the test to compare the two treatments still comes from variation among cultures. I recommend the first method, at least to start. You should evaluate whether the measurements are skewed.
