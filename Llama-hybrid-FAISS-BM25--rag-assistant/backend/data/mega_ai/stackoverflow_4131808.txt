jquery ui droppable insert text in textarea at mouse pointer

I am trying to drag and drop into a textarea using jquery ui draggable/droppable. I set the textarea as droppable. I am able to fire off events when the drop happens but I can't figure out how to determine exactly in which position in the textarea the 'drop' took place. Basically I would like to insert text at the precise position in the textarea where the drop took place. Google isn't helping me right now and it makes me sad. Example: Drag Drop Test $(document).ready(function(){ $( "#catalog li" ).draggable({ appendTo: "body", helper: "clone" }); $( "#mytext" ).droppable({ accept: ":not(.ui-sortable-helper)", drop: function( event, ui ) { console.log(ui.position); // figure out where in the textarea this is // drop in some string } }); }); T-Shirts Lolcat Shirt Cheezeburger Shirt Buckit Shirt Just some random text. So, in the above example, how do I find out which position in the textarea a 'drop' happened of one of the catalog li elements and then how do I put in a string into the textarea at that exact position? Meaning, if I drag 'Lolcat Shirt' into the #mytext textarea and drop it between 'random' and 'text' I would like the #mytext textarea value to change to 'Just some random Lolcat Shirt text.' Is this possible? Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
