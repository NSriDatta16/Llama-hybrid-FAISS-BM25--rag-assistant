https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.FileField.upload_to def upload_path_handler(instance, filename): return "user_{id}/{file}".format(id=instance.user.id, file=filename) class Car(models.Model): ... photo = models.ImageField(upload_to=upload_path_handler, storage=fs) There is a warning in the docs, but it shouldn't affect you since we're after the User ID and not the Car ID. In most cases, this object will not have been saved to the database yet, so if it uses the default AutoField, it might not yet have a value for its primary key field.
