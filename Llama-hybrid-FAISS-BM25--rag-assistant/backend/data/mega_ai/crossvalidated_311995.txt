Proof that the HPD region is the smallest

In one dimension it can be shown that the highest posterior density (HPD) interval is the shortest; I found a proof in Subjective and Objective Bayesian Statistics ( Section 8.4 ) by S. James Press where a suitable Lagrangian is built and used to find the solution. Does anyone know of a proof for the higher dimensional case?
