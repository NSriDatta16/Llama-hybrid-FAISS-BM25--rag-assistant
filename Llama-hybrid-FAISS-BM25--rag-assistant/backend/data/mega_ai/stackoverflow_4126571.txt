Spring MVC session storage

This is just the continuation of this post . I'm coming from ASP.NET world. In ASP.NET I had a few options to store the session: "In proc" and "Out Proc" which mean the session will be serialized and stored either in database or in Session management service. This practice is also relevant to load balancing if I don't want to have my session sticky. what is the Java/tomcat alternate solution for such cases? How can I store out of proc session? What is the load balancer solution? Thank you in advance.
