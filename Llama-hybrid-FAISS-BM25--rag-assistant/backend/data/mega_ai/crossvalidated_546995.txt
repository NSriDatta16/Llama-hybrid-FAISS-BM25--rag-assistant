SD is a common abbreviation for Standard Deviation, while SE is Standard Error. Standard Deviation ( $\sigma$ ) is the measure of average distance from the mean in a distribution. SE is the SD of a sample that is proportional to the sample size (n): $SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ The equation for $\sigma$ is $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(x_i-\mu)^2}{n}}$ , where $\mu$ is the mean of the group. To calculate the standard deviation of your groups in R, simple use the sd function . There is also a convenient se function .
