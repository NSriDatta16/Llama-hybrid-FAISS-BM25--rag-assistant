Matlab - how to replace all the special characters in a vector?

Is it possible to replace all the special characters in a matlab vector through a regular expression? Thank you * EDIT: * Thank you for your responses. I'm trying to achieve the following. I have a text file that contains few paragraphs from a novel. I have read this file into a vector. fileText = ['Token1,' 'token_2' 'token%!3'] etc. In this case , _ % ! are the special characters and I would like to replace them with blanks (''). Can this be achieved through regular expressions? I can do this with javascript, but can't get it to work in Matlab. Thank you
