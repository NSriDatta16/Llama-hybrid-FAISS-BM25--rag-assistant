Neural network for colored line detection?

Can I use a Neural Network to find at least 3 pixels (that have RGB or HSV values in a certain range) in a line? I would like to teach the network to accept when and when not accept the line, is possible to do such thing? The lines are scanned by a scanner, when the network goes looking for some colored lines I first look at the paper with the real picture and then tell the network whether it should accept or not.
