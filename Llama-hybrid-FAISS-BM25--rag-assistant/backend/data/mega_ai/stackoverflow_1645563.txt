I've found several news releases from Dragon claiming that an older version of Naturally Speaking supported SAPI 4.0. The problem is that SAPI 4.0 has been obsolete for over a decade; MSDN doesn't even bother to document it. I suppose if you could get a 1999-era archive copy of MSDN on DVD, you could use that. I'm also not sure that current versions of Naturally Speaking continue to support SAPI 4. Final answer: True at one time; probably not true now.
