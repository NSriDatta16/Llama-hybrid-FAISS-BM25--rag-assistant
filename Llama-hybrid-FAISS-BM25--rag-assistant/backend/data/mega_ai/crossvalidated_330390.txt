Building Decision Tree on a high dimensional data set with sparse Boolean values

I have been trying to learn a decision tree on a data-set with almost 400 features. The target variable has only two values and the data is highly skewed towards the non-event class (90 % of the data set). All the features take only Boolean values. The decision tree plots are skewed towards the non event class. I am looking for the path that helps me predict the event class. I couldn't find a definitive answer anywhere. Can anyone give me some ideas? EDIT : Apologies if the question wasn't clear. I just started as a Data Science inter, and this is my first project . The decision tree predicts almost all the non-event class (90% of the data) with high accuracy, whereas almost entirely misclassifies the event class. What do I need to do to build the tree that predicts the non-event class with high accuracy and to see the decision paths that makes up such a tree? I tried ensemble methods but it only improved my classifier marginally
