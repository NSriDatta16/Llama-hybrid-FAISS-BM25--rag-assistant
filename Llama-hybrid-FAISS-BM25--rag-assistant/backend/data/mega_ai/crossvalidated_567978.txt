Comparing performance of models fitted across time series with different frequencies

I have a time series with observations over the span of minutes, hours or even days. I'm interested in knowing if is better to use a daily, weekly or monthly version of the original time series, which I can produce by aggregating the original values. In synthesis, 5 models were fitted over the 3 time series (daily, weekly and monthly) and the errors should be compared. Because of aggregation, monthly model predictions have a large magnitude compared to daily and weekly, so the errors are much bigger, despite that monthly models could be better. Which would be a good approach to compare different magnitude errors? EDIT I could normalize the series by its maximum in the training set, or normalize the errors. The first makes sense to me, but not the later.
