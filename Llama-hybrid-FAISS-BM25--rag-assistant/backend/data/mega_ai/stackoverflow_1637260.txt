Minor disagreement with the other solution. I'd say ^#(([0-9a-fA-F]{2}){3}|([0-9a-fA-F]){3})$ The reason is that this (correctly) captures the individual RGB components. The other expression broke #112233 in three parts, '#' 112 233. The syntax is actually '#' (RR GG BB) | (R G B) The slight disadvantage is more backtracking is required. When parsing #CCC you don't know that the second C is the green component until you hit the end of the string; when parsing #CCCCCC you don't know that the second C is still part of the red component until you see the 4th C. It also works great for RGBA but the other solution doesn't const thisRegex = /#(([0-9a-fA-F]{2}){3,4}|([0-9a-fA-F]){3,4})/g document.write("#fff;ae#rvaerv c #fffaff---#afd #ffff".match(thisRegex)) // #fff,#fffaff,#afd,#ffff the other solution doesn't recognize #fffaff well const theOtherSolutionRegex = /#(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{3,4}){1,2}/g document.write("#fff;ae#rvaerv c #fffaff---#afd #ffff".match(theOtherSolutionRegex)) // #fff,#fffa,#afd,#ffff
