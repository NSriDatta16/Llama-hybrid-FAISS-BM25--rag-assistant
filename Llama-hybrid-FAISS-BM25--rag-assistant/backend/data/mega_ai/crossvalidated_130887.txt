google scholar gives a lot of hits, in addition to the references above, and in comments, some which looks interesting is: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002041 GAM's in studies of species distributions, published in "Ecological Modelling" http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/156/3/193.short Use of GAM's in studies of air pollution and health but the OP seems to care more for statistical theory, so: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947398000334 this is about better fitting algorithms http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9876.00229/abstract Bayesian inference based on MArkov Random Field priors http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9469.00333/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false about estimation methods in GAM's ... all this with many different authors, so the answer to original question seems to be many .
