How to place text through parameters in a video at different position

I am asked to create a video where texts are inserted dynamically at various points in the video. Its kinda like creating personalized video. For example a person's name is given as a parameter to the swf file, then that name is inserted inside the video at runtime. I am new to video editing and it will be of great help if anyone could guide me which product i should be looking on. With adobe cs4 professional, I tried creating cue points but the issue is i can't place the text at the coordinates where i want to in the video. After that, i tried with adobe after effects, now i am able to create text layer and place the text whereever i want to. But i am at loss to figure out how to pass the value for the text layer dynamically. It will be of great help if anyone can give me some idea of how to do it. Thanks Ragu
