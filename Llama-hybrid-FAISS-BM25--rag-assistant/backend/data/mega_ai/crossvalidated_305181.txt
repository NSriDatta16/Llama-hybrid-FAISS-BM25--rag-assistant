Which model to use when one variable is country specific and the other is company specific?

So basically my study is on a single country with a 10 year time period. The sample is of several companies of that country. My independent variables are of two kinds, one is country-specific macroeconomic and the others are company-specific financial. The dependent variable is also company specific. I am trying to find the joint effect of the two independent variable on the dependent. The problem here is that since the country is same, hence for a single year all the companies within the sample will have same values for the macroeconomic variables. I don't think time series will work since I am not suggesting that current period y depends on past period y. But I am also not sure whether this is a panel data as I am focusing on a single country. Which model should I use? Should I use interaction term?
