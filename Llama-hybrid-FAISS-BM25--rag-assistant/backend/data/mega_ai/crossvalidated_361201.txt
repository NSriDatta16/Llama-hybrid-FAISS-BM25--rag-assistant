Usually when you are doing MCMC sampling you generate a list of sampled values from the algorithm. If the proposed state is rejected then you set $X_t = X_{t-1}$, where $X_{t-1}$ is the current state of the MCMC algorithm. Alternately, you could have 2 (associated) lists first one w/the values and the second one with the counts of the number of times you stay at the state. However, you usually want to be accepting new states with some "reasonably" high probability (search for articles by Rosenthal for more on this) so usually better off just duplicating the same value multiple times in your list.
