Everything looks ok, until this line: for(int year = 1; year This code is outside the scope of the for loop: for(x = 0; x I believe that the loop over the years should be inside the BANKACC loop. For one, by the time the code gets to this, x is out of bounds of the array it looks like. But that is not the only problem. The loops that iterate over the years and months will always go 1 less than they should since they are starting from 1, and going until ( Also, the way the average is being computed also seems to be wrong.
