Stefan, if your end-goal is for reporting I would suggest a tool like Tableau. It is very simply to learn for the average user and it allows them to make reports on the fly using the interface or type custom queries against the database. If you are looking for something more advanced I would suggest a product like CockPit (I know...) developed by a German based company that is also really neat and starting to take off.
