Although you are not concerned with portability, I believe that's a big part of the reason. File I/O is nearly universal and with an extremely consistent API. Other advantages include: Less moving parts Nothing to install Low skill barrier Speed Mature set of tools for logging, parsing, managing Not dependent on the network (assuming local disk and not NFS or other remote storage) Reliability Can still put these into a DB for reporting/analysis grep is your friend No file equivalent of SQL injection to worry about (well for storing the data, not necessarily so for reporting it or subsequent DB upload). That said, there's nothing wrong with logging to a DB if the nature of the app lends itself to that and I've seen many apps that do so.
