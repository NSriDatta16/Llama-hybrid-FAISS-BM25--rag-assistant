Grails: Alternatives to Grails Doc?

The documentation created by running grails doc is not completely satisfactory in my eyes. For example, actions in controllers appear as properties in the documentation, though I would wish to have an extra section to separate actions from actual properties (Strings etc.). Are there any tools that operate on JavaDoc-like comments and generate better output for Grails projects? It should be either Grails-aware (i.e. understands that closures in controllers are actually actions) or allow explicit tagging (e.g. a @section Actions comment makes the paragraph appear in a section called "Actions")
