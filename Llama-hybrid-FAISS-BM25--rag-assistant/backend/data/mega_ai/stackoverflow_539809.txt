There are at least 2 reasonable answers to this question. (I originally gave only answer 2.) Use the int() function to truncate the floating-point calculation result to an integer (throwing away the decimal part), as Bryan suggested in his self-answer: #539805 Use the use integer pragma to make Perl truncate both the inputs and results of calculations to integers. It's scoped to within { } blocks. Examples: print 3.0/2.1 . "\n"; # => 1.42857142857143 print 5.0/1.5 . "\n"; # => 3.33333333333333 print int(3.0/2.1) . "\n"; # => 1 print int(5.0/1.5) . "\n"; # => 3 { use integer; print 3.0/2.1 . "\n"; # => 1 print 5.0/1.5 . "\n"; # => 5 (because 1.5 was truncated to 1) } print 3.0/2.1 . "\n"; # => 1.42857142857143 again
