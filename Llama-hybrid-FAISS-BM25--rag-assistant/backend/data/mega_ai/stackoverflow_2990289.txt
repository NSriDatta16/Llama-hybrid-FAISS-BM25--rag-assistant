A garden variety linked list would fit your requirement. But refining your requirements would produce better recommendations. For example: Is speed important? Linked lists inject a search time and alloc/free overhead. Are you concerned about memory fragmentation? Linked lists with heavy insertion/deletion activity can badly fragment memory over time. What are the bounds of the data set? If you expect a relatively finite data set then a hit table might be better than a linked list which can grow to arbitrary size.
