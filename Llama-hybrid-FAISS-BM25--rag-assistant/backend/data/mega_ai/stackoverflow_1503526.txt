Receive multi file post with google app engine

I want to receive multi file post from image uploader.( i use this ) Most examples show how to receive one image from post. I tried many ways but never got the results. For example self.request.POST['Filename'] gives only first filename. What to do when there are multiple files/images in post? The reason for this is to resize before upload images, that are too big for google app engine to upload. EDIT: self.request.POST.multi.__dict__ shows {'_items': [('Filename', 'camila1.jpg'), ('Filedata[]', FieldStorage('Filedata[]', 'camila1.jpg')), ('Upload', 'Submit Query\r\n--negpwjpcenudkacqrxpleuuubfqqftwm----negpwjpcenudkacqrxpleuuubfqqftwm\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="Filename"\r\n\r\nbornToBeWild1.jpg'), ('Filedata[]', FieldStorage('Filedata[]', 'bornToBeWild1.jpg')), ('Upload', 'Submit Query')]}
