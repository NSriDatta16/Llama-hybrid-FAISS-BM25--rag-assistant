But if occur an error on the servlet, the browser opens an empty pdf with an error message. Seems to me it would be better to try to fix this at the server end than all this fragile fiddling about with AJAX and caches. Why is a servlet error still setting the ‘Content-Type: application/pdf’ header with its error message? Check the order of sending things in the servlet; don't send the ‘Content-Type’ until you've created the PDF successfully and have it ready to return.
