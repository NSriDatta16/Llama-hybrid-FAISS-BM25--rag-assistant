Should I ignore negative prediction values?

I have the following time series of count data : x To which I have associated the following model > library(forecast) ... > ets(x) ETS(A,N,N) Call: ets(y = x) Smoothing parameters: alpha = 0.9999 Initial states: l = 105466.6663 sigma: 32125.45 AIC AICc BIC 355.9429 356.9429 357.3590 Which gives me negative prediction boundaries at 95% confidence: > forecast(ets(x), level = .95) Point Forecast Lo 95 Hi 95 16 54933.94 -8030.795 117898.7 17 54933.94 -34107.138 143975.0 18 54933.94 -54116.824 163984.7 ... Since we're dealing with count data, I've decided to hide the negative values from my final plot: plot(forecast(ets(x), level = .95), ylim = c(0, 260e3)) My questions are: How many Statistics professors have I just aggravated with that procedure? How could I get away with such a model without having to resort to transforming my data (I'm trying to avoid the back-and-forth of log-transformation)?
