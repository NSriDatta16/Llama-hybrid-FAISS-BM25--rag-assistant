You can correct for ties in the Mann-Whitney test, have you considered using this version? Some software, e.g., Statistica calculate this automatically. A tie correction method can be found on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannâ€“Whitney_U_test Note, that it is still not ideal since your outcome/dependent variable only has three categories. An alternative could be multinomial logistic regression but your sample size may be too small for this, especially if you originally planned for a t-test in your sample size calculation.
