The Cocoa design patterns encourage using a controller object to configure views, but there's no reason why you can't subclass like you're describing, especially if you need to add functionality that can't be done any other way. You can use properties and methods just how you're describing, so there's a problem somewhere else. What method are you subclassing to assign the row height? Have you checked in the debugger to make sure your subclass is being allocated instead of a regular table view?
