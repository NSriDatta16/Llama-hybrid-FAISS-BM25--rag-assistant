I would recommend you to give a look to this library: PersistJS I really like it, it supports a variety of storage backends (from cookies to HTML5 storage, Gears, Flash, and more...), its usage is really transparent , you don't have to know or care which backend is used the library will choose the right storage backend depending on the browser capabilities.
