In the example of guess a specified number between 1 and 20 (both inclusive), what is the sample space?

This post is discussing Bayesian reasoning in the context of guess a specified number between 1 and 20 (both inclusive). Consider the following example: Iâ€™m thinking of a number between 1 and 20 (both inclusive), and I want you to try and guess the number. In this case, the hypothesis space is the set of values that observations can take, H = {1, . . . , 20}. If N = 4 values were chosen from this space, the resulting data set might look like the following: D1 = {14, 10, 2, 18} D2 = {4, 2, 16, 8} D3 = {5, 11, 2, 17} D4 = {3, 7, 2, 4} The post defines a hypothesis space as H = {1, . . . , 20}, regarding which, what is the sample space? Are D1, D2, D3, D4 4 different sample spaces?
