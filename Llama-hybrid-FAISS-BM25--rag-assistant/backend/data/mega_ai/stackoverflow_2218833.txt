I just found a possible (inelegant, IMO) solution. After querying and fetching entities, loop through all of them and manually add the id parameter : query = Question.all() questions = query.fetch(10) # Add ID property : for question in questions: question.id = str(question.key().id()) I don't think it's efficient CPU wise, but it works as a quick/dirty fix.
