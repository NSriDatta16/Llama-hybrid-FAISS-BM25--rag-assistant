git notes is the only way to have a different git log message (different than the commit message) without changing the SHA1, as mentioned in the "Notes to Self" article (from the original Aug. 2010 article ). A few remarks though: Notes are organized by namespace , the default one being "commits". Notes don't modify the commit message, they only add to it (which might be why git notes isn't working for you). Notes aren't pushed by default, unless you specify explicitly the refspec for them ( refs/notes/* )
