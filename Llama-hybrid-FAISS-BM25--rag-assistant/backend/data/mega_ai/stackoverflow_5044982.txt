Django Storage Backend for S3

I'm looking for a good Django custom storage backend for use with Amazon S3. I've been googling around and found a lot of blog posts with code snippets or half-baked gist.github.com one-off jobs. But I can't seem to find a solid, well-tested one. Is there a widely accepted standard Amazon S3 Django custom storage backend out there? It doesn't particularly matter to me what Python backend library it uses--i.e., either S3.py or boto are fine.
