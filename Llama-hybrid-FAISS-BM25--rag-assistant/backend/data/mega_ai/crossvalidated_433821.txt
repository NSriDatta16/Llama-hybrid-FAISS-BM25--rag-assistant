Some relevant literature across the spectrum: Muliere, Pietro, and Giovanni Parmigiani. 1993. Utility and means in the 1930s. Statistical Science 8: 421–32. ..gives a wide-ranging review of about a century's worth of thought on the subject, starting ~1920's with the axiomatic approach of Kolmogorov, Chisini's insights, through decision theory and other developments. A good and thorough academic review. Many of the same insights are concisely available in: de Carvalho, Michel. 2016. Mean, what do you mean? The American Statistician 70: 270. For a well designed and presented, brief and accessible article the following is excellent (it would, for example, be ideal stimulation for talented students): Falk, Ruma, Avital Lann, and Shmuel Zamir. 2005. Average speed bumps: Four perspectives on averaging speeds. Chance 18: 25–32. And for those who would like the full & dense mathematical treatment - really only for mathematicians to be honest - this two-part review would be a good start: Grabisch, Michel, Jean-Luc Marichal, Radko Mesiar, and Endre Pap. 2011a. Aggregation functions: Means. Information Sciences 181: 1–22. Grabisch, Michel, Jean-Luc Marichal, Radko Mesiar, and Endre Pap. 2011b. Aggregation functions: Construction methods, conjunctive, disjunctive and mixed classes. Information Sciences 181: 23–43.
