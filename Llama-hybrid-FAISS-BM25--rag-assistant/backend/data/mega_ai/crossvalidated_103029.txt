Calculating Perplexity

In the Coursera NLP course , Dan Jurafsky calculates the following perplexity: Operator(1 in 4) Sales(1 in 4) Technical Support(1 in 4) 30,000 names(1 in 120,000 each) He says the Perplexity is 53. The lecture can be found here: https://youtu.be/b6nwdc_fGfA @ 8:40. I've been trying to figure out how it's calculated but I just can't get it. I've tried to switch to log's because of the 1/120000 but I still can't seem to figure it out.
