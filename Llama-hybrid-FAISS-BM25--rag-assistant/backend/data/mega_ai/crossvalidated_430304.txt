Random forest ordinal data

I want to estimate a Random Forest in some statistical language (SAS). This can only be estimated by setting the target variable as nominal instead of ordinal. Isn't it possible to estimate a Random Forest with a ordinal target variable in general? If it is possible, does estimating the target variable as ordinal instead of nominal have any prediction gains?
