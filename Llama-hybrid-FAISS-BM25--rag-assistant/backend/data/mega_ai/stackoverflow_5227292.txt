conditional evaluation of source file in python

Say I have a file that's only used in pre-production code I want to ensure it gets not run in production code- any calls out to it have to fail. This snippet at the top of the file doesn't work - it breaks the Python grammar, which specifies that return must take place in a function. if not __debug__: return None What is the best solution here - the one that doesn't involve making a gigantic else, that is. :-)
