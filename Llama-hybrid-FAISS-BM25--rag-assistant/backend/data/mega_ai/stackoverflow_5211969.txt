The C++ standard also has a Bidirectional Iterator concept, which is a Forward Iterator that can also go backward (with operator-- ). Together, these five form the entire iterator hierarchy in paragraph 24.2 of the C++ standard. The old STL also had the concept of a Trivial Iterator . See its Iterator overview for details regarding the various iterators. Boost designers Abrahams, Siek and Witt have presented a much more fine-grained set of iterator concepts.
