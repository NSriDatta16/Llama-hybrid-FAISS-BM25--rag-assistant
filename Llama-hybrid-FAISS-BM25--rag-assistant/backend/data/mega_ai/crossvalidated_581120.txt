How to avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price in Machine Learning model?

I am currently working on a case study where I have to estimate how much a person makes by giving their property for rent. They provided me with a constraint which is as follows: "avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price" At first, I tried modeling without considering the constraint but failed miserably since the score I was getting is around 0.25. So, I guess that constraint should be implemented for sure. As I am somewhat of a novice, I did not come across such a case before, therefore having no idea how to approach it. The dataset I am using is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikbhandary2/property-rentals For the sake of context I am sharing with you the full details of the case study: You have been hired by Inn the Neighborhood, an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties for short stays. Currently, the webpage for renters has a conversion rate of 2%. This means that most people leave the platform without signing up. The product manager would like to increase this conversion rate. They are interested in developing an application to help people estimate the money they could earn renting out their living space. They hope that this would make people more likely to sign up. The company has provided you with a dataset that includes details about each property rented, as well as the price charged per night. They want to avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price , as this may discourage people.
