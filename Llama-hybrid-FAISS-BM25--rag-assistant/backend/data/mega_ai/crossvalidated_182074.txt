Calculating Bayesian posterior distribution for an exponential distribution

I want to calculate the Bayesian posterior distribution of an exponential distribution where $\lambda$ is distributed according to gamma distribution. I know that I need to calculate $\frac{P(x|\lambda)P(\lambda)}{P(x)}$. I know $P(\lambda)$ because I know the gamma distribution function. I also know that $P(x|\lambda)$ = $\lambda \exp(-\lambda x)$. But I dont know what $P(x)$ is or what it means. Am I on the right track? What does $P(x)$ mean in this context?
