I noticed a few things while perusing your code and using the app: Use an ArrayCollection instead of Array as the dataProvider for a view component whose data changes. This might solve your update problems. If implementing an ArrayCollection doesn't completely solve your update problems, add the necessary logic to a dragDrop or dragComplete event handler. I get a runtime error every time I drag an item from adg to adgFlat. Here's Adobe's take on Using Drag and Drop . Specifically check out the last page titled "Moving and copying data". Good luck to you.
