While molf's answer is good, it did not solve my specific problem as there were some instances where other models needed to call User#home_url , and so there would be a lot of methods I'd have to update in order to pass along the domain. Instead, I took inspiration from his last paragraph and added a base_domain variable to my app's config class, which is the set in a before_filter in ApplicationController : module App class And thus, when I need to get the domain in a model, I can just use App.base_domain .
