I think while autoencoder is good for compressing non-linear data, it does jot guarantee linearly independent variables in the latent representation space. This means there can still be some redundancy in the latent space, and a PCA step can shave away some of that redundancy. I guess linear independance could be added into the cost function of the autoencoder (perhaps by squaring the correlation coefficients between all the variables and adding that value to the cost function), which might make the PCA step unnecessary...
