Inverting diff() and BoxCox() in R

i'm doing a project with a non-stationary time series. i used BoxCox trasformation and differences to make it stationary selling_boxcox and i've made this ARIMA model: model so i made forecasts using the forecast() function selling_forecast the only problem is that i need the forecasts on the original time series. can i built a vector with the stationary series+forecasts and invert differences and BoxCox trasformation? how can i do it?
