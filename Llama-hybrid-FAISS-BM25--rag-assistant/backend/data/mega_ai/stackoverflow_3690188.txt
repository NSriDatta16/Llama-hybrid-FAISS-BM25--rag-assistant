Replacing a dropdown menu with a text menu in JavaScript

I'm trying to replace a drop down menu I have with a text field if someone chooses the "other" option. Right now in my code I have it replacing it with a paragraph element because I'm too lazy to find the exact constructor arguments for setting up a text field. However, when "other" is selected nothing happens. Does anyone know what's wrong with this? function testfunc(arg) { if(arg.value == "other") { document.thing.replaceChild(document.test, document.thing.selection) } else { alert("stuff") } } yes no other lkjsdf
