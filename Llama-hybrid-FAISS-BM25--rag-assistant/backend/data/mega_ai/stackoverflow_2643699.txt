As mentioned, django is perhaps the most stable python web application framework. To answer your points in turn: supports objective-relational mapping with caching and declarative desciption (like JPA, Hibernate etc..). Yes, see django models controls oriented user interface support - no HTML templates but something like JSF (RichFaces, Icefaces) or GWT, Vaadin, ZK. No. django templates are there but you could add some other view layer quite easily. component decomposition and dependency injection (like EJB or Spring). Not sure as I haven't used EJB. unit and integration testing. Yes, see django testing . good IDE support. Pretty good. See eclipse + pydev clustering, modularity etc (like Terracota, OSGi etc..). Don't know. there are successful applications written in it by companies like IBM, Oracle etc (I mean real business applications not Twitter). Mostly news organisations like LA Times and Washington Post. could have commercial support. There are a few like this .
