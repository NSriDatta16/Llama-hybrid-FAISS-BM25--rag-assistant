Android separate code into packages

I'm just getting into my first android application and just wondering what the convention is here? Is it more organised to separate my code into various packages? For example. com.myfirstapp.activity; com.myfirstapp.database; I was thinking of doing this as a way of organising my code with database helper files for example kept it .database package. I have just noticed that data is stored in /data/data/YOUR_PACKAGE/ does this mean that when on a device I would end up having data stored all over the place if I use different packages? If this is not right what is a better way of organising code in Eclipse much like you do in Xcode?
