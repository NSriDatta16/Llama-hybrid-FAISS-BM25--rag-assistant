What works for me is using a specific color instead of the real ability of .png to represent transparency. So, what you can do is take your background image, and paint the transparent area with a specific color (Magenta always seemed appropriate to me...). Set the image as the Form's BackgrounImage property, and set the color as the Form's TransparencyKey . No need for changes in the Control's style, and no need for BackColor. I've tryed it right now and it worked for me...
