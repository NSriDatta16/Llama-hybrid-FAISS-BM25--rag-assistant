Interpreting the neural network output in R?

I managed to create neural network of my data. But I am not so sure about the interpretation of the R output. I used following command to create neural network: > net=nnet(formula = category~iplen+date_time, size=0,skip=T,lineout=T) # weights: 3 initial value 136242.000000 final value 136242.000000 converged Then I used following command to see the output: > summary(net) a 2-0-1 network with 3 weights options were - skip-layer connections b->o i1->o i2->o 0.64 -0.46 0.15 So from the above output Can I can conclude the following diagram of neural network?: Second question is how can I know how useful this diagram is? I mean I wanted to find the category number(target variable) from the independent variables. so now how can I decide if this network really helped me to predict the category(target variable)? What is the final output or how to find that? Can I conclude the following output from the above n-network? : category= -0.46(iplen)+0.15(date_time)+0.64 Regards,
