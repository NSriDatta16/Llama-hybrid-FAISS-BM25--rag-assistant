You state that by " logit GLM [you] mean a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and a logit link function". (It would be common to refer to that as just 'logistic regression'.) It's important to note that that differs from a General Linear Model (GLM) where the $Y$ variable has been transformed (typically / primarily) to achieve conditional normality and homoscedasticity. The quote from @ŁukaszDeryło's answer to Logit transformation or beta regression for proportion data ( So in beta regression we have ${\rm logit}(E(y))$ modeled while in linear regression with logit-transformed dependent variable we have $E({\rm logit}(y))$ . These two are not the same. ) and the quote from the Rbeta vignette, Beta Regression in R , ( How should one perform a regression analysis in which the dependent variable (or response variable), $y$ , assumes values in the standard unit interval $(0, 1)$ ? The usual practice used to be to transform the data so that the transformed response, say $\tilde{y}$ , assumes values in the real line and then apply a standard linear regression analysis. A commonly used transformation is the logit, $\tilde{y} = \log(y/(1 − y)$ ). This approach, nonetheless, has shortcomings. First, the regression parameters are interpretable in terms of the mean of $\tilde{y}$ and not in terms of the mean of $y$ (given Jensen’s inequality). ) both pertain to linear models (with logit transformed $Y$ -variables), not to logistic regression. I believe that may be the source of confusion. (It is annoying that two different things are both called 'GLM'.) For what it's worth, the standard interpretation applies to both beta regression with a logit link and logistic regression (which has a logit link by definition).
