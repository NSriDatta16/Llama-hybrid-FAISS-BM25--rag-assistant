Logistic Regression Model inquiry with binary data

The short version of my model is that I have ran a logistic regression (logisticmodel Where I am stuck is understanding some theoryâ€¦ I was advised to pool data from (2015-2017) and train it against the 2018 data. But I am wondering if this model is inaccurate without considering year as a random factor. I am wondering under what conditions it makes sense or is appropriate to pool the data? I did run the model with year as a random factor, and the model worked but I was unable to determine the predicted probabilities. Perhaps limited by my R knowledge. When using 2015-2017 data and training it against 2018, is there logic to this decision? My concern would be had I of ran 2016-2018 against 2015 for example, the outcome of the core model would be different.
