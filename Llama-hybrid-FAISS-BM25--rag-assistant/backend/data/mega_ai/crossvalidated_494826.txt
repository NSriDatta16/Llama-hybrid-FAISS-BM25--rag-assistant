Here is a suggestion on how to proceed by employing your predicted probability (say 'p') of 'ultimately passing' together with the observed number of days until reaching the final outcome. Importantly, is this data consistent with a Geometric Probability Law based on p? If yes, the process is without memory, to quote Wikipedia as a source : Like its continuous analogue (the exponential distribution), the geometric distribution is memoryless. That means that if you intend to repeat an experiment until the first success, then, given that the first success has not yet occurred, the conditional probability distribution of the number of additional trials does not depend on how many failures have been observed. And as such, you should not attempt to use days_elapsed_so_far as a variable. Otherwise, however, one may be able to employ a Weibull based failure/success law, as to quote Wikipedia : the Weibull distribution gives a distribution for which the failure rate is proportional to a power of time... Note: you can still make a prediction as to the # of days required on average based on the Geometric distribution (namely, 1/p). [EDIT] Per a comment, I cite the general reference to Reliability Theory (a course I actually have the pleasure of taking). Here is an introduction courtesy of ScienceDirect , to quote: Reliability theory has grown in the last six decades into an independent discipline by drawing tools from several areas including mathematics, statistics probability theory, and actuarial science. During the course of solving its problems, reliability analysis have contributed several concepts and theorems to many other subjects. These topics have resulted in opening up new areas of investigation in several fields of scientific activity.
