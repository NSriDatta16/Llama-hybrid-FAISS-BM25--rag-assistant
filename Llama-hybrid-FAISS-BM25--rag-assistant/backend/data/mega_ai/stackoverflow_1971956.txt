The actual important question is the first part of what your question. "What kind of Issues should be thought about." Only you can really determine that, via two tools: A threat model, and a security model. A threat model is about who is trying to attack the system: Script Kiddies? Skilled Organized Crime Hackers? The evil overlord's government? A security model describes what you are trying to protect. Should anybody be able to read the data? Should you be able to detect injection of false data? First come up with a plan on what your requirements are, then look for technical solutions.
