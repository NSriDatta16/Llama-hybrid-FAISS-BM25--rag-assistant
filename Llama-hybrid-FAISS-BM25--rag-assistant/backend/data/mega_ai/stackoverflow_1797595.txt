You're going to need to figure out what the Unicode representation is for your diacritical characters. You can embed Unicode characters into a string literal with \u[unicode value in hex]; e.g. string s = "\u0159"; // Should be your character You may also need to choose a font that can represent the characters correctly: bf = BaseFont.CreateFont(...); font = new Font(bf, 12); document.Add(new Paragraph(s, font);
