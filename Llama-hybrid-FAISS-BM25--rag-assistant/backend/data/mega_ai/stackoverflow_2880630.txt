I assume the php script is on your machine and returns usefull data. The first -not very elegant solution- that pops into my mind is the following: Make sure your machine has the php commandline installed, so that you are able to run the php script from commandline. To execute a commandlinetool from C# see code for that here . The returned data now probably needs to get processed my your C# program.
