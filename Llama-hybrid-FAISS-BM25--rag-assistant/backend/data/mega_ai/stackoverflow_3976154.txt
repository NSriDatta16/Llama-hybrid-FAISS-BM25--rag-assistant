Few hints: use calendar control ( or equivalent in mvc) since it is more intuitive than row try to avoid drag & drop because it's slow if you have to do it many times try to minimalize click number needed to do a task. For examample when user select 5-2 term type and click in calendar to mark date when workdays starts this term should be assigned as default so user dont have to choose it again when want to mark another date as starting of 5-2 period. use list with checkboxs to allow selecting many users
