My overall question: Why isn't logistic regression (including "family = "binomial") producing results as expected, but a "NOT-logistic" regression (not including "family = "binomial") does? You get different results as the linear models minimizes $$ \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \eta_i)^2 $$ whereas the logistic regression minimizes: $$ \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i \log(\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\eta_i)}) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\eta_i)}) $$ where $$ \eta_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 UV_1 + \beta_2 UV_2 $$ There is no reason the results should be the same. But why does the correlation influence the results of the logistic regression and not the results of the "not-logistic" regression? It is going to affect both. I presume you also see lower Std. Error s in the linear model. This is an issue with multicollinearity though you might not call this multicollinearity when you only have two variables with correlation $.56$.
