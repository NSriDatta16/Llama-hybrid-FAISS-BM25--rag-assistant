Like Time-To-Event analysis, but looking at the timing of events that do or do not happen on a binary outcome

I have a problem where every observation has a binary outcome that occurs at the end of a fixed period, and the predictor variables describe a few types of event that either happen on some day within that period or do not happen at all. For example: Outcome Days Until First Phone Call Days Unit Second Phone Call TRUE 3 14 FALSE 25 63 FALSE 16 NA Of course I can convert the predictor columns to binary and use logistic regression to see if the events occurring at all has a relationship with the outcome. Is there technique to model the effect of the timing of the events as well? This seems like a subset of survival analysis, but so far my research has not uncovered a technique that is well defined and fits this problem.
