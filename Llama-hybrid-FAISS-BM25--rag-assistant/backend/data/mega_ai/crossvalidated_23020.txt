For the lasso penalty this corresponds to a double exponential prior - so long as you are taking the posterior mode as your estimate. If you constraint the betas to be positive then you have an exponential prior. The parameter of the exponential distribution $\lambda$ has a correspondence with your $C$ in that you can choose a value of each such that the same naximum is achieved. The bayesian prior is the langrangian form (on log scale) of the constraint. For the ridge penalty constraning the parameter to be positive is just a truncated normal distribution.
