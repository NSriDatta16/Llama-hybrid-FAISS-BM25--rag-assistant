The way to do it is to use the MSDN library to look things up. Then take a little time to look around what you found. That's especially important with the pure API documentation. For instance, I just browsed to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlreader.aspx (note how that URL is formed). When I look in the Contents pane on the left, I see everything from XmlDocument (and XmlDocumentFragment) all the way down to XmlReader. In the middle are some things I rarely or never use, like XmlNamespaceScope and XmlNodeOrder . From time to time, spend a little time on "abstract knowledge". Sometimes, it's good to look up from the trees to learn your way around the forest. You never know when you'll need something you've learned to get you out of the woods.
