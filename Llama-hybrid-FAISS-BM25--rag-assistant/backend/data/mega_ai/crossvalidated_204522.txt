Combining transition operators in MCMC

Many MCMC papers usually present a new single transition operator (or a family thereof) such as different proposals for Metropolis-Hastings, new forms of slice sampling, etc. I am interested in derivative-free methods; no Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or variants thereof. The rule of thumb I heard of is that often you get improvement in mixing of the chains by combining several transition operators. The choice of a good set of operators is a problem of discrete and continuous hyper-parameter tuning which is often done off-line (e.g., at the end of burn-in, or from preliminary runs). You could also use some online adaptive methods, if you take great care (see this post ), but that's another point. Is there any work (article, thesis, book) that specifically analyses performance of MCMC with combinations of transition operators, and/or discusses how to pick a good set? (beyond the fact that the set needs to produce and ergodic operator) I am interested both in the single-state and multi-state(*) cases. (*) I am using the terminology of Section 30.6 of MacKay's book : In a multi-state method, multiple parameter vectors $\textbf{x}$ are maintained; they evolve individually under moves such as Metropolis and Gibbs; there are also interactions among the vectors.
