This problem seems to be due to the culture settings the Dev Storage is using. If you take a look at TableRow table inside the Dev Storage db, the data is stored as XML, and decimal values use the dot as decimal separator. Here in Brazil the dot is the thousands separator. I edited the data directly in the Dev Storage db, changing the dot to a comma (PT-BR decimal separator), and the value was read ok. That's odd, because if the value is read ok when we use the PT-BR decimal separator, it seems Dev Storage is using my current culture setting. But why the culture is not applied on saving the data? PS: Changing the windows locale to EN-US solved the problem. I guess that's why this is the only post I could find about it.
