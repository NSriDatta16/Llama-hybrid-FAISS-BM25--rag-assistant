jQuery change hash (fragment identifier) while scrolling down page

I'm building a one pager website. Eg. every page (5 in total) is on one big page with the main menu fixed at the top. When you click on a menu link it slides you down to that pages anchor tag and the clicked menu item get a "active" CSS class. What I'd like to do now is allow the user to scroll themself but still have the menu "active" item and URL hash change as they do. So my question basically is how do I know when the user has scrolled down to a different page so I can update the menu and URL hash (fragment identifier). Thanks
