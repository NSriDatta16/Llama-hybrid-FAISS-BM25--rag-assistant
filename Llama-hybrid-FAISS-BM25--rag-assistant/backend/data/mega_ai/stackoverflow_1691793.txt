How do I use namespaces with Zend Framework?

Namespaces are really useful and PHP had no support for them until the recent few releases, AFAIK. When I'm using Zend Framework, I have to remember long names with underscores - like Zend_Form_Element_Button or Zend_Form_Decorator_HtmlTag and so on. If I use namespaces, this might be possible, and so much easier: namespace Zend { class something { // ... } } namespace Zend\Form { class something { // ... } } namespace Zend\Form\Element { class Button { // ... } } And to use it I do this: use Zend\Form\Element\Button; $btn1 = new Button(); So my question is, is it trivially possible , given the autoloader system and a lot of meta-class "black magic" that lives inside Zend Framework, to rewrite the structure of the code using namespaces , and then have more sensible class names? The problem is not the length of the class names - Eclipse/Netbeans/Aptana handle that very well, it is the irritant that long names are . Tends to get confusing after some time if some classes you use have similar parts in the names . Since ZF is open source licensed, I don't think Zend would mind a namespaced version of the code, if mere renaming and some re-organization of code can achieve that .
