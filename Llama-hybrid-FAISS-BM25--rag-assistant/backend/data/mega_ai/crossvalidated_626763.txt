On one hand, with the notations given in the exercise, you are not supposed to find $\operatorname{Var}(\|x_0\|)$ , but $E[\|x_0\|^2]$ given $x_0 \sim N(0, I_p)$ (read the second paragraph of the exercise more carefully). From what you attempted I can see you have no difficulty to show that $E[\|x_0\|^2] = p$ . On the other hand, I agree with you that the underlined sentence is ambiguous in that the distance from a randomly drawn point to origin is $\|x_0\|$ . Therefore, the underlined sentence seems to suggest $E[\|x_0\|] = \sqrt{p}$ , which is not true. In fact, since $\|x_0\| \sim \chi_p$ (i.e., the $\chi$ (not squared!) distribution) , its expectation is : \begin{align} E[\|x_0\|] = \sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{p + 1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)}. \end{align} When $p = 10$ , $E[\|x_0\|] = \sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma(5.5)}{\Gamma(5)} \approx 3.08433$ , which is strictly less than $\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623$ . Also note that the quoted standard deviation corresponds to the scale parameter $\sigma$ in the distributional form of $X$ . In the original problem statement, $\sigma$ was assumed to be $1$ . The verbal interpretation in the third paragraph would be easier to understand if at the outset the distribution of $X$ is assumed to be $N(0, \sigma^2I_p)$ . Under this condition, $E[\|x_0\|^2] = p\sigma^2$ and $E[\|x_0\|] = \sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{p + 1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)}\sigma$ still hold. Therefore, I think the author failed to connect the mathematical result in the second paragraph and the verbal interpretation in the third paragraph in a precise manner. In my opinion, the underlined sentence needs to be modified to either a randomly drawn test point is about 3.08 standard deviations from the origin or the square root of the average squared distance of a randomly drawn test point from the origin is about 3.16 standard deviations .
