Check if string is empty

I got a project in C++ which I need to edit. This is a declaration of variable: LPSTR hwndTitleValue = (LPSTR)GlobalAlloc(GPTR,(sizeof(CHAR) * hwndTitleSize)); How to check if this string is empty? I tried simply with if(hwndTitleValue == "") but it always returns false. How to check if this string is empty? EDIT I also need to check if the file is attached. Here is the code of the file: // Attachment OFSTRUCT ofstruct; HFILE hFile = OpenFile( mmsHandle->hTemporalFileName , &ofstruct , OF_READ ); DWORD hFileSize = GetFileSize( (HANDLE) hFile , NULL ); LPSTR hFileBuffer = (LPSTR)GlobalAlloc(GPTR, sizeof(CHAR) * hFileSize ); DWORD hFileSizeReaded = 0; ReadFile( (HANDLE) hFile , hFileBuffer, hFileSize, &hFileSizeReaded, NULL ); CloseHandle( (HANDLE) hFile ); How to check if hFile is empty?
