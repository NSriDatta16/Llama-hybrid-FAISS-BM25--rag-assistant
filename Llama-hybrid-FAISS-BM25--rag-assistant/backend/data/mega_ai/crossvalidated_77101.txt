What diagnostics for random effects logistic regression?

I'm wondering what checks/diagnostics you usually calculate and report if you do a random effects logistic regression. C-statistic/ROC curve Check multicollinearity? Check heteroscedasticity? McKelvey & Zalvoina R-squared ... There is a lot of information about standard logistic regression and what you should check for, but I'm missing an overview about what applies to logistic regression on panel data. Thanks
