Can jQuery perform a compound select against the top level only? (a.k.a. "How to avoid chaining children")

Basically, is there a way to write a.children('.outer').children('.inner') without the intermediate selector? I can't write $('.outer > .inner', a) because I don't want to do full-depth search against a â€” I know that the .outer elements are immediate children of a . It's partly a matter of "elegance", but partly because I'm trying to avoid "throwaway" element sets. Yes, jQuery may in effect do the same thing, but it has a better chance of optimizing (at least in theory), when it knows the full query's intent.
