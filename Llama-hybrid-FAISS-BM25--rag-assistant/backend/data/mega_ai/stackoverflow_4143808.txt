I'd say that if you're taking the MAX() on an identity/auto-increment column, then you're doing something wrong. As @astander says, it's not behaviour I've observed under SQL Server. You should treat such identifiers as opaque - that they happen to be structured as an integer is a mere convenience to you, with well known storage requirements, clustering behaviours, etc.
