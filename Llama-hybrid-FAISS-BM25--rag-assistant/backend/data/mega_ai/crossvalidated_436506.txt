Sample statistics with 1 less data point

If I define the sample mean as $$\displaystyle {\it Mean}\, = \,{\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{{i}}}{n}}$$ and then exclude one data point, say $y$ , then the new average becomes as follows: $$\displaystyle {\frac {{\it Mean}\,n-y}{n-1}}$$ How are the formulas for the sample variance and the sample central moment?
