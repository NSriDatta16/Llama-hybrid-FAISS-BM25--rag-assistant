Have you considered using T4 templates for performing the code generation? It looks like it's getting much more publicity and attention now and more support in VS2010. This tutorial seems database centric but it may give you some pointers: http://www.olegsych.com/2008/09/t4-tutorial-creatating-your-first-code-generator/ in addition there was a recent Hanselminutes on T4 here: http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=170 . Edit: Another great place is the T4 tag here on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/t4 EDIT: (By asker, new developments) As of VS2012, T4 now supports reflection over an active project in a single step. This means you can make a change to your code, and the compiled output of the T4 template will reflect the newest version, without requiring you to perform a second reflect/build step. With this capability, I'm marking this as the accepted answer.
