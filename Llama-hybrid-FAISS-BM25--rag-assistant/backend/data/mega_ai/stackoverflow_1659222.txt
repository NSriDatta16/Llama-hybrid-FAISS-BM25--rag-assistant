If I recall correctly it's simply because some older browsers had problems with a self-closing tag without a space before the slash. I doubt it's an issue nowadays, but a lot of developers (myself included) got into the habit of including the space. Edit: Ah, here we are: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines Include a space before the trailing / and > of empty elements, e.g. , and . Also, use the minimized tag syntax for empty elements, e.g. , as the alternative syntax allowed by XML gives uncertain results in many existing user agents.
