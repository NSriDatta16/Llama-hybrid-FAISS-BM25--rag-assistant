Can unbalanced classes introduce bias in a Random Forest model?

I am working on a classification problem using Random Forest. The training set has 600 instances and 16 attributes. The final class is an Yes/No answer. The ratio of " Yes " to " No " in the training set is around 5. Is it true (as I was told) that such a disparity (a lot more " Yes " than " No ") can introduce a bias while predicting the class of an unknown instance using this model?
