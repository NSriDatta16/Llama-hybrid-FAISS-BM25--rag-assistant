I actually had to look into a similar issue a couple of years ago. When i began the project i had no idea where to begin, so hopefully i can save you an anyone else in the same situation, some time. Bottom line is that you can take advantage of a large amount of work done in other fields. The most important of these fields, i found, is Domain Name Registration. For instance, the Site DomainTools has a ' Domain Typo Generator ', which works by generating a list of typo domain names, based on a parent domain name that your enter. Given that professional domain name owners (aks squatters ) account for a large portion of any Registrar's business, it's easy to see who this tool is intended for (i.e., squatters are interested in acquiring common typos of high-traffic domain names--even a 2% error rate for a high-traffic domain name is a lot of traffic to a typo domain name. In addition, i would recommend the remarkably comprehensive 2005 Study of this issue by Microsoft Research. Finally, there's a key concept in computational linguistics derived from the Levenshtein Distance , called Damerau-Levenshtein distance , which extends the basic Levenshtein's basic idea of edit distance to the particular problem of humans typing on a keyboard. The principal conclusion from his 1964 research paper was that 80% of all typos can be described by one of just four operations --insertion, deletion, substitution of a single character, or transposition of two characters. Damerau not only distinguished these four edit operations but also stated that they correspond to more than 80% of all human misspellings. (The only link i supplied for D-L is the Wikipedia article; i did so because i think this is an exellent and brief introduction plus it contains pseudo-code for the D-L algorithm, and finally the article provides links the primary online sources for D-L.
