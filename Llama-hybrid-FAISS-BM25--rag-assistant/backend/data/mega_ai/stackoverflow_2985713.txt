multiple droppable

I've have multiple droppable divs (which all have the same size) and one draggable div. The draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable. When I drag the draggable div on the droppables divs I want to find which droppable has been affected. My code looks like this: $(function () { $(".draggable").draggable({ drag: function (event, ui) { } }); $(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { alert(this.id); } }); }); the html drop in me1! drop in me2! drop in me2! drop in me2! drop in me2! drop in me2! drop in me2! drop in me2! Drag But my alert only shows the first which my draggable div (Div0) hits, how can I find the missing (Div1 and Div2), which also is affeckted?? Here's a guy with the same problem : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/drop-onto-multiple-droppable-elements-at-once
