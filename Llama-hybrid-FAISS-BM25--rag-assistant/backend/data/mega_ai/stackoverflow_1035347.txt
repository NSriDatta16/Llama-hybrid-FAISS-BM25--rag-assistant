Turns out there is an easier solution. With the help of Robert and the links he provided, this solution works fine: $(function() { $("#left-col").sortable({ handle: '.item h2', connectWith: '#right-col' }).disableSelection(); $("#right-col").sortable({ handle: '.item h2', connectWith: '#left-col' }).disableSelection(); }); As stated earlier, with sortable, I could sort each item within its respected column, but it couldn't be "dropped" over the the opposite column. With the connectWith attribute on the sortable plugin, you can specify another sortable object that you want to be able to sort with. Thanks for all the help.
