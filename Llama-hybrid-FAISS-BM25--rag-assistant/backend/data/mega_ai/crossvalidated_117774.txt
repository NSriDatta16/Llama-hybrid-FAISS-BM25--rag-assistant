Let's do this by arithmetic: Subtract $1$ from the value and range, and work with $7.1/8$. That is the same as $3.55/4$. Add $1$ back in and you have $4.55$. There is a strong assumption in there about how people would have answered had the scale been different, which you make and are responsible for and which the arithmetic doesn't guarantee. If you want the algebra, then $(\text{new} - 1)/4 = (\text{old} - 1)/8$ so shuffling it all around $\text{new} = 0.5\ (1 + \text{old})$ which checks at $0.5\ (1 + 8.1) = 4.55$. Geometrically, think about the conversion as given by a line connecting $(1,1)$ and $(9,5)$. It often helps to check with extreme cases. Clearly the average can't go below $1$ in both cases, or above $5$ or $9$, depending on the upper limit. So, any conversion must respect those extremes.
