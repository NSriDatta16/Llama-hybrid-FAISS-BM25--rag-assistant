CruiseControl [.Net] vs TeamCity for continuous integration?

I would like to ask you which automated build environment you consider better, based on practical experience. I'm planning to do some .Net and some Java development, so I would like to have a tool that supports both these platforms. I've been reading around and found out about CruiseControl.NET , used on stackoverflow development, and TeamCity with its support for build agents on different OS-platforms and based on different programming languages. So, if you have some practical experience on both of those, which one do you prefer and why? Currently, I'm mostly interested in the ease of use and management of the tool, much less in the fact that CC is open source, and TC is a subject to licensing at some point when you have much projects to run (because, I need it for a small amount of projects). Also, if there is some other tool that meets the above-mentioned and you believe it's worth a recommendation - feel free to include it in the discussion.
