BPTT vs Vanishing Gradient Problem

I know that BPTT is the method to apply Back Propagation on RNN. Which is works fine with RNN as it stops at certain point as changes approach to zero but isn't it the exact Vanishing Gradient Problem? if it is the same then Why does it have 2 names, one is a problem and one is a method. if not then what am I missing here, what is the difference between them?
