I don't really understand this, but see here : Structural equation models and Bayesian networks appear so intimately connected that it could be easy to forget the differences. The structural equation model is an algebraic object. As long as the causal graph remains acyclic, algebraic manipulations are interpreted as interventions on the causal system. The Bayesian network is a generative statistical model representing a class of joint probability distributions, and, as such, does not support algebraic manipulations. However, the symbolic representation of its Markov factorization is an algebraic object, essentially equivalent to the structural equation model.
