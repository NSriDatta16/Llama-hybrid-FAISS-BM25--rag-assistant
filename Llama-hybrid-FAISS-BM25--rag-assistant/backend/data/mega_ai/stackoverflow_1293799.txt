Asp.net mvc paging mechanism

is there some elegant way, ideally with jquery plugin like pager 1 or pager 2 how to implement paging with asp.net mvc? I am trying to go over partial views, but so far unsucessfully. Where should I store the loaded grid data? And how to respond on the page selection with just a partial refresh? Thanks in advance.
