Adding a child entity to parent entityset

Wondering if there is a good way(generic method which is) that can dynamically add child entity to appropriate entity set of a parent. Right now I have to do something like this, and it's not very elegant: public int AppendChild (PATIENT patient, T child) where T : EntityBase switch (typeof(T).Name) { case "EYE_EXAM": patient.EYE_EXAMS.Add((EYE_EXAM)child); break; case "LEGS_EXAM": patient.LEGS_EXAMS.Add(LEGS_EXAM)child); break; //etc, a very long list of possible types goes here } Is there better way to do this? Thanks for answers
