The W3C produces a specification that describes the behavior that browsers (user agents) should follow for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Most browser vendors implement the JavaScript language so that it follows this specification. The code you've described above, where the onload property is defined, is implemented in the native JavaScript packaged with the browser. Each browser vendor implements something that quite possibly works a little differently under the hood, but the end result is usually the same. You could very well follow this same pattern for your Foo object. However, the only way I know to do this natively is by binding the onchange event to a DOM element. The src property on the Image is the property of a DOM element. Your Foo class would also need to bind the value to a DOM element if you were to take advantage of the onchange event. However, there may be other ways of firing events when a property is changed (as opposed to calling a method that could set a property and also invoke other functionality.)
