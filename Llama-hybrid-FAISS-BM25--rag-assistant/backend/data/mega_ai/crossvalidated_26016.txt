Sample size for logistic regression?

I want to make a logistic model from my survey data. It is a small survey of four residential colonies in which only 154 respondents were interviewed. My dependent variable is "satisfactory transition to work". I found that, of the 154 respondents, 73 said that they have satisfactorily transitioned to work, while the rest did not. So the dependent variable is binary in nature and I decided to use logistic regression. I have seven independent variables (three continuous and four nominal). One guideline suggest that there should be 10 cases for each predictor / independent variable (Agresti, 2007). Based on this guideline I feel that it is OK to run logistic regression. Am I right? If not please let me know how to decide the number of independent variables?
