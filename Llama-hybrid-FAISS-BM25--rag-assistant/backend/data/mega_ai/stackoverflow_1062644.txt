While F# is certainly more suitable than C# for this kind of application since there're going to be several algorithms which F# allows you to express in a very concise and elegant way, you should consider the difference between functional, OO, and logic programming. In fact, porting from F# will most likely require you to use a solver (or implement your own) and that might take you some time to get used to. Otherwise you should consider making a library with your prolog code and access it from .NET (see more about interop at this page and remember that everything you can access from C# you can also access from F#).
