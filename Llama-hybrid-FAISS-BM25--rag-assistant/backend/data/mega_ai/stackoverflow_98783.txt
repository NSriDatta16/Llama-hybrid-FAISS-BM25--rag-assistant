Storage is cheap, why limit the password length. Even if you're encrypting the password as opposed to just hashing it a 64 character string isn't going to take much more than a 6 character string to encrypt. Chances are the bank system is overlaying an older system so they were only able to allow a certain amount of space for the password.
