What is the difference between MDA and LDA and how is it applied in SciKit-learn?

According to this paper , Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) is basically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA). I am assuming that MDA is just Multiclass LDA. My work uses SciKit-Learn's LDA extensively. According to its description, it is A classifier with a linear decision boundary, generated by fitting class conditional densities to the data and using Bayesâ€™ rule. It applies pretty well to cases with multiple classes; can this implementation be also called as MDA? So to do CDA in Scikit-Learn, should one just apply PCA followed by LDA?
