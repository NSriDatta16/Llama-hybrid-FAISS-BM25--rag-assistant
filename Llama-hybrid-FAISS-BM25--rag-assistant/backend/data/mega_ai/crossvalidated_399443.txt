Determine the smallest number in your time series , say -10. for example . The constant you would need is then 10.0000000001 or larger in order to make all the adjusted values positive. It doesn't make make any difference as the reverse transformation needed to obtain forecasts will use the same adjustment factor. Please see https://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/lista/pdfm9cJKUmFZp.pdf where Box & Cox suggested an alternative to deal with negative numbers without adding a constant . EDITED after OP's question re logs ... From the above reference ...perhaps this helps ... ..logs are used
