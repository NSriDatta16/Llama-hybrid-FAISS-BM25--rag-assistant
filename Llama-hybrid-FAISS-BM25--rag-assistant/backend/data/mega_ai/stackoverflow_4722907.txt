Why are rollbacks needed?

Why are rollbacks so important? Is it to prevent data (like data in a SQL DB) from being in an inconsistent state? If so, how comes the data "store" (the SQL DB or whatever) made it possible in the first place to become in a corrupt state? Are there data storage mechanisms that don't have a need for "rollbacks"?
