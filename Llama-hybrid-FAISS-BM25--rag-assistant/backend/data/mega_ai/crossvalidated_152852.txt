Estimation of a VECM model

I am attending a time series econometrics course and I am working on VECM models. We have learnt that to estimate a VECM model we should use Engle-Granger two-step procedure but I have not understood why checking for the significance of the adjustment parameter to study cointegration among the two time series. Engle-Granger representation theorem said that if there exist a well represented VECM model of two series, the two are cointegrated; so why checking after have estimated the model?
