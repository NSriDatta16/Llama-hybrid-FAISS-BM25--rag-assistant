Copy updates from external project to custom fork in subversion

I currently am customizing an open-source forum to suit an organisation I do volunteer work for. The forum creators just released an update and I would like to merge it into my trunk. My current directory structure has just the standard, plus an additional directory /dependencies/ svn:externals as "external_project http://svn.url/branches/from/external/project/version " so that there is a directory /dependencies/external_project I copied the project to the trunk a while ago and started modifiing. I would like to merge the changes from the update to my trunk. I've tried copying the files without subversion, commiting and merging from the previous reversion. This works fine for the files in the trunk, but doesn't work for the subdirectories subclipse shows them as external. Two- or three-way merging gives the error "http://svn.url/branches/from/external/project/version" location does not correspond with "http://my.server/repo/" location What is the correct way to do this?
