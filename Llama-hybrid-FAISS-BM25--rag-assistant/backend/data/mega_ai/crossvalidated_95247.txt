Logistic regression vs. LDA as two-class classifiers

I am trying to wrap my head around the statistical difference between Linear discriminant analysis and Logistic regression . Is my understanding right that, for a two class classification problem, LDA predicts two normal density functions (one for each class) that creates a linear boundary where they intersect, whereas logistic regression only predicts the log-odd function between the two classes, which creates a boundary but does not assume density functions for each class?
