I used to think this idea "human beings can naturally and automatically find P(.|D) in their brains" was silly until I found this paper - figure 5 in the 2010 paper by Stigler given here Periods in history of statistics Very simple physical machines can do fully valid Bayesian analyses - so maybe our brains can too. Bitwise'a answer may be more direct for your feild of interest but almost anyone should be able to understand figure 5 ( maybe not people under 12 years of age ). Below is an adaption of that figure I used in a talk, but it would be better to read the paper. This quote from Pearl might also be helpful Because this was the only biologically feasible way we could explain how the human brain deals with uncertainty, say when we read English text or cross a street. My colleagues at that time could not have cared less how humans do things, as long as the algorithm was efficient and correct. But as things turned out, it was this biologically inspired algorithm, called “belief propagation,” that scaled up (as an approximation) in practical applications ... from http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2012/11/01/pearl/
