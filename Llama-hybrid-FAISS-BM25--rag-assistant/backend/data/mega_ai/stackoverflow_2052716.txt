Seriously, reuse an existing solution. Why the hell are you even thinking rolling your own? Now, 1. I don't understand your question as being about embedding a container. 2. You mentioned long polling several time. So I'd suggest to use GlassFish v3 / Grizzly (because there are many samples, e.g. have a look at the Dead Simple Comet Example on Glassfish v3 / Grizzly ). If you don't want to rely on the way a container implemented Comet support, use atmosphere and any of the container mentioned on the web site: Atmosphere is a POJO based framework using Inversion of Control (IoC) to bring push/ Comet to the masses! Finally a framework which can run on any Java based Web Server, including Google App Engine , Tomcat , Jetty , GlassFish , Weblogic , Grizzly , JBossWeb and JBoss , Resin , etc. without having to wait for Servlet 3.0 Async support or without the needs to learn how Comet support has been differently implemented by all those Containers. If this is not a concern, just stick with the suggested option (GlassFish v3 / Grizzly). For a concrete and recent comparison between Comet server implementation, checkout this awesome Comet Maturity comparison grid view (source: Comet Gazing: Maturity ). It might help you to make your final choice... or not :)
