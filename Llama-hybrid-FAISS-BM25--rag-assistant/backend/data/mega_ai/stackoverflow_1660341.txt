With version 5 is HTML now an application interface opposed to just a markup language? Yes. If so then what are the boundaries and defined limits of the technology? Mostly a self-imposed rule of not taking any major new features anymore. When do the boundaries of a markup language end and the application preferences of a user-agent application begin? It's blurry. Is this Stack Overflow page a document or an application? With HTML5 that separation does not appear very clear, but as an industry standard it should be crystal clear, right? The spec is clear in its operational requirements. It doesn't need to be clear in defining a distinction between documents and applications.
