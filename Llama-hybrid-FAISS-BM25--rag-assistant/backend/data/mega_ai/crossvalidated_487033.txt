Which theory explains this estimation problem?

We have a bag with 100 balls, each labeled 1 to 100. Each ball has a color. 10 are green, 20 are red, 20 are yellow, and 50 are blue. Now someone continuously draws balls from the bag, telling you only the color of the ball, not the label. Each time he draws a ball, he places it back into the bag again, such that he always draws from a bag of 100 balls. Now after 50 draws, the only thing you know is the number of balls of each color that was drawn. How do you estimate the average number of times that the same ball was drawn, and which theory would you use? E.g. if 3 balls were drawn, and their numbers were 7, 49 and 7, then the average number of times would be 1.5, as 7 was drawn twice and 49 was drawn once. The tricky part is that you cannot assume that the person that draws the balls does so at random. I am looking for a solution for any configuration of the system, the concrete number of balls and colors are just to make the problem easier to understand. (Sorry for the click-baity title, I honestly have no clue how to properly summarize the problem)
