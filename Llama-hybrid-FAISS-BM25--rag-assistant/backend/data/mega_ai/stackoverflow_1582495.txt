Persist a Hyperlink's Style after mouse has moved away

Is it possible to persist the look of a 'hovered' hyperlink even after the mouse has moved away from it? I want to keep the user's attention on the hyperlink -- or at least have them able to see what it was, standing out from the rest of the text -- for a few seconds after they've left it. Ideally it would fade slowly back to normal. Anyone know how to do this?
