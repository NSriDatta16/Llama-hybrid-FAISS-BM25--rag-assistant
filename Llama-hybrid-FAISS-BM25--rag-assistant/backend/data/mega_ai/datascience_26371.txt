Which machine learning technique to predict student passing based on standardized tests?

I have data on various standardized tests that certain students took and whether or not they ended up passing a specific class in college. Using the pass/fail as the dependent variable and the different scores on the test for the independent variables, I would like to figure out a feature that best predicts the students success in that class; i.e., Student gets these scores on these tests hence the probability that they pass is so and so. Logistic regression is my first instinct but I was wondering if there are other, possibly better, ways to approach this problem.
