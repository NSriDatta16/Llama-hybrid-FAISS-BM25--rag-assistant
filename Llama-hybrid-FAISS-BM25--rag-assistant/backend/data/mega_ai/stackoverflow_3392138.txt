DataContractSerializer and its issues - search for better serializer

We've already established previously that DCS serializes/deserializes objects alphabetically. However, after further investigation I've discoverred this is not entirely true. If we have a structure like this: [DataContract] public class Content { [DataMember] public string Title; [DataMember] public string Slug; [DataMember] public string Description; } [DataContract] public class TextContent : Content { [DataMember] public string Text; } and have an object of type TextContent to serialize, DCS will do this: desc some-slug content title some content So as you can see, the property from the inheriting class is attached to the end of the serialized XML fragment even though it should be before Title. DCS doesn't go over the combined properties and reorder them. I've noticed this when I was manually adding Text element in front of Title element and deserialization just didn't want to work. That's why I performed a serialization of a new object and figured this out. My questions are: This can't be common knowledge?? Anyone else noticed this? Anyone knows of a better serializer (all I ever find if I search for it is the old XmlSerializer and DCS) because this issue with DCS's ordering is extremely annoying? I know we can use the Order attribute but that only enables us to align with one external XML source. What if we have three, four or more third party XML providers which all generate perfectly valid XML but our app is nitpicking about elements order (because of DCS)?
