Initial steps with logistic regression

I have a dichotomous variable which I am trying to predict. In order to do this I have about 2000 variables out of which 1100 are continuous variables (real values between 0.0 and 1.0) and the rest are categorical variable (0 or 1). I am a total newbie and would like to know how to go about it. I am not aware of the relationships between these variables. Roughly the following are the steps that I am planning to take: Should I try to use correlation analysis between each variable and the target variable? Should I try some kind of clustering and remove some outliers and try to come up with a model. What other steps should I take to identify relationships between variables and come up with a model? Thanks
