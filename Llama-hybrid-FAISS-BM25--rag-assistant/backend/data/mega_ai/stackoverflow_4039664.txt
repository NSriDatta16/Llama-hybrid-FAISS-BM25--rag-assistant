Trackball Rotation in OpenGL

I am having trouble implementing a trackball rotation on OpenGL. When I rotate my cube using the trackball rotation 90 degrees to the right along the X axis (dragging mouse left to right on screen) and then try rotating it dragging my mouse from the top to the bottom of the screen, I expect the cube to rotate along my perspective's y-axis. Instead it rotates along ITS y-axis after rotation, rotating sideways from my perspective. Can someone show me what I may be doing wrong?
