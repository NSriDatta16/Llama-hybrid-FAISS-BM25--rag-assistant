Show estimate converges to percentile through order statistics

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{3n}$ be a sequence of iid random variables sampled from an alpha stable distribution , with parameters $\alpha = 1.5, \; \beta = 0, \; c = 1.0, \; \mu = 1.0$. Now consider the sequence $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_{n}$, where $Y_{j+1} = X_{3j+1}X_{3j+2}X_{3j+3} - 1$, for $j=0, \ldots, n-1$. I want to estimate the $0.01-$percentile. My idea is to perform sort of a Monte-Carlo simulation: l = 1; while(l } Calling the mean of all the sample $0.01-$percentiles computed to be $\hat{\mu}_n$ and their variance $\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{n}$, to compute the appropriate confidence interval for $\mu$, I resort to the Strong form of the Central Limit Theorem : Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of iid random variables with $E \left[ X_i \right] = \mu$ and $0 and Slutksy's theorem to conclude that $$ \sqrt{n} \frac{\hat{\mu}_n - \mu}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{n}}} \overset{n \rightarrow \infty} \longrightarrow N(0,1).$$ Then a $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$-confidence interval for $\mu$ is $$ I_{\alpha} = \left[\hat{\mu}_n - z_{1- \alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{n}}{n}} , \hat{\mu}_n + z_{1- \alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{n}}{n}} \right], $$ where $z_{1- \alpha / 2}$ is the $(1- \alpha / 2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Questions: 1) Is my approach correct? How can I justify the application of the CLT? I mean, how can I show that the variance is finite? (Do I have to look at the variance of $Y_j$? Because I don't think it is finite...) 2) How can I show that the average of all the sample $0.01-$percentiles computed converges to the true value of the $0.01-$percentile? (I should use order statistics but I'm unsure on how to procceed; references are appreciated.)
