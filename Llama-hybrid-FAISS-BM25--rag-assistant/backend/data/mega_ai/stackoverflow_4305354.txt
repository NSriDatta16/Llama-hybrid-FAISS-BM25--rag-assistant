It all depends on which kind of board representation you choose. The one you have choses is simple to start with but you run into issues of performance very quickly. So yes, you will need to write some tedious amounts of code. It could help you to generate this code instead of writing it out by hand. On the other hand, you might be interested in other representations. For example, bitboards are the state of the art and will (correctly implemented) give tremendous speed-ups. Note that the amount of code might still be massive, and certainly a lot more complex. Here's an introduction by Robert Hyatt (author of Crafty) that you might find interesting: boardrep . Good luck!
