SWF files are going to be fairly small unless they have extra library items that they don't need in the fla they were exported from. They are also zipped (in most cases) so I wouldn't worry about the files themselves. My company serve maybe 100k SWFs a day and do it on 3 web servers running IIS behind a load balancer. The CPU on those servers never goes very high (less than 10% for sure). We use one shared storage device to serve all the files from over SMB. It works rather well.
