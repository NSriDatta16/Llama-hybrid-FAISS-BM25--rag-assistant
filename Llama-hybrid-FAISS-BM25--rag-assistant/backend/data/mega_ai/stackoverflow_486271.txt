dragover mouse event contain file info in XUL application using javascript

I'm writing a XUL application using JavaScript for the coding. I would like to be able to drag files onto a control in this application and, when dropped, have them show up. This seems like it would be almost exactly like the tutorial here , but when I break in the drag and drop event handlers in a debugger, the dataTransfer member of the event isn't there! How should I be doing this? Thanks, Nathan
