Rewriting the packages isn't an option for larger scale companies where they have thousands of packages. I was dealing with a customer the other day that received a quote for more than $500k to convert their packages and 2 years and a staff of 8. No one can wait that long to proceed with their migration project. The DTS xChange tool by Pragmatic Works will automate 90% of the migration for you. The tool has migrated more than 200K packages at this point and comes with an additional tool to help with ActiveX Script Tasks.
