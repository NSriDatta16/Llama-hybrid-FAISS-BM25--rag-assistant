Can training data be extracted or recovered from random forest models?

I'm currently working on a random forest classifier which is trained on sensitive data. I haven't been able to find specific answers to the following questions: Can someone with access to the machine learning model extract individual sample data points from it? In particular I'm using the R package ranger . In case the raw data is not accessible, can the training data points be recovered from the decision trees, and if, with how high accuracy? To elaborate, the adversary would have access to the entire model, not just the API and predictions.
