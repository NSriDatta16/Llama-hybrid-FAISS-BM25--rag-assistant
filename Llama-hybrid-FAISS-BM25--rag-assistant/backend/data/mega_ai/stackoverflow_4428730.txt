Creating Custom Overlay on the map

I am trying to replicate this feature of Maps in Android: You can see that on the map, there's a Circle depicting the range that the user has selected. In my application, I'll also want a dragger to reside on the perimeter of the circle, which can be dragged to redefine radius. If someone could tell me how to draw custom drawable overlays and 2D graphics over map, I can do other things on my own. Thanks! The full application can be reached at this link
