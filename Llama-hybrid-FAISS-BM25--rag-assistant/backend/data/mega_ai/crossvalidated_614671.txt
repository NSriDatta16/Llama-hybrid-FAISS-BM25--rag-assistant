rnn , gru and lstm are all common choices for modeling sequential data using neural networks. If you have 150 songs, and you want to measure how well your model generalizes to new songs, you hold out some portion (you mentioned 20%) of the 150 songs. Sequences of different lengths can be padded and masked. There are standard methods to do this in widely-used NN libraries (Tensorflow, Torch, etc.). An example is TORCH.NN.UTILS.RNN.PACK_PADDED_SEQUENCE .
