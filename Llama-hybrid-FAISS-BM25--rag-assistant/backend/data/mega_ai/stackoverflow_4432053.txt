I can't tell you about the technical stuff, but what I can tell you is: don't use a splash screen. Directly from the Human Interface Guidelines : Supply a launch image to improve user experience; avoid using it as an opportunity to provide: • An “application entry experience,” such as a splash screen ... Because users are likely to switch among applications frequently, you should make every effort to cut launch time to a minimum, and you should design a launch image that downplays the experience rather than drawing attention to it.
