Get span Id's of selected text using getSelected()

I have a weird problem. I donâ€™t quite know how to approach it. We have an application that spits out paragraphs of text with each and every word wrapped in a span with an ID. I am being asked to make a JavaScript to capture the ID's of all the words that a user highlights. So a simple example of a paragraph is below. that quake briefly triggering another tsunami I know there is a way to capture the selected text using something like this:(found this at site http://motyar.blogspot.com/2010/02/get-user-selected-text-with-jquery-and.html ) function getSelected() { if(window.getSelection) { return window.getSelection(); } else if(document.getSelection) { return document.getSelection(); } else { var selection = document.selection && document.selection.createRange(); if(selection.text) { return selection.text; } return false; } return false; } How would i get the id's of those spans though?
