Most modern compilers support #pragma once , but YMMV. Try it in your compiler (I'm guessing since you use emacs that it's gcc, which has supported it for quite some time now, at least as of version 2.95, probably earlier.) Visual Studio definitely supports it too, I'd imagine it was MS that started the convention.
