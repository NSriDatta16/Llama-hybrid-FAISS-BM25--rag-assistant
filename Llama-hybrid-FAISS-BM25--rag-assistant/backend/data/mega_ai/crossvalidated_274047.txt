ATT vs ATE in propensity score matching when using DiD estimates

According to Lee and Little 2017 , when using propensity score (PS) methods, weighting on odds will generate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), while using subclassification and weighting by the inverse probability of treatment (IPTW) will result in the effect being measured on the Average Treatment Effect on the entire sample (ATE). I believe that Difference-in-Difference (DiD) estimation will generate an ATT. My questions are: Does the above rule hold true when using PS methods with DiD? What will the effect measure be when weighing by IPTW in the context of DiD? ATT or ATE?
