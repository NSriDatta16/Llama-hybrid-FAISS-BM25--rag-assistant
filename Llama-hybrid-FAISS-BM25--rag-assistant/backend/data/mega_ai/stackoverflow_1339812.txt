Resources on mesh networks

Does anyone have any pointers to good resources concerning mesh networks? Maybe I'm not even using the correct terminology. I need to write an app that has multiple agents on various machines, and each agent must have knowledge of and be able to communicate with others. A type of P2P application perhaps? I'm really looking for some architecture-level stuff to get me started on the planning.
