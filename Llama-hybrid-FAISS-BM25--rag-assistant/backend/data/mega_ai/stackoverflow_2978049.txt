Fix formatting of aspx file in Visual Studio?

I have a file with a lot of this kind of thing in it: Company Organization: How can I get the formatter to change it to shows like this: Company Organization: What I have tried: I opened Tools->Options then browsed to Text Editor. I got a list of Languages. I selected HTML because that is the language that controls formatting for aspx files. I changed "tag wrapping" to not have "Wrap tags when exceeding specified length" checked. I then pressed ctrl+k, ctrl+d (Format the document). This did not fix the problem. What I don't want to have to do: Edit the file manually to fix all the tags. Any ideas?
