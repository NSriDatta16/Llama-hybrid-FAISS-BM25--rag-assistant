(1) In contexts where the likelihood function is intractable (at least numerically), the use of the Bayesian approach, by means of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), has gained ground over some frequentist competitors such as composite likelihoods ( 1 , 2 ) or the empirical likelihood because it tends to be easier to implement (not necessarily correct). Due to this, the use of ABC has become popular in areas where it is common to come across intractable likelihoods such as biology , genetics , and ecology . Here, we could mention an ocean of examples. Some examples of intractable likelihoods are Superposed processes. Cox and Smith (1954) proposed a model in the context of neurophysiology which consists of $N$ superposed point processes. For example consider the times between the electrical pulses observed at some part of the brain that were emited by several neurones during a certain period. This sample contains non iid observations which makes difficult to construct the corresponding likelihood, complicating the estimation of the corresponding parameters. A (partial)frequentist solution was recently proposed in this paper . The implementation of the ABC approach has also been recently studied and it can be found here . Population genetics is another example of models leading to intractable likelihoods. In this case the intractability has a different nature: the likelihood is expressed in terms of a multidimensional integral (sometimes of dimension $1000+$) which would take a couple of decades just to evaluate it at a single point. This area is probably ABC's headquarters.
