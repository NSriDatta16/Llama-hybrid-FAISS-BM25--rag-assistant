The closest approximation to perfectly syncing them, as far as I figure, is this. Partial Solution: Master: Send the play message with a timestamp to clients. Clients: When the play message is received, respond with an acknowledgment . Read the timestamp, calculate how long the message took to arrive, and delay starting the playback by that time difference. Master: When the acknowledgment message is received, play immediately. The problem is that you'll still have multiple acknowledgments, so if the average deviation in round-trip-time to is too high, you'll still have a large de-synchronization. One solution for this might be to keep track of some kind of smoothed round-trip-time estimator for each client. Alternative Solution: Master: When you send a play message, send a start time (the highest round-trip-time among all clients) for the clients to begin playback, and should schedule playback for the provided time. Clients: When the play message is received, they should schedule playback for the provided time.
