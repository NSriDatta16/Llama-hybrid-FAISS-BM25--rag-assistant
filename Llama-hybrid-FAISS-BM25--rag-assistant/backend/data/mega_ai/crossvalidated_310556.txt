Your picture is correct and can be used. On the other hand, there is another perspective that can be used. Consider it as a hyper matrix with the following dimensions: Input objects. Scalar/Vector/tensor(picture)/sequence. Output objects. Scalar/Vector/tensor(picture)/sequence. Objective. Implicit/quality of representation (e.g. likelihood or KL divergence )/prediction error/immediate reward/long term reward. Prior knowledge. Not considered/implicit/explicit(Bayesian prior) Learning mechanisms. Random search/evolutionary algorithms/gradient descent/expectation minimization/variations Bayesian. All these dimensions can be used for the categorisation of any algorithm. For example you can consider regression picture to scalar if you want to estimate age from photo.
