I agree with Gartner about the importance of statics. However, if your data science minor courses focus on economics, I would re-evaluate going through with it. Instead, I would switch to a computer science minor, or use up your electives to take programming courses. As a person who did applied math and stats, I felt that my programming knowledge was really deficient when it came to handling real life huge, messy data sets. All my program required was two Java courses, so I ended up having to spend an inordinate amount of time learning more about scripting, useful programming languages, etc.
