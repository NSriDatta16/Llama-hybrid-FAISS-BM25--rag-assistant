nsive production outages Need to protect industrial know-how (contained also in the control files for the industrial automation gear) Lack of adequate skill-sets to expedite the transition towards Industry 4.0 Low top management commitment Insufficient qualification of employees Country applications Many countries have set up institutional mechanisms to foster the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. For example, Australia Australia has a Digital Transformation Agency (est. 2015) and the Prime Minister's Industry 4.0 Taskforce (est. 2016), which promotes collaboration with industry groups in Germany and the USA. Brazil Brazil's embrace of Industry 4.0 technologies has been a slow and inconsistent process. Initial assessments clearly indicated a considerable gap in digital preparedness among the nation's industrial businesses. A significant survey, conducted by the National Confederation of Industry, revealed concerning statistics: 42% of Brazilian companies were completely unaware of how crucial digital technologies are for industrial competitiveness. Furthermore, a substantial 46% either weren't utilizing these technologies or were unsure about their application. These findings collectively underscored a widespread lack of awareness and readiness for digital transformation across the Brazilian industrial landscape. Germany The term "Industrie 4.0", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originated in 2011 from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government and specifically relates to that project policy, rather than a wider notion of a Fourth Industrial Revolution of 4IR, which promotes the computerisation of manufacturing. The term "Industrie 4.0" was publicly introduced in the same year at the Hannover Fair. German professor Wolfgang Wahlster is sometimes called the inventor of the "Industry 4.0" term. In October 2012, the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government. The workgroup members and partners are recognised as the founding fathers and driving force behind Industry 4.0. On 8 April 2013 at the Hannover Fair, the final report of the Working Group Industry 4.0 was presented. This working group was headed by Siegfried Dais, of Robert Bosch GmbH, and Henning Kagermann, of the German Academy of Science and Engineering. As Industry 4.0 principles have been applied by companies, they have sometimes been rebranded. For example, the aerospace parts manufacturer Meggitt PLC has branded its own Industry 4.0 research project M4. The discussion of how the shift to Industry 4.0–and especially digitisation–will affect the labour market is being discussed in Germany under the topic of Work 4.0. The federal government in Germany is a leader in the development of the I4.0 policy through its ministries of the German federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and BMWi. Through the publishing of set objectives and goals for enterprises to achieve, the German federal government attempts to set the direction of the digital transformation. However, there is a gap between German enterprise's collaboration and knowledge of these set policies. The biggest challenge SMEs in Germany are currently facing regarding digital transformation of their manufacturing processes is ensuring that there is a concrete IT and application landscape to support further digital transformation efforts. The characteristics of the German government's Industry 4.0 strategy involve the strong customisation of products under the conditions of highly flexible (mass-) production. The required automation technology is improved by the introduction of methods of self-optimization, self-configuration, self-diagnosis, cognition and intelligent support of workers in their increasingly complex work. The largest project in Industry 4.0 as of July 2013 is the BMBF leading-edge cluster "Intelligent Technical Systems Ostwestfalen-Lippe (its OWL)". Another major project is the BMBF proje
