The comparison may be using the Float object rather than the built-in float type because of the inherent issues with floating point comparison . Because of the way that floating point numbers are stored on a computer system occasionally the equality comparison between two floating point numbers throws up false negatives. The compareTo from Float may take this into account. The original author possibly at least thought it did. You can also write your own floating point comparison algorithm that checks for a difference within a reasonable standard deviation for your system. You can also use the method used by equals in Float, which looks at the integer value of the floating point bits for each number. Note that using Float in and of itself doesn't fix this problem, as the problem is a round-off error in storage.
