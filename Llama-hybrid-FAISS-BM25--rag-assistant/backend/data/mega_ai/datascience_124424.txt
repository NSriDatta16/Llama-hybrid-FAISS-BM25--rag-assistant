Outliers problem

everyone hope you all are good. I have a hard time with outliers First i found some outliers in train set then i capped them and did the same with test set. So when i checked my rsme root mean squarred error was high but when i capped train set outlier and did not capped test set outliers then my rsme was decresed . I donot know what should i do should i cappe both train and test set outliers or i should only cape the train set outlier and donot do anything with test set outliers Please i am new to data science if you guys please help me
