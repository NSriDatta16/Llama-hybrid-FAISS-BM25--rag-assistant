Are Deep Neural Networks limited to grayscale images depending on whether you use Seq. or Func. API?

When I say DNN, I mean the simple usage of densely connected neurons (not CNN). Say we are using Keras (with Tensorflow backend), the input_dim, using the Sequential API, can only take an integer or None value which restricts it to taking grayscale images right? However since the functional API can accept dimensions that aren't just restricted to integers I would assume that it can take RGB images as opposed to only grayscale images? If anyone can confirm or support, that would be great?
