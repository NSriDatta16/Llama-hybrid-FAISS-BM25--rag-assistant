You don't actually have to use a recurrent network, but rather try to ensure the range and scale of what you're feeding the network is optimal. Thus, you might look at detrending by inputting the deltas of the x's and the y (energy usage) between each time point. Also, look into use of a moving average over time because if the data are noisy, it won't help the function approximation. It's not really the type of ANN you use as much as it is getting the appropriate range and scale of inputs to work.
