Is it possible to devise a model which uses all the 4500 features and gives 100% accuracy Not necessarily. As an extreme example, suppose all 1,000 observations have the same feature vector. In that case, all any model can do is predict the same class for every observation, so it would be 50% accurate. I'm sure your data isn't that bad, but it comes to show that whether you can achieve 100% accuracy on training data depends on the feature vectors. and then remove out unimportant features one by one till I get an accuracy of 85% (i.e. moving from a completely overfit model to a more generalized one with 85% accuracy)? This is unlikely to be a good method to maximize predictive accuracy in new data. Certainly, if you have 85% accuracy in the training data, you can expect to get lower accuracy with new data. I would suggest instead conventional feature-selection or regularization methods, such as logistic regression with a lasso penalty.
