iphone app sporadically hangs for a few seconds

When I run my Iphone app on my Ipod touch, it runs fine most of the time. But every so often, it will hang for a short while -- anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds. After the hang, it resumes running normally. The strange thing is that to all appearances, the app's demands on the system should be fairly steady. It is doing a lot of dragging stuff around with calls to TouchesMoved. But it drags a maximum of two labels at a time. How might I go about tracking down such a problem?
