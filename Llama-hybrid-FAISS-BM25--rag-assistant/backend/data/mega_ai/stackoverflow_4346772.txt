Ever wonder why prices on some sites don't show up until you add to cart? Now you know; as others have said understand the Terms of Service of any site you want to pull data from. That's really why many sites have those sorts of policies is preventing people from screen scraping. So to answer your question from a technical perspective, with Java, you probably want to set this up as a Daemon thread - that is a process that can run in the background repeatedly. This would probably make periodic HTTP requests to some API (or screen scrape). What's important is to understand the API or as you suggest use an HTML parsing library. If you end up going the latter route, I encourage the use of one that can produce an XML document so you can execute xpath queries against it to get the data you want.
