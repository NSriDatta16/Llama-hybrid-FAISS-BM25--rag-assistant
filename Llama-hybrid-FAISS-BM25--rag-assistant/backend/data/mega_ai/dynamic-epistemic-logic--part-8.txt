nal) announcement that says that neither knows they are dirty (an announcement can express facts about the situation as well as epistemic facts about the knowledge held by the agents). We then update similarly the model by suppressing the worlds which do not satisfy the content of the announcement, or equivalently by keeping the worlds which do satisfy the announcement. This update process thus yields the pointed epistemic model represented below. By interpreting this model, we get that A and B both know that they are dirty, which seems to contradict the content of the announcement. However, if we assume that A and B are both perfect reasoners and that this is common knowledge among them, then this inference makes perfect sense. Public announcement logic (PAL): We present the syntax and semantic of Public Announcement Logic (PAL), which combines features of epistemic logic and propositional dynamic logic. We define the language L P A L {\displaystyle {{\mathcal {L}}_{PAL}}} inductively by the following grammar in BNF: L P A L : ϕ ::= p ∣ ¬ ϕ ∣ ( ϕ ∧ ϕ ) ∣ K j ϕ ∣ [ ϕ ! ] ϕ {\displaystyle {{\mathcal {L}}_{PAL}}:\phi ~~::=~~p~\mid ~\neg \phi ~\mid ~(\phi \land \phi )~\mid ~K_{j}\phi ~\mid ~[\phi !]\phi } where j ∈ A G T S {\displaystyle j\in AGTS} . The language L P A L {\displaystyle {{\mathcal {L}}_{PAL}}} is interpreted over epistemic models. The truth conditions for the connectives of the epistemic language are the same as in epistemic logic (see above). The truth condition for the new dynamic action modality [ ψ ! ] ϕ {\displaystyle [\psi !]\phi } is defined as follows: where M ψ := ( W ψ , R 1 ψ , … , R n ψ , I ψ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}^{\psi }:=(W^{\psi },R_{1}^{\psi },\ldots ,R_{n}^{\psi },I^{\psi })} with W ψ := { w ∈ W ; M , w ⊨ ψ } {\displaystyle W^{\psi }:=\{w\in W;{\mathcal {M}},w\models \psi \}} , R j ψ := R j ∩ ( W ψ × W ψ ) {\displaystyle R_{j}^{\psi }:=R_{j}\cap (W^{\psi }\times W^{\psi })} for all j ∈ { 1 , … , n } {\displaystyle j\in \{1,\ldots ,n\}} and I ψ ( w ) := I ( w ) ~for~all~ w ∈ W ψ {\displaystyle I^{\psi }(w):=I(w){\textrm {~for~all~}}w\in W^{\psi }} . The formula [ ψ ! ] ϕ {\displaystyle [\psi !]\phi } intuitively means that after a truthful announcement of ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } holds. A public announcement of a proposition ψ {\displaystyle \psi } changes the current epistemic model like in the figure below. The proof system H P A L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{PAL}} defined below is sound and strongly complete for L P A L {\displaystyle {{\mathcal {L}}_{PAL}}} w.r.t. the class of all pointed epistemic models. The axioms Red 1 - Red 4 are called reduction axioms because they allow to reduce any formula of L P A L {\displaystyle {{\mathcal {L}}_{PAL}}} to a provably equivalent formula of L E L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{EL}} in H P A L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{PAL}} . The formula [ q ! ] K q {\displaystyle [q!]Kq} is a theorem provable in H P A L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{PAL}} . It states that after a public announcement of q {\displaystyle q} , the agent knows that q {\displaystyle q} holds. PAL is decidable, its model checking problem is solvable in polynomial time and its satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. Muddy children puzzle formalized with PAL: Here are some of the statements that hold in the muddy children puzzle formalized in PAL. N , s ⊨ p ∧ q {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}},s\models p\land q} 'In the initial situation, A is dirty and B is dirty'. N , s ⊨ ( ¬ K A p ∧ ¬ K A ¬ p ) ∧ ( ¬ K B q ∧ ¬ K B ¬ q ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}},s\models (\neg K_{A}p\land \neg K_{A}\neg p)\land (\neg K_{B}q\land \neg K_{B}\neg q)} 'In the initial situation, A does not know whether he is dirty and B neither'. N , s ⊨ [ p ∨ q ! ] ( K A ( p ∨ q ) ∧ K B ( p ∨ q ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}},s\models [p\vee q!](K_{A}(p\vee q)\land K_{B}(p\vee q))} 'After the public announcement that at least one of the children A and B is dirty, both of them k
