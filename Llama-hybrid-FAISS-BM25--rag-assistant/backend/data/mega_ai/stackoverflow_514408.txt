HTML was actually developed to deliver physics papers. You can still see it in some of the old meta tags. At any rate the difference is web programming is stateless and thick client development is not. As you have adeptly indicated, its all driven by events. True javascript has mucked up web development a bit by creating the illusion of a stateful enviornment but in the end everything comes down to simple HTML. Its never too late to start learning, I would say start making some static HTML pages and move your way up to an MVC Framework, I suggest Microsoft MVC Framework. Its pretty fantastic, there are others you could use like ASP.Net Webforms but you won't learn anything by dragging and dropping things onto a designer ;).
