I would concurr with TFD's answer about keeping track of a timestamp in an separate file/table and then fetching all rows newer than that. That's how I do it for a similar application. Your application querying a single row table (or file) to see if a timestamp has changed from the local storage should not be much of a performance hit. Then, fetching new rows from the 300k row table based on timestamp should again be fine, assuming timestamp is properly indexed. However, reading your question I was curious if Mysql triggers can do system calls, say a php script that would do some heavy lifting. Turns out they can by using the sys_exec() User-Defined Function . You could use this to do all sorts of processing by passing into it the inserted row data, essentially having an instant notification of inserts. Finally, a word of caution about using triggers to call external applications.
