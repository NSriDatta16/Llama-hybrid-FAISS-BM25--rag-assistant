I am not an expert on the field, but I believe the paper "On the use of cross-validation for time series predictor evaluation" by Christoph Bergmeir can help answer your question. It basically addresses the question of whether the use of specialized evaluation techniques for time series provide an advantage to take care of dependencies and time-evolving effects that may occur. They do not provide a strong theoretical background but performed several experiments and basically concluded that no practical problems with standard cross-validation could be found. However, they suggest the use of blocked cross-validation, together with an adequate control for stationarity, since it makes full use of all available information both for training and testing, thus yielding a robust error estimate.
