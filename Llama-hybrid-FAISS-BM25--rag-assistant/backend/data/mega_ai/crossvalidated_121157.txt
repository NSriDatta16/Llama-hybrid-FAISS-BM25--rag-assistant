The problem with Gaussian processes regression is that Maximum Likelihood estimate for hyperparameters of covariance function can be bad: with this estimate we get true values as prediction for training points, bot we get constant value (equals mean) as prediction for other points. I solved this problem using Bayesian regularization for hyperparameters: we impose a prior distribution on hyperparameters, and use MAP (Max of posterior distribution) as estimate. If you want to solve a specific problem - this approach will work for sure; if you try to build a general-purpose package - you have to be careful.
