Sure: h2.interviewer + p { color: red; } I'm not entirely sure how to do it with multiple paragraphs though. Perhaps if you encased the entire set of paragraphs in a div : Alice: [00:00:00] Is it ok if I ask you a question now? More text here. class="interviewee">Bob: [00:00:03] Sure go ahead. You could then do this: h2.interviewer + div { color: red; }
