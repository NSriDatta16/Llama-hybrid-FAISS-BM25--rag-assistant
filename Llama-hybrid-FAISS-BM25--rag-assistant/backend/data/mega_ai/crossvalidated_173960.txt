Granger causality test in VAR framework: small sample

I am using Granger Causality Test in VAR framework to test the causal relationship between renewable energy consumption, gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon dioxide emissions in one country using annual data from 1982-2012. As I couldn't find data related to renewable energy for that specific country before 1982, I was wondering whether 30 years of time series data is good enough to do such a test?
