Why are errors correlated in the reduced-form VAR? If the error covariance matrix were restricted to be diagonal in the reduced form, the model would be too restrictive to adequately represent most of real-world time series. You could specify such a restricted model, but the assumption of diagonal covariance matrix would often be violated in practice. Why are errors uncorrelated in the structural VAR? Structural VAR with contemporaneous effects and uncorrelated errors is another representation of the same reduced-form VAR model. For convenience of interpretation, the structural representation is defined by absence of error correlation. Other representations with contemporaneous effects but correlated errors are possible but are less interesting.
