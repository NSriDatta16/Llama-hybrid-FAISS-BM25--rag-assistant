Do recommendation systems necessarily use machine learning algorithms?

I am studying about evaluation of both recommendation systems and machine learning algorithms in recent times, trying to define a scope for my masters research. After some reading time I'm starting to understand several concepts, but one thing was not clear to me: Do recommendation systems necessarily use machine learning algorithms? I mean, I know these two can be used combined, but in most of the papers I read about recommender systems evaluation, they do not even mention anything about Machine Learning. Also, if you can suggest some papers that I can read, I would be very grateful
