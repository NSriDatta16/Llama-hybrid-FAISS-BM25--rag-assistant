DAL: Is it ok to incapsulate several data sources access in one module?

Application I develop requires several data sources (2 RDBMS and one file storage) to operate. I'm going to incapsulate datasources with DAL library & Business Logic layer. Would you personally create several DAL libraries (each per data source) and cooperate several DAL instances in Business Logic Layer or create monolith DAL library, that incapsulates all datasources application uses?
