Welcome to SE:DataScience. Here [6. 2.7 5.1 1.6] is the feature of the input instance which is classified wrongly. It is one row from your input feature X = iris.data . The message means: your SVM use the input feature [6. 2.7 5.1 1.6] to predict a label, and it predicts label=2 . The ground truth is label=1 . If you want to print the indices of rows that are classified wrongly, you can use for row_index, (input, prediction, label) in enumerate(zip (X_test, svm_predictions, y_test)): if prediction != label: print('Row', row_index, 'has been classified as ', prediction, 'and should be ', label)
