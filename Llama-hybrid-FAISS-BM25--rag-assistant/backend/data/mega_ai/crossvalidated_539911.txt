To graphically represent it you could just plot each line for each variable so y vs x1 with the regression line for x1 and so on, any basic regression plots just using your regularized coefficients. However , if you want to do traditional inference with p-values and all that then that is generally considered not a good route to go because we are biasing our estimates. You could just go full bayesian and set a normal prior to get a ridge and then look at the posterior since bayesian analysis is still coherent in that setup.
