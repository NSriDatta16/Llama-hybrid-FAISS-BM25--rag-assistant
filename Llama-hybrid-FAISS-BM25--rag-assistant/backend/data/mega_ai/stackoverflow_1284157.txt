In javascript: navigator.platform gives you a general idea (win32 for example). navigator.userAgent can be parsed with this regex: /^[^\(]*\((.*)]\)/ to give you what's in the first set of parentheses. This typically is split up into more sub-sections, for example: "Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3pre" Zytrax maintains a wonderful list of useragents. in PHP: browser.php parses the user agent into the OS, Browser, and Browser version: http://apptools.com/phptools/browser/source.php Keep in mind though that no matter how you detect it, it can be faked.
