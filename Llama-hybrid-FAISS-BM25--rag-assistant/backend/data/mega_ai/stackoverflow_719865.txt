Short answer is yes a defrag would help. Clustered indexes try to organize the index such that only sequential reads will be required. This is great if the .MDF is contiguous on disk. Not so much if the file is spread out all over the disk. Also even though SQL allocates in 8K blocks having to move the disk head all over the place leads to much slower access times. You really want the file contiguous.
