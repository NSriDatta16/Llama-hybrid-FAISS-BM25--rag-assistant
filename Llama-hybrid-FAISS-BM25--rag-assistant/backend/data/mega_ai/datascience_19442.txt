Human face attractiveness estimation

Needed for dating portal. I currently use OpenFace to extract features with DNN. (I don't know whether they have a usable meaning) Then compare them to some model faces' features using euclidian distance and rate according to these values. Result is below satisfactory. I'm thinking about SVM, but I need to distinguish between a few levels (rank 1-5). OneVsAll? Not sure if I need 5 classifiers just to get the measure of similarity. Any ideas. What have been tried: Extracted features for a set of model faces (photos chosen by me from google); extracted features from a test set and sort photos according to average (or minimum) euclidian distance to these model features; Visual estimation: many from those which are in top 10's are noticeably not similar (and not attractive) compared to a model set Labeled test set (according to my taste) as 1 and 0 classes (70 and 1640 samples) and CV set (14 and 194). Extracted features, trained RBF SVM, performed parameter search.
