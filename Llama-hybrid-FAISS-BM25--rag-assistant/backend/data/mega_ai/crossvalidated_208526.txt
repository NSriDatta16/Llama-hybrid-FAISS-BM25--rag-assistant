Is every ARIMA(1,1,0) model equivalent to an AR(2) model?

Assume I have a time series $ x_t $ that I want to fit using an ARIMA(1,1,0) model of the form: $ \Delta x_t = \alpha \Delta x_{t-1} + w_t $ This could be rewritten as: $ x_t - x_{t-1} = \alpha ( x_{t-1} - x_{t-2} )+ w_t $ $ x_t = ( 1 + \alpha)x_{t-1} - \alpha x_{t-2} + w_t $ The last equation describes an AR(2) model with coefficients $1+\alpha$ and $-\alpha$. I recognize that, depending on $\alpha$, this AR(2) model might be non-stationary. However, if I was taking a diff to begin with, then the series I am modeling shouldn't be stationary. I know that if the model is non-stationary, a diff should be used. But how would the results differ if I used a AR(2) model vs an ARIMA(1,1,0) model? I assume (as hinted by R) that it has an issue with convergence. However, when I ask R to perform the fits, it will do both of them, and the coefficients are (mostly) consistent with my observations above. The forecasts are definitely different, though. If anyone could shed some light on this, or point me to a good reference, I would appreciate it. Here is the R code I used to generate both models. > set.seed(2) > x plot(x) > arima(x, order=c(1,1,0)) Call: arima(x = x, order = c(1, 1, 0)) Coefficients: ar1 0.3291 s.e. 0.0298 sigma^2 estimated as 1.03: log likelihood = -1433.91, aic = 2871.81 > arima(x, order=c(2,0,0)) Call: arima(x = x, order = c(2, 0, 0)) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 intercept 1.3290 -0.3294 50.9803 s.e. 0.0298 0.0299 35.9741 sigma^2 estimated as 1.03: log likelihood = -1438.93, aic = 2885.86 Warning messages: 1: In log(s2) : NaNs produced 2: In log(s2) : NaNs produced 3: In log(s2) : NaNs produced 4: In arima(x, order = c(2, 0, 0)) : possible convergence problem: optim gave code = 1
