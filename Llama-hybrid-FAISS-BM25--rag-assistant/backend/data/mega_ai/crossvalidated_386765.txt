Regression or classification in neural networks

Given a simple data set to train with neural networks where i.e.: wine quality is the categorical output and measurements of acidity, sugar, etc. are the numerical inputs. The output can be written as a number i.e.: 1-10 and treat the problem as a regression model, or encode the output in 10 different columns with 1 or 0 for each corresponding quality level - and therefore treat the problem as a classification model. Sample data: What is the right answer? How to determine how to approach problems like this?
