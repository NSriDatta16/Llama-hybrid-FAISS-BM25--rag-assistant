SQLite is probably a pretty safe bet. However, if performance is really important for your application and you do not need a relational database, I would suggest you take a look at Berkeley DB link text . Berkeley DB is not a relational database though. In other words, if your data is grouped in different tables and you constantly need to query result sets that require relating data from more than one table, you probably need a relational database. Berkeley DB is better suited for something like look up tables (i.e., the data is organized in a few tables and you don't need to query data from more than one of them in order to produce the result sets you want). Berkeley DB is very fast but it will require more work on your end in order to get the most out of it.
