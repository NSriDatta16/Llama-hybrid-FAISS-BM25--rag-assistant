Java Stanford NLP: Part of Speech labels?

The Stanford NLP, demo'd here , gives an output like this: Colorless/JJ green/JJ ideas/NNS sleep/VBP furiously/RB ./. What do the Part of Speech tags mean? I am unable to find an official list. Is it Stanford's own system, or are they using universal tags? (What is JJ , for instance?) Also, when I am iterating through the sentences, looking for nouns, for instance, I end up doing something like checking to see if the tag .contains('N') . This feels pretty weak. Is there a better way to programmatically search for a certain part of speech?
