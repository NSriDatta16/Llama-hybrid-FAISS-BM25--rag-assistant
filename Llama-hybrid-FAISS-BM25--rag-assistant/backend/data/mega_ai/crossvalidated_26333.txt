Plain old linear regression has a nice non-parametric interpretation as the average linear trend across all pairs of observations; see Berman 1988, "A theorem of Jacobi and its generalization". So, the data doesn't have to look linear in order to use it; any (broadly) monotonic trend could be summarized this way. You could also use the Spearman rank correlation... and probably much else besides.
