Proving a non-stopping time

Let me begin by first confirming that this is indeed the correct place to post this (other ideas I had were math.SE). That said, Let $X_n$ be a Markov chain on the state space $\mathcal S$ and for $ y \in \mathcal S$ let $T_y = \min\{ n \ge 1 : X_n =y\}$ be the first return time to $y$. Let $W_y = T_y - 1$ be the time just before the first return to $y$ Explain why $W_y$ is not a stopping time Show that the Strong Markov Property does not apply to $X_n$ at random time $W_y$. My Work When showing that $W_y$ is not a stopping time, is it sufficient to write $$W_y = \bigcap_{i = 1}^{n-1} \{X_i \ne y\} \cap X_n = y$$ and claim that since $X_n$ does not belong to the set $\{X_0, X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}\}$, we have that $W_y$ is not a stopping time? Then, for showing that the Strong Markov Property does not apply, can I write $$\mathbf{P}(X_n = y \mid W_y = n-1, X_{n-1} = i, X_{n-2} = x_{n-2}, \dots, X_0 = y) = 1 \ne p(i, y)$$ where $p(i,y)$ is the one step transition probability from $i$ to $y$?
