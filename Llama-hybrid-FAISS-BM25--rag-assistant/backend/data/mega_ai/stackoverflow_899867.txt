"Process documentation should be minimal, real-time and current." What do yo mean by "minimal"? Is it in the sense of say sum of the number of pages or in the sense of coverage (v.gr. standards doc, configuration management manual, design doc). When you assume a project where there is no turnover in the team - and in long projects this is not a reasonable assumption, you need an efficient mechanism for knowledge transfer, and the most efficient mechanism for knowledge transfer is documentation. I have seen projects where documentation is kept minimal (in the sense of number of pages) because it is too cumbersome to develop the documentation. But if you can re-use documentation from one project to another with no changes or minimal changes (and this is reasonable for documents like programming standards, configuration management manual) there is no documentation development burden. Process documentation should cover all of the software development process or you will risk to have processes with steps that are executed in an inconsisten way. Agile teams have agile software processes. And by software development processes I mean clear mechanisms for managing code, controlling versions, controlling reviews, checking in code, fixing bugs, etc.
