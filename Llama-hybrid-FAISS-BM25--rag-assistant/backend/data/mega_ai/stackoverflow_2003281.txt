Basic PHP MySQL array grouping question

Quick question, which I think has a very easy solution for someone who has anything above the most rudimentary knowledge of PHP/MySQL as I do. I have a list of cities in a variety of states stored in a database with city, state and some other variables. Right now they get pulled as a list sorted by city name: Anchorage, AK Baltimore, MD Chicago, IL etc etc. I want to be able to group by state first, then list all the cities that have that state value. So it'd look like: AK Anchorage Juneau CA Los Angeles San Diego San Francisco etc etc I know I need to do some sort of foreach and have searched online, but haven't found an example that I can get to work. Here's what I have to pull the basic list: $list = mysql_query("SELECT id, alphaname, state FROM regional ORDER BY alphaname",$db); while ($thearray = mysql_fetch_array($list)) { echo " $thearray[alphaname], $thearray[state] "; } The only real way I know how to do it would be to run a query for each state which would be a pain and totally stupid... Thanks for any help! Update - solved. I went with rockacola's approach though i-g's worked as well.
