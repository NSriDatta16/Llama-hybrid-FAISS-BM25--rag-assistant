First of all, this has nothing to do with Bayesian approach. In frequentist approach if you observed only a single value, then estimating the expected value from it would also yield a biased result. The same with Bayesian approach. The key point in here is estimating the uncertainty of such estimate, e.g. confidence intervals in frequentist setting, or highest density intervals in Bayesian setting. In each case you would learn that based on a single data point, the point estimate you got is very uncertain and in most cases the interval estimates would (should!) tell you that given your data, the the true expected value "can be literally anything" with high probability. There is no competing intuitions in here, statistics enable you to find point estimate, but they also help you with assessing how trustworthy is your estimate, and given only a single data point, they will not be very trustworthy.
