SQL Server tempdb optimization tips for a new server?

I am planning a fresh installation of SQL Server 2005 on a new machine, which I have to order. I know that tempdb tuning is very important to the overall performance of the SQL Server instance. I've read that it's best practice to create as many tempdb files as you have CPU's (or cores?). Is that correct? Are there any other recommendations, e.g. for harddisk/RAID setup configuration I should pay attention to? Thanks!
