Sample C++ tests

I'm about to take a C++ test. But I only get one crack at it to get over 85%. If I don't push over that, then I don't get the job. The problem with these tests are that they typically target generic C++, and depending on what libraries you use your definition of generic may differ. STL and Boost may seem logical to some (and should be part of most) but I worked with MFC for years before ever using templates. Why use >vector> when you've got access to CArray? (retorical question) If you've worked with dialogs you've not used stdio . If you've worked with Borland products you've not used MFC. If you've worked with Palm, you've not used the file system, and you've definitely not used CFile . OK, so here's the question... Given that I'd like to pass the 85%, I'm taking online tests of "generic" C++. So... Is there a place I could go to find tests? The more the better. Correct answers are also good, either during or after the test. As long as I can learn from my mistakes. EDIT: If your answer doesn't have a link to a test, some C++ questions, or some interview questions... You missed the point of Is there a place I could go to find tests? Great example.. I've just found this question. What does the following code fragment print? cout I've been coding for 9 years. And never used cout , setw or setfill once. Not since university.
