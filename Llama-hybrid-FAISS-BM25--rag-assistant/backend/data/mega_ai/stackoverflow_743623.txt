Are there reasons to choose Eclipse Link/Toplink... over Hibernate? In O/R mapper developer land (where I live ;)) it's a common fact that Toplink is considered to be the most feature complete and best O/R mapper out there. It has its weaknesses, but its vast number of features makes it something that's hard to beat. As it's now open source and free, I'd give it a try. iBatis is not really an O/R mapper, it is more of a class filler/persister through hard-coded SQL. So you've to do the heavy lifting and have to write all queries. iBatis is useful when you're using a database with stored procs and have to utilize these procs for DML/set retrieval.
