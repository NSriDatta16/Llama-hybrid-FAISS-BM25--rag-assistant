I think there is 2 ways to do it. Dimensionality reduction Using technique such as PCA , you can represent your data in lower number of dimensions. This is a good approach if you want to represent all your data in one graph. Dimension removal Another way to visualize is simply to visualize only a few dimensions at a time. For example you can visualize a/b , c/d , a/c in 3 different 2D graphs. While much simpler, this approach does not allow you to have a single graph visualization.
