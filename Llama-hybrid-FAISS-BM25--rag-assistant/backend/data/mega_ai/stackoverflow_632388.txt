I just realized that that my requirement was actually to circumvent the audit trail in SharePoint so I sure hope that it can't be done :-) I came up with another solution: I added a new user or group field to the announcement list, and copy the AD-user logon into this field. Any report or view that previously used the "created by" field should now use the new field. How about the situation where a real user enters a new element in the announcement list then? That will not update the new field with the logged in user! Well, the only solution I could come up with is to add a ListItem Add trigger on the list. When a new element is added I check whether the new field contains a value, is not then I update the new field with the ID of the logged in user. That way the new field should always contain a valid userID. I know this is not an elegant solution, but for the time being it is the best I can think of.
