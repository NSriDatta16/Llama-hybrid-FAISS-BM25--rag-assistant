varchar cannot hold Unicode characters, so n in varchar(n) means both number of characters and number of bytes. In case of nvarchar(n) the n means the number of Unicode characters, with storage size of two times n bytes. If you query information_schema.columns , there will be, among others, two columns of particular interest: CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH and CHARACTER_OCTET_LENGTH . The former holds the number of characters, and the latter contains the number of bytes.
