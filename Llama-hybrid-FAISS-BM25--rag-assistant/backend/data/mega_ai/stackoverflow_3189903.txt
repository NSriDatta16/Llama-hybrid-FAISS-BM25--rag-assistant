What one can get into trouble doing often comes down to what "they" can convince a judge. It's certainly possible that a company can see such an act as a genuine attack (the wrong person in the company gets the wrong idea and yells loud enough about it) and seek some kind of damages from you. Just remember that "being right" or "being reasonable" or "making sense" don't really mean much in the US legal system (assuming US here). That said, as a developer I absolutely encourage vulnerability testing and reporting back to the developer for the product being tested. But, unfortunately, you should tread carefully.
