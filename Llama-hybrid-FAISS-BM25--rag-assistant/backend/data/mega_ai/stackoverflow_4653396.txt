How do I prevent the browser from jumping to an anchor when the URL's fragment identifier is changed to it?

Possible Duplicate: Modifying document.location.hash without page scrolling I'd like to cancel the event, if possible, but I don't see any precedent for this. Assume for the moment that I'm constrained to using the same string for both my fragment identifier and the name of my anchor. I need to intercept the event and cancel it somehow. UPDATE: This is a duplicate of Modifying location.hash without page scrolling
