you will find a nice summary given by user @ttnphns here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/22520 . In particular: If you center columns (variables) of $\mathbf{A}$ , then $\mathbf{A′A}$ is the scatter (or co-scatter, if to be rigorous) matrix and $\mathbf{A′A}/(n−1)$ is the covariance matrix. If you z-standardize columns of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ (subtract the column mean and divide by the standard deviation), then $\mathbf{AA′}/(n−1)$ is the Pearson correlation matrix: correlation is covariance for standardized variables. In general you should always center your data when performing PCA. As explained here , not centering your data can give misleading results.
