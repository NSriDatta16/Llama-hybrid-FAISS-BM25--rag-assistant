Can anyone explain this paragraph of the current C++0x standard draft?

Can anyone explain this statement from ISO N3242 ยง3.2, 2nd point A member of a set of candidate functions is odr-used if it is selected by overload resolution when referred to from a potentiallyevaluated expression. [ Note: This covers calls to named functions (5.2.2), operator overloading (Clause 13),user-defined conversions (12.3.2), allocation function for placement new (5.3.4), as well as non-default initialization(8.5). ISO Standard 2003 : says An overloaded function is used if it is selected by overload resolution when referred to from a potentially-evaluated expression. [Note: this covers calls to named functions (5.2.2), operator overloading (clause 13), user-defined conversions (12.3.2), allocation function for placement new (5.3.4), as well as non-default initialization (8.5). What is the actual difference in these statements? Can any one explain this with the help of an example/program?
