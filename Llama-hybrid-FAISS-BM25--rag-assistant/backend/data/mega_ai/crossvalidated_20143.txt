Since probability is bounded by 0 and 1, any predictor that relates to the probability of winning will likely do so in an S-shaped fashion. It is easier to build a model using the logit, which gives one the chance of finding linear relationships. With that done, it's a little bit of work but not terribly hard to convert logits into probabilities associated with different combinations of predictors. I think you'd get a lot out of readings on logistic regression.
