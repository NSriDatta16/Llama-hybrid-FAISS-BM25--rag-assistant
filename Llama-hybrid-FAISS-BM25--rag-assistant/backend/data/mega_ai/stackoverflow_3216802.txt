Allowing drag and drop in a usercontrol on a web page

I'm building an application in C# to run in a browser window. I want to drag and drop files from the windows explorer into a listbox. However, when I try to pop up a dialog that contains the drop target, I get an error. Application attempted to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy. Etc. There are additional instructions to use the .NET Framework Configuration tool. I want this to run on an end-user's machine. If I download the .NET SDK and mess with the configuration, will this affect my application or the use of .NET on my own machine (useless). Is this simply an inadvisable thing to do? Should I either nix the drag and drop or build this as an application instead of a browser-based app?
