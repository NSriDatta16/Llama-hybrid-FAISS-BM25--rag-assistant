Machine learning metric: essential accuracy vs. incidental accuracy

I guess I could find the answer to my question if I knew the right Google search words. If you use a better model in a classification problem then you will get a better accuracy (if you use that metric to judge). But even the "best" model will reach a ceiling, e.g. if the data is not telling you enough about the problem. Is there a way to somehow separate the "essential accuracy" (the max accuracy the best model could achieve) from the "incidental accuracy" (the accuracy you happen to achieve due to your potentially imperfect model)? Which search terms would I have to use to learn more about this topic? Thanks! Christian
