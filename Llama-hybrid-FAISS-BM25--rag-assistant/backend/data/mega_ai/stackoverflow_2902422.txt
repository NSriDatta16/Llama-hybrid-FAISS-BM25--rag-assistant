Canonical pattern reference in Actors programming model

Is there a source, which I could use to learn some of the most used and popular practices regarding Actor-/Agent-oriented programming? My primary concern is about parallelism and distribution limited to the mentioned scheme - Actors, message passing. Should I begin with Erlang documentation or maybe there is any kind of book that describes the most important building blocks when programming Actor-oriented? (Most useful examples would be in Scala or F#)
