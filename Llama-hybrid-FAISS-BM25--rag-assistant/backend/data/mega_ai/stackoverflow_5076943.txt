Sam, just give you an idea and pointer on where to start. If what you need is somewhere between storing the whole matrix and storing the numbers one-by-one, may be you will be interested to use pickle to serialize your list, and store them in datastore for later retrieval. list is a python object, and you should be able to serialize it. http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/how-to-put-any-python-object-in-a-datastore
