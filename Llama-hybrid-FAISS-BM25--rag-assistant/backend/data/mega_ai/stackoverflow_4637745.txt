I've used Process Explorer to diagnose these issues before: start it when the message is showing, click the bullseye icon on the toolbar and hold it down, then drag over and release when the bullseye is on the target window. The process will be highlighted in the main program area. Also, check your Application event log for errors, and see if you have any services that are set for automatic startup that are not running after you close the error dialog. For what it's worth, I'd bet this issue is related to an auto-updater for some software installed on your machine. Try to identify those auto-update services (I bet McAfee has one) and disable them for a time (if that's safe.) Only disable one at a time so you can be reasonably sure which one the culprit is; be sure to enable it if it is ruled out. Best of luck!
