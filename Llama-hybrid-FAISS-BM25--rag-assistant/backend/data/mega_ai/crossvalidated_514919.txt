I believe that more precision could be added to exactly solve the problem and know what test are we talking about. But because you are talking about 1 sample mean and 1 standard deviation, I will assume a classic Z-test Statistics. You are trying to see if the average of your sample $\bar{x}$ is significantly different from $\mu$ . The "precision of your average" is given by the standard deviation expressed as: $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ . All of this can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test One can see that the more sample you add, the more your estimated variance will shrink. This in turns means a higher value for Z and thus a lower p-value, according to the following formula: $$Z = \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{(\sigma/\sqrt{n})}$$ A more intuitive way of seeing it, is that the more you draw sample, the more confident you are about the average because the smaller is standard deviation around that average. Now there will be a point, where that average is "precise enough" to be significantly different than any number $\mu$ that you were trying to compare it to. In the case you were given, the p-value would then decrease. [edit] Thanks for the precision from Sal Mangiafico : in the case where $\bar{x} =\mu$ then the p-value will remain unchanged and equal to 1
