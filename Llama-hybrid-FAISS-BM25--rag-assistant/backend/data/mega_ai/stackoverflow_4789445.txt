Here is the server side code that will locate these controls. You can take it from there... I ran into this problem when I was trying to use a wizard for a checkout sequence. I read a lot of these posts and they all have you jumping through a lot of hoops trying to find these buttons. They tell you that you have to add custom step templates, trace the control etc... The good news is that it's not nearly that difficult. You don't need to use the custom templates.. Just drag a vanilla wizard control on the page, add your steps and this code works just fine. I am using this code on a production app of mine. Dim btnNext As Button = Wizard1.FindControl("StepNavigationTemplateContainerID").FindControl("StepNextButton") Dim btnPrevious As Button = Wizard1.FindControl("StepNavigationTemplateContainerID").FindControl("StepPreviousButton") btnNext.Visible = False btnPrevious.Visible = False Here is an example for the final step...(Note the different name for the finish button.... (Using their naming convention I at first thought it would be FinishFinishButton..) lol Dim btnFinish As Button = Wizard1.FindControl("FinishNavigationTemplateContainerID").FindControl("FinishButton") Dim btnPrevious As Button = Wizard1.FindControl("FinishNavigationTemplateContainerID").FindControl("FinishPreviousButton") btnFinish.Visible = FalsebtnPrevious.Visible = False I can't imagine why you would want to disable the Next button on the 1st panel but here is the code for that one as well. Dim btnNext As Button = Wizard1.FindControl("StartNavigationTemplateContainerID").FindControl("StartNextButton") btnNext.Visible = False
