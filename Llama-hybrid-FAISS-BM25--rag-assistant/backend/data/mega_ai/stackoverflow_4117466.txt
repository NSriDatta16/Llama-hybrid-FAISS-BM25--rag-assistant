JavaScript: Disable text selection via doubleclick

When double-clicking on a html page most browsers select the word you double-click on (or the paragraph you triple-click on). Is there a way to get rid of this behavior? Note that I do not want to disable regular selection via single-click+dragging; i.e. jQuery UI's $('body').disableSelection() and the document.onselectstart DOM event are not what I want.
