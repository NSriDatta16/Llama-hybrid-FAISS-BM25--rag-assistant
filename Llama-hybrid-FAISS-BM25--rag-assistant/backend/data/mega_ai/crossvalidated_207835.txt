Since this is self-study, I'll give hints where I think they will help: a) Correct approach. Since you are dealing with events of vastly different probabilities, your approximation of $10^{-4}$ is numerically, as long as we're just talking probabilities. b) Approach looks good here too. c) You could have calculated this as one minus the probability you got in (a). Then apply the method you used in (b). From De Morgan's Law: $$P((F\cup E)^c)=P(\neg F \cap \neg E)$$ d) This is an odd question, since no costs are provided. If earthquakes or floods by themselves will do only slight damage, but combined would lead to collapse, then it might be worthwhile. However, I think your line of thinking here is correct. How likely is such an event over the life of the bridge? I think this is what they are after. A more nuanced analysis would require additional assumptions about costs. For example, assume that the losses would be large(say 10 Billion in direct repairs and liability/damages/lawsuits). Now, assume that the extra reinforcement would cost $500 Million. Can a case be made that its still not worthwhile? For an added twist, you can calculated the expected next present value of avoided losses against the extra up-front costs (say, at 6% discount rate)...what do you get then?....see, this can get complicated if you think too hard (i.e., overthink it like this);-)
