DB9 Serial communication

I am getting some strange character displays on hyper terminal, after establishing communication with my GSM modem using the appropriate baud rate. When I type "AT", it appears to get repeated or display strange characters (as though the baud rate were not correct) on the hyper terminal screen as "AATT". And all other AT commands get repeated as well, but what surprises me is that they all respond to the command. "AATT"(having typed "AT") give me "OK". What could possibly be the problem? I am connecting the Modem to the DB9 using a MAX232. Below is the response øatt OK aaütø OK aatt++ücnnmmiiþ?ø +CNMI: 1,0,0,0,0 OK aattþ+ccssccss??ø +CSCS: "UCS2" OK RING RING RING NO CARRIER øat++ücnnmmii==11 aaüt++ccþnmii?? +CNMI: 1,2,0,0,0 OK Thanks!
