I don't think there is any automatic way to do this, but you could use some convention and: Create a custom view result that takes in multiple partial view results i.e. a MultiplePartialViewResult In the execute of the custom view result, call each the execute method of each of the supplied views'. Make sure to wrap each in a div or some other container for ease of retrieval at the client script Upon receiving the response on the AJAX call in the client script, grab the value from each container and replace it in the corresponding elements matching the partial views initially rendered For the last step you could use a convention. A simple one would be (if there is only one instance for each partial view) to put the id of target html element to update in the div/container you used to wrap it in the second step.
