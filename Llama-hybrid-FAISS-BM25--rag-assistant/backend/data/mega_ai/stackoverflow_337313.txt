Why are my programs running from my SD card so slow?

When moving my .Net Compact Framework application to the SD-card of a Windows CE device, the program executes slower then running it from the internal memory. I thought, the start-up might be slower, but it is the whole program. There is no IO to the storage card. Why is my application so slow and how does the compact framework handles and loads the assemblies?
