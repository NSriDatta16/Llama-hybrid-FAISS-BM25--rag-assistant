ASP.NET 4 ACCESS DATA TO APPLY TO NavigateUrl

I am currently learning .net and have come to a brick wall with trying to implement url rounting. I have most of it working fine, but I am trying to generate hyperlinks from information in my database. I am getting the data out fine using: 'portfolio navigation data Dim rdrPortfolioNav As SqlDataReader Dim cmdPortfolioNav As SqlCommand = New SqlCommand() cmdPortfolioNav.CommandText = "SELECT TOP 6 [id], [date], [client], [category], [title], [body], [website], [navimage], [navdesc] FROM [portfolio] ORDER BY [date] DESC" cmdPortfolioNav.CommandType = CommandType.Text cmdPortfolioNav.Connection = boomSQL cmdPortfolioNav.Connection.Open() rdrPortfolioNav = cmdPortfolioNav.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection) lvPortfolioNav.DataSource = rdrPortfolioNav lvPortfolioNav.DataBind() cmdPortfolioNav.Dispose() On the front end i can access the data and show all records using: / / " ToolTip=""> " AlternateText=" " ToolTip=" " /> The problem is this line: / / " ToolTip=""> it won't get the values from the database and in the html the link literally comes out as: Kingston Bagpuize House Website the same thing works fine for the ImageUrl so not sure what i'm doing wrong. I know you can do something in the backend code to generate the urls but i can't for the life of me find anything on the internet.....help would be very much appreciated. Thanks. J.
