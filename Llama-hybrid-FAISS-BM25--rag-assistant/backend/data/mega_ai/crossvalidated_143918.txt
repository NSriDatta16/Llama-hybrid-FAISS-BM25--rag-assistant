How do I sample from a black-box model of a probability distribution?

I have a function 'P(x)' where we query for any 'x' it gives a probability value. This function 'P' does not have a closed form and the evaluation is costly. Now 'x' is a set of vectors(matrix whose rows) which sum to 1 and each entry in the matrix is greater that 0 and less than or equal to 1. Now this distribution has many peaks and ridges. What method would be appropriate to sample from this 'P'. I want to approximate the distribution by a set of samples. So what would be the appropriate method to use? Which method in MCMC or any would be suitable?
