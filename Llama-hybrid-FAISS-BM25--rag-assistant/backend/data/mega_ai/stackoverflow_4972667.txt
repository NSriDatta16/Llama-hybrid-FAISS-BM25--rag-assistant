You should be testing it by passing in many, many valid pieces of data, and even more invalid pieces of data to make sure it works like its supposed to. That's the entire point. Your method must do what it's supposed to do, otherwise it needs to be reworked. That way the consumer of this information (either you or possibly another developer), can work with that data without being concerned about the internal implementation of your method. In fact, if you have a paragraph of comments that contains text from a novel your reading (which is silly, I admit), but your method accepts and returns what it says it should, then the consumer will never know or care how you implemented that method.
