The definition of a good/bad policy depends entirely on if it meets its objectives. In the example given, the use of the resource string actually makes the code itself less readable - without looking up the string you won't know what placeholders are there or what order they appear in. BUT there may be a number of business reasonse why it is worth the little bit of extra effort. I'm not sure what your organizations reasoning might be, but here are a couple off the top of my head. localization, you can swap out resource files and have your dates, numbers, etc. reformatted without touching the code string reuse - if the same string appears in a number of different places you can define it once ... any changes would carry through to all instances of its use translation - makes translating the application into other languages much much much easier. Most policies are put in place for a well established reason, so the best thing to do is ask around. It can actually give you some great insight into the department's business.
