because it shows score after each batch and in the end of epoch score is 0.74, don't look on scores after each batch since data can be shuffeled like this: first batch contains examples that your NN performs well so you have higher score, next we have examples that NN performs poorly and score is going down and so on... also keep in mind that accuracy is "human" metric, real indicator of performance of neural network on this dataset is loss value, also loss can decrease even after 1000 epochs but metric will be stuck since epoch e.g. 20 and will not change (especially for accuracy) if it's accuracy minimum maybe your data is not stratified or other fundamental improvement is needed?
