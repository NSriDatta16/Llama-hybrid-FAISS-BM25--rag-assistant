Is It Possible to do Context/Specification Testing With MSTest?

I'm moderately new to test frameworks and I have been reading up on Moq and this introductory post used a way of organising tests that I had not seen before. Further research shows that we in the .Net world tend to meld the terms BDD and Context/Specification (CS) Testing. I don't want to get into that argument - I am primarily interested in achieving this style of writing test classes. This article shows the approach again and makes explicit the use of a base class that allows us to construct our specification through the test framework. This issue I have is that I cannot see an instance method under MSTest that would allow a test fixture to be initialised just once for each test. The best I can see is the constructor of the test class but that feels a bit wrong. In NUnit one could use [TestFixtureSetup] . Is there an equivalent using Visual Studio's built in test framework? Edit I've subsequently moved to NUnit which provides the flexibility I require.
