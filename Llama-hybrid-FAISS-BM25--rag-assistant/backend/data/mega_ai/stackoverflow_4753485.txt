If you're very lucky, you can find a library that can load chunks of an image from storage rather than loading the entire thing. It depends on the image format, and what libraries are available to read it. Plus, the library will probably be written in C, so you'll have to port it to Java or use the NDK. It would be far better to break the image into tiles before it's placed onto the phone. If neither of these options work for you, I think you're out of luck.
