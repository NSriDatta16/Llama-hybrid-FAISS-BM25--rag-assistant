Name some techniques similar to Random Forests

I'm interested in what techniques are out there that are similar to, but not the same as, Random Forests. Either for classification or regression or both. Particularly interested in techniques which apply: Random resampling from the data Some form of variable selection / regularisation. Combination of many weak learners. Bonus kudos for techniques which aren't tree based.
