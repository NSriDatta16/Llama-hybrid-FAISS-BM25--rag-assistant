How do I create a Magento module or widget that will appear on the shopping cart page?

I’m having a lot of trouble understanding how to create a module that will add an extra button to the shopping cart page. I found lots of info on payment modules and stand-a-lone page modules, but nothing for this. I simply need to add a button underneath the regular “Checkout” button that can post item data to another website. I’ve created a module but can’t get Magento to recognize it and display the button on that spot. Any help would be greatly appreciated, even just sending me to an existing tutorial that I haven’t been able to find. Thanks.
