Univariate or Multivariate Time Series?

I believe univariate time series pertain to one single variable changing over time and multivariate refer to multiple variables (either dependant or independent), however the following case is unclear to me, as there are two independent variables but one does not change over time, it's more of a category (a location in this case). Is this still classed as a multivariate time series? Date Place Value 01/01/2021 A 1 02/01/2021 A 2 02/01/2021 B 1 03/01/2021 B 3 04/01/2021 C 2
