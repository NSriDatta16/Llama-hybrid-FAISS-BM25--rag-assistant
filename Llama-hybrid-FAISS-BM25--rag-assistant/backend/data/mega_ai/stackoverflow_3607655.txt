The question of how you match the questions had been asked already . The answer of how you should implement it in AJAX is as follows: First, implement a web service that you can query using JavaScript, that takes a question title and returns a list of questions that seem related. Let's say the service is at http://example.com/queryRelatedQuestions , and returns a JSON object in the following form: { "How to find the average speed of an African sparrow": "http://example.com/questions/1", "Speed of European sparrows diminishing, help ASAP": "http://example.com/questions/2" } Second, when the user has entered the question title ( blur event of text input), query the service like this: $.post('http://example.com/queryRelatedQuestions', { query: $('#title-text').val() }, function(data){ var result = [' ']; $.each(data, function(title, url) { result.push(' '); result.push(title); result.push(' '); }); result.push(' ') $('#relatedQuestions').html(result.join('')); } );
