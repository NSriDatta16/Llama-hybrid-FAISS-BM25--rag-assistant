) 0-valued pixels on the borders of an image. This is done so that the border pixels are not undervalued (lost) from the output because they would ordinarily participate in only a single receptive field instance. The padding applied is typically one less than the corresponding kernel dimension. For example, a convolutional layer using 3x3 kernels would receive a 2-pixel pad, that is 1 pixel on each side of the image. Stride The stride is the number of pixels that the analysis window moves on each iteration. A stride of 2 means that each kernel is offset by 2 pixels from its predecessor. Number of filters Since feature map size decreases with depth, layers near the input layer tend to have fewer filters while higher layers can have more. To equalize computation at each layer, the product of feature values va with pixel position is kept roughly constant across layers. Preserving more information about the input would require keeping the total number of activations (number of feature maps times number of pixel positions) non-decreasing from one layer to the next. The number of feature maps directly controls the capacity and depends on the number of available examples and task complexity. Filter (or kernel) size Common filter sizes found in the literature vary greatly, and are usually chosen based on the data set. Typical filter sizes range from 1x1 to 7x7. As two famous examples, AlexNet used 3x3, 5x5, and 11x11. Inceptionv3 used 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5. The challenge is to find the right level of granularity so as to create abstractions at the proper scale, given a particular data set, and without overfitting. Pooling type and size Max pooling is typically used, often with a 2x2 dimension. This implies that the input is drastically downsampled, reducing processing cost. Greater pooling reduces the dimension of the signal, and may result in unacceptable information loss. Often, non-overlapping pooling windows perform best. Dilation Dilation involves ignoring pixels within a kernel. This reduces processing memory potentially without significant signal loss. A dilation of 2 on a 3x3 kernel expands the kernel to 5x5, while still processing 9 (evenly spaced) pixels. Specifically, the processed pixels after the dilation are the cells (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (5,1), (5,3), (5,5), where (i,j) denotes the cell of the i-th row and j-th column in the expanded 5x5 kernel. Accordingly, dilation of 4 expands the kernel to 7x7. Translation equivariance and aliasing It is commonly assumed that CNNs are invariant to shifts of the input. Convolution or pooling layers within a CNN that do not have a stride greater than one are indeed equivariant to translations of the input. However, layers with a stride greater than one ignore the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem and might lead to aliasing of the input signal While, in principle, CNNs are capable of implementing anti-aliasing filters, it has been observed that this does not happen in practice, and therefore yield models that are not equivariant to translations. Furthermore, if a CNN makes use of fully connected layers, translation equivariance does not imply translation invariance, as the fully connected layers are not invariant to shifts of the input. One solution for complete translation invariance is avoiding any down-sampling throughout the network and applying global average pooling at the last layer. Additionally, several other partial solutions have been proposed, such as anti-aliasing before downsampling operations, spatial transformer networks, data augmentation, subsampling combined with pooling, and capsule neural networks. Evaluation The accuracy of the final model is typically estimated on a sub-part of the dataset set apart at the start, often called a test set. Alternatively, methods such as k-fold cross-validation are applied. Other strategies include using conformal prediction.
