HTML viewer for ics (iCal) files

I'm creating a small app in ASP.NET MVC that generates ics (iCal) files based on certain criterias. The generated files are accessible through a permanent URL ( http://myserver/some/criterias.ics ). I am looking for a way to display the calendar data on the page to give the user a preview of the generated file. Ideally, I'd like a Google Calendar type interface embedded in the page. Unfortunately, Google Calendar only seems to allow embedding calendars that have previously been added to their system. Is there any free service or library that will allow me to embed a calendar for an arbitrary ics file on my site?
