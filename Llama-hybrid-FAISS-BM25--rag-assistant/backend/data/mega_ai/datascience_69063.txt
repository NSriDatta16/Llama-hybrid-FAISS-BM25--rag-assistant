Keras: DepthwiseConv3DTranspose or doing transposed Conv. with a Conv. layer

I am building an autoencoder for 3D images and would like to use Depthwise convolutions. For the encoder, I found an implementation of a depthwise 3D convolutional layer (DepthwiseConv3D). For the decoder, I need a DepthwiseConv3DTranspose layer. I did not find an implementation of this anywhere. I read that "a deconvolution layer performs also convolution". This made me think: is it possible to choose parameters so that DepthwiseConv3D performs a transposed convolution?
