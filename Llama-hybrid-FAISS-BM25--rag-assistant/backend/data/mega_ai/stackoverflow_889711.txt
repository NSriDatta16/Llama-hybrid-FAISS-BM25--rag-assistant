Calculated Column Based on Two Calculated Columns

I'm trying to do a rather complicated SELECT computation that I will generalize: Main query is a wildcard select for a table One subquery does a COUNT() of all items based on a condition (this works fine) Another subquery does a SUM() of numbers in a column based on another condition. This also works correctly, except when no records meet the conditions, it returns NULL . I initially wanted to add up the two subqueries, something like (subquery1)+(subquery2) AS total which works fine unless subquery2 is null, in which case total becomes null, regardless of what the result of subquery1 is. My second thought was to try to create a third column that was to be a calculation of the two subqueries (ie, (subquery1) AS count1, (subquery2) AS count2, count1+count2 AS total ) but I don't think it's possible to calculate two calculated columns, and even if it were, I feel like the same problem applies. Does anyone have an elegant solution to this problem outside of just getting the two subquery values and totalling them in my program? Thanks!
