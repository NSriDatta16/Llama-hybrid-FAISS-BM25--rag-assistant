The directionality question is easy to answer for East Asian languages: websites are left-to-right, top-to-bottom as per usual. In fact, the general web design layout principles much the same. Have a look at the websites of a newspaper (name top left, navigation bar under with "Home" on the left, headline links below with most important at the top) or a search engine (don't think I need to say which US site you should compare that layout to). However, just as Arabic/Hebrew/etc right-to-left language users will expect left-to-right progression in some contexts (embedded English fragments and so on), there are situations, even on the web, where top-to-bottom layout is preferred. This is generally done by including an image with the text layout and font desired, or using flash. Internet Explorer has actually offered tb-rl layout with the CSS writing-mode property since version 5.5 however none of the other browsers have bothered implementing it (or ruby, which is useful for sites aimed at a young audience). IE 5.5 was released in 2000, so that's eight years of support, and there was a W3C candidate recommendation in 2003 but text layout in CSS still being poked around . As for your worries with text input and IMEs, as long as you're not doing something bogus like trying to manually translate the virtual keys given by keydown events into text strings, you're unlikely to run into problems. There are some additional issues you've not mentioned however. The minimum comfortably readable font size is larger than for languages written with the Latin script. Bold and italic for emphasis in flow are generally not appropriate. Han unification means to need to be picky about specifying the right fonts for the different CJK languages when working with unicode. You may want to provide both traditional and simplified interfaces for Chinese, depending on what audience you are expecting. I've been meaning to write up a more comprehensive guide along these lines for a while, if you need more information feel free to kick me.
