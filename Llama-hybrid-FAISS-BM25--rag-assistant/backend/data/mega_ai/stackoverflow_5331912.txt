What's the point of gutters in CSS grid frameworks?

I'm diving into web development and I'm playing with the Blueprint CSS framework, which includes a grid system, and I have a few questions. What's the point of gutters? Surely they're not used to include space between the columns because you can just use the margin CSS property for that, right? Or are gutters just an elegant way to manage margins? I don't want any space between my columns and would like to generate a grid layout that doesn't include gutters, but all the generator tools prevent me from having zero-width gutters. Why is that? It appears the suggested Blueprint CSS generator is no longer supported. Can anyone suggest a Blueprint CSS generator for modifying the grid to include zero-width gutters? Thanks so much for your wisdom!
