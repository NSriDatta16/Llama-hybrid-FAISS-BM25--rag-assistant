Here are some tips I can think of: 1. break the framework into independent parts, so that changing one part requires only running a small portion of test cases. 2. Employ a test case prioritizaion technique. That is, you only rerun a small portion of the test pools of the applications selected by some strategy. Additional branch and ART have better performance than others usually. They require to know the branch coverage information of each test case. 3. Update the framework less frequently. If an application doesn't need change, it means its ok not to change it. So I guess its ok for these applications to use the old version of the framework. You can update the framework for these applications say every 3 months.
