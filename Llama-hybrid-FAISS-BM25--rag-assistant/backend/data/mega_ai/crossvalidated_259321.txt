How to select relevant parameters

I have a large set of data corresponding to parameters used or (not used) to determine the value of many indicators.These indicators are also used to to determine a value type. For example: parameter/indicator | Comfort | VacancyRate | AirQuality | FireSecurity city | x | | x | x number of rooms | x | x | | nb of fire extinguishers| | | | x city impacts the comfort, air quality and fire security and indicator/value type | ContextualValue | GreenValue | FinancialValue Comfort | x | x | x VacancyRate | | | x AirQuality | | x | x Comfort impacts the contextualValue the greenValue and the financialValue I have thousands of parameters, several hundred indicators and five value types. I was wondering if there was any way to determine the real use of a parameter and indicator using statistics or maybe machine learning; the objective is to filter out any "useless" data. "20% of data corresponding to 80% of the necessary information." Any advice would be helpful ! Elliott
