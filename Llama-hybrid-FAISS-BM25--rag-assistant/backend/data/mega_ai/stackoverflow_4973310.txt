SIGNAL 11 SIGSEGV crash Android

Today I faced an error due to which my Android application is getting by SIGNAL 11. This error usually occurs due to unauthorized memory area access by Android internal storage. Some of the possible scenarios are web access, network communication, server image downloading and such. Mine was the case of browser load url! http://bootloader.wikidot.com/linux:android:crashlog I need to launch the browser after a QR code scan. Application was keep on scanning and launching the browser fluently but the issue occurs after 15-20 attempts of same steps.. I researched a lot and found that its the MEMORY ERROR which occurs in Android Native libraries.. usually when an unknown memory area is tried to access by the android internal storage system. Finally I revealed that when I saw my application memory usage in the Android application setting section, i found that the cache has been reached to 10 MB..
