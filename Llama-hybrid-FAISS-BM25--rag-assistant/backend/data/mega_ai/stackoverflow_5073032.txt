Sorry to say, but the solution proposed in the question is an unscalable design. I was looking into this problem over here , which had a decent discussion on it (before I showed up). Take a look there. In your case, storing U*M records to track "unread" posts, where U is the number of users and M is the number of messages, would get out of control very, very quickly. This is because its best-case efficiency requires all users to read every message (and most users don't care about everything, as most everything on a forum is noise). Average case, maybe 20% of users have read 100% of posts, but 80% have read near 0% of posts and never will read the rest. This means that you're being forced to store 0.8*U*M, with U and M only ever increasing, geometrically. No amount of indexing will fix this. The previous @will-hartung answer has the more efficient approach. I see that this is pretty old, and I hope you found a better solution in the meantime.
