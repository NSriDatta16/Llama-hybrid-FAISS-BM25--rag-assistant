How to reduce question set of a poorly designed questionnaire?

I have a very lengthy but poorly designed questionnaire, which has a very large number of questions. The questionnaire really needs to be completely rewritten, but prior to that being done, there is an organisational need to use it again in the short term. Given the length of the questionnaire, it would be helpful to reduce the number of questions. Some of the 'factors' are composed entirely of questions in a Likert score format - the average of these questions is taken to obtain the 'factor' score. It is likely that some of the questions only contribute noise to the score. Would it seem reasonable to undertake a factor analysis of only the questions lying under each 'factor' and look for a one factor solution, eliminating those questions which don't load to that factor?
