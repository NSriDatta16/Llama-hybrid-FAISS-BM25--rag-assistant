That is what logistic regression , probit regression , and company were invented for. Nowdays most people would use logistic regression, but fitting involves iterative algorithms - there are, of course, lots of implementations, but you might not want to write one yourself. Probit regression has an approximate explicit solution described at the link that might be good enough for your purposes. A possible way to assess whether logistic regression would work for your data, would be to look at a plot of each score versus the logit of the probability of purchase (log(p/(1-p)), and see whether these form a straight line.
