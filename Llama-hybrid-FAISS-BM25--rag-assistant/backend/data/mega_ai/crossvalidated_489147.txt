There is nothing special about dimensionality reduction in moving from 3 dimensions to 2 - dimensionality reduction, in principle, can start with an arbitrarily large number of dimensions. You could extend the Swiss Roll to higher dimensions by simply imagining several instances of plot A, where each dimension in/out of the plane of the screen represents a different uninformative dimension. You'd have a N dimensional Swiss Roll dataset which you can visualize as N-2 three-dimensional plots, but the underlying manifold is still well-described in far fewer dimensions. No matter how many uninformative dimensions you have, you can still get back to something like plot B with the right mapping. For concentric N-spheres, the ideal dimensionality reduction would map everything to one dimension, which simply measures the radius. You only need one single number to determine which N-sphere you're in, which is the distance from the center.
