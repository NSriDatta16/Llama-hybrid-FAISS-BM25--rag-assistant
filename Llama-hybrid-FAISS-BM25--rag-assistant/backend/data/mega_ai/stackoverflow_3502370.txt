If max_distance and mouseDragX are int values, the division by 2 results in an integer division that can induce losses. This is especially true if mouseDragX value's is 1 at some time. This will result in 1 / 2 (integer division) and returns 0 . Example: Lets consider that mouseDragX takes 3 different values (3 cycles): 3, 1, -4 One would expect that max_distance will be increased by (3 / 2) + (1 / 2) - (4 / 2) = 0 . But due to integer truncation, this will infact result to 1 + 0 - 2 = -1 . What if you use float s instead of int , and just round max_distance to an int when you really need it's value ?
