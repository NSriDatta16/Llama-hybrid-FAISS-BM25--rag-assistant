The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is a point forecast accuracy measure. As a percentage, it can be compared between forecasts for time series on different scales, and it is easily interpreted. However, it is asymmetric (underforecasts' MAPEs are bounded at 100%, while overforecasts' are unbounded), potentially leading to biased forecasts. The MAPE is undefined if any actual is zero.
