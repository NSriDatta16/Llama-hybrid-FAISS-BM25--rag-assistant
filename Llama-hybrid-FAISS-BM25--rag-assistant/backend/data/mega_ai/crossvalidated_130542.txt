The Wilcoxon signed rank test is a nonparametric test for two populations when the observations are paired. Using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with two samples, s1 and s2 will allow you to test for the null hypothesis that s1 â€“ s2 comes from a distribution with zero median and density that is symmetric about that median ( thanks @ttnphns for spotting this ). It is not concerned with averages (ie. means) at any point. My main concern would be that that the Wilcoxon signed rank test asks for each pair to be chosen randomly and independently. Your data appears to be part of a timeseries so I would suspect a seasonal component to come into play. I do not think that the Wilcoxon signed rank test assumptions are fulfilled for your particular case. You might want to "bend the rules" and say that each pair is random and independent of the others (so you are OK to use the W.s.r. test) but this is your choice to make.
