main has to be in a class because everything in Java is a class. In your simple example typically the main function would be in the Bear class. The MakeBear class is unnecessary. It would be re-written like this. public class Bear { private String name; private String colour; private int age; private int weight; public Bear(String bearName, String bearColour, int bearAge, int bearWeight) { name = bearName; colour = bearColour; age = bearAge; weight = bearWeight; } public static void main(String[] args) { Bear myBear = new Bear("Jim", "brown", 12, 50); // constructor System.out.println("The bear is called" + myBear.getName() + " and is " + myBear.getAge() + " years old!"); } }
