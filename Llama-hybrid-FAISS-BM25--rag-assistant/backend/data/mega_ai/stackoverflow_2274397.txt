AFAIK there's no easy way round this. Alternatives I can think of are:- Modify the geometry so the objects don't overlap (hardest to code, but highest performance). Render the objects to a texture at full opacity, then render that alpha-blended. Use a stencil buffer (if iPhone supports stencil buffers which I suspect it doesn't). Start with the stencil set to zeros, set it to write a 1 when you draw your translucent polys and set the condition to only draw the fragment if the buffer is 0.
