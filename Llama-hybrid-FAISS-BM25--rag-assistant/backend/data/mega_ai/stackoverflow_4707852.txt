Custom session state provider needed for DB storage?

I know this question is related to many others, but please bear with me. I am trying an experiment to store all information in database tables instead of the ASP.NET session. In ASP.NET 4 one can create a custom provider for session. So, again should I implement a Custom Session-State Provider or should I just disable session (in Web.config)? Thanks! From the comments my question can be misunderstood. Hopefully this tidbit will help clarify: I don't want to store the session in the database. I want to store information in the database that you would typically store in the session. One reason why: I don't want to carry around a session on every page, especially if that page doesn't care about 90 percent of the information in the session
