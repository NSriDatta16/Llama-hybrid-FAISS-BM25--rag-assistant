I assume you've already created a working app that uses sqlite as persistent storage for your data model. Have a look into the AppDelegate.m file to search for the sqlite database name and location, then run your app in the iPhone Simulator. Use Spotlight to search for the SQLite database created by the app in the simulator, usually this is /Users/ /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Application/ /Documents/ Now you only have to copy that file to a working folder, open it using sqlite3 (www.sqlite.org), then type .schema to retrieve the database schema. Now populate it, either by hand or using a python/ruby/whatever script! Unfortunately, i'm not aware of any tool that will populate a db by simply feeding them the schema. For directly manipulating the data, sqlite3 provides you with a command line utility that's really handy for that purpose. When you're finished, add the file with sample data to your App project.
