What is the impact in having different Domain groups for CC users ? None except the administration cost (registering every users to many group can be cumbersome). The fact to have several element with different groups is not a problem in itself. VOB vB, is read/write access to group gB, read access to group gA, and restricted to everybody else gB is part of the secondary group of vB, gA is not (means no checkout possible). 770 for a system group including gA and gB (meaning read access for gA, read/write for gB, denied for gC) read-only or read/write implies protections set by clearcase (" cleartool protect " or " cleartool protectvob "), but "no access" can only be achieved on the system level (chmod 770) ClearCase regions have nothing to do with data restriction, only data visibility: it allows you to see only a subset of vobs or views, it does not prevent you to access them (a simple mktag -vob and you would see that "confidential" vob anyway) It seems to me the difficulty here is not technical, but rather that in the process for giving access to certain people to the proper groups, and that the CM team should stay away from this (and leave that to be decided by the Security Department and the development teams involved). Sigh... the CM should stay away, but the CM team cannot always stay away ;) That team must at least initialize the request, for the system team to register the user in the correct group. That initialization step alone is quite a drag, compared to a VCS which has its own group management system. But ClearCase is not there yet.
