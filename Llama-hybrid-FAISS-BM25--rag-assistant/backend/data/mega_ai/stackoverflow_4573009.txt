I find that using a graphical interface as a 'crutch' while you get familiar with any version control system is great help. With something like Git new users can get quickly discouraged by the command line entry which is rather scary if you havent used bash commands before. I am currently using a mix of Aptana 3 which includes integration with Github and clearly highlights the files I am making changes to, as well as making it easy to make commits, revert to original versions or diff-merge my changes to compare the current and last version of code. As an alternative to Aptana: I've used Tortoise SVN in the past to get familiar with Subversion and I know that there is a version of Tortoise Git available that also integrates with windows explorer. The reality is that once you start developing with Git you wont have time to do everything on the command line so you may as well get used to one of GUIs. Learning on a graphical interface is an gentler learning curve, you can get confident since you'll be screwing up less often, once you are familiar with the key concepts there you can start trying out more advanced commands that are only available on the command line, I use the following resource when I need to do something out of the ordinary: http://www.gitready.com/
