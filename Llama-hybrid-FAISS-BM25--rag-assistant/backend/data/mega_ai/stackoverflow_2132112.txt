The best way is to use Curl ( https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php ) for loading external content because you can manipulate with headers etc., it also supports redirects etc. For example, if mod_security is installed on apache - you wouldn't be able to grab content without passing user-agent header etc., but Curl will definately will help with it.
