Run TeamCity Build Step on a specific Agent

I've got TeamCity installed and working, and I need to have a build step run on a particular build agent (everything's running on Windows, but we have a Mac portion I need to build as well). How do I tell the build step what agent I want it to run on? I've seen this , but that references an entire build; I just want a particular step to run on a given agent. Is this even possible?
