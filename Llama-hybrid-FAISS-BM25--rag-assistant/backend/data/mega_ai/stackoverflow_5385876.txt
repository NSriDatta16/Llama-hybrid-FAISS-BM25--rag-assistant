You can use list multiplication accAttackSword = [100]*6 .... bookWeight = [100]*2 .... You might consider grouping all of the variables with similar prefixes either into dictionaries or nested lists (EDIT - or classes/objects). This could have benefits later for organization, and would allow you to iterate thru and set them all to the same initial values. bookVars = ['AttackPhy', 'AttackMag', 'StrInstrument', 'StrCharms'] bookValues = dict() for i in bookVars: bookValues[i] = [100]*2 And to access... bookValues {'AttackMag': [100, 100], 'StrCharms': [100, 100], 'StrInstrument': [100, 100], 'AttackPhy': [100, 100]} bookValues['AttackMag'] [100, 100] EDIT - check out senderle 's thing too. at a glance his seems a little better, but id definitely consider using one of our ideas - the point is to structure it a little more. whenever you have groups of variables with similar prefixed names, consider grouping them together in a more meaningful way. you are already doing so in your mind, so make the code follow!
