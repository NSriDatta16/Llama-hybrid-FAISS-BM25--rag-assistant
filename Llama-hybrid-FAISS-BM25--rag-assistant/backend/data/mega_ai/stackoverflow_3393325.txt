I'm sorry I'm not very proficient with time series objects, but if you can get your data into a data frame, I can help. Assuming you have a data frame with the following columns: Date Data Value Where Date contains the date, Data contains your A through C labels, and Value contains the value. From that point, the ggplot2 code would be library(ggplot2) ggplot(df, aes(Date, Value, fill = Data))+ geom_area() I think passing color = "black" to geom_area() nicely delimits the areas, but that's up to your aesthetic taste.
