Classification and regression trees: what is a sensible value for the minimum number of observations in terminal nodes

Here I'll borrow some parameter names from the R rpart package for illustration. The most important hyperparameter for pruning a CART tree is the cost-complexity parameter (i.e., cp ). However, there are other parameters that affect the size of the tree, such as (1) the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted (i.e., minsplit ); (2) the minimum number of observations in terminal nodes (i.e., minbucket ). Now I know that cp is the fundamental driver for over/under-fitting, but I also think there must be some circumstances where I need to pay attention to minsplit or minbucket . So my question is, when should I consider changing the default value of minbucket (or minsplit )? In addition, how do I determine a sensible value for the parameter?
