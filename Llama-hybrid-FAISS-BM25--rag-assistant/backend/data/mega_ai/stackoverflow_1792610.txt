adding fade to jquery image replacement

Im creating a nav that uses jquery to replace the image on rollover. Here is the code I am using: http://peps.ca/blog/easy-image-rollover-script-with-jquery/ basically, you add a suffix (_o) to the filename and when you rollover the src, jquery replaces it with the (_o).png. I want to add fade so when there is a rollover, the transition isn't instant, rather there is a quick, elegant fade. Any ideas?
