I'd look for something (buried in a header?) changing the structure packing from the default. The warning seems to be saying that whatever type MyClass::my_data_ is expects to be 8-byte aligned, but it's not being placed at that alignment inside MyClass . Search for #pragma pack(some-number) directives that aren't reset with a #pragma pack() . Using #pragma pack(show) would probably be helpful, too.
