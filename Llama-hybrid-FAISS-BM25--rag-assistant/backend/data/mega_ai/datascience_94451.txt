You should read this post . It's a long one but it's a useful one. It relies on LSTM for time series forecasting and does a very good job of illustrating how framing the problem, ie: how to you define what's the training and the target data, influence what the model is going to predict. In your case, it's gonna show that you only need using you n-1 Var present in both data set and use the remaining one in the train data as the target. How you decide frame it is up to you, whether you want to do a step by step prediction or predict a vector of values.
