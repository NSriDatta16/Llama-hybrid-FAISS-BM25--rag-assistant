How to use more features in text based machine learning models beyond the text itself?

I have a text dataset such that for each document in the text I have more features like category of the document, sub-category of the document and some anonymized features which are float. I can model a model by considering only TF-IDF features from the each document's text but I will not be using other relevant information which encoded in other features. One way could be to append these features to text of the document and then do TF-IDF which is obviously wrong. Can someone help me in understanding how can I using these other features of the dataset along with the text to build a model?
