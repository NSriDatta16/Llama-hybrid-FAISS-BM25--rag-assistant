Detect when mouse enter QGraphicsItem with button down

I want to detect when the mouse cursor moves in over a QGraphicsItem while a mouse button is pressed, i.e. the button is pressed before the mouse enters the item. My first idea was to use hoverEnterEvent , but it doesn't seem to trigger when the left mouse button is pressed. My other idea was to use dragEnterEvent , but it doesn't seem to trigger at all (even though I have used setAcceptDrops(True) . What is the best way to detect when the cursor moves on top of an item and the mouse button is pressed?
