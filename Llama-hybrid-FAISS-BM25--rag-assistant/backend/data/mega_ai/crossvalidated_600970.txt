Yes, glmmTMB happily fits models without random effects. As pointed out in comments, the reason you're getting (apparently) very different answers from glm and glmmTMB is that you have complete separation in your example: all of the cars with 4 cylinders have Bin==1 and all of those with 8 cylinders have Bin==0 (There are questions on CrossValidated and Stack Overflow about how to diagnose and deal with complete separation, but a short version is that any coefficient value with $|\beta| \gt 10$ in a logistic regression with reasonably scaled inputs is a red flag.) with(mtcars, table(Bin, cyl)) cyl Bin 4 6 8 0 0 4 14 1 11 3 0
