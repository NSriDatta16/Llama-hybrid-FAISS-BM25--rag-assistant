The problem is that Python treats the empty string as False. When you pass None to your function, it evaluates to: None == None and '' or None which (effectively) becomes: True and False or None then: False or None and finally: None One solution would be: lambda x: x if x is not None else '' If you know x will be either a string or None, then you can leverage the fact that None is also a False value in Python: lambda x: x or ''
