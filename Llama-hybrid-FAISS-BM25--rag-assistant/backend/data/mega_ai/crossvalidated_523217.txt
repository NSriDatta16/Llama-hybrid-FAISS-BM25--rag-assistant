Ordered quantile normalization properties explained

My question is about the properties and proper use of "Ordered quantile normalization" from the paper titled “ Ordered quantile normalization: a semiparametric transformation built for the cross-validation era ”. The formula of the transformation is a little difficult to understand. The transformation is available in R package called bestNormalize . As far as I understood, it fits a function to transform a non-normal distribution to normal in a numerical vector. The transformation maintains ranks of the numbers in a vector. Then the fit information (parameter values) could be saved and used by predict function in the package to transform a new vector to the normal distribution (or close to normal). Since it is meant to be used in machine learning, my question is whether the transformation results in any leak of information from the training set to test set via the transformation or across different observations (within train or test sets). Also doesn’t this process force the numbers/values in the test set to be too similar to the training set and thus making the performance of a classification/regression task too easy (compared to using the original data distribution) due to a sort of bias added by the transformation? Since the transformation does not change the rank of data, are transformed values interpretable?
