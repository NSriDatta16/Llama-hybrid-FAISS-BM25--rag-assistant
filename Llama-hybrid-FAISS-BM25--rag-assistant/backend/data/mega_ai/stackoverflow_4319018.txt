Using Jetty to serve a web application

I am using Jetty for the first time to deploy a GWT web app connecting to a Restlet API and I am trying to understand the best way to use it. I want to make it embeddable so that I can update config during run-time (allowing me to add new domain names etc). Our web server currently runs Apache to serve a PHP web app and this will be our first time deploying a GWT app and using Jetty. Is it possible to use Jetty in parallel with Apache (both serving requests on port 80) and since I am embedding it do I use Apache before it reaches Jetty? So Apache receives request and forwards to Jetty?
