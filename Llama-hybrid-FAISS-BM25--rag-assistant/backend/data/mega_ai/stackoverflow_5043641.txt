Why is my OpenMP implementation slower than a single threaded implementation? (Followup)

This is a follow up to Why is my OpenMP implementation slower than a single threaded implementation? . I have adhered to the answer provided, and used tasking instead of for pragmas to speed up the code. However, compared to a sequential (same) program, both programs run equally as fast. I witness no speed up. The reworked code is here: http://pastebin.com/3SFaNEc4 I simply removed all the for pragmas and replaced it tasking pragmas for the recursive procedures. Am I doing anything wrong? I should be seeing an almost linear speed up. What do you guys think? Thanks!
