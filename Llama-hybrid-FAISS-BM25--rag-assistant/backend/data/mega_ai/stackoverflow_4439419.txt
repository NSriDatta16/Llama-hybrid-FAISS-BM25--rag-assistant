how to implement a dynamic combo box selection system

I'm implementing a system these days, i want to implement a combo box selection process but i don't know how to implement it, so asking you guys favor? my scenario is this, let's say we have two combo box selection lists, left one and right one, left one is the main one and the right one is the child of the left one. when i select a item from the left combo box the right combo box's content should be changed according to the selection of the left one, Ex: let's think about mobile phones, if i select the brand Nokia from the left combo box right combo box's content should be changed to C6-01 E7-00 5232 X3-02 C1-01 C7-00 5228 C5-03 5250 6120ci E5-00 E73 like wise. please help me to implement a this kind of scenario! any tutorial links, sample codes to understand the scenario is better! regards, Rangana
