Once you have made sure the File's Owner is set to be CalculatorViewController, make sure that the IBOutlet type in the CalculatorViewController.h file matches the UI component type you are trying to connect it to. Your header defines an IBOutlet for a UILabel, which means only a UILabel can be connected to it. If the component is of a different type, lets say a UIButton, then you would change your header file to include an IBOutlet like so: IBOutlet UIButton *button; Once you have defined the UIButton in your header, switch to IB. Double check that file's owner is set to your viewcontroller class, then add a UIButton to the view. Then you should be able to either: ctrl+drag from the component to the file's owner right-click on the file's owner and get a HUD styled popup showing all available IBOutlet's. click and drag from the UIButton one to the UIButton in your view. If you want the UIButton in IB to trigger one of your defined IBActions, you will make a connection to the action. I usually perform this by right-clicking on the File's Owner, which will show all available IBActions and IBOutlets. Hope this helps!
