What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM?

I am working with many algorithms: RandomForest, DecisionTrees, NaiveBayes, SVM (kernel=linear and rbf), KNN, LDA and XGBoost. All of them were pretty fast except for SVM. That is when I got to know that it needs feature scaling to work faster. Then I started wondering if I should do the same for the other algorithms.
