Pairwise vs listwise deletion of missing data in regression?

I was wondering what would be the difference between using the pairwise versus the listwise option in a multiple regression? I have a dependent variable (reaction time) and several predictors (accuracy, and 4 measures corresponding to anxiety & depression). When I calculated the mean reaction time for the dependent variable, I included only some participants that reached a certain level of difficulty of the memory task, therefore reducing the number ($N$) of subjects (from 100 to 70). However the $N$ of the predictors remained unchanged. When I want to include the predictors in the multiple regression using the stepwise method in SPSS v. 21 (step1: accuracy, step 2: anxiety and depression predictors), when using the pairwise option there are 2 significant predictors on the second model but when I use the listwise option, although the $N$ is 70 for both, the second predictor is no longer significant ($p=0.078$). Also the variance inflation factor (VIF) increases for each predictor (average VIF from 1 increases to 1.8 with the listwise option). I am aware of what Field (2009), Discovering Statistics Using SPSS , Ch. 7.7.6, p. 231, recommended, by saying that using the pairwise option: "many of your variables may not make sense, and you can end up with absurdities such as $R^2$ either negative or greater than 1.0. So, itâ€™s not a good option". However, this does not occur in my analysis. What would be the difference between pairwise and listwise when calculating the coefficients in this multiple regression (as the $N$ is the same in both analyses)?
