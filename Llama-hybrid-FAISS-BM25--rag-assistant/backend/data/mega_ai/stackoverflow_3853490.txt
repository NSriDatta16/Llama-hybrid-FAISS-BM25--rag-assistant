Decision tree induction open-source code

I am preparing a task for computer vision class, which involves training a simple classifier after extracting features from images. Since machine learning is not the main topic here, I don't want students to implement a learning algirithm from scratch. So, I have to recommend them some reference implementations. I believe the decision tree classifier is suitable for that. The problem is the variety of languages allowed for the class is quite large: C++, C#, Delphi. Also, I don't want students to spend a lot of time to any technical issues like linking a library. WEKA is great for Java. We also can use OpenCV with all the wrappers, but it is quite big and clumsy while I want something simple and sweet. So, do you know any simple C++/C#/Delphi libraries for learning decision trees?
