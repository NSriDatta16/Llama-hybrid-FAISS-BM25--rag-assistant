As soon as you use any subclass of Reader , you aren't reading binary. You are converting from bytes to characters, using the default encoding of the JVM. If you really want bytes of binary, you need to stick to streams, not readers. Creating both stacks at once is asking for trouble. Use Apache Commons IO: IOUtils.toByteArray() to read the entire content into memory as a byte[], and then decide what to do with it, unless you have a gigantic amount of data, in which case you should set up the buffered input stream, decide what to do, and only construct the reader after you push back.
