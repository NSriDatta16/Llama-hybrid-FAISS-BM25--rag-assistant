Vectorization of data before splitting in to test and train with Neural Network?

Is it better to split your dataset into train and test before vectorizing? Or is it better to do it in reverse and vectorize inputs then perform train test split? For example I'm trying to use some categorical inputs such as types of animals, should I vectorize them into one hot then split into train/test or split the data set randomly then vectorize into one hot?
