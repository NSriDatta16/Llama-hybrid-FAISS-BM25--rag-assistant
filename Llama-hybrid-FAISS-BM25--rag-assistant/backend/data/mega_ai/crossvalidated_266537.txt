Feature selection for 2D sample

I have a dataset in which each sample has 2D matrix data, e.g., 50x1000 size matrix. Each of these 50 rows has different meanings. I convert this to 1*50,000 size data and use svm for classification. But now I want to find out the most significant rows for classification. I checked Sequential Feature Selection of matlab, but the problem is, it discards and takes some columns from row 1, some columns from row 2 etc. But I want to use each row as a group for feature selection so that either I take that whole row or not. Does anyone know any algorithms for this purpose?
