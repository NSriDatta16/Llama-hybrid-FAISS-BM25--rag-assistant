Qt Drag and Drop indicator Position

I have a class that extends from QTreeView that has a data model that extends from QAbstractItemModel and I want to drag an item to it. My problem is this, when I am dragging, I have the drag indicator shown, and its shows either a rectangle to drop on the item, or a line to drop between the items. When I receive the dropMimeData in my data model though, I see no way to retrieve this data. I noticed there is a dropIndicatorPosition on the QAbstractItemView, but it is protected. So my question is, how can I know in dropMimeData if the drop is on the item, before it or after it?
