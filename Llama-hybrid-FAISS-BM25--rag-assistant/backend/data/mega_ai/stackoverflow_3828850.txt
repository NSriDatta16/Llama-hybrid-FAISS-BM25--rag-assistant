You posted code seems to have syntactical errors, but I think the solution for your problem should be the call of e.target.startDrag(); . With your call of my_thumb.startDrag(); you are trying to call a function startDrag on e.target.name which doesn't exists. Alternativly you can replace var my_thumb = e.target.name; with var my_thumb = e.target;
