What are the best practices for permissions on a publishing site within MOSS 2007 Standard?

Here's the scenareio: I have a single site collection, with the publishing infrastucture feature activated. Seveal levels below this I have a publishing site with the publishing features turned on. I also have unique permissions for this site. The problem is that no one except site collection administrators can "Create Page". I have given the individuals everything including full control, and they still can not create pages. They can edit pages, but not create. Am I doing something wrong? What is the proper way to set up the taxonomy of a site? I am trying to create a hierarcy to match my organization and mostly am using unique permissions on each site/subsite. This is working ok, until i needed a publishing site, but I don't want him to be a site collection admin. I would appreciate any help or ideas with how to make the publishing site work as I have it, or guide me on the proper way to lay out the site.
