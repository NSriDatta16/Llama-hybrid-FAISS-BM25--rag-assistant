Select numbers between a range (1 to 100) in sqlite

I know some of the solutions in SQL but couldn't find any of them from SQlite. I just want to execute a select query that returns a resultset of numbers ranging from 1 to 100. Numbers 1 2 3 4 ...... 5 A correction: I don't actually have a table at all. (however a solution is encouraged with a virtual table like dual in MySQL)
