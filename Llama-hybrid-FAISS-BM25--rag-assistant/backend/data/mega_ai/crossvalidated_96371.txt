Should the mean be used when data are skewed?

Often introductory applied statistics texts distinguish the mean from the median (often in the the context of descriptive statistics and motivating the summarization of central tendency using the mean, median and mode) by explaining that the mean is sensitive to outliers in sample data and/or to skewed population distributions, and this is used as a justification for an assertion that the median is to be preferred when the data are not symmetrical. For example: The best measure of central tendency for a given set of data often depends on the way in which the values are distributed.... When data are not symmetric, the median is often the best measure of central tendency. Because the mean is sensitive to extreme observations, it is pulled in the direction of the outlying data values, and as a result might end up excessively inflated or excessively deflated." â€”Pagano and Gauvreau, (2000) Principles of Biostatistics , 2nd ed. (P&G were at hand, BTW, not singling them out per se .) The authors define "central tendency" thus: "The most commonly investigated characteristic of a set of data is its center, or the point about which observations tend to cluster." This strikes me as a less-than forthright way of saying only use the median, period , because only using the mean when the data/distributions are symmetrical is the same thing as saying only use the mean when it equals the median. Edit: whuber rightly points out that I am conflating robust measures of central tendency with the median. So it is important to keep in mind that I am discussing the specific framing of the arithmetic mean versus the median in introductory applied statistics (where, mode aside, other measures of central tendency are not motivated). Rather than judging the utility of the mean by how much it departs from the behavior of the median, ought we not simply understand these as two different measures of centrality? In other words being sensitive to skewness is a feature of the mean. One could just as validly argue "well the median is no good because it is largely insensitive to skewness, so only use it when it equals the mean." (The mode is quite sensibly not getting involved with this question.)
