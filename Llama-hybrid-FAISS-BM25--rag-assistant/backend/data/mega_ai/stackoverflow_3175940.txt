I assume you've found this article . From that, it seems like you have the right idea by using a 3D embedding. Your question is then how to intersect the result with the sphere. First of all you need to consider how you're going to represent the voronoi diagram. If you want to work in lat/long coordinates in a 2D plane, then your voronoi diagram will contain curved edges, so maybe it is best to just use a 3D representation. If you use a program like qvoronoi, you should in theory only need the inifinite hyperplane data (generated by Fo ). This gives you the equation of the plane and the two points it corresponds to. Usually you only need to use the voronoi diagram to test for inclusion within regions, and the hyperplanes should be enough for that.
