Output prediction from a sequence of data

Given the machine learning libraries available for many different languages, it's possible to utilise algorithms where you don't need to have a detailed understanding of their application or workings or datascience in general. I have tried to find a list of algorithms that are suitable for sequence prediction from a window of previous input values, which I could then apply in such a library e.g. Accord for C# but have failed. Each observation I have is an array of 2-dimensonal data in the following form: {MODE1/2/3, int 1-98}. That is, multiple inputs produce multiple outputs. I'd like to examine preceding sets of values from either t-1 or t-x where x could be a variable amount of preceding value sets. So, I'd like to ask what algorithms excel at prediction from a window of sequence data, and what are their strengths / weaknesses.
