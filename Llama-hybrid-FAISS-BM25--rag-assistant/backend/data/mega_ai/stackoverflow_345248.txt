You can register that .NET dll with regasm utility by specifying /codebase parameter. This parameter is not encouraged to use with unsigned assemblies but it works when you can not put your assembly into GAC. regasm your.dll /codebase Please note that you should not change your .dll's path after this operation since it inserts this path into the Windows registry.
