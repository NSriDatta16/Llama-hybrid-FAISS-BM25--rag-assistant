Not a complete answer to your story but a data point to consider: Beware the IO speeds of IsolatedStorage. While there has been considerable effort put into speeding it up, you may want to consider other options if you plan to do multiple small reads/writes as it can be extremely slow . (That, or use appropriate buffering techniques to ensure your reads/writes are larger and infrequent.)
