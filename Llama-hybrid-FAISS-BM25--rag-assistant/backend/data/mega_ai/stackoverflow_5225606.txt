How to show one div of many, per page refresh?

The JavaScript below will show the blockquote in the markup one every 6000 ms. I want to change this behaviour to only show one every page load. I am ok with loading all of them in the markup, I just want to only a random one in every page load. jQuery(document).ready( function(){ jQuery('.quotes').innerfade({ animationtype: 'fade', speed: 'normal', timeout: 6000, type: 'random_start', }); }); As a bonus, If JavaScript is disabled in the browser I will like to only show one. “Throw out costs by more than 50%.” Da John @ Con Pi LLC “Georgio pany.” Kn Maez, Mnet “…He hae is available.” Dan net “Georommend without a doubt.” Jorge Suár Puerto Rico “Siain tomorrow…” Cha, Inc.
