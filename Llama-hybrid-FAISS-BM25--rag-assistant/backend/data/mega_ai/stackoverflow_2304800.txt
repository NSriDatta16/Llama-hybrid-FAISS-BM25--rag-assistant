Make sure you have the most recent svn from the repository. I could not get the tar ball to build but the svn check out built correctly " https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/trunk/opencv " You will also need the OpenCV.framework for xcode to build the app with. I found this page to have the best info to get openCV working on an Mac http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port So far I have only got this to work on an intel based Mac.
