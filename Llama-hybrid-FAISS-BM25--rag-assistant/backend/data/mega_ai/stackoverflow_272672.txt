Personally I would reject the idea of users using either system simulataneously. How are you going to resolve the issue if user 1 changed record 1 on system 1 and user 2 changed record 1 in a different way on system 2? Further, if you don't require people to use the new system, they won't. Resistance to change is very very strong in most organizations. I would suggest instead that you rollout the new system and require all to use it and hourly send data to the old system in case you need to revert for any reason. I see no reasonable way to get a 2 second synch. That is a ridiculous requirement and the business side should be told so in no uncertain terms. Sometimes you just have to fight back when busines users want something unreasonable.
