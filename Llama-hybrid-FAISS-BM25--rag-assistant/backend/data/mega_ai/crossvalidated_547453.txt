How to interpret anova(model, test = “Chisq”) for logistic regression model?

I’m new to logistic regression and was hoping for some help in picking a "best fit model". Say I have a group of students who are assigned a job after college. Everyone can request their top 5, but there's no telling if they'll receive it or not. Say I use logistic regression to see if a student receives their top job choice or not (0=no, 1=yes) and then a variety of independent variables gender (Male or Female) race (White, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Other) math gpa (continuous 0-100) English gpa (continuous 0-100) tier (top, middle, or bottom of class) How do I know which variables I should keep in the model for best fit? So if I run the model with all the variables and I get an output like this Call: glm(formula = receive_top1 ~ gender + race + tier + math_gpa + English_gpa, family = "binomial", data = data) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error. Z Value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -16.7. 2.95. -5.66. 0.00000000015 genderFemale 0.09 0.19 0.48 0.63416 raceAsian -0.26 0.40 -0.66 0.50936 raceBlack 0.33 0.35 0.94 0.34580 raceHispanic 0.23 0.26 0.88 0.38112 raceOther 0.43 0.32 1.35 0.17610 tierMiddle -0.13 0.23 -0.55 0.57952 tierTop -0.64 0.35 -1.85 0.06433 math_gpa 0.10 0.02 4.92 0.00000000888 English_gpa 0.06 0.02 2.80 0.00504 Null Deviance: 1327.5 on 967 degrees of freedom Residual Deviance: 1249.6 on 957 degrees of freedom AIC: 1271.6 And I'm using a p-value of 0.05, how do I know which variables are important to the model? It seems to me like the intercept, math_gpa and English_gpa are significant. However when I run anova(model, test = "Chisq") I get confused. Model: binomial, link: logit Response: receive_top1 Terms added sequentially (first to last) DF Deviance Resid. DF Resid. Dev Pr(>Chi) NULL 967 1327.5 gender 1 1.15 966 1326.4 0.2836 race 4 1.39 962 1325.0 0.8467 tier 2 40.44 960 1284.5 0.00000001657 math_gpa 1 23.06 959 1261.5 0.00000015 English_gpa 1 7.96 957 1249.7 0.00478 But now looking at the anova output this makes it seems like tier is also significant as well as math_gpa and English_gpa . Could someone also explain what the null hypothesis is in this case for the anova function? How do I know what independent variables to keep in my model? Should I keep tier in? Take it out?
