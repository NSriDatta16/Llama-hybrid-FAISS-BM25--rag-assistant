Your dataset has a lot more attributes than instances (or samples). It is possible that the SVM doesn't have enough data to learn from. The Naive Bayes classifier can deal with such situations better. Due to the independence assumptions, the amount of instances it needs does not scale exponentially with the number of attributes, as is true of many other classifiers.
