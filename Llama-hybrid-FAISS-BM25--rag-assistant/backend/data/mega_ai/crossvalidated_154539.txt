You should pick the model that performs best on the your holdout sample. Your holdout set reduces the risk of overfitting. The model that is more precise on your training set could be the model that is overfit. ( What's a real-world example of "overfitting"? ) In other words, you should pick the model that will have the lowest prediction error on future data when your project is running in production. I recommend Chapter 7 of "The Elements of Statistical Learning", a free but excellent book by famous Stanford machine learning experts. http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD/ESLII_print4.pdf Ultimately it depends on your use case. You tagged this question as a 'machine learning' question, so I'm assuming your use case considers predictive power to be more important than explanatory power.
