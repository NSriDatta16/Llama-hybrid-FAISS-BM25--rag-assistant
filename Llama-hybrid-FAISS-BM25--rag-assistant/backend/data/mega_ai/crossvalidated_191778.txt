A nice resource, which also gives a good example on imposing linear restrictions on a VECM can be found in Lecture 12 of Sebastian Fossati as part of his econ 509 course at the University of Alberta. [1] Additionally I would like to add, that the code example provided needs the library(dae), which includes rmvnorm.
