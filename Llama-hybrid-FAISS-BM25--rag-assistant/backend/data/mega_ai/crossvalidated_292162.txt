Just a suggestion, if your classifying a sequence with an RNN you could add a final fully-connected layer that combines the output of the RNN with your static features (by concatenation) before going to the softmax and outputting the predicted class probabilities. Since this final layer is fully-connect with its own set of weights, as long as you scale the features to zero mean and unit variance, the weighting would be done automatically when training the network.
