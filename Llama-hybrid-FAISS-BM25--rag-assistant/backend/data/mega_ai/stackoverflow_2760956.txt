Sometimes you'll need pointers to interface your C# to the underlying operating system or other native code. You're strongly discouraged from doing so, as it is "unsafe" (natch). There will be some very rare occasions where your performance is so CPU-bound that you need that minuscule extra bit of performance. My recommendation would be to write those CPU-intesive pieces in a separate module in assembler or C/C++, export an API, and have your .NET code call that API. An possible additional benefit is that you can put platform-specific code in the unmanaged module, and leave the .NET platform agnostic.
