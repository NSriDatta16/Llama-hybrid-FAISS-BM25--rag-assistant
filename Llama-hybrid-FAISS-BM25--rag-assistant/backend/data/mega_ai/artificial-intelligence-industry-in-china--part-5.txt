afeguards user data. Under these draft measures, companies bear legal responsibility for training data and content generated through their platforms. In October 2023, the Chinese government mandated that generative artificial intelligence-produced content may not "incite subversion of state power or the overthrowing of the socialist system." Before releasing a large language model to the public, companies must seek approval from the CAC to certify that the model refuses to answer certain questions relating to political ideology and criticism of the CCP. Questions related to politically sensitive topics such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre or comparisons between Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh must be declined. In 2023, in-country access was blocked to Hugging Face, a company that maintains libraries containing training data sets commonly used for large language models. A subsidiary of the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, provides local companies with training data that CCP leaders consider permissible. In 2024, the People's Daily released a LLM-based tool called Easy Write. Microsoft has warned that the Chinese government uses generative artificial intelligence to interfere in foreign elections by spreading disinformation and provoking discussions on divisive political issues. The Chinese artificial intelligence model DeepSeek has been reported to refuse to answer questions relating to things about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, persecution of Uyghurs, comparisons between Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh or human rights in China. Leading companies Leading AI-centric companies and start-ups include Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, SenseTime, 4Paradigm and Yitu Technology. Chinese AI companies iFlytek, SenseTime, Cloudwalk and DJI have received attention for facial recognition, sound recognition and drone technologies. China's government takes a market-oriented approach to AI, and has sought to encourage private tech companies in developing AI. In 2018, it designated Baidu, Alibaba, iFlytek, Tencent, and SenseTime as "AI champions". In 2023, Tencent debuted its large language model Hunyuan for enterprise use on Tencent Cloud. New leading AI startups include Baichuan, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI and MiniMax which were praised by investors as China's new "AI Tigers" in 2024. 01.AI has also been touted as a leading startup. In January 2025, DeepSeek launched its model DeepSeek-R1 and surprised the Western world. Its performance with minimal hardware is comparable to the leading models in the US. DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer, a privately owned company in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. Impact Economic impact Some analysts hold optimistic views about AI's economic impact on China's long-term economic growth. In the past, traditional industries in China have struggled with the increase in labor costs due to the growing aging population in China and the low birth rate. With the deployment of AI, operational costs are expected to reduce while an increase in efficiency generates revenue growth. Some highlight the importance of a clear policy and governmental support in order to overcome adoption barriers including costs and lack of properly trained technical talents and AI awareness. However, there are concerns about China's deepening income inequality and the ever-expanding imbalanced labor market in China. Low- and medium-income workers might be the most negatively impacted by China's AI development because of rising demands for laborers with advanced skills. Furthermore, China's economic growth might be disproportionately divided as a majority of AI-related industrial development is concentrated in coastal regions rather than inland. An influential decision by the Beijing Internet Court has ruled that AI-generated content is entitled to copyright protection.
