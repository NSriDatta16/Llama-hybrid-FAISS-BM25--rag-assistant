Reasons for using a DLR-based language rather than C# for scripting tasks?

I'm considering embedding a scripting language into one of my software projects and have identified two options: compiling C# at run-time via CodeDOM and embedding a DLR-based scripting language. Both options would give me full access to the .NET Framework. The operation that I'd be scripting would be a user-defined transformation of a DataRow and a set of metadata resulting in a modified DataRow. I expect these transforms will be composable and frequently invoked. Of course, I expect the transforms to be provided and modifiable by the end-user. With this workload in mind, are there any clear advantages to using one approach over another?
