You have prior knowledge that the breakpoint can only occur at values between 5 and 20. Therefore, Bayesian modeling is well suited to this task. One further advantage of going Bayesian is that you can quantify the uncertainty of the change point. Using the mcp package, you could do: library(mcp) model = list( mean ~ year, # y ~ z (with implicit intercept) ~ year # also y ~ z (with implicit intercept) ) prior = list(cp_1 = "dunif(5, 20)") fit = mcp(model, data = birdpred, prior = prior) If you know more about likely values in the interval, you could also do something like prior = list(cp_1 = "dnorm(15, 5) T(5, 20)") to truncate another distribution to the interval. Read more about using priors in mcp . If you want the segments to be joined, the second segment should be ~ 0 + year . Among others, you can inspect the fit using plot(fit) , plot_pars(fit) , and summary(fit) .
