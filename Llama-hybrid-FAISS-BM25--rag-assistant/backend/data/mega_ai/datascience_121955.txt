I think that you should apply classification, given that the target variable attendance is binary with values of 0 and 1 . Among the three machine learning tasks you mentioned: classification, regression, and clustering, there exists a simple rule that tells you when you should apply each one. If the target variable that you are trying to predict is categorical, i.e., it can take up a pre-defined finite set of possible values (as in your case, attendance can be either 0 or 1, it can't be 0.5 or 15, or red ) then you should apply classification. Else, if the target variable that you are trying to predict is numerical, i.e., it can take up a (theoretically) infinite set of possible values; example: predicting house prices, then you should use regression. Else, if the target variable is not available, in other words, it doesn't exist, then you use clustering. Clustering will group your data by similarity and is a bit different concept of machine learning from the previous two.
