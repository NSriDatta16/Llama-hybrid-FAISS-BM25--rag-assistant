I'm answering my own question for the reference of future people who might find it helpful. I've accepted David Wright 's answer , though, because it contains the actual solution and he did all the work. In this case, I used ARIMA, specifically the auto.arima function in the R package forecast . I wanted to be able to implement my solution computationally due to the large size of my data sets, so R was very useful. Using this function, the mean and standard error thereof were simply printed to the screen, saving me a lot of work. Thank you, Carl , for mentioning ARIMA in the first place, and David Wright for expanding upon the process. You were both very helpful. I also enjoyed David's explanation of the model-independent method, and I'll definitely look into that more. I was only able to obtain an estimate for the mean when $d=0$ (that is, the ARIMA model featured no differencing). That makes sense, since the mean would be reduced to zero (or something close?) by differencing, but it's worth mentioning. As it transpired, the optimal ARIMA model (restricted to $(p, 0, q)$, as above) for most — but not all — of my data sets turned out to be $(0, 0, 0)$. If I'm not mistaken (which I may well be!), this means the variation in the data can be represented by white noise and wasn't correlated after all, so I was being over-cautious. Regardless, it's good to have confirmed that, and this question might prove useful to someone with a more strongly correlated time series at some point.
