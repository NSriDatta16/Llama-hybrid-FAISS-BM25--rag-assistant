Birth Death process

An office has two employees that process incoming orders. these two are always busy and they process the orders at the rate of 100/day for each person. However they are smokers. On an average they will take a smoke break every 50 minutes (distributed exponentially) and it takes an average of 5 minutes to return to work (distributed exponentially). Calculate the Steady state probabilities that 0,1,2 are working. Find the expected output of these people in a 25 day work period assuming an 8 hour work day. I understand that this is a birth death process modelling machine breakdown. But I am not sure how to solve the same using the same.
