This is the problem with handing your business objects directly to the marshaller - you have very little flexibility in how they turn that object into the response. There is something to be said for pre-transforming the objects yourself, you get more control that way. So if you have a specific output structure that you want, then with XStream you need to build a class structure that looks like it. You then transform your business objects into that class structure, and pass that to XStream instead. It may seem less elegant, but your system will be much less prone to being broken by small changes in your business object model, which you your current XStream-based system will be.
