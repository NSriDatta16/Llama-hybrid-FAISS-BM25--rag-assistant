extract/slice/reorder lists in (emacs) lisp?

In python, you might do something like i = (0, 3, 2) x = [x+1 for x in range(0,5)] operator.itemgetter(*i)(x) to get (1, 4, 3) . In (emacs) lisp, I wrote this function called extract which does something similar, (defun extract (elems seq) (mapcar (lambda (x) (nth x seq)) elems)) (extract '(0 3 2) (number-sequence 1 5)) but I feel like there should be something built in? All I know is first, last, rest, nth, car, cdr ... What's the way to go? ~ Thanks in advance ~
