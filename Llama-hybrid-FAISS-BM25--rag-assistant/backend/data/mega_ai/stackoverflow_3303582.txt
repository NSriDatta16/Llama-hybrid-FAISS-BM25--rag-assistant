.NET - need 10 points around an ellipse

Simple code fragment below draws an ellipse on a VB.NET panel. I now need to locate 10 points ON that ellipse, so I can draw small circles along the edge (the final effect will be an elliptical "table" with 10 "seats" around it. Help filling in the center of my loop below appreciated. Private Sub Panel1_Paint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) Handles Panel1.Paint Const OFFSET As Integer = -36 Dim g As Graphics = e.Graphics Dim r As Rectangle = Panel1.ClientRectangle Dim iAng As Integer r.Inflate(OFFSET, OFFSET) g.DrawEllipse(Pens.Black, r) For i As Integer = 0 To 9 iAng = i * 36 Next End Sub
