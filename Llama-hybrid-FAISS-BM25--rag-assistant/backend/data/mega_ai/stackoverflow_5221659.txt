With #if CHAR_BIT * sizeof (long long) != 64 #pragma error "long long is not 64 bits" #endif or some equivalent. Based on comment: if you want to support compilers where sizeof can't be used in the pre-processor, see this thread: http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread13553.html Something like this: char longlongcheck[(sizeof(long long) * CHAR_BIT) == 64]; // won't compile if the expression is 0.
