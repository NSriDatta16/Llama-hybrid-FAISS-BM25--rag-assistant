How can I improve the accuracy of my neural network on a very unbalanced dataset?

I have a dataset which contains data for about accidents. The dataset consists of about 15.000 entries and I can't get more. The Distribution is as follows: 88.6% of the data are class 1 accidents 10.6% of the data are class 2 accidents 0.8% of the data are class 3 accidents As you can see, the biggest part of the training data belongs to one class. I have only very few examples for class 3 accidents (about 100 rows out of 15.000), but it would be most important to classify class 3 accidents correctly. I trained a pretty standard deep neural network on the data and got an accuracy of ~93% on the validation set. I used a custom Tensorflow estimator with an AdamOptimizer and tuned the parameters as good as possible. The Problem is, the network still classifies most of the accidents as class 1 accidents. So if I have for example 25 class 3 accidents in the validation set, the network misclassifies 10 of them as class 1. I want to improve that. Are there any methods to improve the performance in this case? The obvious choice would be to get more data of class 3 accidents, but sadly that is not possible. Does it make sense to show the existing class 3 data multiple times? So for example, train 5 Epochs with all data and then 3 additional Epochs with just the class 3 accidents? Or could I do something during the data preprocessing? Right now I'm MinMax-Scaling the input data to get to the [0, 1] interval. Is there maybe any other way to emphasize outliers more? (If you assume outliers mostly belong to class 3) I hope someone knows some methods to increase the accuracy in this case. EDIT : The Dataset has mostly categorical columns like: Street Class (e.g. highway or country road) Light (e.g. "good") Weather (e.g. "rainy" or "sunny") ... Additional it has these columns: Accident Date (just month and day) Age Time of the day Number of injured persons Number of Vehicles So an entry might look like this: { street_class: 'highway', light: 'daylight', date: '23. Jan', age: 59, injured_persons: 2, vehicles: 2, time: 1724, label: 1 ... }
