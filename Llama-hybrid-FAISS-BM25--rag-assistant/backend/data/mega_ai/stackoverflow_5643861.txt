Need help with output of asterisks and indexes using arrays

The output of this program on fortran 95 displays asterisks instead of digits. Also I cannot get the Experiment# to print as intended like so; Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3 and so on. Instead it prints as follows; Experiment 1, Experiment 1, Experiment 1. Any ideas on how I can fix this issue? Below is my program in its entirety. Thanks for your time. PROGRAM numbersgen IMPLICIT NONE !Variable declaration INTEGER, DIMENSION(:,:),ALLOCATABLE::numarray INTEGER, DIMENSION(:),ALLOCATABLE::temparray INTEGER:: numrolls, numexps INTEGER:: i=0, j=0 REAL:: avg=0, sdv=0, variance=0, sum=0 INTEGER:: k, min, pos, temp ............. ------ REAL, INTENT(IN):: sum REAL, INTENT(IN):: avg, variance, sdv PRINT*, " " PRINT*, "Sum: ",sum PRINT '(1X,A,F5.3)', "Average: ",avg PRINT '(1X,A,F5.3)', "Variance: ",variance PRINT '(1X,A,F5.3)', "Standard Deviation: ",sdv END SUBROUTINE END PROGRAM
