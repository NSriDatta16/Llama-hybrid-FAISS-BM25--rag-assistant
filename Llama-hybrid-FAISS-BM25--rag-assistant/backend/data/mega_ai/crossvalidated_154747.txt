Assigning weights in stat evaluation of NFL quarterbacks

I'm doing a statistical analysis of multiple former and current NFL quarterbacks to try to determine who is the best ever. Basically, I'm doing this by evaluating how much better or worse than a season's league average a player was in total yards, completion percentage, yards per attempt and TD:Int ratio. I find a player's percentage increase or decrease from a season's league average for a given statistic and add up those deviations for four different categories: regular season, five-year peak, postseason and Super Bowl. Anyway, the issue I'm running into is that of high variability, particularly with TD:Int ratio. I've evaluated Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, and TD:Int ratio made up 67% of both of their subtotals. Most league average ratios are around 1, and it's not terribly difficult for an above average QB to have a 2:1 ratio. I'm trying to bring down the splits so that, generally speaking, total yards, completion percentage, yards per attempt and TD:Int ratio are all around 25% of the subtotals. Thoughts on how to do that, and thoughts on my research in general? Thank you!
