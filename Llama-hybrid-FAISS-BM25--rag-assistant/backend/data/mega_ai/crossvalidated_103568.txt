I just wanted to point out that there is recent work trying to develop a test statistic specifically for the LASSO, which takes into account the feature selection being performed: A significance test for the lasso. Richard Lockhart, Jonathan Taylor, Ryan J. Tibshirani, Robert Tibshirani. http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7161 I haven't seen this used in applied work yet however, whereas bootstrapping certainly is used.
