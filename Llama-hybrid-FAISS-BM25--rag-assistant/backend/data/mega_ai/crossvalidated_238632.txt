The current answers focus on the proper (mathematical) definition of a stochastic optimization target - I want to provide a somewhat more applied perspective. This problem occurs frequently when fitting stochastic models, e.g. using informal or synthetic likelihoods. Reference (1) provides you with a list of options that can be used to define the distance between a stochastic model and the data. After having defined your target in this way, the issue that remains is finding the optimum of some mean of a noisy target. There are two routes to go, a) optimization, and b) MCMC sampling. You were asking specifically about optimization, but I want to bring in the MCMCs because they are often better behaved for this task. a) If you stay with optimization, you need to make sure that you don't get stuck and that the optimizer can deal with a stochastic target. Chapter 4 in the PhD thesis of Matteo Fasiolo gives some hints, see (2). b) As we note in (1), MCMCs are generally more robust against a stochastic target - under mild conditions regarding the distribution of the noise, the MCMC will average the noise away, and the sampled target will be indistinguishable from a non-noisy target with mean of the noisy target. However, MCMCs too can get stuck when encountering an evaluation that is particularly good. What you MUST NOT DO now is getting the following "obvious" idea: simply calculate both current and proposed value in each MCMC iteration. The keyword to look up here is "pseudo-marginal", see also here and here . 1) Hartig, F.; Calabrese, J. M.; Reineking, B.; Wiegand, T. & Huth, A.
