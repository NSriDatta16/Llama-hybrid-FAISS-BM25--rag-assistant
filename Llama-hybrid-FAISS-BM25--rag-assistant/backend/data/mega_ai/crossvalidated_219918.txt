Does reinforcement learning apply to this type of problem?

My problem can be described as follows: In my problem, the state does not influence the observations seen by the agent, but the state decides the rewards for the agent. So, the agent has to do its best to get more rewards, but it can't influence the observations. Does reinforcement learning apply to such problems? Imagine multiple shelves / racks where boxes of various sizes can be stored. A shelf can store 10 boxes of size 1 or 5 boxes of size 2 or 2 boxes of size 4 and 1 box of size 2 and so on. Given historical logs of insert and remove box requests, can we use RL to find the best location to place a box given the current openings in all the shelves? The goal is maximize storage and reduce small openings int he shelves because small boxes are rare. Can the algorithm take into account the historical insert and remove patterns?
