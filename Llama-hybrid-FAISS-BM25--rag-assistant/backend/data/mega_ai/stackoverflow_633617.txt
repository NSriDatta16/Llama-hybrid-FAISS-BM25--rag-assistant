What's the difference between Low-level functions & Top-level functions?

I need to understand the following sentence: "Charles Simonyi introduced the idea of organizing really big software teams by creating one super duper uber programmer writing the top-level functions , while handing off the implementation of the lower-level functions to a team of grunt junior-programmers as needed. They called this position program manager." I want to know what are the Top-level functions What are the lower-level functions? How can a program manager easily spot Top-level and Lower-level functions ? Can you provide Javascript examples of Top-level and Lower-level functions? BTW, the quote above is taken from Joel Spolsky, extracted from his blog about How to be a program manager.
