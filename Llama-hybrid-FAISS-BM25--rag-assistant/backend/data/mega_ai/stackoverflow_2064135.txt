Each trac-admin initenv creates a new instance of trac. If you want separate instances of trac for each of your projects, then creating separate trac environments is what you should do. If you want to use a single instance of trac for all your projects located in a single svn repository, then you should create a single environment for trac. Never tried running a single instance of trac with several repositories, don't know if it is possible. You might have to move all the projects to a single repo. At work we have several loosely related projects each with their own repository and an instance of trac running on windows and we have everything organized roughly like this: - projects - project_1 - trac - trac environment for project 1 - svn - svn repository for the project - misc - auth data and other stuff - project_2 - trac - trac environment for project 2 - svn - svn repository for the project 2 - misc - auth data and other stuff
