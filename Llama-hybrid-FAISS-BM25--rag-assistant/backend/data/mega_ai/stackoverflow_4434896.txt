How to compute the "15% of the time" randomness?

I'm looking for a decent, elegant method of calculating this simple logic. Right now I can't think of one, it's spinning my head. I am required to do some action only 15% of the time. I'm used to "50% of the time" where I just mod the milliseconds of the current time and see if it's odd or even, but I don't think that's elegant. How would I elegantly calculate "15% of the time"? Random number generator maybe? Pseudo-code or any language are welcome. Hope this is not subjective, since I'm looking for the "smartest" short-hand method of doing that. Thanks.
