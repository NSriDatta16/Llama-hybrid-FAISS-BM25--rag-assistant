Variational autoencoder obtain high likelihood but produce low quality sample?

I'm watching Ian Goodfellow's introduction to generative models. When he was introducing variational autoencoders at 22:29, he said: Variational autoencoders are good at obtaining high likelihood, but they tend to produce lower quality samples, and in particular, the samples are relatively blurry. My questions are: What does it mean by obtaining a high likelihood? Does it means that the density model that VAE learnt centres around those training samples? Is this the reason that causes VAE to produce low-quality samples? Why are the generated samples blurry? Is VAE averaging something when it is generating a new sample? When do we want high likelihood and when do we want high-quality samples?
