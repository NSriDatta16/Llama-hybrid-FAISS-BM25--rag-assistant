Not an answer to your question, but possibly a solution to your problem: VirtualBox (and probably others) supports "seamless integration" mode, which just gives you a second start bar and lets you drag windows around freely. Also, and this is an answer to your question, it depends on your compile settings. You can compile for different environments, and you can perfectly compile 32-bit programs on a 64-bit system with Visual Studio. Can't tell you how, but I'm sure some Visual Studio guru could help you out.
