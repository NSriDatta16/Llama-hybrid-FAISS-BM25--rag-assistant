It's a bad idea for a couple reasons: First, it assumes that your inputs will always be going into the database and into the database alone. What if something is going to be used in HTML output? Or in an email? Or written to a file? Or lots of other things.. your filtering should always be context-sensitive. More importantly, it encourages sloppy use of GET, POST, etc because there's no indication that they've been filtered. If someone sees you use echo $_POST['name']; on a page, how would they know it's been filtered? Or even worse... are you sure it has been? What about that other app? You know, the one you were just handed? What would new developers do? Would they even know that filtering is important?
