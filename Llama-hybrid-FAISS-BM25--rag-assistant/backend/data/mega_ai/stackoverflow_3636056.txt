Too bad nobody gave me the answer. It took me some time, but I managed myself. I made code to generate a Rijndael session key. Use this key for every element to encrypt and reference this key. In the last EncryptedData element I include the rsa encrypted sessionkey and a reference to the x509 certificate. This works. Bert
