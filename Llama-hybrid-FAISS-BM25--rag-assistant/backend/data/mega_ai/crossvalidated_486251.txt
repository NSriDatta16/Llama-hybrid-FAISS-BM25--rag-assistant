I think you meant correlation versus causation not correlation again! But with that, all we really are dealing with are correlations and that is fine for prediction, so that is a problem in any method you will choose to use. With tree models the splits can cause issues with a simulation strategy you are talking about, namely holding everything else the same and changing one thing slightly. If the simulation is your ultimate goal you may get more bang for your buck with linear models which sound like they may give you more theoretically sound results, although probably at the cost of some prediction accuracy. One of the strength of trees is that they are handling complex interactions nicely, so although you are changing one unit slightly in the simulation, in the real world that one unit may really move with other things which is why the tree is splitting where it splits. In terms of simulation research, if you turn to linear models then that is a very well researched and documented field but for you it really is as simple as just changing the variable and getting a different output. If you want to get 'in the trenches' with simulation and stats then bayesian models are the way to go.
