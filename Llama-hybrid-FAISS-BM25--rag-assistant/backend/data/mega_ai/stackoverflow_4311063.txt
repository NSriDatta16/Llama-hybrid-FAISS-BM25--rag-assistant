If you use the type "unsigned __int64" to declare all elements of the structure, you'll get an object with sizeof(S)=8, but the last two bytes will be unused and the first six will contain the data in the format you want. Alternatively, if you can accept some structure reordering, this will work #pragma pack(1) struct S3 { unsigned int a:15; unsigned int b:15; unsigned int d:2; unsigned short c:15; unsigned short e:1; };
