Here's a classic, econometric time series approach: find variance "regimes" as in an ARCH (autoregressive, conditional heteroscedasticity) method. Here's what Wiki has to say about ARCH models: In econometrics, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models are used to characterize and model time series. They are used at any point in a series, the error terms are thought to have a characteristic size or variance. In particular ARCH models assume the variance of the current error term or innovation to be a function of the actual sizes of the previous time periods' error terms: often the variance is related to the squares of the previous innovations. Such models are often called ARCH models (Engle, 1982),[1] although a variety of other acronyms are applied to particular structures that have a similar basis. ARCH models are commonly employed in modeling financial time series that exhibit time-varying volatility clustering, i.e. periods of swings interspersed with periods of relative calm. ARCH-type models are sometimes considered to be in the family of stochastic volatility models, although this is strictly incorrect since at time t the volatility is completely pre-determined (deterministic) given previous values. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity
