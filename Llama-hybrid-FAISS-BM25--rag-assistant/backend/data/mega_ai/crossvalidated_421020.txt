Which methods would you use in case of binary data?

The dataset is a full ranked binary dataset. Therefore, Y = 1 or 0 and X's = 1 or 0 . Y represents whether a car has an engine failure or not. X represents the features of the car, for example X1 is engine type A, X2 engine type B, X3 gear type etc. I want to know from your experience, which models work well on those type of datasets. I read somewhere, that LDA or KNN are not recommended, as well as SVM . Which information criterion would you use for forward selection? AIC , BIC ..? The data looks like this Engine_A Engine_B Engine_C Color_R Color_B Color_G Y_Failure Car1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 Car2 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 Car3 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 Would you factorize all variables X and Y ?
