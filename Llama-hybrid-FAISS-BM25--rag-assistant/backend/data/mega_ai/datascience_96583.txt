Using xgb.train function, you can set nthread in params . xgb.train({'nthread': 3}, dtrain) In the xgboost documentation , afaict, there is no clear way how to set the nthread parameter. Some global params are set by xgb.set_config and some are not, like nthread . But when I walk through their test script , I found nthread is set by params in xgb.train .
