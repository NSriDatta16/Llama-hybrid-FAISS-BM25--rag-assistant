What are the differences between using the natural log versus base-10 log for the logistic regression?

Normally logistic regression uses the natural logarithm, as opposed to a $\log_{10}$ base. If we have a regression for binary $Y$ where $p = \Pr(Y=1\mid X)$ , $$ \log_{10}\left(\dfrac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 $$ and we found $\widehat{\beta_0} = -2$ and $\widehat{\beta_1} = 3$ , then we can interpret $\widehat{\beta_0}$ as saying the log odds of $Y=1$ are 100 to 1 when $X_1= 0$ . Similarly, $\widehat{\beta_1}$ can be interpreted by saying that if $X_1$ increasing by 1, it implies that the odds of $Y=1$ increases by $10^3$ . Why isn't this interpretation preferred to what you would get from the natural log $\ln$ ?
