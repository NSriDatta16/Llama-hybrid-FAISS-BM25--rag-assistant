very poor quality of audio recorded on my droidx using MediaRecorder, why?

my project requires me to be able to record audio on an android device. i implemented solution using the MediaRecorder() but the recorded audio is in a terrible quality. what am i doing wrong? i must think that this cant be the only way to record audio :) perhaps i am doing something wrong, i am including my code below. please point me to the right direction. thanks! MediaRecorder recorder = new MediaRecorder(); File outputFile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "audio.3gp"); recorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC); recorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.RAW_AMR); recorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMR_NB); recorder.setOutputFile(outputFile.getAbsolutePath()); recorder.prepare(); recorder.start(); // stop recorder.stop(); recorder.reset(); recorder.release();
