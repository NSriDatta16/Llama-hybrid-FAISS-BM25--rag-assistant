iPhone: MKMapView Strange crash

I'm having an issue with a MKMapView , hope someone can help me. I have a view that embed a MKMapView and a navigationController. I push in my navigationController another viewController then another one again. Then if I go back to the MKMapView and touch the map, the application crash. so MkmapView > View2 > View3 > View2 > MKMapView > touch on the map then crash. I definitely don't understand why. If I only push another view then come back, it works well. So: MkmapView > View2 > MKMapView = OK I Use the other views in the same way in another part of the application without any problem. View1 > View2 > View3 > View2 > View1 = OK I checked, no memory warning viewDidUnload or dealloc method are called. The error is: *** -[NSURL length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4806930 This time it was an NSURL that crashed but it's almost all the time different: NSArray, NSDictionnary etc... Here is the stack trace: 0 0x3266bdf4 in objc_exception_throw 1 0x32de2bfc in -[NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:] 2 0x32d67b18 in ___forwarding___ 3 0x32d5e840 in __forwarding_prep_0___ 4 0x32cec074 in -[MKOverlayView _annotationViewForSelectionAtPoint:avoidCurrent:] 5 0x32ce4b60 in -[MKOverlayView annotationViewForPoint:] 6 0x32cc7efc in -[MKMapView _firstTouchBegan:withEvent:] 7 0x32d17e28 in -[MKScrollView _firstTouchBegan:withEvent:] 8 0x32d17c98 in -[MKScrollView touchesBegan:withEvent:] 9 0x30c4a888 in -[UIWindow _sendTouchesForEvent:] 10 0x30c49f94 in -[UIWindow sendEvent:] 11 0x30c45790 in -[UIApplication sendEvent:] 12 0x30c45094 in _UIApplicationHandleEvent 13 0x31bba990 in PurpleEventCallback 14 0x32da452a in CFRunLoopRunSpecific 15 0x32da3c1e in CFRunLoopRunInMode 16 0x31bb9374 in GSEventRunModal 17 0x30bf3c30 in -[UIApplication _run] 18 0x30bf2230 in UIApplicationMain 19 0x000025f8 in main at main.m:14 Does anyone had same kind of issue ?
