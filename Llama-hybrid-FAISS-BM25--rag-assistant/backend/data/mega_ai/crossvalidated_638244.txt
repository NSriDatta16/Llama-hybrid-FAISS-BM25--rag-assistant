CNNs are quite diverse with lots of different settings, i.e., such as kernel size, strides etc, see Torch cnn1d . Considering these settings, it is conceivable to produce a setting of 1D CNN that has the same complexity ( FLOPs ) of 2D CNNs or equal complexity. Best bet is to really restrict the settings and compute the FLOPs using a practical library, such as flops-counter with pytorch .
