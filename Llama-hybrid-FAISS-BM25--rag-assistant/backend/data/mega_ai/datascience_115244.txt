I think you have too few features. Try to do some feature engineering. Time series have a wealth of information, but it needs to be extracted somehow. Have you looked at things like stationarity/seasonality (for days, weeks months)? These can help you find more relevant features. First, use the very data as features. Have a variable with the number of the day, the number of the week, the number of the month. Also try to have some general. You already have "lag" features (values from previous days), but you can also try something like a moving window or expanding window augmented with statistics like maximum or mean or std attendance value for the time the window encompases. I know that I just stated some terms but you will find implementations with some googling. Having more features is the first step, then you can perform some sort of feature selection to keep only the best of them.
