I would say parse through the book and look for occurrences of the newline character. If it doesn't come after a period, then remove it. The only problem is that it wouldn't work in this particular case: He watched Kahlan as she walked with her shoulders slumped down.\n He watched Kahlan as she walked with her shoulders slumped down. Instead of: He watched Kahlan as she walked with her shoulders slumped down. He watched Kahlan as she walked with her shoulders slumped down. With that case, you will have to determine how paragraphs are separated (are they two newline characters?). If that's the case, check after a period, if there are two newline characters. If not, then delete the first newline character.
