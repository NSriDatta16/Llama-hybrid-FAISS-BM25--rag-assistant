Segmentation can be carried out with the Constraint Clustering and Classification (CONCC) algorithm to split a single series data into segments. Classification can then be carried out by algorithms such as decision trees, SVMs, or neural networks. Geological structure classification Exposed geological structures such as anticlines, ripple marks, and xenoliths can be identified automatically with deep learning models. Research has demonstrated that three-layer CNNs and transfer learning have strong accuracy (about 80% and 90% respectively), while others like k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), regular neural nets, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) have low accuracies (ranging from 10% - 30%). The grayscale images and colour images were both tested, with the accuracy difference being little, implying that colour is not very important in identifying geological structures. Forecast and predictions Earthquake early warning systems and forecasting Earthquake warning systems are often vulnerable to local impulsive noise, therefore giving out false alerts. False alerts can be eliminated by discriminating the earthquake waveforms from noise signals with the aid of ML methods. The method consists of two parts, the first being unsupervised learning with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn and extract features of first-arrival P-waves, and the second being use of a random forest to discriminate P-waves. This approach achieved 99.2% in recognizing P-waves, and can avoid false triggers by noise signals with 98.4% accuracy. Earthquakes can be produced in a laboratory settings to mimic real-world ones. With the help of machine learning, the patterns of acoustic signals as precursors for earthquakes can be identified. Predicting the time remaining before failure was demonstrated in a study with continuous acoustic time series data recorded from a fault. The algorithm applied was a random forest, trained with a set of slip events, performing strongly in predicting the time to failure. It identified acoustic signals to predict failures, with one of them being previously unidentified. Although this laboratory earthquake is not as complex as a natural one, progress was made that guides future earthquake prediction work. Streamflow discharge prediction Real-time streamflow data is integral for decision making (e.g., evacuations, or regulation of reservoir water levels during flooding). Streamflow data can be estimated by data provided by stream gauges, which measure the water level of a river. However, water and debris from flooding may damage stream gauges, resulting in lack of essential real-time data. The ability of machine learning to infer missing data enables it to predict streamflow with both historical stream gauge data and real-time data. Streamflow Hydrology Estimate using Machine Learning (SHEM) is a model that can serve this purpose. To verify its accuracies, the prediction result was compared with the actual recorded data, and the accuracies were found to be between 0.78 and 0.99. Challenge Inadequate training data An adequate amount of training and validation data is required for machine learning. However, some very useful products like satellite remote sensing data only have decades of data since the 1970s. If one is interested in the yearly data, then only less than 50 samples are available. Such amount of data may not be adequate. In a study of automatic classification of geological structures, the weakness of the model is the small training dataset, even though with the help of data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset. Another study of predicting streamflow found that the accuracies depend on the availability of sufficient historical data, therefore sufficient training data determine the performance of machine learning. Inadequate training data may lead to a problem called overfitting. Overfitting causes inaccuracies in machine learning as the model learns about the noise and undesired details. Limited by da
