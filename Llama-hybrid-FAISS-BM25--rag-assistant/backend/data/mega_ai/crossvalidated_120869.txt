Statistical test: Does actual time series data deviate from forecast?

I have made a prediction of future sales based on an ARIMA model. The ARIMA model is based on past data, during which there has been no marketing activity. During the period predicted by ARIMA, I will be running an Online marketing campaign. I would like to evaluate whether the marketing campaign had a statistically significant impact. I.e. I would like to test: H0: actual mean sales = ARIMA predicted mean sales (marketing did not work), H1: actual mean sales > ARIMA predicted mean sales. What is the best way to solve for this? Is it as simple as running a one-tail t-test (Welch's t-test if there is a big difference in variance between the two series?) Would really appreciate any help with this! Thanks
