Probably yes. Various software packages offer you the option for bespoke non-linear models e.g. in SAS you have PROC NLMIXED (frequentist estimation) or in R you have things like brms (Bayesian models) (there's also nlme ). Key considerations would be parameterization (e.g. do you put some quantities that can only ever be positive on a log-scale and then put exp(quantity) in where needed?), numerical stability (some things might be more stable on a log-scale or with certain in-built stable functions) and whether there should be random effects (and on what - e.g. is there a random ship effect on the intercept or perhaps do other parameters vary between ships?).
