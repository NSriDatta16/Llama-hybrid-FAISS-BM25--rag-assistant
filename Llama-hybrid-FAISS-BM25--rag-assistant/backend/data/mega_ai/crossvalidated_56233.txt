On the moving average question I have previously addressed this using a 'telescoping' approach. If you want an N period MA then for i less than N: $MA_i = (1 / i) \sum\limits_{j=1}^i p_i $ You then have to decide the trade off between the error in the burn in period and your need for data points and discard as appropriate.
