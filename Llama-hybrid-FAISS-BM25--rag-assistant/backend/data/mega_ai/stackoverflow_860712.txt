Here's a way to look at it: If there's no contention, then the spin lock is really fast compared to going to kernel mode for a Mutex. When there is contention, a CriticalSection is slightly more expensive than using a Mutex directly (because of the extra work to detect the spinlock state). So it boils down to a weighted average, where the weights depend on the specifics of your calling pattern. That being said, if you have little contention, then a CriticalSection is big win. If, on the other hand, you consistently have lots of contention, then you'd be paying a very small penalty over using a Mutex directly. But in that case, what you'd gain by switching to a Mutex is small, so you'd probably be better off trying to reduce the contention.
