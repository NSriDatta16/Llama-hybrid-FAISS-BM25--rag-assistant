A lot of the ruby "syntactic sugar" is enabled by the use of blocks (closures) which Java doesn't have. The Google Collections library has a lot of enhancements to the Collections API including support for a lot of a new data structures. The authors have tried hard to make collections easier to work with (especially when using Generics), but I don't think you're you're going to find the elegance of working with Ruby. I don't think there were any major language changes in Java 6; Java 7, currently in the works, has something called Project Coin but those are fairly small language changes - no big changes like Closure support.
