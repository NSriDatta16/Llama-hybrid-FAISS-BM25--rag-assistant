What is your sample size? If it is fairly large, you will be robust to non-normality unless there are extreme outliers in the data (mild non-normality is one of the most ignorable assumptions). An alternative to transforming the data is to weight the observations in each cell (combination of factors) by $weight = 1/\sigma^2$, where the variance is estimated by taking the $s^2$ of values in that cell. Again, there is an old rule of thumb for balanced ANOVA that says you don't have to worry much about non-constant variance unless some cells have standard deviations greater than twice that in other cells. The integer-response GLM models mentioned above aren't appropriate (you have, it appears, positive-valued continuous response), such as Poisson regression, Logistic Regression, Negative Binomial. However (thanks for jogging my memory, Nick) you MIGHT consider a GLM with Gamma family, since that is compatible with non-constant variance, but (in R at least) it has a fairly rigid model for the variance (assumes a constant shape parameter) so it might not be any better fit. It also might be harder to interpret and explain to others than a weighted ANOVA (or even unweighted ANOVA), so for practical reasons I'd lean toward the ANOVA and not a GLM. EDIT: Now that I see your data, I'd suggest that you try a transformation, such as $y_i^* = \sqrt{y_i}$, then apply regular ANOVA. This is because categories with larger means are associated with larger variances and the square root transformation will often correct that (in general, the Box-Cox transformation can be used).
