How to interpret the Score-Based CUSUM test results?

Context I'm doing an analysis of a price time series and checking for structural breaks (s.b. further on). One of these tests is the Score-Based CUSUM test. As far as I understand, this test is more dedicated to checking the instability of coefficients of the model fitted to the series. However, it is often proposed for s.b. testing (e.g. this post ). I use 3 lags for prediction (i.e. each new point is forecasted using 3 previous points); also I use efp from R : res = efp(y ~ y1 +y2+y3, data = d, type = "Score-CUSUM") The output is the following: Also, I use sctest(res) to obtain the p-value. Questions Q1. What do the plots show to us? Q2. What hypotheses sctest(res) tests in the given case. Any hint is welcome. NB. The series itself is the following:
