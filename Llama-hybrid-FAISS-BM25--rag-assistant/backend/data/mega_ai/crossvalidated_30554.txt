xts object to ts object / seasonal dummies for xts

I am trying to use a function from the forecast package, seasonaldummy() , which requires a time series object as input, but I have an xts object, call it x . So first, is it correct that xts objects can not be directly passed to functions that require a ts object? I then tried to coerce it to a ts object. I tried this by as.ts(x) . The function still produces an error. I looked at the xts vignette, and in particular the reclass function, but all I could understand from that was how to coerce non xts objects to xts. It appears I have to do the opposite, and that as.ts(x) does not work. I have put a MWE below, where the last two lines generate an error. > a = rnorm(20) > dt = seq(as.POSIXct("2010-03-24"),by="days",len=20) > library(xts) > a = xts(a,dt) > library(forecast) > seasonaldummy(a) Error in seasonaldummy(a) : Not a time series > seasonaldummy(as.ts(a)) Error in seasonaldummy(as.ts(a)) : subscript out of bounds
