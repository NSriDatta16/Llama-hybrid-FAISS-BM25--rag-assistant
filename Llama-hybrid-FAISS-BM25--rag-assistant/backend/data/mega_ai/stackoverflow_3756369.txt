if( new RegEx(",").Match(s).Matches.Count > 4 ){ //insert logic here } I'm doing this off the top of my head so don't kill me if it's not perfect code, but you get the gist of what i'm doing. You can leverage a regular expression to tell you exactly how many commas there are and to perform the required logic if the condition is met.
