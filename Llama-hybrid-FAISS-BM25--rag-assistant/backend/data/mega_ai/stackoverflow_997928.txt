I've always had success with a mix of local- and database-driven settings storage. Machine-specific settings were stored in an XML file on the machine (this included connection information for our root database), as were any application-specific (but not user-specific) settings. Anything user specific or enterprise-wide settings were stored in the database, including connection information for OTHER databases. In other words, we had a single database with this information in it, which the client could then use to connect to other databases. This allowed us to centrally maintain everything except the connection to our root database.
