You don't need to transform it for statistical reasons. Logistic regression does not make any assumptions about the distribution of independent variables (neither does linear regression). Whether you ought to transform it is another matter and depends on what you are trying to find out. Categorizing continuous variables is almost always a bad idea. I suggest using a spline of the IV and seeing if there are nonlinearities in the relationship with the logit. As to the outliers, you have to first figure out why you have those and what form of the relationship you are interested in. If you take the log of time then you change the relationship from additive to multiplicative. Is that what you want? Is that reasonable?
