I think you can approach your problem by dividing it into two stages: Clustering: use whatever method you deem appropriate for your data, e.g. k-means, k-medoids, HDBSCAN, etc. Explainable classification: train an explainable multiclass classifier on your data, using the clusters as labels. Alternatively, train one explainable classifier for each of the clusters (i.e. positive class is belonging to the cluster, negative class is not belonging), for instance, one logistic regression classifier per cluster. Then, interpret the predictor's influence in each classifier.
