Well, you are right, the relationship is weak, but not zero. I would guess positive. However, don't guess, just run a simple linear regression (OLS regression) and find out! There you will get a slope of xxx which tells you what the relationship is. And yes, you do have outliers that might bias the results. That can be dealt with. You could use Cook's distance or create a leverage plot to estimate the outliers' effect on the relationship. Good luck
