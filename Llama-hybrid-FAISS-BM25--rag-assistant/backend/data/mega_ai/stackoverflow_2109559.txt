Image Tag Flow Problem

i use this fluidgrid system: http://fluid.newgoldleaf.com/ I have the problem, if the first content element in a column is an image Tag, the content in the following column drops down. It only works, if the first content element is something like a paragraph or a headline etc., and the second is an image Tag. Why? :-) Thankx.
