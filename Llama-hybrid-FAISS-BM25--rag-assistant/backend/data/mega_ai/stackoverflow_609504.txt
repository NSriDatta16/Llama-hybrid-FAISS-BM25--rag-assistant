StringBuffer allFilesString = new StringBuffer(fileCollection.size()); Unless all your file.toString() is one character on average, you are probably making the StringBuffer too small. (If it not right, you may as well not set it and make the code simpler) You may get better results if you make it some multiple of the size. Additionally StringBuffer is synchronized, but StringBuilder is not and there for more efficient here.
