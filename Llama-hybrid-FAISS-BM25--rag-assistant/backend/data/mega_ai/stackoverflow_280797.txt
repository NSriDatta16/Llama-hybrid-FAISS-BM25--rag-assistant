Calculate poisson probability percentage

When you use the POISSON function in Excel (or in OpenOffice Calc), it takes two arguments: an integer an 'average' number and returns a float. In Python (I tried RandomArray and NumPy) it returns an array of random poisson numbers. What I really want is the percentage that this event will occur (it is a constant number and the array has every time different numbers - so is it an average?). for example: print poisson(2.6,6) returns [1 3 3 0 1 3] (and every time I run it, it's different). The number I get from calc/excel is 3.19 ( POISSON(6,2.16,0)*100 ). Am I using the python's poisson wrong (no pun!) or am I missing something?
