Magento: Set and store a global product filter

In Magento, how can layered navigation selection be kept when a new category is selected or a search is performed? Full story: We're developing a store which sells Books and eBooks. When I am navigating the store I generally want to see all products. I also want to be able to view a category and only see the Books or the eBooks exclusively. That can be easily achieved with an attribute "Product Type" and Layered Navigation. However, the problem is that if I select another category or perform a search, the current layered navigation filter is lost. I have to select the "Product Type" filter again. What are my options if I want to keep the layered navigation across multiple requests? Are there any suggestions on how to best organize my catalog if what I want can't be easily achieved with layered navigation? Would two top level categories for Books and eBooks be a better solution? But then how could I select the "Romance" category and still see Books and eBooks? Thanks!
