While not exactly what you are asking for (it's not ??=)... You could perhaps leverage Extension Methods. static void Main(string[] args) { object foo = null; object x = "something"; Console.WriteLine(foo.NullToValue(x)); } public static class ObjectExtensions { public static object NullToValue(this object obj, object value) { return obj != null ? obj : value; } } I haven't spent an exhaustive amount of time thinking of possible ways this won't work, but it does seem to pass the smell test in my sample application...
