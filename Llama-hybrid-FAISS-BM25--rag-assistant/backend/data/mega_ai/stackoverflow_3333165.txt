.Net Exception detail

How can one get detailed Exception thrown by the .net framework. The below log fragment shows something is wrong but what? A first chance exception of type 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' occurred in mscorlib.dll Unfortunately I can not catch this exception so I can not debug. Is there a way to get a detailed information about such exceptions? May be some tools etc.
