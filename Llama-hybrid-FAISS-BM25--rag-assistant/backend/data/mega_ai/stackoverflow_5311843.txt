Let's take LoadRunner out of the picture for a moment. All LoadRunner does is leverage the native capabilities of whatever operating system or application it is monitoring. So, with the removal of LoadRunner, how would you monitor these items using perfmon or other utilities in Window. Once you have that path set you should be able to educate LoadRunner to examine the same items. Try this: Run Performance Manager (Perfmon.exe) Hit the '+' sign to add a measurement Object = .net CLT Networking Metric, Connections established Similarly there are other counters present related to the network interface that may have some items of interest to you. Once you have the counters you want, simply add them to LoadRunner's native capability to inquiry a Windows host or (preferred) set up a monitor group in SiteScope that LoadRunner Leverages. Current releases of Loadrunner (at least since 8.x) ship with a 500 point SitScope license for use as a monitoring foundation.
