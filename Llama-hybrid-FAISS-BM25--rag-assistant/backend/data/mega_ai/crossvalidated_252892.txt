Testing if data normally distributed and interpretation!

I have two question related to if data are normal distributed or not and interpretation. I am using R for my analysis About my Data: I have a data set X (lets assume they are females) that consist of G groups (Grouped based on where they live). I am applying two approaches (A1, A2) to find the tallest female in each group. What I am comparing is: The time each approach takes to find the tallest female in each group. About Statistics: Function I am using in R (Studio) to calculate Wilcox is: wilcox.test(A1, A2, correct = F) Question (1): Is this the right way to use the test for my data? Kurtosis and Skewness are used to see if the data are normally distributed. If both of them greater or less than 0 then it means that the data are not normally distributed. When Kurtosis and Skewness not 0 & Wilcoxon (p-value) > 0.05 means: Not normally distributed and distribution is different. But what about when: Question (2): When Kurtosis and Skewness not 0 and 0 Edited: The reason I am doing this is, I want to compare the two approaches A1 and A2 in term of which one is faster. The problem I don't know which one to use the Mean or the Median, as if: The data are not normally distributed then I should use the median. The data are normally distributed then I should use the mean (average). so I am applying these three tests to decide which one to use.
