Beginner LINQ to XML inline XML error

Imports System.Xml.Linq Imports System.Linq Partial Class test2 Inherits System.Web.UI.Page Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Dim xml As XElement = My Title Kyle WROX End Sub End Class The above code is producing the following error: Compiler Error Message: BC30201: Expression expected. Source Error: Line 8: Line 9: Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Line 10: Dim xml As XElement = Line 11: My Title Line 12: Kyle Source File: C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\myproject\web\test2.aspx.vb Line: 10 Why? edit: Dim xml As XElement = New XElement("book", _ New XElement("title", "My Title"), _ New XElement("author", "Kyle"), _ New XElement("publisher", "WROX") _ ) The above code works, but obviously is not as elegant as the original and I would still appreciate an explanation of why my original syntax is wrong.
