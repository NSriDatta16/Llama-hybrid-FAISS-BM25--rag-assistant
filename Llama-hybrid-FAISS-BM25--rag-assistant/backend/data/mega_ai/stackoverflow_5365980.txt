In that big mess you could probably factor things out, apply theorems such as Demorgan's theorem, rearrange, and find that certain things cancel out or simplify, such as A(B+B') or BB'. That's just the general idea, not saying any of this will occur in that particular problem. It's just like normal algebra. Don't be intimidated by the fact that you are using letters, compliments, etc.
