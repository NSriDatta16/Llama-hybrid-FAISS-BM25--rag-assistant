Heterogeneity in residuals

I am very new in here, but I will try my best to create a good question. First of all I am doing some regression on Fama and French 3 factor model and an asset. Thus I am doing a OLS regression, using R code with the LM function, and wanting to rolling 1 step forcasts. However by doing a Breusch Pagan test I can see my residuals contains heteroskedasticity, furthermore they are not normally distributed. Since those a true violation of the OLS assumption, I tried different ways of correction the residuals, but without any luck. Data contains returns for an Asset, (MK-RF), SMB and HML, which all contains both negative, zero and positive values. LM Regression data $Date_format Date, format = "%m-%d-%y") data.xts Theese are the residuals, which a pagan tests tells me are heteroskedasticity. I tried to correct for this by using GLS, however not with much succes. glsModelx $fitted, glsModelx$ residuals) Furthermore I could not do a Breusch Pagan test on the GLS model > bptest(glsModelx) Error in as.data.frame.default(data) : cannot coerce class ‘c("glsStruct", "modelStruct")’ to a data.frame Any help or suggesting is aprreciated greatly, this problem have taken me hours.... Thank you very much. Please say if you need any other information.
