Bayesian Survival Analysis - COX PHD Time Varying Covariates Implementation

Suppose you are interested in the Survival modelling technique Cox Proportional Hazard, where we model the hazard as: $$ \lambda(t \vert x) = \lambda_0(t) exp (\beta x) $$ An extension of this model is time-varying covariates i.e. $$ \lambda(t \vert x(t)) = \lambda_0(t) exp (\beta x(t)) $$ Another extension is time-dependent effects i.e.: $$ \lambda(t \vert x) = \lambda_0(t) exp (\beta(t)x) $$ I am interested in time-varying covariates and have strong prior beliefs over the coefficients of the covariates (in the partial hazard) as well as the baseline. I have seen examples of Bayesian survival modelling (with Cox PHD) where you have time-dependent effects (i.e. a sequence of regression coefficients), see this example using PyMC3 and Python: However, in the situation where you have time varying covariates , I am yet to find an example or implementation of this in python (or R for that matter). My question is: Is there a reason why you do not see implementations of Bayesian time-varying covariates COX PHD? If no to the above, does anyone have a good example of an implementation? Many thanks
