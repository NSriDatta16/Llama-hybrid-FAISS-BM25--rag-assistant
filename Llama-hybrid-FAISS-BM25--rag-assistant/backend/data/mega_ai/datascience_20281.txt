At least for my current team (~80 data scientists and engineers), we don't have such preference. Half of the data scientists here use R and another half use Python. Many can code in both. We do deploy Python and R code in production. I don't think any of our data scientists uses Java at all. If they need to deal with big data, they can use SparkSQL or PySpark. The data engineering team uses a mix of Java/Scala/Python/Go. If you are one of few data people in a small company, I can understand why they require certain language skills so you can do both data science and engineering. But tbh, I think most small companies won't have data big enough that Python or R can't handle in production.
