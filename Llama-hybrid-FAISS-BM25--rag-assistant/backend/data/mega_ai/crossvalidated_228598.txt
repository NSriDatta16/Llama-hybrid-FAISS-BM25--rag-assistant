Can neural network can be used to predict pseudo-random numbers?

Given list of numbers which looks pseudo-random (like lotto numbers, stock prices, pseudo-random), is it is possible to train the network to attempt to predict the next numbers? Which network would be more suitable for this task? Feedforward, recurrent or any other neural network? Especially the one which will work without memorizing the entire training set, but the one which can find some patterns or statistical association.
