Winpcap is a netwok packet capture library for windows which i believe is a port of a *nix library. It is (or was, at one point) used by the network traffic anlyzer Wireshark (a.k.a. Ethereal) While I'm not certain if the library would work on WinCE, or whether it directly provides what your looking for, it may serve as a framework for any packet analysis that would need to be done in order to facilitate bandwidth use measurement
