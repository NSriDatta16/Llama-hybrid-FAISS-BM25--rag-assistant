You can actually create web applications in C++ using a toolkit called Wt (similar API to Qt). There is a standalone browser as well as a module for Apache. This way you can use C++ as your programming language the same way you would C# with ASP.NET, and thus you can also use your existing C++ code. It's not really elegant though. I'd actually recommend you learn Qt and write the whole application on top of it. It's incredibly portable and has an extensive API for just about everything - it's an application framework; GTK+ does just the UI, and in C, although the GTKmm wrapper for C++ is nice. Check it out at http://qt.nokia.com - it's available under the GNU LGPL.
