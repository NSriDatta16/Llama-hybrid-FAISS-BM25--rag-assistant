Spawning in Rails

I was using the spawn plugin ( http://rubyforge.org/projects/spawn/ ) which worked excellent. However, I then moved to Mongo (using mongo_mapper) and Spawn no longer worked. Modifying the plugin is beyond the scope of my abilities. Is there a simple way to do spawning in Rails that would work with Mongo? It's not an often-run process so it doesn't have to be the most elegant solution in the world. Thanks!
