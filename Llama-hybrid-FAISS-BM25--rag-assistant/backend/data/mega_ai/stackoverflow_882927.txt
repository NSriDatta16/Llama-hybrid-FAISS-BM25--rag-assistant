I suspect that the problem is Windows memory fragmentation. There is another question here on StackOverflow called Java Maximum Memory on Windows XP that mentions using Process Explorer to look at where DLLs are mapped into memory, and then to address the problem by rebasing the DLLs so that load into memory in a more compact way.
