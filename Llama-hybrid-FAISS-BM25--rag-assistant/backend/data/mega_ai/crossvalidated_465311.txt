There is no one-size-fits-all solution for this. The threshold could be judged by the researcher based on the association between the variables. For the high correlation issue, you could basically test the collinearity of the variables to decide whether to keep or drop variables (features). You could check Farrar-Glauber test (F-G test) for multicollinearity. Here is a link to do it in R for example: https://www.r-bloggers.com/multicollinearity-in-r/ For the scaling issue, the scaling (if you mean multiplication of variables by a real number), it does not affect the linear relationship across variables. It is however recommended to scale the features for SVM if you are using Euclidean distance metric as kernel.
