Expanding on my comment: Don't . Write your library code in portable C++; putting as much as possible of the functionality in the library, making sure you study the platform-specific APIs (probably Cocoa and .NET) as you go, so the interfaces to the library are at least moderately suitable for either. Then wrap your library in native binaries; ensuring that you pay attention to how applications are supposed to look on each platform, as well as the feel of them. Building an application that looks like an X11 application and does everything in a manner somewhere between a Gnome application, a KDE application, an OS X application and a Windows application will really hurt user experience. Badly .
