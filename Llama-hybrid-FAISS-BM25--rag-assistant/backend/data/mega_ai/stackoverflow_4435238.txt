The dates in time series are not referenced with "[". They are more like rownames in dataframes. They are stored in the "index" leaf of the attributes list. In addition to that, they are not of Date class but rather the DateTime class so you need to may use POSIXct: > attributes(junk)$index[1] junk [,1] 2010-02-01 1 2010-05-01 2 Edit: more accurately the attribute$index is internally in seconds but the time method will accept a variety of assignment classes.
