1. You could introduce a third variable (the actual image). More generally, you can put all your independent variables - actual image, age group, sex into a model for predicted image (e.g. a logistic regression model) and test various hypotheses. 2. If you reject the null, it's reasonable to look at the source of the difference. e.g. if you conclude that men and women are different, you can (for example) simply point to the sign of a coefficient and say 'it was significant because the women did better'. However, beware Simpson's paradox !
