How to allow users to create or edit web forms within a Spring MVC web application?

We would like to provide our users with a limited set of drag-n-drop fields so they could manage template web forms in an application. The admins would define these templates and the users would enter some data up front which would determine which template they would be shown. Is there a framework or some things I could check out on how to do this? We use Spring MVC 3 as our web layer and that would drive our solution. Thanks! E
