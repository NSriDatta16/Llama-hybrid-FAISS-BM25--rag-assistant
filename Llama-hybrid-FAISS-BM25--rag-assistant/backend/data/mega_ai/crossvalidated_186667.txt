Cross-validation on really small datasets

Let's say I have a small dataset: data I want to test the out-of-sample predictions of a regression model as a function of increasing training set size (increasing by 10% in each increment). I use the following procedure: test.set 1] results I repeat this procedure several times and take the average of the repetitions. My problem is that I get unreliable results. I am assuming this is because the dataset is really small. What could I do to get more reasonable estimates?
