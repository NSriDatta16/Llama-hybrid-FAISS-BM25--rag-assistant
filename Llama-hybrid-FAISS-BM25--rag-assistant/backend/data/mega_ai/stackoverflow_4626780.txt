Cache.SetMaxAge not working under IIS, works fine under VS Dev Srv

I'm trying to add a "max-age" header to my response. It works fine on my Visual Studio Development Server, but as soon as I move the app to IIS (tried both IIS express locally and IIS on the server) - the header disappears. My code: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0, 0)); VS Dev server response (all works just fine): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: ASP.NET Development Server/10.0.0.0 Date: Fri, 07 Jan 2011 14:55:04 GMT X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400 IIS7 Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 Date: Fri, 07 Jan 2011 15:00:54 GMT X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 Cache-Control: public PS. It's an ASHX-handler, if it matters...
