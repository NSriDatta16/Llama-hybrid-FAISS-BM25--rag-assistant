I'll try to answer your 2 questions here, How to get stats like mean/median of requests per config and plot charts? For this, Load testing tools like JMeter, Gatling, LoadRunner with graph support are better. Their advantages as compared to curl scripts are , They are more efficient/sophisticated in terms of understanding, sharing and are extensible, scalable. In short its standard practice in load testing. These tools support various other protocols Scenarios like caching, failure handling, response validation are handled out of the box. Stats calculation and graph generation is available as plugins or out of box in most of the above. How to get resource utilization of servers For this system monitoring tools are used. Examples are ganglia, munin, graphite-influxdb, sar etc. They have agents installed on cluster nodes and will send resource util data periodically to monitoring server. Plotting can be done using Grafana.
