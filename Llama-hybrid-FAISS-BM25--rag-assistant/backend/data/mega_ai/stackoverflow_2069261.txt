Flex HSlider dragging using slider track

I am a Flex/Flash newbie and am trying to create a simple Music player has play/pause button and an HSlider that shows the position of the song as it is playing using a custom SliderThumbClass. I would like allow the user to drag/drop the sliderthumb or click on the sliderbar to change the position of the song currently playing. With the code I have below, if I use the sliderThumb to change the position of the currently playing song, it works great. But I if I click directly on the slidertrack to jump ahead/back, the current position doesnâ€™t move and there is some flashing of the current position, but it jumps back to where it was and continues playing the song. This does work if I am in the paused state. As expected, thumbDrag/Press/Release events are not triggered when the user clicks on the sliderTrack - What events should I be subscribing for to handle this case? Thanks
