No. You need to understand what the code is doing and whether it is amenable to parallelization. Dependencies between your data items can make it hard to parallelize, i.e., if a thread uses the value calculated for the previous element it has to wait until the value is calculated anyway and can't run in parallel. You also need to understand your target architecture, though, you will typically have a multicore CPU on just about anything you buy these days. Even on a single core, you can get some benefits from more threads but only if you have some blocking tasks. You should also keep in mind that there is overhead in creating and organizing the parallel threads. If this overhead is a significant fraction of (or more than) the time your task takes you could slow it down.
