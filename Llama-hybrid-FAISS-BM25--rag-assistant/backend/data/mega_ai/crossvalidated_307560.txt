It seems that you neural network has already converged to a solution. You should see what is the best performance other people have achieved on the same dataset (since it's on Kaggle). For a problem like this, there is probably an upper bound for the accuracy that is below 1.0, since medical diagnosis has inherent uncertainties that can not be fully explained by the data. Looking at the dataset I believe this to be the case and think our performance is already pretty good.
