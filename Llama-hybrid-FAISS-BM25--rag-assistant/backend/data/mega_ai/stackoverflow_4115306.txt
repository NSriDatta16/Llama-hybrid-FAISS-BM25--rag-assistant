A different approach to translation of web applications

I have done a few websites and applications with support for multiple languages where I've used language xml files and a keyword inside my code. For my web app, I believe that method sucks. I love to read and understand my HTML code. This code doesn't make any sense: It looks good at the beginning but just ends up with unhappy programmers since the process of adding new features now requires putting stuff in XMLs all the time. My solution (I just wrote a simple test PHP parser an hour ago, do you think this will work on a large scale project?) I'm using english as my base language and this is how my source file looks: {{ I love colors }} My parser will use the text (a real text) as the key for a dictionary array. In this example, I'm translating from US english to UK english. $dictionary['I love colors']['en_GB'] = 'I love colours' No dictionary is required for my base language since it's already in the source file. There is a lot more to it like cache, fallbacks, dictionary storage etc. Do you think it will work in a large scale projects? It there something I haven't considered?
