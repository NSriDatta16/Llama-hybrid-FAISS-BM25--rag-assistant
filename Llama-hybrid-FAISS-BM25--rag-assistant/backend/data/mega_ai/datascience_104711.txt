Comparing machine learning algorithms on features selected by a neural network

I'm reading a paper where they use a neural network to select 9 features from tabular input data with 20 features. And then, this is what feels weird to me, they run several machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, naive bayes, decions tree, tree bagger, etc.) with these 9 features to compare the performance of the algorithms to the performance of the neural network. Does this step make any sense, and if yes, why? Citation: Korani, Walid, et al. "Machine learning as an effective method for identifying true single nucleotide polymorphisms in polyploid plants."
