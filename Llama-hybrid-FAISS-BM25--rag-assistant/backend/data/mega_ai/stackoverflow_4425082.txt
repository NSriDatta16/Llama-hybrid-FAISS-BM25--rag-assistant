git commit directory

I created a repo and, locally, dragged-and-dropped an existing project directory into the repo. I then did something like git add directory/ and committed it and pushed it. When I look at my repo on github though, all i see is the directory with no subfolders, no content. How do I push all of the files and subfolders of that project to the repo?
