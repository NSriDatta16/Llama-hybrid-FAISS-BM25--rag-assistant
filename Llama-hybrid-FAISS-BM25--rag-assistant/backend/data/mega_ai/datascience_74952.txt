Will GPU optimized model run on TPU?

There is a project which contains models in DLC format ( Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine - SNPE ) that I guess are optimized for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset (see second link). The project newly also introduced models in Keras format. My question is - will the Keras model run on Google Coral with Edge TPU ? If so, how fast? Is it needed to optimize the model for TPU?
