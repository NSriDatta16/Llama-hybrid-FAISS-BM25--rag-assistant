Changing the root_dir on a magento system

I want to create another instance of magento for development purposes. I've copied the site and the database and changed the connction string for the database. However, when I go to log in to magento it re-directs to the live site www.example.com rather than going to the test url test.example.com. Both instances exist on the same box. After a bit of digging arund I think I need to change the root_dir, but not sure where to change this. Can anyone help? Thanks Tom -- Edit -- I've updated the two fields in question in the database, but all urls still point to the production environment. Do I have to run a specific script to update all of these across the whole site? -- Edit 2 -- There was more than one instance of the two urls in the table, after updating these and deleting the cache and sessions directories from the var folder everything worked.
