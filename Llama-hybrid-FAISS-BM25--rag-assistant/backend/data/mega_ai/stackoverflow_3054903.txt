Preferred menus for C# application

Which of the menu tools do you use for C# windows applications? I began with MainMenu, but when I moved to VS2005, only MenuStrip appeared in the Toolbox, so I assumed it was new and better. However, the merge/replace action seems to require a lot more time and effort, and leave one open to maintenance problems. (Perhaps my real question is "what were they thinking when they created MenuStrip?) Do you drag/drop the menus, or do you write the code? Do you use MainMenu, MenuStrip, or some other alternatives?
