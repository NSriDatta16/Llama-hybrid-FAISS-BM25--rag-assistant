Per Justin's response, not only is it fine for the implementing developer to write the test, it's the de facto standard. It is, theoretically, also acceptable for another programmer to write the test. I have toyed with the idea of a "test" programmer supporting a "feature" developer, but I have not encountered examples. If I write a test for an object, in addition to the inputs and outputs I expect, I have to know the interface it exposes. In other words, the classes and methods under test must be decided upon before development begins. In twelve years I have only once worked in a shop that achieved that granularity of design before development began. I am not sure what your experiences have been, but it doesn't seem very Agile to me.
