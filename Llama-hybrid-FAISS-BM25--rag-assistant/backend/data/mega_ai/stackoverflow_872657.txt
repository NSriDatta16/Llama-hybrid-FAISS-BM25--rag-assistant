How do I start my Java program with more than one java agent?

I'm aware of how to start a java progam with a java agent: java -javaagent:myAgent.jar MyJavaProgram But what if I want to add 2 or more java agents to instrument my program? I do not want to reinvoke the java -javaagent:... for every agent I have to load in JVM. I've tried something like this : java -javaagent:agentA.jar, agentB.jar MyJavaProgram or something like this: java -javaagent:agentA.jar agentB.jar MyJavaProgram But have no success. Is there an answer to solve my problem ? Thank you.
