Can I simply remove one of two predictor variables that are highly non-linearly correlated?

I understood why we should avoid having linearly correlated variables in our model as asked in this question remove one of two linearly correlated variables .\ But should we do the same when we face non-linear relationship ? (In the case i would want to do a logistic regression logistic)
