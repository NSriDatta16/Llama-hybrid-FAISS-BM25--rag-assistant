AFAIK pragma directives are preprocessor and compiler directives and have not much to do with Qt itself. http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Pragmas.html http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-3-Manual/gcc/pragmas.html Qt provides some defines , which can be used to do things like enable/disable parts of the source code depending on which platform you are compiling: http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qtglobal.html You can use them like this: #ifdef Q_WS_MAC (some mac code goes here) #endif #ifdef Q_WS_WIN32 (some windows code goes here) #endif
