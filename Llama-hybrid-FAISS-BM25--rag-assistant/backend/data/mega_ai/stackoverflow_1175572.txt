Using the right tool for the job. I've got nothing against an object database, but SQL is very, very good at expressing queries in a functional manner which allow them to optomised and parallelised. The data needs to be regular to do this effectively which is why we have SQL Server. Effectively I see SQL as the right tool for the job of storing and searching phenomonally large data sets in an efficient way. You combine this with good tools and mappings and you should theoretically end up with the best of both worlds. PS: I do see a convergence to what you are describing, SQL 2005 already natively supports .Net data types and CLR procedures, so if this is embraced in the future we could have object databases leveraging the awesome base of SQL server.
