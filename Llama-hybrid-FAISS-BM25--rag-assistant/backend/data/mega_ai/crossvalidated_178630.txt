An LSTM has the following core components (not present in RNNs): Forget gate -which allows the LSTM to forget its past state or remember some elements of it Input gate - this gate decides what part of the new input arriving at the current step should be allowed to influence the cell's state Output gate -this gate determines what part of the cell's output should be allowed to flow out-typically to be consumed as a prediction A "cell" is a word used interchangeably for an individual LSTM.
