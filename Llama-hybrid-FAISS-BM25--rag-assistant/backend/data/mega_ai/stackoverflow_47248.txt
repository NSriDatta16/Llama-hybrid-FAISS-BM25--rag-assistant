Is there a Firefox 3 addon similar to View Source Chart?

Before I upgraded to Firefox 3 I used to constantly use the View Source Chart Firefox Addon which shows the source HTML in a very organized, graphical form. Unfortunately, this addon is only for Firefox 2 and the beta version for Firefox 3 now costs $10 on the author's site. Anyone know of a similar addon that works for Firefox 3? (of course, I might indeed pay $10 for this, but first want to ask around if there isn't anything better and free, as the version for Firefox 2 had its limitations and I don't really want to pay $10 for something in beta that I can't test out before paying for it.)
