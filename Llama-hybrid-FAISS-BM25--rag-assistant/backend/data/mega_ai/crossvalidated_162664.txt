SVM Classifier with HOG Features

I am interested in having a system to detect and recognize speed limits from traffic signs. The detection part works fine, meaning that I am able to detect them inside any image. Now I would like to classify the result of the detector. What is the correct way to do that? For example, I would like to recognize a speed limit of 50. Should I train an SVM with traffic signs of 50 as positive samples and as negative samples use what? Should I use all of the remaining speed limits (20, 30, 40, 60, 70....) as negative training samples? Is this the only way? Is there any other way (again using SVM) to do that? I am using Matlab's svm.
