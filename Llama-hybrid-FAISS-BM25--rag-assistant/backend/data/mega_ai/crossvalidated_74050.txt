Variational Bayes vs EP and other message-passing methods

I am trying to understand the difference between: Expectation Propagation (EP) Variational Bayes Wikipedia says: Expectation Propagation differs from other Bayesian approximation approaches such as Variational Bayesian methods. Why isn't EP considered a Variational Bayes method? Isn't EP Bayesian, and relies on message-passing to approximate the posterior? What makes a method Variational Bayes? Also, what about the following methods. Can they be considered Variational Bayes? Sum-product Mean-field methods Bethe-Kikuchi approximations
