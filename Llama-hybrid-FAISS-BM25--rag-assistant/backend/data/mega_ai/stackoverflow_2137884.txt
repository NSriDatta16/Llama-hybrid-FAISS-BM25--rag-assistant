If you intend for the content to be a subsection (i.e. a distinct separation, not merely a paragraph block) of the section you're in, use the next available heading level. Otherwise, just stick it in a paragraph. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid wrapping your elements in a div tag just for the sake of having a div tag. It's not semantic and may throw off search engine spiders.
