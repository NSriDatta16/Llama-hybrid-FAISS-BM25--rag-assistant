The question you asked: I haven't tried it, but in theory you should be able to create the Event object and get a handle on the Swing Event Queue from one of the system classes. However without having a valid component, there may be problems when methods try to work with the event. What you probably meant: Registering events for a standard window -- you should be able to set up drag and drop support for an empty JPanel or JFrame, but it'll take some hacking. Drag & Drop is a pain to work with at this level when not built in -- I suggest using something like an invisible component or something instead.
