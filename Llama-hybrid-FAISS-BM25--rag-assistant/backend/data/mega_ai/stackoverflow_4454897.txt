Screen Scraping | Web Crawling

I just have a few questions about the topic. Can someone explain the advantages and disadvantages of using the following languages to write a scraper: Java/Groovy Perl PhP Selenium Python I'm also wondering what kind of issues to expect to face while scraping and perhaps how I should deal with it. For instance, I have come across fragment identities and haven't found a way to deal with it yet. (I'm using htmlunit) Just looking for some pointers for those who know a bit about the topic.
