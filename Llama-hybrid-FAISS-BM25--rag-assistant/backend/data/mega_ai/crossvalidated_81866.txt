You may consider a nonstationary time series as consisting of a number of time segments that are stationary. You can do it either manually or using methods related to the algorithm discussed here . Once segments are identified, you can estimate the mean, variance and the autocovariance structure of each stationary segment. The fact that time series is non-stationary does not automatically make the assumption of normality inappropriate. Also note that for a non-stationary time serires the long-run mean is undefined. For example, how would you define the mean of a random walk? The local means of stationary segements we refer to as levels of the process. To estimate levels at any given point of (discrete) time, we use methods appropriate for non-stationary time series, such as those of exponential smoothing.
