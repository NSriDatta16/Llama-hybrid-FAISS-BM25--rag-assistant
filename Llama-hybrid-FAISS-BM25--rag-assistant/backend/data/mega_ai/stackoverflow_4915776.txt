Given a noun, what's the best way to determine the "gender"?

I'm given the task of determining whether an advertisement is suited for male or female. What's the best way of determining this? The words looks like this: Cheetos Coca Cola Nike Ferrari 24 Arrested Development Transformers Nestle American Eagle For each word, I'd like to know if it's more associated to male or female. It doesn't have to be correct. I know it's hard to tell if "nike" is suited towards male or female. Just any methodology would help me brainstorm.
