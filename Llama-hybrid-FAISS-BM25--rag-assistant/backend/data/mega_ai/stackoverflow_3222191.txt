The above poster is correct in offering a viable solution that already exists within the flash platform. Depending on your requirements you may just be looking to reduce your code library or save some time you could look into utilizing a cross compilable language like Haxe. In this case you would write code in the Haxe language (similar to ECMAScript) that can then be cross compiled to C++/neko/flash ASVM2/PHP, etc..
