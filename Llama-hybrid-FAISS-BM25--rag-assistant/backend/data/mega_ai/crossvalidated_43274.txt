Over classification may be caused by prediction bias, which is a problem for the canonical RF method and for which a number of modifications have been researched. Probably the principal approach to mitigating bias is to utilise randomised split thresholds, sometimes referred to as 'extreme' random forest. I'm not sure what flavour of RF is implemented in the R package, but certainly the problem will be more prominent when working with unbalanced classification data sets - by taking a majority vote the forest loses the information regarding the balance of votes, and that can and often will introduce bias to the classifications.
