For bioinformatics you may be interested on that: Blast on DB . The guy who is working on that is a friend of mine and has a work on fast similarity sequence search, he found out to make his own binary storage better than using databases at this point. I don't know specific details about his solution but you probably can exchange one or two ideias mailing the guy, even sharing code.
