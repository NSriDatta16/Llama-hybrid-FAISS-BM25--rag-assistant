Flagging an item as delete really complicates the information retrieval, and also, you need to deal with cascade remove by yourself. I would choose the "mail box" approach, that move deleted records to different table. I have done a project that use soft-delete, and I end up put all delete calls to Stored Procedure and handle the copy and remove in Stored Procedure.
