This also doesn't load in Safari 4. It's got something to do with a 404 on http://www.hupcapstudios.com/crossdomain.xml Likely you didn't follow the rules for cross domain scripting support via a policy file in the flash plugin sandbox. There's probably some information to get you started in this page . Alternatively you need to make sure that your script is trying to connect back to http://hupcapstudios.com/ and not http://www.hupcapstudios.com/ or vice versa, depending on where the swf was loaded from. You can see that as written now it works fine if you load: http://www.hupcapstudios.com/projects/calendar.html so the problem has to do with the cross domain restrictions.
