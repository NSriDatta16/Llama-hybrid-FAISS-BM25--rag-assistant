Is this a stationary time series?

I have a wait-time time series for 10 weekdays(2 weeks) with 10 minutes intervals. I'm having hard time to interpret this? Is this stationary? I also applied Philips-Perron Unit root test and I got the following values. Any help is appreciated. Dickey-Fuller = -8.4726, Truncation lag parameter = 5, p-value = 0.01
