A simple dead man's switch accomplishes this. Appoint long term / valued members of your community as successors in case the worst happens, make arrangements for the keys to be transferred to them. You can also form your own foundation very easily, it need not be non-profit, nor is it required to pay any of its employees. In my experience, umbrella organizations may not have the resources to stay in tune with the community to the degree needed to act quickly in case something happens. This is why SPI has very little involvement with the organizations it serves, other than acting as a payment proxy. You would do better to simply coordinate wills with the other developer, or set up something small that is intrinsic to your community.
