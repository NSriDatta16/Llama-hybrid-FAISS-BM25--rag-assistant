Best distance measure for cluster analysis of time series data with a circular variable

I'm doing hierarchical clustering on a set of time series (say 21 time series of 400 time points), however the variable I want to cluster is a circular variable, i.e. a directional vector between 0 and 360 degrees. Can dynamic time warping be applied to a circular variable? Otherwise, what would be the most appropriate distance measure between circular variable time series?
