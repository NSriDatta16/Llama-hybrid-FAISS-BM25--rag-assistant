Running bunch of python methods on a single piece of data

I would like to run a set of methods given some data. I was wondering how I can remove or chose to run different methods to be run. I would like to groups them within a larger method so I can call it; and it will go along the lines of test case. In code: Now these are the methods that process the data. I may sometimes want to run all three or a subset thereof to collect information on this data set. def one(self): pass def two(self): pass def three(self): pass I would like to be able to call of these methods with another call so I dont have to type out run this; run this. I am looking for elegant way to run a bunch of methods through one call so I can pick and choose which gets run. Desired result def run_methods(self, variables): #runs all three or subset of I hope I have been clear in my question. I am just looking for an elegant way to do this. Like in Java with reflection. Please and thanks.
