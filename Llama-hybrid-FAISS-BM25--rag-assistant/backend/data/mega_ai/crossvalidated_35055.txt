Time series from experimental measurement

I've got a couple of time series obtained from a small number of replicates,where many variables (all of them continuous) are measured at various time points (longitudinal study). I was looking for a statistical test that could answer whether or not the data supports any type of trend (increasing, decreasing or even oscillations), or alternatively, the actual value stays constant and what I see in my individual or average time series is due to measurement error alone. I've had a look and found the Ljungâ€“Box test - Is is appropriate to answer what I want? If not, what do you suggest?
