The Elbow Method can sometimes provide a very clear answer, but often it's hard to discriminate the elbow or bend that reveals the best clusters. In the absence of a clear elbow, one can then turn to the Silhouette Method, which involves examining the average Silhouette Coefficient (SC) and finding the number of clusters k that maximize this value (with the understanding that if two values of k are relatively close, there's often a benefit to choosing the simpler model.) In the case of your diagram for the average SC, it's important to note that the coefficient is only defined for values of 2 and above . Therefore, the highest average SC was present when two clusters were generated, so k = 2 would be your choice using this approach. Having said this, the average SC is still pretty low when k = 2 (just under 0.1), and this led to my question in the comments as to whether you standardized the features before performing K-means clustering.
