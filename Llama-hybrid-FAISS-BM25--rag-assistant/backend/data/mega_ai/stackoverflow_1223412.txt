In another question people told you exactly how to fix that warning, you declare a formal protocol for the delegate and add that protocol onto the delegate's property declaration. Having said that, if you want to suppress the warning you can use the GCC diagnostics pragma: //Turn the warning off #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wundeclared-selector" if (self.myDelegate != nil) { BOOL callDelegate = [self.myDelegate respondsToSelector:@selector(fooDidHappen:WithBar:)]; if (callDelegate) { [self.myDelegate fooDidHappen:foo withBar:bar]; } } //Turn the warning back on #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wundeclared-selector" Note this requires GCC 4.2.1+ or CLANG (and clang has what I feel is an improved version, but I may be biased since I wrote the patch for it).
