A very straight answer is that $R^2$ (adjusted or not) is itself strongly affected by outliers, and that a leverage outlier (position in $x$ -space far away from the majority of the data) can result in a very high value of $R^2$ that should not be trusted. So the fact that $R^2$ goes down alone should not be a reason against removing the outlier. Note however that if the outlier is not an erroneous observation, and you remove it, you in fact remove valid information, which is not normally recommended. You could keep it and run a robust regression as recommended in other answers. Note in particular that the statement that "no assumptions are violated" is meaningless as removal of points can make any data set look like if assumptions were fulfilled, but data dependent manipulation of the data set in fact violates assumptions itself (any data based manipulation will destroy independence), apart from the fact that model assumptions are never exactly fulfilled in reality anyway.
