Solved this by going through the saveAction in the Mage_Adminhtml_Catalog_ProductController . I wasn't setting the websiteIds correctly so the new products were never getting added to the site correctly. Magento uses this piece of code to get the correct website: $product->setWebsiteIds(array(Mage::app()->getStore(true)->getWebsite()->getId()));
