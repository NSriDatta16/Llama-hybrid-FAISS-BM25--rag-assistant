Coin flipping: Relationship between Bayesian and Frequentist's point estimates

I have a (biased) coin that has an unknown Head probability $p\in(0,1)$ . To point estimate $p$ , say that I'm going to use two approaches. Approach 1. I can use the Bayesian inference technique. Starting from a Beta prior $p^0\sim Beta(a^0_H,a^0_T)$ , I calculate the posterior from the observations. When I observed $n_H$ Heads and $n_T$ Tails in round $n_H+n_T$ , The posterior will follow $Beta(a^0_H+n_H,a^0_T+n_T)$ . As a point estimate for $p$ , I can take the posterior mean, which is $\hat p_B=\frac{a^0_H+n_H}{a^0_H+n_H+a^0_T+n_T}$ Approach 2. I can use MLE. The MLE in this case is given by $\hat p_F=\frac{n_H}{n_H+n_T}$ . My question is what is the relationship between $\hat p_B$ and $\hat p_F$ ? Especially, It looks like when I have enough observations, the two estimates coincide. In this case, can I say $\hat p_B$ and $\hat p_T$ are asymptotically equal? or is there any other terminology that I can formally describe the asymptotic relationship between the two? When I only have a handful of observations, what can I say about the relationship? Can I say the two differ only by constant terms? or, again, is there any other formal description of the two under the small sample situation?
