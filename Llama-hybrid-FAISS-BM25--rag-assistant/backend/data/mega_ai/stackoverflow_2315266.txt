When does the code after End Using run? Does it wait until the thread finished, or does the Using block return immediately? If it waits until the thread finishes, then what's the point of launching a thread at all? But if it doesn't wait, then what do you do if you want to get the thread's return value? There do exist more elegant idioms for threads than the standard one that you mention. In C#, for example, you can use an anonymous delegate to do much the same thing, and C# 4.0 has a variety of threading-related tools. But your example does not illustrate one of them.
