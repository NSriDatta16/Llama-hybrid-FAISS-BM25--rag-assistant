How to calculate multi-step prediction intervals for time series data?

I need to manually calculate multi-step prediction intervals for time series data. I know packages like 'forecast' in R provide these, but I cannot use these packages as the production infrastructure does not support R. Could someone point me to an article that explains how to generate multi-step prediction intervals?
