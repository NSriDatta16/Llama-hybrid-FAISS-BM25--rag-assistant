I guess your question is: you want to use a neural network to predict whether a user is a "gamer" or not, and you want to find some features from his/her followers. Well here are some possible features you may want to use. If you find the number of their followers is varying, why not just use this "follower number" as a feature. Based on the first point: because some gamers are very active in their game community and like to discuss their common interests, you can check the absolute number of the "gamers number" in their followers. Even based on the percentage of the (gamers/followers), you can even give weights to these users. Another thing I found from my project is that: you may find some interesting features from the user pages. For example, the number of tweets or pictures they post, the contents of their tweets (you can do some simple sentiment analyses or more complex NLP to extract features from it). Then you can find more useful features to feed your model. Hope these can help you.
