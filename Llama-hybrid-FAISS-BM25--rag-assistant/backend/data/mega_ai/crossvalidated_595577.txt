The $z$ in the probability function is just an arbitrary integration variable. There is no standard or convention about this, it is just arbitrary notation. You could just as well change the $z$ to $y$ with no change of meaning. The author of the Wikipedia page seems more concerned with mathematical formality than with clarity unfortunately. The notation in the Wikipedia article really is terrible. The $\lambda$ parameter isn't even defined. Even if the notation was properly defined, the use $\sigma$ -algebras for this type of article is totally unnecessary and unhelpful. Anyway, $\nu_\lambda()$ is just a mathematical formality to make sure the density integrates to 1 over the whole distribution. In my opinion, you would be better off ignoring the Wikipedia page and read instead the much better descriptions of the Tweedie distributions in the cited papers. It is much better to estimate $\mu$ instead of $\alpha$ . See the Dunn & Smyth (2018) book for detailed advice and examples. The power parameter $p$ is often pre-specified, in which case estimating $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ becomes relatively easy. See also Tweedie Dispersion Parameter Estimation Methods . No there aren't. If there were good methods they would be implemented in the tweedie package. Type help("dtweedie") and consult the references cited to understand the challenges. It is difficult to imagine how MCMC could possibly be of any help to you. MCMC is not a tool for evaluating goodness of it, if that is what you have in mind.
