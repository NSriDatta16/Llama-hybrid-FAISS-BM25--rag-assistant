There is nothing Bayesian (in the sense of "inverse" probability calculations) in this problem, only the law of total probability. Of course, the law of total probability requires assumptions about a priori probabilities.... Using the illustrations in the question, suppose that there are random variables $Y$ and $X$ where $Y$ has a binomial distribution $\text{Binom}(15,X)$. (Note that $X$ must take on values in $[0,1]$ only) What this is saying is that conditioned on the value of $X$ , $Y$ is a binomial random variable. Thus, the conditional distribution of $Y$ given the value of $X$ is a binomial distribution $\text{Binom}(15,X)$. Perhaps this is the name that you are looking for when you ask "Is this called a compound distribution, or ..."? The unconditional distribution of $Y$ is, in general, not a binomial distribution. It is, in fact, a mixture distribution. This is particularly visible in the case when $X$ is a discrete random variable because then the unconditional distribution of $Y$ is a weighted sum of the conditional distributions. For our particular example, we have that for $0 \leq n \leq 15$, $$P\{Y = n\} = \begin{cases}\sum_i \binom{15}{n}\alpha_i^n (1-\alpha_i)^{15-n}\cdot P\{X = \alpha_i\}, & X ~\text{a discrete random variable,}\\ \int_0^1 \binom{15}{n}\alpha^n (1-\alpha)^{15-n}\cdot f_X(\alpha)\,\mathrm d\alpha, & X ~\text{a continuous random variable,} \end{cases}$$
