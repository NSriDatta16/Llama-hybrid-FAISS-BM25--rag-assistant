How to get periodicity from timeseries data?

I would like to create a recommendation system for a smart home application. I gather the data in a time-series database. The app monitors the on/off state of a smart lamp and can create daily routines. I would like to create notifications to the user like "It looks like you are usually use your lamp from 8:00 to 10:00. Would you like to create a routine for that?". I am beginner to data science and machine learning and I would like to ask what kind of machine learning algorithm or method should I use for this problem. Someone recommended me Facebook Prophet, but as I can see that library can only predict future occurences not the periodicity of time-series data. Do you know any library or algorithm? In the image below you can see my problem detailed. There is hourly on/off state of the lamp daily in green and in blue the result that I would like to get: the periods that the lamp is usually on.
