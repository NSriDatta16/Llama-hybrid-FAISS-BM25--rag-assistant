Buggy HTML tables in IE7, help?

I have the following code: .tl, .tr, .bl, .br, .b, .t { background: #f00; width: 16px; height: 16px; } .m { background: url('https://www.google.com/images/logos/ssl_logo_lg.gif') #0f0; } table { width: 512px; height: 512px; border-spacing: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; } &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; test &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It works fine as long as I don't look at it with IE7. IE7 for some reason does not respect my width and height set to 16px and instead makes all rows and columns to take the average size. Oddly, this works in the Quirks mode though, but now in the standards mode, what's up? P.S. Is there any other way of accomplishing a similar layout that has 16x16 corners, 16px top and bottom while the middle fits in?
