Is this joint probability or conditional probability?

Recently I've been studying Bayesian statistics. Often when I see this $$p(y|x, \theta)$$ I treated as a probability of y given x and $\theta$. This made sense when solving linear regression since $\theta$ was a fixed value/vector. I think it's also written this way: $$p(y|x; \theta)$$ But with Bayesian, $\theta$ becomes a probability distribution. Does that make $$p(y|x, \theta)$$ a joint distribution? EDIT: (context) In Bayesian linear regression, $$y = \theta^Tx + \epsilon$$ and $$P(y|x, \theta) = {1 \over \sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} exp(-(y-\theta^Tx)^2 / 2\sigma^2)$$ where $$\theta \tilde{} N(0, \tau^2I)$$
