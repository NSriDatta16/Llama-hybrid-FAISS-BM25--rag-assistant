 male sexual strategy in which participants are ranked as "alpha" or "beta" males. The subreddit promotes antifeminism, rape culture, hegemonic masculinity, and traditional gender roles. Users discuss diet and physical fitness; share "pick-up" techniques for seducing women; and display varying levels of misogyny, ranging from virulent hatred of women to simple frustration with contemporary male experience. In 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center described r/TheRedPill as one of several male supremacist subreddits featuring xenophobic discourse. One critic compared the ideology expressed in r/TheRedPill to alt-right philosophy, highlighting attacks on feminism and mockery of rape as common threads. The New Statesman described it as one of the most misogynistic subreddits on Reddit, intended to radicalize men. In 2017, The Daily Beast revealed that New Hampshire legislator Robert Fisher created r/TheRedPill and had posted demeaning comments about women there. Fisher resigned. As of 2018, the subreddit is quarantined. WhitePeopleTwitter r/WhitePeopleTwitter is a controversial Reddit community that has produced controversy from several posts which included satirical or hoax tweets taken from their original context that then went viral on social media. One such tweet joked that Twitter CEO Elon Musk was introducing a "special verification for users of the Jewish faith". Another purported to be written by conservative commentator Matt Walsh and claimed he engaged in sexual assault multiple times. A third feigned support for then-recently arrested social media personality Andrew Tate. Like its sister subreddit, r/BlackPeopleTwitter, it mainly sources their posts from a specific racial group, which unlike its sister subreddit, r/BlackPeopleTwitter, involves specifically white people's posts. Temporary ban On February 3, 2025, r/WhitePeopleTwitter was temporarily banned for 72 hours by site administrators. A Reddit spokesperson stated that the ban was due to "a prevalence of violent content", adding that "Inciting and glorifying violence or doxing are against Reddit's platform-wide Rules." The ban came about after an X user, @RedditLies, posted a screenshot of comments on the subreddit about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its leader at the time, Elon Musk. The screenshot included comments such as "time to hunt", "this Nazi stooge needs to be shot", and threats to drag the employees' bodies. Musk noticed the X post of the various comments and quoted it, stating, "They have broken the law". Free speech rationale In 2011, the site's general manager, Erik Martin, stated that Reddit would not ban communities solely for featuring controversial content. He noted that "having to stomach occasional troll [sub]reddits like r/picsofdeadkids or morally questionable [sub]reddits like r/jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this." He argued that it is not Reddit's place to censor its users. Similarly, the site's former CEO, Yishan Wong, argued that Reddit should not ban distasteful subreddits because, as a platform, it should serve the ideals of free speech. Critics responded that Reddit had not been consistent in following its free speech philosophy. In a 2015 discussion on the site's content policy, founder Steve Huffman stated that "neither Alexis [Ohanian] nor I created Reddit to be a bastion of free speech". When it banned r/The_Donald in 2020, Reddit expanded upon the kinds of content it was willing to ban, implementing new rules that directly prohibit hate speech. The following year, despite moderator criticism, Reddit vowed to allow conversations that "question or disagree with popular consensus" regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: "dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy." Reddit did eventually ban r/NoNewNormal after moderator protests, but the ban was leveled for unduly influencing other communities, not for promoting misinformation.
