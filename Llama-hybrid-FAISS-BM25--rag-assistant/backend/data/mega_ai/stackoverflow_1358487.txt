Is there any #pragma or similar directive for generated C# code to match template code line numbers to C# line number?

I have a templating system that looks similar to old-style ASP code. I run this through a class that rewrites the entire thing into C# source code, compiles, and finally executes it. What I'm wondering is if there is some kind of #pragma-like directive I can sprinkle the generated C# code with that will make compile errors match the line numbers in my template file? For instance, let's say I have this first and only line in my template code: Object o = datta; // should be data, compiler error but then in order to compile this I must add a namespace, a class, a method, and some boiler-plate code to it, so this line above, which is line #1 in my template file, actually ends up being line #17 (random number, just for illustrative purposes) in the C# code. The compiler error will naturally flag my error as being on line #17, and not on line #1. I remember from another programming language I've used before (though I can't remember which one) that it had a directive that I could add, which would make error line numbers line up. Is there any such thing in C# 3.5?
