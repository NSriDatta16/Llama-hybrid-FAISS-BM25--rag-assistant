Don't use browser detection: Browser detection is not 100% reliable at the best of times, but things get worse than this: There are lots of variants of browsers (MSIE customisations etc) Browsers can lie about their identity (Opera actually has this feature built-in) Gateways hide or obfuscate the browser's identity Customisation and gateway vendors write their own rubbish in the USER_AGENT It's better to do feature detection in client-script. You hopefully only need browser-detection to work around a bug in a specific browser and version.
