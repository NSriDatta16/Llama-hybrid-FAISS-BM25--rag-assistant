jQuery Drag And Drop Using Live Events

I have an application with a long list that changes frequently, and I need the items of that list to be draggable. I've been using the jQuery UI draggable plugin, but it is slow to add to 400+ list items, and has to be re-added every time new list items are added. Does anyone know of a plugin similar to the jQuery UI draggable plugin that uses jQuery 1.3's .live() events? This would solve both problems.
