A possible way, particularly efficient if the set is immutable, but is still usable with a variable set: var haystack = "monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday"; var needle = "Friday"; if (haystack.indexOf(needle.toLowerCase()) >= 0) alert("Found!"); Of course, you might need to change the separator depending on the strings you have to put there... A more robust variant can include bounds to ensure neither "day wed" nor "day" can match positively: var haystack = "!monday!tuesday!wednesday!thursday!friday!saturday!sunday!"; var needle = "Friday"; if (haystack.indexOf('!' + needle.toLowerCase() + '!') >= 0) alert("Found!"); Might be not needed if the input is sure (eg. out of database, etc.). I used that in a Greasemonkey script, with the advantage of using the haystack directly out of GM's storage.
