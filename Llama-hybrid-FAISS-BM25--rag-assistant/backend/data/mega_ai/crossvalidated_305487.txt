I'm sure the popular packages don't search over all C values either for the sake of speed Hastie et al. made this point obsolete. Using the regularization paths for ordinary SVMs would allow one to explore many values for C faster (at the order of magnitude of the time of a single evaluation). See this paper: The Entire Regularization Path for the Support Vector Machine . So you can investigate the whole path at once to pick the optimal cost without having to depend on heuristics. While R wasn't mentioned, you can fiddle with the method in the R package svmpath , created by Hastie himself. [ CRAN link and manual ]. The SVM has a regularization or cost parameter C, which controls the amount by which points overlap their soft margins. Typically either a default large value for C is chosen (allowing minimal overlap), or else a few values are compared using a validation set. This algorithm computes the entire regularization path (i.e. for all possible values of C for which the solution changes), with a cost a small (~3) multiple of the cost of fitting a single model.
