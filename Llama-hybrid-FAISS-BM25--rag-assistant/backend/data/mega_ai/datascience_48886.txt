Looking for other opinions on approach to classification problem

I'm looking to implement an "opt-out" filter for my company. The input is short, text-message style messages. A few examples of opt-out messages are: "remove me from your list" "remove from list" "please unsubscribe from list" etc. All other messages are "good", and should not be removed. My thoughts on approaches: I was thinking of using a Bayesian classifier here, but not really knowing the solution space (or having much of a background in ML), want to be sure I'm not wasting time on a sub-optimal solution. I'm fine with not having the most cutting-edge solution, but want to be sure I'm not missing an approach that might be equally as straightforward but more effective.
