Microsoft equivalent of Eclipse RCP

I have heard positive things about Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform) - does Microsoft has similar plugin UI framework available? I found an article from the Eclipse.org marketing director where he states: "An organization that is 100% Microsoft probably won't/shouldn't consider Eclipse RCP." A colleague pointed out that this article was posted in 2005, so i was wondering if Microsoft has a competing product by now, and if not, why not?
