How to address bias in AI Image Recognition Model: Oversampling, Undersampling, and Ensemble Techniques Not Working

I am currently working on an image recognition project using AI, but I am facing challenges with bias in my model's predictions. The model seems to be biased toward the majority classes in my dataset. Despite attempting oversampling, undersampling, and ensemble learning techniques, I have not been able to resolve this issue effectively. My dataset contains images of various categories, including food, drinks, and desserts. However, the AI model struggles to distinguish between these categories accurately. Here's a summary of what I have tried so far: Data Preparation: I've loaded my dataset from a CSV file and removed irrelevant columns. I ensured that labels are correctly assigned to each image. Model Architecture: I've created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers for feature extraction and classification. I've experimented with different architectures and hyperparameters. Training Process: I've adjusted hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size and trained the model for an increased number of epochs. Handling Class Imbalance: I've tried random oversampling, undersampling and also ensemble learning to address class imbalance, but the model still favors majority classes. Data Preprocessing: I've resized and normalized images, ensuring consistency between training and inference. Evaluation Metrics: I'm using precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics to assess the model's performance, especially for imbalanced categories. Despite these efforts, my model struggles to differentiate between categories accurately, primarily due to bias towards majority classes. I'm seeking advice on how to improve accuracy and address this bias effectively. Your suggestions are welcome.
