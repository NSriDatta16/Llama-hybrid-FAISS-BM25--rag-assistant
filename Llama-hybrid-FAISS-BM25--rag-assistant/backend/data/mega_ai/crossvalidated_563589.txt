How to show mathematically whether the following conditional relationships hold?

In the following Bayesian network, the variables $ x_{i} $ are mutually independent (let's assume that these are the positions of $N$ boats). The variables $ y_{i,j} $ are distance measurements between two parent nodes $ x_{i}, x_{j} $ (with that said, some measurement $ y_{i,j} $ depends only on these two parents). I do have a model that given a measurement $ y_{i,j} $ and a parent $ x_{j} $ , it provides me with the pdf of the parent's $ i $ position. The dots above show that there can be $ N $ boats in the system, and that for any $ (x_{i}, x_{j}) $ pair of parents we can have up to two measurements of their distance (one from $i$ to $j$ and one from $j$ to $i$ ). In the provided example, if dots are unclear, feel free to forget about them and just replace N with 4 so that you have some exact instance of the system (where for example, there is no measurement between Node 1 and Node N=4). So these measurements act like connections between the mutually independent Nodes. Assuming that I have no prior information about $ x_{3} $ , I want to calculate the following marginal probability (because I want to infer the position of Node 3 given the data I have from the other Nodes and measurements): \begin{equation} \begin{array}{l} P(x_{3}|everything~else) = P(x_{3} \mid x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{N}, y_{1,2}, y_{1,3}, y_{2,1}, y_{2,3}, ... , y_{2, N}, y_{N, 3}) \end{array} \end{equation} In hopefully simpler words, I know the following: $x_{1}$ , $x_{2}$ , $x_{N}$ , $y_{1,3}$ , $y_{2,3}$ , $y_{N, 3}$ and the functions $P(y_{1,3} \mid x_{1}, x_{3}) \cdot P(y_{2,3} \mid x_{2}, x_{3}) \cdot P(y_{N, 3} \mid x_{N}, x_{3})$ , and I need to prove that these are enough to calculate the conditional marginal above. I have a couple of questions about it. Firstly, is it correct (and why?) that: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{l} P(x_{3}|everything~else) \propto P(x_{3} \mid x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{N}, y_{1,3}, y_{2,3}, y_{N, 3}) \end{array} \end{equation} Also, is it correct (and why?) that: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{l} P(x_{3}|everything~else) \propto P(y_{1,3} \mid x_{1}, x_{3}) \cdot P(y_{2,3} \mid x_{2}, x_{3}) \cdot P(y_{N, 3} \mid x_{N}, x_{3}) \end{array} \end{equation} Lastly, is it correct (and why?) that: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{l} P(x_{3}|everything~else) \propto P(x_{3} \mid x_{1}, y_{1,3}) \cdot P(x_{3} \mid x_{2}, y_{2,3}) \cdot P(x_{3}, \mid x_{N}, y_{N, 3}) \end{array} \end{equation} Thank you.
