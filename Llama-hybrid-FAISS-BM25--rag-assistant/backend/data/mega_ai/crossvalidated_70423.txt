According to LÃ¼tkepohl's Applied Time Series Econometrics, the difference between simple VAR and structural VAR is that instead of identifying the coefficients, identification focuses on the errors of the system, which are interpreted as (linear combinations of) exogenous shocks. Restrictions based on the theory is imposed on the relations between the variables and the rest of variable dynamics are considered exogenous shocks. In a simple VAR no restrictions are imposed in advance and the coefficients of the lagged values of the variables included are identified. So in one sentence, in a SVAR restrictions are imposed on the variable dynamics beforehand and the rest is considered exogenous shocks, while in the VAR the coeffients of the lags are identified. I strongly recommend this book: H. Lutkepohl & M. Kratzig. Applied Time Series Econometrics. Cambridge University Press, The Edinburgh Building, Cambridge CB2 2RU, UK, 2004.
