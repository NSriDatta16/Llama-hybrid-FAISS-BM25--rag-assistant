Features for multi-channel time series classification

I am quite confused about extracting features of the multichannel signals and wonder if anyone can help me out. I want to get a feature set where feature is related to time, but I found the only way to do this was to cut the signals into different parts and extracted some features from each part, is there any way to extract something from the whole time series? For example, there is a time series which contains 300 time epoch, and the feature set contains 5 features, features are time related, which means the last feature represents the last part of the signal. Thanks in advance!
