Its a bizare error to be getting in the first place. Why would the simple ADODB.Connection object be considered an out-of-process component? The only thing I can think of that might cause this is if someone has accidently dragged the ADO dll into a COM+ Service. Check the set of COM+ Services anything unusual installed there? In an attempt to repair you could download the latest MDAC from Microsoft's download area and re-install it on your machine. Enabling out-of-proc components to is not the answer ADODB.Connection should not be out-of-proc. Next Step Fire up Regedit, find in Keys the key value of {00000514-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4} under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT You should find an InprocServer32 key with a default value: C:\Program Files\Common Files\system\ado\msado15.dll The ProgID should ADODB.Connection.2.8 .
