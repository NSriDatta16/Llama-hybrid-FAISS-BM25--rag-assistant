Is the error rate always the Bayesian one?

I know from Wikipedia that the Bayes error rate is: $${\displaystyle p=1-\textstyle \sum _{C_{i}\neq C_{\text{max,x}}}\int \limits _{x\in H_{i}}P(C_{i}|x)p(x)\,dx}$$ where $x$ is an instance, $C_i$ is a class into which an instance is classified, $H_i$ is the area/region that a classifier function $h$ classifies as $C_i$. For instance for a multiclass classifier results predicted["pred_idx_euc"] and the actual labels predicted["target"] I did the following error rate measure : >>>def accuracy(target, predicted): acc = (target==predicted).sum()/len(target) return acc >>>error_rate = 1 - accuracy(predicted["target"], predicted["pred_idx_euc"]) It doesn't look exactly the same way ...
