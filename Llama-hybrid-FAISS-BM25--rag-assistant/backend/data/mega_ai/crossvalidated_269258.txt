Coefficient of Logistic Regression

Fitted a logistic regression to predict if a member would default the loan payment. The coefficient for 'loan_amnt' is positive as shown below: As it is positive, an increase in loan_amnt would mean that odds/probability of 'defaulting' also increases. But, the average defaults based on quartile of loan_amnt indicates that average number of defaulters decrease with increasing loan_amnt. columns(quartile, no of members, no of defaulters, average). Here the members is classified as Defaulter or Non-Defaulter. How can they different ?
