You don't need to "calculate complexity for a base number", you can just compare its growth rate to that of the other terms (see this graph of logarithm growth rates , to give you an idea ) Note that to solve these problems, you don't need to pay attention to the base of the logs. O(x + y + z) === O(max(x,y,z)) So, decide which of the summed terms is largest and you can solve your problems.
