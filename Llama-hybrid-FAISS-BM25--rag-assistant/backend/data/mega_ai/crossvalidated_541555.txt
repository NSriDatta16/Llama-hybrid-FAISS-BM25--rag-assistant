More generally, how do Bayesians interpret P(X=x|θ=c) or P(X≤x|θ=c) for any probability model and does this interpretation pose any challenges when interpreting P(θ=s|x) or P(θ≤s|x)? $P(X=x\vert \theta=c)$ is the degree of belief ascribed to the outcome $X=x$ conditioned on the fact that $\theta =c$ under the model represented by $P$ . $P(\theta =s \vert X=x)$ is the degree of belief ascribed to the outcome $\theta=s$ conditioned on the fact that $X=x$ under the model represented by $P$ . $P(\Theta = \theta)$ is the degree of belief ascribed to the outcome $\Theta=\theta$ under the model represented by $P$ . $P(\Theta)$ is the degree of belief ascribed to the outcome $\Theta=\theta$ , for each $\theta \in \Theta$ , under the model represented by $P$ (and so on...) "Degree of belief" can be operationalized in terms of betting/preference behavior (as mentioned in other answers). More abstractly, Bayesian probability theory is a formalization of aspects of how people reason under uncertainty (at least some of the time...), so it is, itself, a model for belief. How do we justify blending two interpretations of probability in Bayes theorem as if they are equivalent? How does Bayes theorem not imply there is only one type of probability? How are we able to apply posterior probability statements to the unknown fixed true θ=c under investigation? I believe the first two questions miss a key point: more than one category of phenomena can be modeled using the same mathematics. In this case both (an idealization of) belief and (an idealization of) repeatable trials can both be represented by the same mathematical formulation: probability theory. Good/useful/accurate beliefs about repeatable trials will assign "degrees of belief" for an outcome $x$ that are equal to the proportion of occurrences for the outcome $x$ in the ensemble of trials (basically by Dutch Book arguments), so under those circumstances you get a numerical correspondence between these two different aspects of the world. For the third question, these statements are "the degree of belief ascribed to the outcome...".
