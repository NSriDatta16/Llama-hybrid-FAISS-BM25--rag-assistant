To say "C casting is bad" is an extremity that by itself is about as bad as using C-style casts all the time. The areas where "new" C++ style casts should be used are: hierarchical casts (upcasts, downcasts, crosscasts), const-correctness casts and reinterpretation casts. For arithmetical casts C-style casts work perfectly fine and pose no danger, which is why they can safely be used in C++ code. In fact, I would actually recommend using specifically C-style casts as arithmetical casts - just to make arithmetical casts to look different from other cast types.
