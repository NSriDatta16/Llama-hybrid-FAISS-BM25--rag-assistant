I am afraid that you fell victim to the usual misinterpretation of the (essentially vacuous) dictum "rational agents given the same information must come to the same conclusion". "Information" in this context is not just "data". It includes also the information-processing procedures a rational agent will use. Also, it includes the structure of preferences or attitudes towards uncertainty. Let's say person A and person B have the same data. Do they process the data in the same way? If not, they do not have "same information" (and there are many different ways to process the data, all compatible with rationality). If yes, do they quantify the costs of making wrong inferences in the same way? If not, (and there are many "cost-quantification" approaches compatible with rationality -say, a risk-averse person is no less rational than a risk-neutral one), they do not have "same information". If yes, they are a priori identical (for all aspects relevant to the issue at hand), and that's why the dictum becomes vacuous, and so no paradox emerges: persons A and B in your specific example, obviously have not the same information, in this more general and complete sense. "Rationality" is a very minimum set of requirements, having mainly to do with internal consistency . There are a lot of different inferential setups that are internally consistent, and so they all are "rational" -and they lead to different conclusions.
