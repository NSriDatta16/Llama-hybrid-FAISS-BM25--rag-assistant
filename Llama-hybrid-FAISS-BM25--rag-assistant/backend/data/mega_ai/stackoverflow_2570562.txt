That depends on how hard you think someone will try to defeat your system. If you plan to track these positions over time, you give away more information over time than you do in a snapshot. For instance, if you choose a fixed-offset from the center of the circle, it may be possible to find this offset by mapping the path over time to the street map. On the other hand if you continually change the offset, the position may be discoverable by averaging. Here's one possible scheme based on hysteresis. Leave the visible circle in place until the user exits an invisible bounding circle with a random radius. Then compute a new visible circle with a different random offset, and also set up a new invisible circle with a different random radius. This should generate a visible-circle movement that is almost impossible to reverse engineer, but also avoids lots of jittery movement.
