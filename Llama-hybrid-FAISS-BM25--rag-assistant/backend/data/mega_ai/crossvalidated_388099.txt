I don't know why randomForest has smaller RMSE on the training set, I would assume it's because RF by default builds deep trees with no pruning, hence why they may explain the training set a little better during building. However, in most cases this should not be a problem, it is hard to overfit a randomForest model, because of the many trees which will, on average, even things out. Cforest and gmb on the other hand have by default set limits on the depth of the trees and on-the-fly pruning, and this is why I think they have worse performance on the training set. Nonetheless, all models have very similar RMSE based on CV so they all perform equally well. Choosing a model now is just a matter of preference.
