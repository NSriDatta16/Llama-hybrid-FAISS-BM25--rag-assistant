What am i missing when creating applications from window-only template?

I'm fairly new to iOS development, but catching on pretty quickly. I'm attempting to figure out how to create universal apps from the window-only template in xcode. I THOUGHT that i could add a main view to the main_window.xib by following these steps: Make a new window-based app template. Go to file > new file > uiviewcontroller subclass with XIB file. Open the main_window.xib and add a new view controller, with my new uiviewcontroller subclass as the selected NIB name in the inspector. Control-Drag from the window object to the new view controller, and add it as the rootViewController. I thought that from here i had something that was essentially the same as the view-based template, but when i add in a segmented view controller, add the IBOutlet/IBAction in code, and then hook up the outlets and received actions in Interface Builder, the app crashes as it launches every time. I'm positive that i'm missing a vital step in hooking up this process and would be greatful if anyone could offer the solution, as well as some general advice when setting up these sorts of things? Thanks. EDIT: Solved it by doing the following: Create new window based template. Create UIViewController Subclass, name it whatever you want. In AppDelegate.h, add @class YourViewControllerName before @interface Inside the @interface for appDelegate, add YourViewControllerName *mainViewController; Then outside the @interface add @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet YourViewControllerName *mainViewController; In AppDelegate.m add in #import YourViewControllerName.h at the top. Add @synthesize YourViewControllerName . In ApplicationDidFinishLaunching add: [self.window addSubView:mainViewController.view] Open MainWindow.xib in interface builder, drag in a new view controller from the library, and use the property inspector to change it's class to be YourViewControllerName , and select the corresponding NIB file from the drop-down menu. Control drag from the app delegate, which is the yellow box in IB, to your new;y created view controller, and hook up the mainViewController outlet you created. VOILA! done. Solved all my problems. Many many thanks for the help guys.
