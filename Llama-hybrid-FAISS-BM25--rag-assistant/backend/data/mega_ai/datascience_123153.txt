Wavelet choice for wav file analysis

Context I am working on the Maestro v3.0 dataset https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro#v300 to familiarize myself with signal processing. Years ago, I mainly worked on image processing with CNNs. Here, I have an association of midi files with stereo wav files . What I am trying to achieve is fairly simple: note envelope identification, maybe some chord recognition. Choice of the proper wavelet function I need to reduce the length of the structure I will feed my NN with. I read that, one of the best way to so is to apply wavelet functions. Because of the size of the dataset, I will stick to Discrete Wavelet functions (DWF). I do have a general understanding of how wavelet functions work, what I struggle with is the number of available functions in pywavelets : I just don't know what is relevant for music processing. Here are the families Haar (haar) Daubechies (db) Symlets (sym) Coiflets (coif) Biorthogonal (bior) Reverse biorthogonal (rbio) “Discrete” FIR approximation of Meyer wavelet (dmey) Gaussian wavelets (gaus) Mexican hat wavelet (mexh) Morlet wavelet (morl) Complex Gaussian wavelets (cgau) Shannon wavelets (shan) Frequency B-Spline wavelets (fbsp) Complex Morlet wavelets (cmor) Because of the typical shape of a piano note envelope, based on the shape of the wavelet functions , I would: include: db, bior, sym exclude: mexh, morl, dmey because of their axial symmetry and continuity But I just don't know what to do with the rest Proper treatment of stereo The wave files contain the stereo record of one piano. I can sampling_frequency, signal = scipy.io.wavfile.read(wave_file) approx, detail = pywt.dwt(signal, "db1", axis=0) and, for a signal of shape (40110639, 2), I get a detail of shape (20055320, 2). Am I on the right track?
