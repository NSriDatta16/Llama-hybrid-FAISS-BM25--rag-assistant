How to report Logistic Regression Pseudo-R^2 in publication or reports?

I have a Logisitc Regression model with a McFadden Pseudo- $R^2=0.7113$ . Based on the answers to this question: McFadden's Pseudo-R2 Interpretation , it seems my model has a good fit. However if I want to present this result in a report, what is the interpretation of good fit? According to this link: http://www.statisticalassociates.com/logistic10.htm , Pseudo- $R^2$ is NOT a measure of percent of variance explained in the dependent variable by the model. This is exactly what I thought it was but apparently it is wrong.
