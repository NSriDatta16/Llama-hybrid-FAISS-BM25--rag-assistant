One option would be to use a regression strategy which treats your data as draws from a continuous underlying function (see discussion here: Is there any gold standard for modeling irregularly spaced time series? ). From there you could use a method like Singular Spectrum Analysis to decompose the signal (for R: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rssa/index.html ).
