I just finished a book titled, Bayesian Models for Astrophysical Data: using R/JAGS and Python/Stan, Cambridge University Press . I am lead author (Joseph Hilbe), with two astrophysicists, Rafael de Souza and Emille Ishida. It is in production now and should be out early next year. In the meantime you should look at Andreon and Weaver (2015), Bayesian Methods for the Physical Sciences: Learning examples in Astronomy and Physics, Springer . It is part of the Springer Series in Astrostatistics books.
