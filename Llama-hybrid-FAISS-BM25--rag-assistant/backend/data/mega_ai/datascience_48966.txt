Story Tag Prediction - Optional Labels

I'm currently working on a prediction for fiction. I have a database with fiction, which are each described with different story tags. My idea is to use a neural network that can tell you by processing a new story which tags are relevant. The problem is, that the original data wasn't generated but added by users. A story in the woods could be tagged with trees, nature etc. Another story that also takes place in the woods might not be tagged with nature, even though the tag applies. This might confuse the neural network. Is there a way to prevent this form happening? Thank you!
