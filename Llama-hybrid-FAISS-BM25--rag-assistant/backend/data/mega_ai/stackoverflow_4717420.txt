If you are really set on doing this from the command line, this site (search for "no duplicates found") has an awk example that searches for duplicates. It may be a good starting point to look at that. However, I'd encourage you to use Perl or Python for this. Basically, the flow of the program would be: findUniqueValues(file1, file2){ contents1 = array of values from file1 contents2 = array of values from file2 foreach(value2 in contents2){ found=false foreach(value1 in contents1){ if (value2 == value1) found=true } if(!found) print value2 } } This isn't the most elegant way of doing this, since it has a O(n^2) time complexity, but it will do the job.
