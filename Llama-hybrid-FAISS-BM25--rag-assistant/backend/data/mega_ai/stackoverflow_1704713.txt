I've not tested this out, so this is just a guess, but I had a similar problem earlier today with a project I'm working on... ...Your 'test' class is on the span element and not the link. IE in particular (especially IE Your CSS makes perfect sense, given the sample of HTML you've shown, but sometimes, putting the style on the link element itself rather than it's containing element is less problematic (and what I ended up doing earlier today with my problem). Home ...may do the trick, but if not, I'd suggest getting in reinforcements...if you're not sure of the order of inheritance or things are getting very complex and you're not sure if other styles are conflicting with a style, a great tool for picking which selectors to use are John Allsopp's XRAY and MRI bookmarklets - http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200710/css_diagnostics_with_xray_and_mri/ Simply drag 'n' drop them onto your browser's bookmark bar. XRAY gives you the element, id and class of any on-screen element you click on, as well as its position and margin, padding and border info, as well as inheritence heirarchy. When you click on any element on-screen, MRI gives you suggested selectors for the element, which you can then copy and paste into your text editor. To activate both you just click on them wherever you've dropped them on your browser, and then a floating overlay appears, which when you click on an element displays all the relevant info about that element. I find both invaluable when I'm having trouble figuring out why a style isn't behaving as I'd expected it to.
