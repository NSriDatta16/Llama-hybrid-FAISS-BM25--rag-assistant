Are there any GOOD javascript addins for Visual Studio?

In our daily work we maintain some rather large Javascript libaries. We use VS2008 and while they made some improvements to the Javascript IDE, I still find it lacking. There is no outlining, no collapsing, or other ways to keep the code organized. I have tried js-addin and JSLint which crash and don't have the features I want, respectively. I have actually gone as far as running Aptana Studio as their Javascript IDE is much better than what I can get out of Visual Studio. I'm getting tired of having to maintain 2 IDE's. Is there anything out there that can make Javascript editing less painful in Visual Studio 2008? (We don't have the option of 2010 yet).
