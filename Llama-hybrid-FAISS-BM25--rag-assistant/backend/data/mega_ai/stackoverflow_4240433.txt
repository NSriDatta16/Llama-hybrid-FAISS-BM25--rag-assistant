Creating Taxonomy Table in MySQL

I am creating a botanical database where the plants will be organized by their taxonomy: Life Domain Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species I was considering using the example put forth by the article Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL , however it is adding the above list as records inside the table....and I'm not sure if that is the best thing to do since I will be having multiple species per genus and multiple genus per family and so on. What would you suggest is the best way to approach this problem. Thanks in advance.
