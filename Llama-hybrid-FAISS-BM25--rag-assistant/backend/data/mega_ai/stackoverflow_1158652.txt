There are many ways to develop applications. One of those is "Extreme Programming" or "Test Driven Design (TDD)". It states that all code should be tested. Code Coverage is a means of measuring how much is tested. I'd like to make a small remark about this: I don't think all code should be tested, nor that one should set a specific percentage of code coverage. Neither do I think that code shouldn't be tested with Unit Tests (code testing code). I do think one should decide what makes sense to test. Due to this reason I generally don't use code coverage. One thing that some tools provide, is highlight the parts that are tested. This way you might run into some code that isn't tested but actually should be, which is the only thing I use it for.
