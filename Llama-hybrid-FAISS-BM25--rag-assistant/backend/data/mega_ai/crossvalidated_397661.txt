A regressor failed to learn extreme values

I am working on a regression problem using xgbclassifier ( https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html ) The output values range from 0 to 10 (log-normal distribution), but when I predicted on the testset, the output is always around 4-6. The regressor seems not to learn the examples at extreme values. I tried several ways: oversampling the training instances with high output values. put instance weight on the training set. But none of them works. Might you suggest some approaches to deal with the problem?
