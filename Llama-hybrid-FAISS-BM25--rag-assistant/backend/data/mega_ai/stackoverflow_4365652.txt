This will work: appusedFaces[i]=[[appCardString objectAtIndex:i] characterAtIndex:0]; Though you should add a check that the string has at least one character. You should also be aware that char can only hold character codes up to 255 ( unichar can handle any Unicode character). It also looks like you have some numeric codes in your test string. Checking if the string has more than one character and then calling [[appCardString objectAtIndex:i] intValue] for those characters will handle these.
