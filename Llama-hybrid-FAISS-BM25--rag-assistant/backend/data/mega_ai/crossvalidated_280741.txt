The bootstrap is a method of doing inference in a way that does not require assuming a parametric form for the population distribution. It does not treat the original sample as if it is the population even those it involves sampling with replacement from the original sample. It assumes that sampling with replacement from the original sample of size n mimics taking a sample of size n from a larger population. It also has many variants such as the m out of n bootstrap which re-samples m time from a sample of size n where m In my book "Bootstrap Methods: A Practitioners Guide" second edition published by Wiley in 2007, I point out situations where the bootstrap can fail. This includes distributions that do not have finite moments, small sample sizes, estimating extreme values from the distribution and estimating variance in survey sampling where the population size is N and a large sample n is taken. In some cases variants of the bootstrap can work better than the original approach. This happens with the m out of n bootstrap in some applications In the case of estimating error rates in discriminant analysis, the 632 bootstrap is an improvement over other methods including other bootstrap methods.. A reason for using it is that sometimes you can't rely on parametric assumptions and in some situations the bootstrap works better than other non-parametric methods. It can be applied to a wide variety of problems including nonlinear regression, classification, confidence interval estimation, bias estimation, adjustment of p-values and time series analysis to name a few.
