Communicating and Controlling web page from C#

I have already opened a webpage in Firefox which is actually running through the apache web server on the same machine. And I have C# application running on the same machine. Now I want to refresh/inform my already open web page that C# has finished processing. I have seen the threads all over the web and also some similar threads on Stackoverflow but did not find solution. Any idea how to solve this? In details: C# Application is transferring images from external storage. Web page ( http://127.0.0.1/mypage.php ) is looking for the images periodically, but never know that all images are transferred or not so that it can process these images to do some more work. In this scenario, we want to tell our web page (which is already running in firefox) all data transferred and now you can refresh to process data.
