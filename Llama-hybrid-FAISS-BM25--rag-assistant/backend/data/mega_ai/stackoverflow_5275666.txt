How to Request a Password Protected Page in Javascript

I'm working on a very simple Sidebar Gadget to analyze my router's monthly bandwidth usage and determine how far ahead or behind I am for that month. The data is located in a router-hosted, password protected webpage (I'm using DD-WRT, if it matters). I'd like to pass a page request to the router with Javascript, along with all the authentication information, to retrieve the page all in one go, but I can't seem to find the proper syntax for that. Any ideas? Here's my code so far: var ua = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); if (!window.ActiveXObject){ req = new XMLHttpRequest(); }else if (ua.indexOf('msie 5') == -1){ req = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); }else{ req = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); } req.open('GET', 'http://192.168.1.1/Status_Internet.asp', false, "username", "password"); req.send(null); if(req.status == 200){ dump(req.responseText); } else{ document.write("Error"); } document.write("Second Error"); Firebug indicates that it throws an error on req.send(null) - specifically, Access to restricted URI denied" code: "1012 . It may be because of the same-origin policy, but in that case what can I use instead of an xmlhttpRequest?
