Issues in estimation and plot

I am learning adaptive filters and testing the performance of using Least Squares and Kalman filter for parameter estimation for $y = X + \text{noise}$. The model is autoregressive AR(2) model $$y(t) = ay_{t-1} + by_{t-2}$$ and a Moving Average MA(2) model. I have obtained the parameters $(\hat{a},\hat{b})$ for AR and MA. I want to show the plot of the desired signal vs the actual signal so that it shows how close the estimated signal is from the actual. How do I recover the signal and show the plot?
