There is plenty of options for anomaly detection, from a standard deviation using Pandas std deviation function, to a Bayesian method and many Machine learning methods in between like: clustering, SVM, Gaussian Process, Neural networks. Take a look to this tutorial: https://www.datascience.com/blog/python-anomaly-detection From a Bayesian perspective I recomend Facebook Prophet. It gives very advanced results without the need of being a Time series expert. It has the options for working on months, days etc, and "uncertainty intervals" help with anomalies. Finally, I recomend this Uber blog about using Neural nets (LSTM) for anomaly detection, it has very goods insights: https://eng.uber.com/neural-networks/
