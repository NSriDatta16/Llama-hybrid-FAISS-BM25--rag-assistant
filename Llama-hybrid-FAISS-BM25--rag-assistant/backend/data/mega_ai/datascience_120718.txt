Use dummy variables for most accurate results. For example if you have 4 cities, create dummy variables: city_2, city_3, city_4, where a sample coming from city_4, would have values 0 for city_2 and 3, and a 1 for city_4. You will notice I did not write city_1, this is because if you have zeroes for city_2,3,4, that implies a 1 for city_1. Doing this insures higher accuracy, and less correlation. A different type of solution is by using a numerical feature with possible values: 1,2,3,4. This however, leads to lower accuracy as the machine learning model tries to 'understand' the relationships between the values. It is intuitive to understand why having the category city encoded the same way as age, for example, is not a good idea.
