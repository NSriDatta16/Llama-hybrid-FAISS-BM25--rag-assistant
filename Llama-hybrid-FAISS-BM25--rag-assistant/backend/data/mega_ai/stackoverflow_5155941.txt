I can't find a single reference in the framework to cms/content.phtml . It appears to be unused. CMS pages can be set to use different content templates at your request, most of which follow typical Magento page layouts. Take a look here for a tutorial on how to add a new CMS template, which you can change at will. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
