There is any number of ways to go about doing this. If your major concern is security, one way could be to send a link that contains a guid parameter which you create and store on your end (in a db table, file or whatever suits you) together with the user id associated with it. When the request for password reset comes in, you check for the guid and look if there is one matching value in your db/file/whatever and proceed with the password reset. Don't forget to delete the guid from your storage to prevent multiple use of the same link.
