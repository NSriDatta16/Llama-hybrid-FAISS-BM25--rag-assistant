Is there any way to load json from a subdomain?

I'd love to stash some .json files on a CDN a la static.mydomain.com. Truth be told, static.mydomain.com is a CNAME in front of an Amazon S3 bucket. I understand this violates the JavaScript security model. Is there an advised workaround or design? I've seen server-side stuff suggested like a PHP script to suck down data via cURL or file_gets_contents(), but that's a pretty lame approach. Is there any way to load JSON from a foreign server without getting too hacky? === UPDATE: Here's the line of thought that led me to believe it's a crossdomain issue for subdomains. When I visit a page (e.g. static.mydomain.com/json/file.json) in Chrome, it displays as it would plaintext. When I visit the page in Firefox, it tries to get me to save the .json as a download. I see a peculiar result in Firebug: A 200 response with no response body. I can't log the direct headers via browser; my Firefox HTTP header plugin doesn't log anything before the download is forced. However here are the headers when loaded via this jQuery snippit (worth noting, the alert below doesn't fire): jQuery.get("https://static.mydomain.com/json/file.json", function(data){ alert("Data: " + data); } ); Response Headers x-amz-id-2 wSVtjlvFj5ffOtg7ZbKqKw8PexqlzJic7+PxSk975/FcDUnshSV2CiUP2oPWR8yK x-amz-request-id 8AD81565A783988D Date Tue, 19 Oct 2010 00:07:22 GMT Expires Sat, 17 Oct 2015 22:25:37 GMT Last-Modified Mon, 18 Oct 2010 01:08:13 GMT Etag "2f1c7adcc1a7b0fd8fc8ce1478e0bf81" Content-Type application/json Content-Length 85966 Server AmazonS3 Request Headers Host static.mydomain.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 Accept application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01 Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Referer http://mydomain.com/directory/referrer.html Origin http://mydomain.com Though the headers seem to me to be fine, there is no response body to either a get, post, or anything else I can throw at this via jQuery. I see the same result when setting the content type to application/json, text/javascript and text/plain. Can anyone explain this behavior? I figure I must be doing something wrong on the S3 side, but could it be crossdomain issues in JavaScript or can I rule out cross-subdomain issues?
