Resources for learning Markov chain and hidden Markov models

I am looking for resources (tutorials, textbooks, webcast, etc) to learn about Markov Chain and HMMs. My background is as a biologist, and I'm currently involved in a bioinformatics-related project. Also, what are the necessary mathematical background I need to have a sufficient understanding of Markov models & HMMs? I've been looking around using Google but, so far I have yet to find a good introductory tutorial. I'm sure somebody here knows better.
