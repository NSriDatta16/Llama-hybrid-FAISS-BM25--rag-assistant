thanks for all the tips : I tried to use the mouseenter / mouseleave events, since they seem to look in detail for the divs they are dealing with ( as seen here ), but nothing changed. So seeing that all the usual jQuery instructions weren't responding I've checked out as suggested my CSS. And there was the trick. What I had : .text p{position:relative; top:-370px; padding: 0 10px} was setting up a huge, empty space that the browser was interpreting as "not left still" by the cursor (I noticed that overflying that empty space was making the text to respond properly). So I changed to that : .text {margin-top:-370px; padding: 0 10px; float:left} Which lets the "p" tag alone, and positions the second block up in the div, but without a trace of empty space behind it. Then, concerning the snippet, it will work as well with mouseenter / moseleave and hover : $(function(){ $('#wrap').mouseenter( function(){ $('#wrap .image').fadeOut(100, function(){ $('#wrap .text').fadeIn(100); }); } ); $('#wrap').mouseleave( function(){ $('#wrap .text').fadeOut(100, function(){ $('#wrap .image').fadeIn(100); }); } ); }); This is the improved version http://paragraphe.org/nice/test.html
