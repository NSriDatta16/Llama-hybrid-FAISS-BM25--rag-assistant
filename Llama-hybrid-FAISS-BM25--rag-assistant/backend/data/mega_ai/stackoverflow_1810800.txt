This answer is super outdated; support for non-standard fonts is now built into all major browsers. See e.g. MDN You could try removing the apostrophes. Also make sure the font name is written exactly as you see it in the fonts folder. But anyway, it is not a good idea to deviate from the standard fonts. It will not display on other people's computers who do not have the font installed, and fall back to Times New Roman. The best way is to put headings and small paragraphs into graphics, preferably as GIF or PNG. The only halfway robust way to have at least parts of your content rendered in your own font is siFR .
