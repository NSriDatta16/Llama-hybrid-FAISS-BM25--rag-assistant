What are the possible architectures for clustered data storage on Amazon EC2 (EBS)?

I am running a Django website (on Apache) deployed on an EC2 instance. Currently it uses a single MySQL instance but ideally I would like to have a cluster. Please advise on the pros and cons on the following possibilities as well as list others if any: MySQL Cluster: If I deploy MySQL on several EBS instances, I still need a partitioner to have a distributed cluster. Any solutions for this? Cassandra: How does setting Cassandra up go with EC2? Also, if I use Cassandra currently, do I use the ability to use Django Models, or can I write a driver plugin for Django? RDS: Does RDS support clusters? So far I only found documentation on Master-Slave architectures. Thanks, -Sid
