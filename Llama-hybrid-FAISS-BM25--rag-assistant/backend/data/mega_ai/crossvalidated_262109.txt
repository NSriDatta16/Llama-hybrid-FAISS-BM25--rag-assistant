What is the Bayesian counterpart to the McNemar test (of marginal homogeneity)?

In analogy to a similar post on continuous data, I ask the following. In paired discrete data, we test the frequentist hypothesis of equivalent marginal distributions of two discrete variables $X$ and $Y$ with the McNemar test. For example when both variables are dichotomous with cell probabilities $$P(X=i,Y=j) = \pi_{ij} \quad; \quad i,j \in \{0,1\}$$ and marginal probabilities $\pi_{+j}$ and $\pi_{i+}$, marginal homogeneity is tested one-sided as $$H_0: \pi_{1+} \ge \pi_{+1},$$ which is equivalent to $$H_0: \pi_{10} \ge \pi_{01},$$ known as symmetry. What is the adequate Bayesian analysis for this contingency table?
