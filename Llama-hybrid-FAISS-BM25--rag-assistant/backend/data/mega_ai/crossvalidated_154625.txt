Bayesian & Power-Law Distributions

I'm looking to conduct a Bayesian regression analysis with three independent variables (all roughly normally distributed) and a single dependent variable (job performance) that follows a power-law distribution. Instead of assuming that job performance follows a normal distribution, how can I specify that it follows a power-law distribution in R?
