Something like this? select count(status) as total, year(timestamp) as yr, month(timestamp) as mnth from mytable group by yr,mnth As to your bonus question, 1000 records a week is not that much. How would switching to a CSV file help? You would still be getting 1000 records per week. edit select count(status) as total, year(timestamp) as yr, month(timestamp) as mnth, day(timestamp) as dy from mytable group by yr,mnth,dy Edit 2 select count(status) as total, year(timestamp) as yr, month(timestamp) as mnth, day(timestamp) as dy, to_days(timestamp) daynum from mytable group by yr,mnth,dy I've added a to_days field that would help you spot missing days as you scan through the results, daynum should be sequential. Edit 3 OK I've had a go at it but it is untested and bear in mind PHP is my 4th or 5th language. I'm pretty sure some of the gurus round here could do it a lot more elegantly.
