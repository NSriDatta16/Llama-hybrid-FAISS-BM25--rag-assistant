What kind of plot am I looking at?

I stumbled on to these following two slides (slides 21 & 22 on a machine learning tutorial found here ): The first is obviously an $x,y$ scatterplot of height and weight. But what is the second? Looks like two component parts representing the original data, but I can really tease out what is going on. Any insight (or reproducible R code, or even Pseudo-code) on what the heat map is representing, and what the white lines are interpreted as would be great.
