Exceptions are errors that are not part of normal program execution. Depending on what your program does and its uses (i.e. a word processor vs. a heart monitor) you will want to do different things when you encounter an exception. I have worked with code that uses exceptions as part of normal execution and it is definitely a code smell. Ex. try { sendMessage(); if(message == success) { doStuff(); } else if(message == failed) { throw; } } catch(Exception) { logAndRecover(); } This code makes me barf. IMO you should not recover from exceptions unless its a critical program. If your throwing exceptions then bad things are happening.
