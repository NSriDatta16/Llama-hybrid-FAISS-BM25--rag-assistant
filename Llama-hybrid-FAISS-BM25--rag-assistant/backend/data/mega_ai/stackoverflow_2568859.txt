WCF: Switched computers, now bidirectional serialization has stopped working

I'm using this code generator to create business objects, with bidirectional serialization attributes, that can be sent from a server to a client using WCF. This used to work, but I've switched computers, and now I seem to only have unidirectional serialization, even though the source code has not changed. This is a property that I would expect to still be serialized: partial void OnApplicationIDChanging(int value); partial void OnApplicationIDChanged(); private int _ApplicationID; [Column(Storage=@"_ApplicationID", DbType=@"Int NOT NULL", CanBeNull=false)] [DataMember(Order=2)] public int ApplicationID { get { return _ApplicationID; } set { if (_ApplicationID != value) { if (_Application.HasLoadedOrAssignedValue) { throw new ForeignKeyReferenceAlreadyHasValueException(); } OnApplicationIDChanging(value); SendPropertyChanging(); _ApplicationID = value; SendPropertyChanged("ApplicationID"); OnApplicationIDChanged(); } } } private EntityRef _Application; [Association(Name=@"Application_ApplicationExecution", Storage=@"_Application", ThisKey=@"ApplicationID", OtherKey=@"ApplicationID", IsForeignKey=true)] public Application Application { get { return _Application.Entity; } set { Application previousValue = _Application.Entity; if ((previousValue != value) || (!_Application.HasLoadedOrAssignedValue)) { SendPropertyChanging(); if (previousValue != null) { _Application.Entity = null; previousValue.ApplicationExecutions.Remove(this); } _Application.Entity = value; if (value != null) { value.ApplicationExecutions.Add(this); _ApplicationID = value.ApplicationID; } else { _ApplicationID = default(int); } SendPropertyChanged("Application"); } } } That property is on a class called ApplicationExecution. When I pull that object down, its Application property is populated on the server side, but it is null when I try to access it on the client side, after it is retrieved via a WCF service call. I'm pretty sure all of the correct attributes are still there. Am I missing anything? If not, what might have caused this to stop working?
