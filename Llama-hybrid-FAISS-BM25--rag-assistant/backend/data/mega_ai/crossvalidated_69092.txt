What is the qualitative difference between a Michaelis-Menten model and a log-linear model?

In a book chapter I am reading 1 the authors compare the fit of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function using both a log-linear model and a Michaelis-Menten model. The authors refer to the Michaelis-Menten model as "saturating" and the log-linear model as non-saturating. ...authors of the publications used in [Meta-analysis 1] did not distinguish between non-linear curves that do (Michaelis-Menten) and do not saturate (log-linear). In [Meta-analysis 2] this distinction could be made and showed that the average R 2 value was 0.690 and 0.682 for the saturating Michaelis-Menten and log-linear relationship, respectively. My initial investigation into these models (via Wikipedia etc...) appears to show very similar behavior in that they both approach an asymptote with increasing X-values. Furthermore, I am not sure what the authors are referring to with respect to the saturating and non-saturating descriptions because both models appear to saturate. My question is, how should I interpret the relationship differently if it fits one of these models versus the other? NOTE: I have looked up the models and while I can somewhat understand each, I lack the training to relate them mathematically. However, I am looking for a non-mathematical comparison of what fitting one or the other would indicate about the relationship they describe. Schmidt, B. et al. 2008.
