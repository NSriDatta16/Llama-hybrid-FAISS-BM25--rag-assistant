Check out the PLM procedure in SAS: http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings10/258-2010.pdf and, of course, the PLM documentation and examples within. Using PLM, you can specify an input dataset with your desired values for the predictor variables and use the SCORE statement to obtain the predicted values (as well as standard errors, confidence limits, and prediction limits) on either the model scale or the inverse link scale from the model. For a categorical predictor, say CLASS1, you cannot specify a value other than the observed levels of CLASS1. For example, if CLASS1 has two levels (0 and 1), you cannot obtain a prediction by specifying CLASS1=0.5. You can, however, use the ESTIMATE statement to compute the average of the CLASS=0 and the CLASS=1 values for a specified value of VAR1. You could use ESTIMATE in either the original procedure (e.g., GLIMMIX) or in PLM. Hope this helps, Susan
