Your number of effective samples is so low for Person -- two orders of magnitude -- that I'm not sure you can iterate your way out of this. Though you could try bumping the number of iterations up to, say, 12000 and see if you make progress. I'm no expert, but I think the way forward will be to choose some priors instead of using the default uniform (improper) priors. I have no experience with assigning priors to sd , but my guess is that's where you might begin. See prior= in the brm help, and also set_prior (with class="sd" ). Discussions like this at Andrew Gelman's blog, How to think about “identifiability” in Bayesian inference? , may be helpful.
