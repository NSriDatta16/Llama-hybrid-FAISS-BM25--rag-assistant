It is possible that your problem is relatively simple, so your SVM converges to a good solution really fast. However if your dataset is highly skewed, then simply a high precision might be misleading. For example, if you are doing a spam email classification and 95% of your training data is 0 (or non-spam), then a classifier always prediction 0 will give you 95% accuracy. You may want to look at the confusion matrix of your model output to see whether it is such a case. If it is, you may consider to upsample the minority class(es) or to assign different weights to your classes ( see some discussions here ).
