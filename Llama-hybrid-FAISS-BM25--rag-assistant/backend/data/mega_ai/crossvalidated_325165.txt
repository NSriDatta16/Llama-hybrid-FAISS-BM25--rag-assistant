Simulating Bayesian Power Priors

I'm trying to implement Bayesian power priors to discount historical data. $$\pi^p(\theta|\mathbf{z_{n_0}},a_0) \propto \pi_0(\theta) * L(\theta;\mathbf{z_{n_0}})^{a_0}$$ where $\pi^p$ is the posterior, $\pi_0$ is the prior, $L$ is the likelihood function, $\theta$ are the parameters of interest, $\mathbf{z_{n_0}}$ is the historical data, and $a_0 \in [0,1]$ is the discounting factor. My problem consists of five parameters, and if $a_0 =1$, I can simulate it using an MCMC method like Gibbs sampler. There is no conjugate prior and accompanying closed-form solution available in my problem. If $a_0 = 0$, the posterior equals the prior and no updating is required. For any other value of $a_0$, I haven't come across any ways of getting the result. If conjugate priors are used, there are closed form solutions ( examples in Section 5 ). @Florian, yes I want to estimate the posterior. Sorry for the confusion. @Bj√∂rn, thanks for the suggestion. I am looking at a fixed exponent and am using R, so I will try rstan. I'll report back afterwards.
