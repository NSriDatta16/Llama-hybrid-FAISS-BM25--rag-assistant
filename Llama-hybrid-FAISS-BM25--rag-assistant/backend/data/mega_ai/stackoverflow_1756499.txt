Can I go for in-line specification of the XSL into the XML document?

I'm embedding an HTML control in our CRM system, and using it to display a bit of XML. I want to format this using an XSL document. Everything works fine when I test it locally with a test.xml and a test.xsl, but of course when I change the XSL link to \\servername\share\test.xsl then it doesn't work, I imagine because the location is not trusted. Can I in-line the XSL into the XML document? How else could I format the contents of a Browser control when I can't really use relative paths? Thanks
