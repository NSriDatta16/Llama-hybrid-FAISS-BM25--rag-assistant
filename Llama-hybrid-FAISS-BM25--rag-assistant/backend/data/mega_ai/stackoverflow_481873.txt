I know I'll get downvoted for this, but I really think people are starting to overabuse the annotation mechanism in Java. All it was designed for was to be a mechanism for providing metainformation about classes and methods for the purpose of the compiler or of programming-support tools (e.g., testing infrastructure, model checkers, code generators, etc.) It was not meant for actual production-oriented code, macro metaprogramming, and all that. This is just as inelegant as using preprocessor macros in C instead of actual functions. If menus are first-class entities in your program, I really don't feel that you should be using the annotation mechanism for them. As for your specific questions, you can easily define a default value. However, you can't start doing things like nesting annotations to overcome the menu problem. It really wasn't designed for this.
