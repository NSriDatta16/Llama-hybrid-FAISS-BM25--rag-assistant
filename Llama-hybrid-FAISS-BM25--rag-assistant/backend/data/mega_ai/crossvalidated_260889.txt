Is there an algorithm to transform arguments from text to "standard form"?

Consider the following deductive argument , in the form of a paragraph: Drugs use should be legalised, because it is an attack against individual freedom, which is a founding element of our societies. At the moment, the state is prohibiting that freedom to people. This argument can be reconstructed into the "standard form" (where P stands for premise, and C for conclusion): P1 Freedom is a founding element of our societies P2 The prohibition of drugs use by the state is an attack on freedom $------$ C Drugs use should be legalised. Is there an algorithm/method/tool in AI, Natural Language Processing, or machine learning that is able to translate an argument in the form of a text into the "standard form"? Or perhaps easier, an algorithm that can transform an argument in its standard form into a paragraph? (They are probably related)
