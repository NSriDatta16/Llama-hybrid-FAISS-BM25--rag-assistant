Standardization centers the values around a mean of $0$ with standard deviation $1$ . Therefore, having values smaller than $0$ or greater than $1$ is to be expected. If you want to make sure values are between $0$ and $1$ you need to normalize the data instead. Here is an example of the two procedures taken from the book "Python Machine Learning" by Raschka: Be aware though to apply the procedure to your test data with parameters obtained from the training data (in case of standardization: mean and std. dev. of train data). Sklearn has methods for standardization and normalization which you might want to have a look at.
