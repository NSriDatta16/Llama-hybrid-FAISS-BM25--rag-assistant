How to calculate overall odds ratios from two 2X2 contingency tables with correlated variables?

I have analyzed the odds ratio (and risk ratio) from a 2x2 contingency table - I have calculated the odds of Y is true (i.e. =1) given that X1 is true (i.e. =1) versus X1 is false (i.e. =0). The result is a statistically significant odds ratio (and risk ratio) greater than 1. I now have a second variable (X2), and in the same way (2x2 contingency table) have calculated the odds ratio (and risk ratio) to be greater than 1. But ... I have an expectation (from domain knowledge in my field) that when X2=0 the influence of X1 on Y may be reduced (i.e. there is an interaction between independent variables). I want to test this hypothesis - and am looking for advice on how best to do so. An approach I have done so far (but I am looking for suggestions as to why this might not be appropriate) is that I have formed a third contingency table counting the number of times our outcome is true for (X1=1 while X2=0) versus the number of times outcome is true for (X1=1 while X2=1). In doing so I observe that the case (X1=1 while X2=0) results in lower odds of the outcome compared to (X1=1 while X2=1). Is it appropriate to form contingency tables this way? If not can you please explain why not and suggest why other alternate approaches may be better (i.e. logistic regression?). Thanks in advanced, I am familiar with R if that may guide suggestions.
