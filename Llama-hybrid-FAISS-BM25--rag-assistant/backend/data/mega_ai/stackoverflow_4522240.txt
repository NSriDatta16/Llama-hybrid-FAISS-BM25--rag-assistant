Digital Number Recoginition - Neural Network? Other Technique?

I need to find some method to recognize images with a single digital number in it (black on white). What I have read so far, I would use a neural network. Is a SOM (self organizing map) the correct network type? Is there any other good way to to recognize digital (I have found a lot of stuff for handwritten characters, but not on digital numbers) numbers that I haven't thought of yet?
