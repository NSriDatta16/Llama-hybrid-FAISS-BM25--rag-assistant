Ria Services Passing Complex Object as parameter to a query domain service method

I'm experiencing some difficulties with a WCF RIA Services similar to the problem specified in this thread . The domainservice method I'm creating (a Query method) should take a complex object parameter. example domainservice method: public ComplexObjectResult GetComplexObject(ComplexObjectParameter test) { //do stuff } the parameter object: public class ComplexObjectParameter { [Key] public decimal ID { get; set; } ... other fields } I get this compilation error: Error 70 Parameter 'test' of domain operation entry 'GetComplexObject' must be one of the predefined serializable types . After some searching on the web I found this msdn thread . It states that this is a limitation of RIA services and the thread specifies no decent workarounds. Now there seem to be some dirty workarounds: Change the complex parameter to type string and Serialize/Deserialize the parameterobject ourself which I find a very hacky solution. Use [Invoke] tag on the domain service method and loose all RIA tracking functionality, for which I am using RIA in the first place. Are there alternatives for the mentioned solutions that have less disadvantages? Has someone found a more elegant workaround for this problem? Thanks
