Even though, I found stuff online using the term "supervised dimensionality reduction", for now I decided to place it in the unsupervised learning part of my book. I am still not sure what they mean by supervised DR, since I didn't have the time to read those articles, but I will treat DR as unsupervised for now. Also, given that I didn't get much response for my question here, I assume most people don't even care about this issue, and they just treat DR as unsupervised learning.
