multiple attribution with linear regression

I’m working on a problem that is analyzing purchases at a store and determining the effect from advertising. There are many advertising variables, but to keep things simple, assume there are three types of media: Television, desktop, mobile four types of creatives (ad speak for advertisement type): tv_crt_A, tv_crt_B, digital_crt_A, digital_crt_B two types of tv shows: tv_A and tv_B two types of websites: web_A and web_B The independent variables are Television, Desktop, mobile tv_crt_A, tv_crt_B, digital_crt_A, digital_crt_B, tv_A, tv_B, web_A, web_B Each time an ad is served to a given person they may have any combination of the above. For Example, on October 1, person p _1 may be servered with an ad with the following attributes: Vector_1=0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1 This equates to person_1 being served an add on desktop with digital_ctr_B on web_B. Count the number of purchases that this person makes before getting another ad ( they may only get one ad). If they do not purchase before they receive another ad they receive a 0. For example, 4 days later they receive another ad of the form 0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0 so person p_1 was served an ad on oct 5 on mobile, with digital_ctr_B on web_A. There is a cumulative effect to advertising, so this exposure takes the form of vector_2= 0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1 meaning that they have now been served an ad on desktop and mobile, and seen digital_ctr_B twice, once on web_A and once on web_B. Again, count all the purchases they make before they receive their next ad exposure. Since this is sensitive the time between exposures I thought about modeling the problem as the average purchases per day between exposures. For example if person p_1 made a purchase on oct 2 and oct 3, then we would have y= 2(purcahses)/4(days)=.5 Could I get the coefficients for each variable and then for each purchase divide each unique coefficient-variable product by the sum of the coefficient-variable product for that exposure. Suppose the coefficients for the variables are Television =.10 Desktop =.041 Mobile = .0352 tv_crt_A =.078 tv_crt_B = .119 digital_crt_A =.002 digital_crt_B =.047 tv_A =.043 tv_B= .021 web_A =.037 web_B = .081 For the two purchases in vector_1 I would get a contribution for Desktop = (1*(.041))/(1*.041 + 1*.047+ 1*.081) digital_crt_B= (1*(.047))/(1*.041 + 1*.047+ 1*.081) web_B= (1*(.081))/(1*.041 + 1*.047+ 1*.081) All other variables would have zero contribution for this purchase. Suppose there was 1 purchase for vector_2. I would get contributions of Desktop = (1*(.041))/ (1*.041 + 1*(.0352) + 2*.047+ 1*.037 + 1*.081) Mobile=(1*(.0352))/ ))/ (1*.041 + 1*(.0352) + 2*.047+ 1*.037 + 1*.081) digital_crt_B= (2*(.047))/ (1*.041 + 1*(.0352) + 2*.047+ 1*.037 + 1*.081) web_A= (1*(.037))/ (1*.041 + 1*(.0352) + 2*.047+ 1*.037 + 1*.081) web_B= (1*(.081))/ (1*.041 + 1*(.0352) + 2*.047+ 1*.037 + 1*.081) All other variables would have zero contribution for the purchase. A could make this a binary outcome, “purchased” or “not purchased” and use logistic regression, but I thought this approach would give a more granular view. Is this a sound approach?
