UIControlEventTouch...?

I have a grid of images/buttons, and I want the user to be able to drag their finger over the images/buttons such that when their finger touches each image/button an event is called. How do I do this??? The best example I can think of now is the Contacts app, how you drag your finger down the list of letters (on the right) and as you touch each letter it jumps to that part of the contacts list.
