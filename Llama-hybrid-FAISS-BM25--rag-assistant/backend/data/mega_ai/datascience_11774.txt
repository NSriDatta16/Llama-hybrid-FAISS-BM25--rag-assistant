Which features do I select from text?

Hello, I am very new to data science, machine learning, and stack overflow. Excuse me for being unclear or asking naive questions. My question is as follows: From any given document, I am trying to classify it according to the emotions it evokes in readers, using a neural network. However, I am having difficulties with feature selection. I'm thinking of using NLTK and RAKE to extract keywords, but I don't know how I can translate them into features. Should I hash the keywords for one feature? Or, should I find a dictionary of english words (i.e. Wordnet), and use every word in the dictionary as a feature.
