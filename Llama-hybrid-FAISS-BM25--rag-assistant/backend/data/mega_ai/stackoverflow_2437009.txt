ext-js chart, multiple series on same chart

Ext-js Chart, I have a line graph, and I wish to add a single line(eg. average line) to the graph. The only way I can think of to emulate this line is to do the following: add an extra field with identical value to all my data points if, but this seems to be a waste and plus I don't want to show the dots that comes with the line. is there anyway to add an average line to my existing chart?
