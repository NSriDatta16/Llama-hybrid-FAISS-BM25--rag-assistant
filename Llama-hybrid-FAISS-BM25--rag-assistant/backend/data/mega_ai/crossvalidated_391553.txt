Should we trust statistics?

My mathematical statistics theory professor, an expert in the field, said today he doesn't trust statistics enough to use it in practice. He just likes the beauty of the math. He said he would never be able to teach applied statistics in good conscience. Do you trust statistics? If so, why? The more statistics I learn, the more I realize how much of it is founded on assumptions. We specify assumptions, and then use rigorous mathematics to generate conclusions. Why is this any better than not using advanced statistics? After all, we do not know our assumptions are true. How can we justify hypothesis testing, for example, when we don't know the true distribution? (I ignore descriptive statistics here, which are clearly useful.) The more I learn, the less confidence I have in statistics and the more faith I have in machine learning, which is not bold enough to make claims like causality.
