Getting the uptime of a SunOS UNIX box in seconds only

How do I determine the uptime on a SunOS UNIX box in seconds only? On Linux, I could simply cat /proc/uptime & take the first argument: cat /proc/uptime | awk '{print $1}' I'm trying to do the same on a SunOS UNIX box, but there is no /proc/uptime. There is an uptime command which presents the following output: $ uptime 12:13pm up 227 day(s), 15:14, 1 user, load average: 0.05, 0.05, 0.05 I don't really want to have to write code to convert the date into seconds only & I'm sure someone must have had this requirement before but I have been unable to find anything on the internet. Can anyone tell me how to get the uptime in just seconds? TIA
