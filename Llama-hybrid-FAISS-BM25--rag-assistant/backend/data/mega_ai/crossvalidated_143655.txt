This is certainly possible; participant responses to your eight scenarios, rated on a 7-point scale, would make fine indicators for an SEM. However, it seems that you are already anticipating three "first-order" latent variables, pertaining to investment behavior based on (1) expertise, (2) product tested-ness, and (3) market tested-ness. As such, you might want to consider specifying a second-order latent variable model (see Beaujean, 2014, for a conceptual description), in which your scenario responses load onto their respective first-order latent variables, which subsequently load onto a second-order "investor behavior" factor. If you were going to pursue the second-order latent variable modeling strategy, I'd encourage you to consider ensuring that you have at least three indicators (i.e., scenarios) per first-order latent variable, so that each of them would be just-identified (if not over-identified). The measurement model in lavaan would look something like this (using a marker-variable method of scale-setting): library(lavaan) investor.model Note that this second-order latent variable model model will fit the data equally as well as a model in which only the first-order latent variables were specified. If you want to see, just remove inv.beh=~expertise+prod.test+mark.test from the script. I recommend the second-order model simply because it seems to better represent the theoretical model for investor behavior you seem to be outlining above. References Beaujean, A. A. (2014).
