Given a 4d tensor for time series predicition

I have multiple time series datasets, which i want to train to an lstm model. The shape of the training data is (735,2,5,4). 735 are the time steps, 2 are the two time Series datasets, 5 are the sliding windows and 4 are features. How can i train an lstm model with a 4d tensor.
