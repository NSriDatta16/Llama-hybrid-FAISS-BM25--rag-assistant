What's a concise way to check that environment variables are set in a Unix shell script?

I've got a few Unix shell scripts where I need to check that certain environment variables are set before I start doing stuff, so I do this sort of thing: if [ -z "$STATE" ]; then echo "Need to set STATE" exit 1 fi if [ -z "$DEST" ]; then echo "Need to set DEST" exit 1 fi which is a lot of typing. Is there a more elegant idiom for checking that a set of environment variables is set? EDIT: I should mention that these variables have no meaningful default value - the script should error out if any are unset.
