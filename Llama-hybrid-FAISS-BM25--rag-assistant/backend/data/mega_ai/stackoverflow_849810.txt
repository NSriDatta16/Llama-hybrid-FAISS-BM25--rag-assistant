Large Report Implementation Recommendations 250 - 300 pages

My group has a report that was recently developed utilizing Reporting Services 2005 with the NeoDynamics Bar Code component. The report is for return authorizations and consists of 2 main reports. The first set of data on the report is the authorization form, listing all of the line item products and some header information (think of it as an invoice). The second item on the report is the listing of all of the products which prints out 4 products per page. Each product has 3 bar codes and 1 logo. The average return authorization is produced in just a couple of seconds and streamed to the user as a PDF. The average document is about 6 - 8 pages in length. We also have some return authorizations (unfortunately) that can get up to about 300 pages (less than 10% of authorizations are more than 15 pages). Reporting Services seems to timeout after minutes of trying to put the report together as a PDF. My question is, what is our best option for getting this report into a PDF format? Our users are allowed to generate the report 24x7 and it is streamed to them as a PDF. Are there things we can do to improve the reporting services performance?
