Test its side-effects. This includes: Does it throw any exceptions? (If it should, check that it does. If it shouldn't, try some corner cases which might if you're not careful - null arguments being the most obvious thing.) Does it play nicely with its parameters? (If they're mutable, does it mutate them when it shouldn't and vice versa?) Does it have the right effect on the state of the object/type you're calling it on? Of course, there's a limit to how much you can test. You generally can't test with every possible input, for example. Test pragmatically - enough to give you confidence that your code is designed appropriately and implemented correctly, and enough to act as supplemental documentation for what a caller might expect.
