Backpropagation in Faster R-CNN

I understand how the convolution layers are applied after selective search finds the regions of interest in vanilla R-CNN and so the back-propagation or any weight updating is done in the individual convolution networks. But in Faster R-CNN a convNet is applied first and then RPN works out the regions of interest in a separate convNet. Where exactly are the weights updated? Is it between the initial convNet and the RPN. But weights can only be updated after comparison with the ground truth values. Or is it that after a full forward pass of both networks, a backward pass is done. In this case how are both considered simultaneously? If not, Where and how is this comparison done? Any pointers to any resource will be highly appreciated.
