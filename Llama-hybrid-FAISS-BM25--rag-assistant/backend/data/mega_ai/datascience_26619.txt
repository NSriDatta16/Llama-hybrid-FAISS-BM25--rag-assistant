does accuracy and performance depends on whole dataset or fraction of that data mimics the whole?

MNIST dataset is handwritten images which contains 60000 training and 10000 testing samples , can I use only a fraction of dataset for instance 10000 for training and 4000 for testing. I want to know that whether my results will be comparable to other claimed results. Like I used random forest classifier on 10k training and 4k testing and got accuracy of 93 %. would this result be equivalent when I use 60k training and 10k testing . and in some published papers I read that they only used 40 images per class and evaluated their accuracy and performance using them does it conforms to the standards that use 60k as training and 10k as testing. Or we can say that the choice of selection of training and testing data is dependent on the method used to classify
