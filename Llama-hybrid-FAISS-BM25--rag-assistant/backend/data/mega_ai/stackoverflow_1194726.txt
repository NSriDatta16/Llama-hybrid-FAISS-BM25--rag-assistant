Well, there, Jack, what you've listed is a hodge-podge of half-right answers. There are a lot of ways to start an SSIS package. However, the best way is probably sp_start_job . Now, this implies that you've created a job that will run your SSIS package. A lot of times, this puppy fails because of credentials issues. Namely, you're trying to run the bloody thing as the SQL Server Agent account (aka LOCAL SYSTEM ), which doesn't bode too well for execution abilities. So, you'll need to create a Credential , and then a Proxy for the job to run as. Therefore, what you need to do is thusly: CREATE CREDENTIAL MyCred WITH IDENTITY 'CORP\MyUser', SECRET = ' ' GO sp_add_proxy @proxy_name='MyProxy', @enabled = 1, @credential = 'MyCred' GO sp_grant_proxy_to_subsystem @proxy_name = 'MyProxy', @subsystem_id = 3 GO sp_add_job @job_name = 'MyJob', @enabled = 1 GO sp_add_jobstep @job_name = 'MyJob', @step_name = 'Run SSIS Package', @subsystem = 'CMDEXEC', @command = 'dtexec /F C:\Path\To\Package.dtsx', @proxy_name = 'MyProxy' Meaningful docs: CREATE CREDENTIAL sp_add_proxy sp_grant_proxy_to_subsystem sp_add_job sp_add_jobstep
