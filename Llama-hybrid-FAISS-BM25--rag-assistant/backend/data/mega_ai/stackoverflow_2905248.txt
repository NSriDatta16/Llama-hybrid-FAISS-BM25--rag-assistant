This is an Anonymous Class . What is actually happening is that a subclass of Handler is being created with an overridden handleMessage function. One of the most elegant things about anonymous classes is that they allow you to define a one-shot class exactly where it is needed. In addition, anonymous classes have a succinct syntax that reduces clutter in your code. You also asked "Could somebody explain to me exactly what final does". A nice explanation can be found here . In the case of your example the final keyword stops anybody from being able to assign a new instance / null the instance of the variable "handler" meaning I cannot write the line handler = null; or handler = new Handler() { ... } after your example code snippet.
