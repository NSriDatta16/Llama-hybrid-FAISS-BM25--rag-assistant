Optimal classifier or optimal threshold for scoring

In practice, there can be a classifier that gives far better performance at a specific acceptable threshold than an "optimal" classifier with better average performance across range of thresholds (higher AUC) but not so much at that threshold. For example: Classifier 1: 80% TPR with 5% FPR, 95% TPR with 40% FPR, AUC = 0.6 Classifier 2: 40% TPR with 5% FPR, 95% TPR with 20% FPR, AUC = 0.9 Shouldn't I use classifier 1 instead of classifier 2 if I am operating around 5% FPR acceptable threshold? Also, what if I am allowed to run near 10% FPR? Should I just check TPR from both classifiers corresponding to 10% FPR and pick the classifier that has higher TPR? Or compute a partial area under curve until 10% FPR and pick the one with the highest?
