At least in 2.6, slices of strings are always new allocations; string_slice() calls PyString_FromStringAndSize(). It doesn't reuse memory--which is a little odd, since with invariant strings, it should be a relatively easy thing to do. Short of the buffer API (which you probably don't want), there isn't a more efficient way to do this operation.
