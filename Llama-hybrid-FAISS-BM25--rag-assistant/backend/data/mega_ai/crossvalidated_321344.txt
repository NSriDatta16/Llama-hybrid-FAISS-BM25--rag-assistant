As suggested in the comments, a moving average of some kind may help. Here we see the results of smoothing with weights (1:2:1)/4 and (1:4:6:4:1)/16, otherwise known as binomial filters of length 3 (Hanning) and 5 (Hanning repeated). A simple trick to wrap the smoothers round at the end of the day is to smooth on the data copied three-fold and then just to show results for the middle part. The results are not especially clear-cut. There are essentially no details on the generating process given in the original post, but various peaks in visit times presumably mix times of leisure and/or visitors from different time zones. As there appear to be perhaps 4 minor peaks, sinusoids don't seem likely to help further.
