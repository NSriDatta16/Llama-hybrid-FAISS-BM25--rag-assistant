android: can 140 dpi will get mdpi resource?

In android docs, it is said that 140 still is ldpi, but when I change dpi to 140, I find mdpi resource is retrieved, can someone have idea? thanks a lot. btw, I read the code about how to get resource, seems ldpi's max dpi value is 131.25? Does google post the wrong doc?
