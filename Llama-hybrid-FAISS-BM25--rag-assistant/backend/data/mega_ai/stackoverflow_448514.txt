Can I add sub folders to a SQL Server Management Studio Project?

What is the best way to keep large projects organized with SSMS? I want to do something like: ProjectRoot SchemaObjects Tables Constraints Indexes Keys Functions Views Stored Procedures Scripts DataGeneration And so on, but I cannot find a nice way to do this... Any suggestions?
