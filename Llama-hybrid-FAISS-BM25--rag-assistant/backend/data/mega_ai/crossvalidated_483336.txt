Interesting question - I assume that you want to build a classifier that predicts for example whether the price of a stock goes up - or down - during the coming day. My advice is to take a different path. With literally millions of feature variables available, I would start off with a machine learning method that uses feature selection as an integral part of its building process. I would go for C4.5 or other decision tree classifiers which perform sequential forward feature search during learning. You will end up with a classifier model with a small subset of well-predicting features. Use that subset of features to train other classifiers for comparison, neural networks, discriminant analysis, logistic regression - a support vector machine. Regularization is mainly applied for reducing model complexity - a different purpose than feature selection. Dimensionality reduction is applicable - but most often comes down to principal component analysis (PCA) - a technique which assumes normally distributed data.
