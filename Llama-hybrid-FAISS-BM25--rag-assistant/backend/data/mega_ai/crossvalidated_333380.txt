The Wilcoxon test is acutally not a test of medians but of ranks. There is a median test, but that apparently has low power(1) ist thus rarely used ( R obviously has a package - you know! (2)). You might also want to look in the wilcox.test - help pages to read about a "pseudomedian": help(wilcox.test) There is no logical problem with presenting means whilst proving difference in ranks. You may consider it "not elegant", if you are so inclined. There is no problem in reporting the mean as well as the median, if that helps. Chances are, that you can actually use parametric tests in the absence of normality, if you have enough data. It is hard to tell, how much data is enough for how big a deviance from normality. Some say $n>30$ or $n>50$ might bie good rules of thumb. And finally, if you have enough observations, you might compare means of non-normal data by bootstrapping...
