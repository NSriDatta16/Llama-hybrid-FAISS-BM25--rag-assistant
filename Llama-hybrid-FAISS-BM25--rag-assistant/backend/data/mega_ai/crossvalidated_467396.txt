data leakage when scaling time series

Suppose I want to forecast future values of $y$ past values of features $x$ . In this example I am using: the training set goes from $t_0$ to $t_{15}$ values from $x_{t_0}$ to $x_{t_{10}}$ to forecast $y_{t_{11}}$ values from $x_{t_1}$ to $x_{t_{11}}$ to forecast $y_{t_{12}}$ and so on until I use $x_{t_6}$ to $x_{t_{15}}$ to forecast $y_{t_{16}}$ I scale the my feature $x$ using only data in the training set (up to $t_{15}$ ) Nevertheless when I try to predict $y_{t_{17}}$ you can see from the picture below that I use some data points that have also been used for scaling. Is this leakage?
