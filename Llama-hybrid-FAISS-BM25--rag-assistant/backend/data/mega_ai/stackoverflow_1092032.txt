AFAIK, there is no way to know drop target (in your case destination folder). You can look into CFSTR_FILENAMEMAP shell clipboard format, but still in this case you can only provide name mappings before (or in process) of drag-n-drop. Also note, that default DataObject in .net has limited shell support. So if you need to use mentioned above format, you need to write your own IDataObject implementation (or take someone's implementation, good example with lot shell drag-n-drop related stuff can be found here )
