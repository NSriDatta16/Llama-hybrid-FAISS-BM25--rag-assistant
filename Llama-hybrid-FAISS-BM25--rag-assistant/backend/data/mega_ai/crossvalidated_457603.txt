the title of your question confuses me along with the amount of observed data you are trying to use . are you eying to identify with 823 .. re-estimate parameters of the model developed on the 823 using 823 + 100 and them with this model and re-tuned parameters make a forecast for observations starting at 924 ? Since you didn't proved the data for the 823 values... I could not develop a model for that time range. Since time series models are based upon capturing the signal/equation from history and measuring it's true out-of-sample accuracy in order to place reasonable expectations going into the true future â€¦ Based upon a specified horizon length ( say 7 periods) I would take the 200 observations and go back to period 193, identify a model and parameters and forecast the next 7 periods (observations 194-200 ) and obtain a weighted mape of 18.67 . I would then go back to period 186 develop a model and parameters and predict observations 187-193 and obtain 34.36. Doing this 12 more times yields the following table showing the actual summed and forecast summed the 14th iteration predicts observations 103-109 Note that a new model is developed using all of the data up to and including the values observed before the forecast. I am unfamiliar with what you are trying to do and can't answer your question as I don't precisely know what you want. One additional option is to identify a model say with 102 values and fix the model and parameters ( God knows why ! ) and use that model and parameters to generate the 14 sets of 7 period out forecasts . Here are the results for the 14 origins using a 7 period out-of-sample .
