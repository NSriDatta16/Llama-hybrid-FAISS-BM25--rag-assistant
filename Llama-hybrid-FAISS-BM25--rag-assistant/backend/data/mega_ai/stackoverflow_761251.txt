This is an excellent starter project for AI coding, but coming up with a complete solution will be way to big of an answer for SO. As with most software, I recommend using an object-oriented design. For example: Define a Neuron class which has inputs, weights, and an output function. Then, create several of these Neuron objects in order to build your network. See the wikipedia article on artificial neural networks for a good starting point. Good luck with the code! Sounds like a lot of fun.
