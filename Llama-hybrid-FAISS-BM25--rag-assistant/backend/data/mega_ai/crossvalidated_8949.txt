There's many different kinds of matrices that can be obtained from data. Off the top of my head: a covariance matrix: you have several variables measured on each data point, and you want to see how they are correlated a misclassification matrix: you have a categorical output or response variable, and another variable that attempts to estimate or predict the response a grid of spatial measurements: adjacent rows/columns are in some sense closer to each other than to non-adjacent rows/columns a contingency table of counts or cell averages The methods you'd use to analyse these matrices would differ. I'd guess that your matrix is the last one judging from the ANOVA mention, but it would be good to have more information.
