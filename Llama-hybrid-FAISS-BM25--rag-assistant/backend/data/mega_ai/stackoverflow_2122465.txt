SSH cannot authenticate to git@github.com

Recently, I sign up for a free plan on Github.com. I follow their instructions to generate a ssh key to add to my account. However, when I try ssh -v git@github.com , I get this error: debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 277 Agent admitted failure to sign using the key. debug1: Trying private key: /home/phuongnd08/.ssh/identity debug1: Trying private key: /home/phuongnd08/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: No more authentication methods to try. Permission denied (publickey). When I look into the error, I see a funny thing here, that is the .ssh/id_rsa was not tried, just .ssh/identity and .ssh/id_dsa were tried. How can I fix this error? Thanks
