Resolving a dependency inside a dependency would require the use of the ivy packager resolver . I've never configured the package resolver from within Gradle, but I think it would work something like the following (Referencing webpage ) repositories { add(new org.apache.ivy.plugins.resolver.packager.PackagerResolver()) { name = 'local Ivy packagers' buildRoot = file("${gradle.gradleUserHomeDir}/packager/build") resourceCache = file("${gradle.gradleUserHomeDir}/packager/cache") addIvyPattern "file:///${project.rootDir}/ivy/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/ivy.xml" addArtifactPattern "file:///${project.rootDir}/ivy/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/packager.xml" } } dependencies { compile group: 'org.myorg', name: 'jms', version: '1.1.0.200810061358' } The resolver requires the following files for the declared dependency: ivy/org.myorg/jms/1.1.0.200810061358/ivy.xml ivy/org.myorg/jms/1.1.0.200810061358/packager.xml ivy.xml Describes the module and in this case declares what artifacts are published: packager.xml Describes where the enclosing archive is located and instructions on how to extract jms.jar: The content under the build tag is used to generate an ANT script. For more details read the "Packaging instructions" section of the ivy documentation
