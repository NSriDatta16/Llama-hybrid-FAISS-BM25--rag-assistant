if you have a binary dependent variable, then I guess you will use logistic regression, which assumes the log odds are linear combination of the inputs. using mgcv, the assumption is extended to a smooth (non linear) combination of the inputs. The splines allow you to model the relationship between a given input and the log odds as non linear- eg perhaps impact of liability/total assets suddenly shoots up after reaching 50% liability/total assets.
