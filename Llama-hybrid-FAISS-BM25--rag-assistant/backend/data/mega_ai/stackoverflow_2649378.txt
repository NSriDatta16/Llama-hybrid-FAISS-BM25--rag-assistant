If you're talking full boat Java EE, then Glassfish. GFv2.1 is rock solid, GFv3 is too young to say, but offers new Java EE 6. Actively developed, free and commercial support, good forums. Oracle has published it roadmap for it. It's easy to use, easy to configure, well organized. Great console. Really well documented, vast amounts of supplementary documents and article from folks working different aspects of it (Metro, Grizzly, JAX-RS, NetBeans, etc.) NetBeans + Glassfish is a painless out of box experience to get started. Offers clustering and all sorts of management options.
