RDL below. I just use defaults of everything. For some reason I had to set the colours for the graph to show anything. And you have to fill the high and low as well. I just put in the average of the open and close so they did not show. EDIT: Modified to include the crosses and diamonds. I set all the values of a new series to lastyear then turned on only the markers. Then I did the same again for the thisyear. They do not seem to be positioned ideally but that is the best I could do. 892866e1-c006-4497-9545-251d2a43feb0 SQL Data Source=rover4;Initial Catalog=master true 29.7cm true 21cm 0.25cm true 2.5cm 2.5cm 2.5cm 55a6b44d-b38d-4f58-b9bf-fd26c6f80e4a 21cm codename System.String thisyear System.Int32 lastyear System.Int32 DataSource1 Select 'code1' as codename, 45 as thisyear, 46 as lastyear union Select 'code2' as codename, 42 as thisyear, 55 as lastyear union Select 'code3' as codename, 57 as thisyear, 40 as lastyear union Select 'code4' as codename, 10 as thisyear, 11 as lastyear true 16cm 1cm Solid RightCenter Solid Solid Outside 0 true master LightGrey Solid 30 30 Simple 50 0 Value2 This year markers last year markers 0.25cm Candlestick true Solid Solid Outside 0 100 true true true Stock 15cm =Fields!codename.Value =Fields!codename.Value Default =(Fields!thisyear.Value+Fields!lastyear.Value)/2 =(Fields!thisyear.Value+Fields!lastyear.Value)/2 =Sum(Fields!lastyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!thisyear.Value) SandyBrown Lime Red 6pt =Sum(Fields!thisyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!thisyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!thisyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!thisyear.Value) Diamond 6pt =Sum(Fields!lastyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!lastyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!lastyear.Value) =Sum(Fields!lastyear.Value) Cross 6pt White 0.5cm 10.36905cm en-US 2.5cm 29.7cm
