Extending DTW 1-NN Classification to On-line Scenario

I am familiar with Dynamic Time Warping classification using a 1-nearest neighbour approach. However, in most benchmark datasets and applications, it used ex-post, i.e. classifying a time series after you have observed it. Is there a way to use the dynamic time warping similarity distance in an on-line setting before I have fully observed the series I am comparing? Furthermore, if there is a way to probabilistically categorize as the series comes in that is even better. E.g. After observing 1/10 of the time series, the model predicts this sub-series has a 20% of being in group A, 10% of being in group B, etc
