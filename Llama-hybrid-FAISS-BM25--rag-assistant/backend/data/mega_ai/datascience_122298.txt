How to interpret k=1 when summing over k? Is there something wrong with this equation?

I am having a hard time understanding the following equation to do with document clustering. Is there something wrong with it? $$\ln \left(\prod_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K p\left(x_n \mid z_n, k=1\right) p\left(z_n, k=1\right)\right)$$ In pseudo code I initially want to read this as The natural log of The product of (for each n) The sum of (for each k) The joint probability of The (data variable given the latent variable) and the first k Multiplied by the joint probability of the latent variable and k being 1 But then why would we enumerate over K? For example if k=K and K !=1 Is there a more concise way to write the equation? [Update] GPT advises $$\ln \left(\prod_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K p\left(x_n \mid z_n, k\right) p\left(z_n \mid k\right)\right)$$ [Update] The full question is The answer is [Update] From my course notes I understand that $z_i=k$ and $k \in \{1...K\}$ and it represents the class label for the ith document.
