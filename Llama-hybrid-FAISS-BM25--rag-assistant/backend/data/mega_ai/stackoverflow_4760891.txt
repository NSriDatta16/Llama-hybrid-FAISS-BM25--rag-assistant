Am I allowed to store data retrieved from Facebook connect on my server?

Am I allowed to permanently store data I retrieve from Facebook connect about a user (eg. firstname, lastname etc.) on my server if my application requires it to function? If the user deinstalls the app I will remove it again of course. I have heard this is not allowed, but could not find the right paragraph in their terms of use.
