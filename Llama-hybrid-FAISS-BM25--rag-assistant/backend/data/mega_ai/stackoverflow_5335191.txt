This is the way I imagine it for clips - separating the problem into smaller ones: You can focus on checking whether people are smiling in the video. First use an algorithm that detects faces. Then you create several random (in time) samples of these faces. Then you use another algorithm (trained neural network) to check if they are smiling in the form of a number: p of n samples smile detected. Use voice recognition to check if they are laughing or crying. Check nodding (beware in some countries it is the opposite way, but you can skip this part for now) Check whether the clip starts loudly and ends that way. Once you recognized these 4 (example ones) you can try to train a neural network on top of them: smiling, positive nodding, loud start -> positive A good sample data will be sport commentators announcing a team win/lost. Actually all this is good when you do not know what are they saying and this is the case when you want to check all youtube videos, but you do not want to learn all the languages in the world.
