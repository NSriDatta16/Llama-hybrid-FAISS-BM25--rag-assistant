Learn the evaluation matrix for hire a job candidate

Let us assume that we have a certain number of features that are weighted with some parameters . The features could be the different skills that belongs to a job candidate applying for a job vacancies . The decision to give a job to the single candidate is based on a weighted sum of a different features .So we have a neural network model on which we have to learn the matrix that associate the variable x = features that a candidate has to y = ( hire/not hire) I was wondering what is the name in literature of this problem and where i can find suggestion to solve it. Many thanks
