branch_id in this case is a categorical variable, and you can treat is just like you would other categoricals (like city: "Seattle", "San Diego", "Austin"). You just need to be sure you use an algorithm that can treat it as categorical. LightGBM uses a method that sorts and optimally splits the histogram of the categorical integers, which is faster than OHE. CatBoost can leverage a few different methods . In addition to regression, you can similarly convert the customer counts into ranges or histogram bins and use a classification algorithm to predict the bin.
