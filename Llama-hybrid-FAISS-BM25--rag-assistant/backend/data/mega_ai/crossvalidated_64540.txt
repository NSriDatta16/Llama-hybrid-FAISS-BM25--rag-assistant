You might try a Heckman two-step model . If you don't have an exclusion restriction--a variable that changes whether a customer buys or not, but does not affect how much he spends directly--the identification will be fragile and you can get wacky results. But in some marketing examples, a two-step approach can make sense, though it's hard to tell without knowing what your two groups are. Take a look at the examples, formulas and references sections of the Stata manuals . You don't have to use Stata to estimate, but these manuals are pretty nice for explaining the idea. If your expenditure data has a long right tail, you can estimate this model in logs using $\ln(min\{y\}) -\varepsilon$ in place of $\ln(0)$. Play around with what $\varepsilon$ is to make sure your results are not very sensitive. Another approach would be to use the two-part model ( tpm ) command in Stata, which avoids the twin difficulties of exclusion restrictions and logarithmic transformations. It's the continuous outcome counterpart of the hurdle models for count data (like number of purchases rather than revenue). I am not aware of a non-Stata implementation.
