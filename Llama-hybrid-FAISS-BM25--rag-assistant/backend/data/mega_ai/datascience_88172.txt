Although there are several nearest neighbor tool as one mention by @oneextrafact. The problem with that tool is you need to index the external database for a logic operation like you mentioned that you want to build some logic using over date. I will recommend you is to extract a document vector. Although there are several approaches to do that either by training doc2vec or using pre-trained BERT. In case you want to use word2vec then I will recommend the following approach. Train word2vec extract important phrases from each document using text rank. Set a thresh hold for text rank score(0-1) and retrieve those phrases and tokenize those phrases extract word embeddings of those words and average out or sum the vector Now that vector represents the embeddings of that document. Place that vector along with document text, id, and year in Elastic search version 7 and above Elastic search support nearest neighbor search along with other logic like filtering Dates etc.
