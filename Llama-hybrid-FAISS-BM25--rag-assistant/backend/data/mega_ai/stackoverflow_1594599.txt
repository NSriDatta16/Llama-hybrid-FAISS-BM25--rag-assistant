What is $Secure:$SDS:$DATA on Windows?

One of my customers has seen $Secure:$SDS:$DATA show up on their drive and it keeps growing while my app is running. I don't (knowingly) write to this file, and don't use any type of Windows secure storage (which might be related). Kind of stumped... Any thoughts on what this might be?
