Depends... if this was on a domain entity then I wouldn't be in favor having complex logic in a getter and especially not a setter. Using a method (to me) signals a consumer of the entity that an operation is being performed while a getter signals a simple retrieval. Now if this logic was in a ViewModel, then I think the getter aspect is a little more forgivable / expected.
