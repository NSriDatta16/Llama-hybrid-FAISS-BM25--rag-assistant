The explanation in your link is pretty clear. This is a type of interrupted time series model (ITS). Grading post is a vector of two quantities that estimate a difference in trend pre and post intervention in terms of a gap or instantaneous change in trend and a difference-in-differences or change in trend line. If either of these are significant you'd say the intervention did something. You can use fixed effects to model cluster level heterogeneity. It works much the same way as random effects. Simply adjust for cluster indicators and estimate them with maximum likelihood. Seasonal fixed effects is a similar thing: create categorical variables for periodic trend (e.g. Fall/Winter/Summer/Spring or Jan/Feb/Mar.../Dec) and adjust for them in the model.
