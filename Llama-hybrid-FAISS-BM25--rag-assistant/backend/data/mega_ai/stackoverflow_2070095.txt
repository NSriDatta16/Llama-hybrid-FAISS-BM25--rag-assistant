parallelizing a task, how many threads?

Say we have an embarrassingly parallel task, ants providing food for their queen for instance. X = Amount of food needed Y = Time it takes an ant to get a unit of food Z = To get an ant to start foraging for food a single primary thread takes Z seconds. The primary thread can spawn threads until the problem is fully solved but there is a threshold when creating new threads, diminishing returns take effect. To what percentage of progress into a task is it most efficient to stop creating new threads. For a fixed X and Y value how many threads do I tell the primary thread to spawn? Edit: operating environment is a nvidia gts250 gpu using CUDA over java wrapper
