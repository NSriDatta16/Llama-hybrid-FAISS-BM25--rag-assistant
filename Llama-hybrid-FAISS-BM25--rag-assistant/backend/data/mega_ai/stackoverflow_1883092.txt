When your from is encoded as multipart, you can't get the POST values as plain old parameters. They are just additional parts of the multipart form. To retrieve the uploaded files in ASP, you typically have to loop through the parts and check each one to see if it is a file (and then save it if it is). To get field values, you have to add to that loop to check each part to see if it has the name of one of your field values, and then retrieve the value. This is a pain to do in pure ASP code, so many people use some type of file upload component, in which case the retrieval of field values will depend on the component. But the basic message is: whatever parsing of the form you're doing to retrieve the files, you have to do the same thing to retrieve the field values.
