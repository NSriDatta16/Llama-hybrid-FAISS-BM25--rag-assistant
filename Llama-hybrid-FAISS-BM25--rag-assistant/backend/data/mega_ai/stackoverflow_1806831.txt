I just re-compiled everything and it worked So I assume the abstract base class was declared in one binary (for example, in one dll on windows) and the derived class was in another. In that case, if you don't recompile the binary containing the derived class, it's vtable will not be setup properly and the calls will start behaving weirdly and as @Strager said, you need to have the virtual destructor in the base class.
