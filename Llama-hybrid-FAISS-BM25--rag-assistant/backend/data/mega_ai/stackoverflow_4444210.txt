How to copy a large file in Windows XP?

I have a large file in windows XP - its 38GB. (a VM image) I cannot seem to copy it. Dragging on the desktop - gives error of "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service" Using Java - FileChannel.transferTo(0, fileSize, dest) fails for all files > 2GB Using Java - FileChannel.transferTo() in chunks of 100Mb fails after ~18Gb java.io.IOException: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service at sun.nio.ch.FileDispatcher.write0(Native Method) at sun.nio.ch.FileDispatcher.write(FileDispatcher.java:44) at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.writeFromNativeBuffer(IOUtil.java:72) at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.write(IOUtil.java:28) at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.write(FileChannelImpl.java:198) at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.transferToTrustedChannel(FileChannelImpl.java:439) at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.transferTo(FileChannelImpl.java:510) I mean - the computer has 3GB of RAM. A 100GB buffer should be enough!?!? Apparently the DOS commands "copy" and "xcopy" also fail. (edit) I've tried COPY & XCOPY - these fail with the same error. XCOPY seems to take a really really long time about it too. I've heard of Robocopy, but it doesn't copy single files? I'm really feeling that Windows is for the lose right now. Surely microsoft have heard of files larger than a few GB? Thanks!
