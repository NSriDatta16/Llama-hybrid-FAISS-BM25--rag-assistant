What justifies the zero mean assumption for Gaussian processes?

Most internet resources--- papers, slides, etc--- on GP I've found take the mean function to be zero. Chapter 15 of Murphy's book (Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective) says this is because 'the GP is flexible enough to model the mean arbitrarily well, as we will see below' . I didn't see that he ended up explaining this comment. So my question is: Why do you not lose generality when you make a zero mean assumption?
