Help starting ML project in pythin(novice)

I am starting a machine learning project (for fun!), but I am not sure where to start from... I am fairly new to ML so any hints are appreciated. I have a relatively large data-set where each input is a list of roughly 300 integers (mainly zeros). The output is a list of 20ish integers. The goal is to predict the output given a random input (obviously). And I am not sure what is the best method for that. I have started reading a bit into neural networks which seem like it could be a good way to solve such problem, but there seems to be a whole range of different activation etc. (not sure how it's actually called) so I am not really sure what to do. Any hints on what direction to look into? Thanks a lot!
