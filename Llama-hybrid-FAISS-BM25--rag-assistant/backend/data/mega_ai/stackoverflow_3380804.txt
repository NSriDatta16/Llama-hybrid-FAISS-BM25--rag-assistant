String has a Contains method that should suffice, returns a boolean "Big string that represents a paragraph".Contains("that"); Example from the Contains Method MSDN page : // This example demonstrates the String.Contains() method using System; class Sample { public static void Main() { string s1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"; string s2 = "fox"; bool b; b = s1.Contains(s2); Console.WriteLine("Is the string, s2, in the string, s1?: {0}", b); } } /* This example produces the following results: Is the string, s2, in the string, s1?: True */ If you need more advanced matching then Regex might be the correct route, but from the example you stated I think contains will work fine.
