Finding a source of data that can be easily parsed is key, there are quite a few cool data sets out there, check out statlib for a few. One of the more popular data mining applications these days is visualization. You can take a large (but not too large) dataset where each element is related to each other in some way and use dimensionality reduction algorithms to visualize it. Algorithms like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), ISOMap, maximum variance unfolding (MVU), and structure preserving embedding can create 2D (or 3D) representations of the data.
