Basic Machine Learning Question, Looking at where to start

Was recommended to post here instead of StackOverflow I am looking to do some ML, and I just need to know the words to start going off and which library/path to go down. I have two data sets that look something like the below, | UserName | Location | Department | |test.user | Chicago | IT | |asd.smith | LA | Marketing | |qwe.smith | Chicago | IT | |dfg.smith | Chicago | Marketing | and | UserName | Permission | |test.user | 1 | |asd.smith | 2 | |asd.smith | 4 | |qwe.smith | 1 | |dfg.smith | 1 | |dfg.smith | 2 | |dfg.smith | 3 | The problem I am trying to solve is, If a new person is hired into Chicago/Marketing, what is the % chance they would have permission X. So with the above datasets I would expect it to say, There is a 100% chance that they would have Permission 1, 100% they have Permission 2 50% chance they have Permission 3 I am really just looking for a point in the right direction on where to start/what models exist for a problem like this/the right words to google.
