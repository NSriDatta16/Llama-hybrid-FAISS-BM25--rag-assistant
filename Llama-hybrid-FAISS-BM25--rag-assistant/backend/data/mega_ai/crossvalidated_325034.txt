K-means : choose Optimum number of clusters based on graph

I've come into a situation where I dont understand How to choose the number of clusters. The WithinSS increases suddenly after 6. How/What do I interpret of this graph ? Background : I've applied PCA on the data set and used 4 PCs. The clustering is done on the PCs. I'm using K-means cluster algorithm in R.
