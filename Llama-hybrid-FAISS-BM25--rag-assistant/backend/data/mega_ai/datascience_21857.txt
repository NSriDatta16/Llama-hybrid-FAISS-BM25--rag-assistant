Hi, my name is Raj and I'm running to become one of your mods. I work as a Sr. Data Scientist at my day job, while leading communities like Pydata Delhi for helping and educate Data Science and ML enthusiasts via talks and workshops. I think I would be a good choice as the moderator of Data Science SE, as I have been one of the most active members on this site since the early beta days. I am one of the top contributors in this community [#4 currently], and one of the most active members on the Meta site, helping users with their queries and suggestions about the main site. I have been the top reviewer in all the review queues after our current moderator. I have also been moderating the beta site of Devops StackExchange as their Moderator Pro-Tempore. So, I already have experience handling the diamond responsibilities as the moderator. Link to my answers for Moderator questionnaire.
