GSOC mentors that don't care about the project

I am asking on behalf of FluxBB, an open-source project I'm contributing to: We would love to offer "jobs" for this year's Google Summer of Code, but we completely lack the resources or the man-power to let somebody from our team be a mentor. So my question is: are there any mentors who would take on mentoring for other projects or are completely free of any organization behind them that wants to benefit from the program itself?
