I think the key here is understanding the missing data mechanism; or at least ruling some out. Building seperate models is akin to treating missing and non-missing groups as random samples. If missingness on X3 is related to X1 or X2 or some other unobserved variable, then your estimates will likely be biased in each model. Why not use multiple imputation on the development data set and use the combined coefficients on a multiply imputed prediction set? Average across the predictions and you should be good.
