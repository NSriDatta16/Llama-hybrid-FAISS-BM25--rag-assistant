New delegate with different signature is a new type. C# being type-safe it is not possible to do that - other than churning some code and compile on runtime which apart from memory leak is not such an elegant approach. But what you can do is it choose appropriate delegate from the list of already made Action<> or Func<> based on the type of delegate. Alternatively create a lits of your own, based on your expected types, and choose that in runtime.
