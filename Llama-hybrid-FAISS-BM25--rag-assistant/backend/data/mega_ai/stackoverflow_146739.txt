To link a new framework (In the Groups and Files pane, open the Targets disclosure triangle to display the targets associated with your project.) In the Groups and Files pane, double-click your current project target to display the Target Info panel. In the Info panel, select the General tab. The lower pane displays the currently-linked frameworks. Add a new framework by pressing the + button at the bottom left of the panel and selecting from the list presented in the sheet that appears. (Importantly, the list in the sheet shows only the frameworks relevant to the target...) (This wasn't available two years ago, but it's nevertheless worth pointing out as a significant time-saver over finding the framework in the filesystem and dragging it into the project...)
