Synchronization refers to multi-threading. A synchronized block of code can only be executed by one thread at a time. Serialization refers to converting objects to bitstreams either for storage or transmission. The act of serialization encodes the data according to specific rules. This bitstream can then be deserialized later or on a remote system that receives it. For serialization to work the class definition must match (i.e. you need to be using the same version of the class or one that is guaranteed to be compatible) and the class must implement the Serializable interface.
