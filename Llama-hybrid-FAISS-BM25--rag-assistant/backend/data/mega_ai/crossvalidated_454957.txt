Welcome to the site, @Nick, and good luck with your job application. I will wade in regarding your forth question. Whenever data are collected from scratch, which seems to be the case here, you have to understand first why the data are collected. Let's say in this case the data are collected to help the company predict which customers are likely to opt out of a service offered by the company. The why will drive how the data will be analyzed. So before you even look at any data given to you, make sure you understand the questions the company would like to answer based on these data. For example: Are men more likely than women to opt out of this service, all else being equal? Are older people more likely to opt out of this sevice than younger people, all else being equal? Are long-term customers less likely to opt out of this service than recent customers, all else being equal? With these questions clear in your mind, the first thing you will have to do is try to import the data in your statistical software of choice (e.g., R). You may discover that the data are not properly formatted for import (e.g., they are saved in a spreadsheet with text annotations made by the developer). So formatting the data for import could be your first task (e.g., remove all text annotations from the data). Creating a back up copy of the original dataset is also a good idea! Presuming the data could be imported in your statistical software of choice, the first thing you will want to do is to look at each of the variables of interest for your analysis and describe their distribution numerically and visually. For example, one of your variables could be Gender (a qualitative variable) - look to see how many people of each gender you have in your data set. Another variable could be duration of being a customer with the company (expressed in months) - a quantitative variable. So you could plot the histogram of duration, report the average duration (and a standard deviation), etc. This initial exploration of the data will enable you to determine whether the data present any issues that need addressing: Do you have all the data you need for your analyses or are data on crucial variables or cases (i.e., customers) not available yet? Are the qualitative variables (e.g., Gender) coded properly? If not, will you need to clean up those variables to make sure their categories are coded consistently? Do the quantitative variables (e.g., Duration) present non-sensical values (e.g., someone has a duration of -12 months) or values that are implausibly large or small? Do any of the needed variables include missing values and if so, what is the extent of missingnes? Do any of the needed variables need to be recoded?
