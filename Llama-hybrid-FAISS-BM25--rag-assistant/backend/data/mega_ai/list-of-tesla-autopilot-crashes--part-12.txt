e driver of the Tesla estimated they were driving at about 65 mph (105 km/h) prior to the crash. As the car entered a curve which revealed the glare of the setting sun, the Tesla kept to the same speed despite passing several other vehicles slowing down or at a standstill with hazard warning lights on as well as a pedestrian attempting to alert the driver. The car finally swerved to avoid a stopped vehicle and ran into a pedestrian, a 71-year-old woman who had just put on a safety vest and was leaving her vehicle. She was pronounced dead at the scene. While the crash report initially did not mention that the Tesla Autopilot was engaged, Tesla reported the crash to NHTSA seven months after the incident, as required whenever any advanced driver assistance systems are involved. Snohomish County, Washington, US (April 19, 2024) At approximately 3:54 p.m. on April 19, 2024, a motorcyclist was killed after a driver in a 2022 Tesla Model S crashed into the rear of the motorcycle. Both vehicles were traveling on eastbound Washington State Route 522 just west of its intersection with Fales Road, in unincorporated Snohomish County, Washington, close to Maltby. The motorcyclist had slowed down due to traffic conditions, but the Tesla driver did not. The Tesla driver reported he heard a bang as the car collided with the motorcycle and lurched forward; the motorcyclist was ejected and was pinned underneath the Tesla. A few days later, the Tesla driver was arrested for vehicular homicide due to distracted driving based on his admission that he "had the Tesla on Autopilot while looking at his phone", and was released after posting bond. The motorcyclist was wearing a GoPro, which police collected for evidence. During the investigation, the Washington State Patrol determined the Tesla was operating in FSD, based on telemetry data from the car. It is the second fatal accident involving FSD. The NHTSA is gathering information about this crash from local law enforcement. Non-fatal crashes Culver City, California, US (January 22, 2018) On January 22, 2018, a 2014 Tesla Model S crashed into a fire truck parked on the side of the I-405 freeway in Culver City, California, while traveling at a speed exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h) and the driver survived with no injuries. The driver told the Culver City Fire Department that he was using Autopilot. The fire truck and a California Highway Patrol vehicle were parked diagonally across the left emergency lane and high-occupancy vehicle lane of the southbound I-405, blocking off the scene of an earlier accident, with emergency lights flashing. According to a post-accident interview, the driver stated he was drinking coffee, eating a bagel, and maintaining contact with the steering wheel while resting his hand on his knee. During the 30-mile (48 km) trip, which lasted 66 minutes, the Autopilot system was engaged for slightly more than 29 minutes; of the 29 minutes, hands were detected on the steering wheel for only 78 seconds in total. Hands were detected applying torque to the steering wheel for only 51 seconds over the nearly 14 minutes immediately preceding the crash. The Tesla had been following a lead vehicle in the high-occupancy vehicle lane at approximately 21 mph (34 km/h); when the lead vehicle moved to the right to avoid the fire truck, approximately three or four seconds prior to impact, the Tesla's traffic-aware cruise control system began to accelerate the Tesla to its preset speed of 80 mph (130 km/h). When the impact occurred, the Tesla had accelerated to 31 mph (50 km/h). The Autopilot system issued a forward collision warning half a second before the impact, but did not engage the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system, and the driver did not manually intervene by braking or steering. Because Autopilot requires agreement between the radar and visual cameras to initiate AEB, the system was challenged due to the specific scenario (where a lead vehicle detours around a stationary object) and the
