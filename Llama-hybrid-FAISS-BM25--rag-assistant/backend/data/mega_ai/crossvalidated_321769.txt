First let me say that if I were grading your questions, I would give you an excellent grade. These are the introductory questions of the book, so you still do not have all the tools to think through the problems, but you are already showing that you know you need to take causal information into consideration to answer it. Now as to the answer, notice the question asks you whether you want to look at the aggregate data or the segregated data. It turns out in both cases you want to look at the segregated data. In question A, the size of the stone affects both the choice of the treatment and the health status. Hence, you need the segregated data to eliminate this bias and determine which treatment is more effective, either conditionally or unconditionally. To know which treatment is unconditionally better, you need the segregated data to obtain the average causal effect weighted by the probability of stone size $P(Y = 1|do(T)) = \sum_{S}P(Y = 1|T, S)P(S) \neq P(Y =1 |T)$, where $Y$ is health status, $T$ treatment choice and $S$ stone size. If you want to know which treatment is conditionally better, then it's clear you also need the segregated table. If it's strange to think of picking a treatment for yourself without knowing the stone size, maybe it will be easier to understand the analogous question of having to pick only one treatment to a whole population (say for technical/budget reasons you can't pick both). In this case you want to know which one has the largest average treatment effect on the population as a whole. Question B is a similar problem, difficulty is a confounder so you need the segregated table to know which doctor is better, both conditionally and unconditionally. Your point about sample size is completely valid, in real life you should always consider sample uncertainty --- but notice it doesn't change the fact that you would still need the information of the segregated data. Regarding your last comment, if the 2 failures occurred early in his career (while he was still learning) or more recently (after he started drinking heavily). It actually touches a deep problem in causal inference, which is the assumption of invariance . Take the case where the doctor started drinking heavily just now. In this case the data before and after that event do not come from the same causal model --- so you would actually need more information and more causal assumptions to make inference in this case.
