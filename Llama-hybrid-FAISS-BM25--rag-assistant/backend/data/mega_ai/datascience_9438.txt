I recommend starting from Coursera specializations in data science. The data science specialization by Johns Hopkins is the oldest running specialization. I do not recommend books and kaggle. They only confuse you in the beginning. Keep in mind that coding is the easiest part of data science and you have to learn a lot. For getting an idea about the field, this Venn Diagram is a good start.
