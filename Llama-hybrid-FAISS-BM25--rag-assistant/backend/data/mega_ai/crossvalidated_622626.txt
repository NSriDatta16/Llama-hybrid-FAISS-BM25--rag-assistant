Generate a Synthetic Bivariate Data for Testing Simple Linear Regression Using Excel

I come up with a solution as below. What do you think? Do you have any other way? Linear regression modeled as; y(i) = a + b*x(i) + e(i) a and b is constant, thus for all value of i ; a = RAND()*(U_a - L_a) + L_a b = RAND()*(U_b - L_b) + L_b U_a and L_a is upper and lower bound for a U_b and L_b is upper and lower bound for b . x(i) is a variable, thus for all value of i ; x(1) = RAND()*(U_x - L_x) + L_x x(2) = RAND()*(U_x - L_x) + L_x ... x(n-1) = RAND()*(U_x - L_x) + L_x x(n) = RAND()*(U_x - L_x) + L_x U_x and L_x is upper and lower bound for x . e(i) is a variable, normally distributed with mean 0 , thus for all value of i ; e(1) = NORM.INV(RAND(),m,s) e(2) = NORM.INV(RAND(),m,s) ... e(n-1) = NORM.INV(RAND(),m,s) e(n) = NORM.INV(RAND(),m,s) m is mean which is equal to 0 and s is standard deviation. therefore, variable y(i) for all value of i ; y(1) = a + b*x(1) + e(1) y(2) = a + b*x(2) + e(2) ... y(n-1) = a + b*x(n-1) + e(n-1) y(n) = a + b*x(n) + e(n) please note that, a and b is constant. Therefore, they only have single random value each. So, when dragging, use cell reference and anchor to avoid generating multiple a and b . Scatter plot variable y(i) versus x(i) The result seems OK each time I press F9. But, I am not sure if this is the right way to do and I am intrigued if there is other better way.
