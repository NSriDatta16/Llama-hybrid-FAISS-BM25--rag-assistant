JPA/EclipseLink - Retrieve Columns Names

I'm trying to update my knowledge in Java, since I last used in when it was in 1.4.X version... I'm trying to use 1.6.0, in particular the Java Persistence API (2.0). I managed to create an entity class. It's working, since I'm able to store and retrieve data. But I was fooling around and when I decided to fill a JList with the column names of a table and didn't got success... It's a simple class and looks like: @Entity @Table(name = "T_CURRENCY", schema = "APP") public class Currency implements Serializable { @Transient private PropertyChangeSupport changeSupport = new PropertyChangeSupport(this); private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) @Column(name = "ID") private Short id; @Basic(optional = false) @Column(name = "NAME") private String name; ... } Is there a way to retrieve the columns names? I found this post . Seems to be a valid solution, but I thought that it might have something more easier/elegant? I don't know why, but I was expecting an already done method... TIA, Bob
