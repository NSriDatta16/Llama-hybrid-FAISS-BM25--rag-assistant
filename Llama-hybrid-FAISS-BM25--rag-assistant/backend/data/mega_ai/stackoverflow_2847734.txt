Is "auto int i" valid C++11?

In answering this question the question arose as to whether the traditional C meaning of the keyword auto (automatic, rather than static or extern storage) is still valid in C++11 now that it means type deduction. I remember that the old meaning of auto should remain where relevant but others disagreed. auto char c = 42; // either compilation error or c = '*' Looking at compilers I see the current division. Old meaning of auto is no longer allowed VS10 g++ Old meaning of auto is used where relevant Comeau Do you know which is the correct behaviour?
