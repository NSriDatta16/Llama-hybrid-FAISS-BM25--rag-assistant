My opinion - comments in source code is evil. Code should be self documented. Developers usually forget about reading and updating them. As sad Martin Fowler: "if you need comment for lines block - just make new function" (this not quote - this phrase as I remember it). It will be better to keep separated documentation for utility modules, basic principles of your project, organization of libraries, some algorithms and design ideas. Almost forget: I was used code comments once. It was MFC/COM - project and I leave links from MSDN howto articles near non-trivial solutions/workarounds. 100 lines of source code - should be understandable if not - it should be separated or reorganized on few functions - which will be more understandable. Is there a tool to generate a skeleton for comments on the Unix platform for C++? Vim have plugins for inserting doxygen comments template, if you really need this.
