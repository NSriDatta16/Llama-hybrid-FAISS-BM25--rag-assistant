One possible problem might be that Precision and Recall are very different. In general, F1 is only useful if Precision and Recall are similar. If they are very unbalanced, it will screw up your F1 score. So early stopping might be better based on Precision or Recall. Attention: Keras loves normalization of the data. But if you have a lot of outliers in your dataset, you squeeze them into the normalization where they will dominate.
