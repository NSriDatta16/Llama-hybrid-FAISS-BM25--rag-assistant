Android and data storage space?

Im wondering how much data storage is available for my application in android? I need to cache lots of files, and i was thinking to store it inside the sharedpreferences, this way it gets deleted if the application is uninstalled. Afterall its just alot of cache files. I guess i could also use the SDCard, but than i dont have any controll of what the user does outside the application... So, how many MB can my application steel from SharedPreferences when storing files ?
