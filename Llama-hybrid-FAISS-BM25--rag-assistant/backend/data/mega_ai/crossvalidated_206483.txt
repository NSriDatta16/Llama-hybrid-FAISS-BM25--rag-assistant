Too many bagging estimators?

I am bagging 20 SVMs using the full training set. I have found the best SVM params using grid search. The validation performance is quite good, but performance on the training set is disappointing. Can too many bagging estimators lead to over-fitting? What is a good heuristic for the number of estimators to use?
