should distribution of predicted probability correspond to training data?

Say I have classification problem with imbalance training label: 1: 1000 0: 100000 When I train a classifier, like Logistic Regression or Random Forest or XGBoost, it can output predicted probability. Will the mean of all predicted probability be close to mean of training label, which is 0.01 in this case? It seems to me MLE will give such kind of estimation.
