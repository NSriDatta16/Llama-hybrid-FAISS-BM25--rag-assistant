Catalog entries: Updated html files or on-the-fly from database?

I've got a database site that will serve approximately 1,200 primary entries at launch, with the prospect of adding ~100 new entries per year. Each entry would be composed of ~20 basic values from the database, as well as a calculated average rating, and a variable amount of user comments. The rating and comments output would have to be generated upon page request, but the rest of the data would be static unless an error correction had been made by an admin. Considering bandwith, database load, and download times - would it be better to just generate the entire page on the fly with a few queries after a GET or would it be better to have html files and append the ratings & comments then write a refresher script that would update all the html records when run? In my mind the pros & cons are: On-the-fly + saves hosting space by building pages only when needed - leaves nothing for a search engine to find? - slightly slower due to extra queries HTML & appends + search engine friendly + slightly faster due to less queries - uses disk space - slightly more complex code requirements Neutral = templating would be the same either way Thoughts?
