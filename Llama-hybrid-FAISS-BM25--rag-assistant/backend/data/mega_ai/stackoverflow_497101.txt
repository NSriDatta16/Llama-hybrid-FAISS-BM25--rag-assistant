Class Library of Constants--Best Practice?

I was using .Net Reflector on an Internal App to try and understand what the previous Dev was doing and also to learn. I have never had actual instruction on how to develop Apps so I take from where I can (Hooray Stack Overflow). That being said I found something that has me confused. A class Library called WinConstant containing the below code. Here are my actual question: What possible use could this be? What value is there in storing a bunch of constant's in a class library? Is this considered a "Best Practice"? Thoughts and guidance appreciated! Public Class clsConstant Public Const cAccess As String = "Access" Public Const cAddress As String = "Address" Public Const cCancel As String = "Cancel" Public Const cCity As String = "City" Public Const cClear As String = "Clear" Public Const cClickOnMessage As String = "Click on any row in top pane to see the detail fields in the bottom pane."
