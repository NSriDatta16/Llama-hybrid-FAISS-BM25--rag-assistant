Considering that SMTP doesn't have a notion of "accounts," just senders and recipients, your question doesn't make a lot of sense. If the receiving server decides that you machine is generating spam, then it will probably blacklist your IP, not any "account" used to run the mail program (although it could decide to blacklist the sender address). The easiest way to prevent this, of course, is to prevent your mail server from accepting outgoing mail that would be considered spam. There are lots of techniques to do this, such as Bayesian spam filters on the content, or keeping track of the usage patterns of a particular sender. But it's your responsibility; if you "whitelist" yourself with an organization and then behave in an inappropriate way, you'll end up blacklisted. And before you start, you should at least get an overview of how SMTP works (and then move on to the actual RFCs).
