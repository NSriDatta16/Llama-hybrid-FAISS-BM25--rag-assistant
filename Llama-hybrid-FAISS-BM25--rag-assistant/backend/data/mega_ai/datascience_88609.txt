Can we use prior information to improve the results of a neural network? If so, how do we incorporate it into the learning process?

Let $f_\alpha(x)$ be the function $$ f_\alpha(x) = x^2 + \alpha\sin(x), $$ on the interval $[-5,5]$ . Suppose $\alpha = 2$ , and our goal is to learn the function $f_2(x)$ using some form of neural network. $f_2$ looks like this: We are given a set of noisy measurements of $f_2$ from which we would like to learn $f_2$ . Specifically, we are given a set of random samples $\{y_i,x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with $$ y_i = f_2(x_i) + N(0,\sigma), $$ where $N(0,\sigma)$ is normally distributed noise with standard deviation $\sigma$ : Now we can use the samples $\{y_i,x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to estimate the unknown function $f_2$ . However, before doing that, note that the general behavior of $f_2$ is captured well by the function $f_0(x) = x^2$ : Now suppose that instead of just being given the set of noisy samples $\{y_i,x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of $f_2$ we are given both the noisy samples and the function $f_0$ which we are told is a decent approximation of $f_2$ . In other words, we have some prior knowledge on what the function $f_2$ generally looks like. Can we somehow incorporate this prior knowledge of $f_2$ into our neural network learning process so that we can get a better estimate of $f_2$ than estimating it based on just the noisy samples on their own? If so, what are our options for incorporating this knowledge into a neural network? Does the type of neural network (CNN, RNN, etc...) affect the way we incorporate the prior information? P.S. I am coming from statistics/mathematics and while I understand the general principles of neural networks I have only just started using them. P.P.S. Here is the Matlab code for the images rng(123); N = 100; x = linspace(-5,5,N); alpha = 2; sigma = 4; f_0 = x.^2; f_alpha = x.^2 + alpha*sin(5*x); f_sigma = f_alpha + sigma*randn(N,1).'; figure hold on, grid on plot(x,f_0,'k--') plot(x,f_alpha,'b') plot(x,f_sigma,'r.')
