To answer your question, you can still use a repeated measures ANOVA when you have missing data, but you're likely to run into problems that might encourage you to take another approach. In general, the design doesn't handle these situations well. While data from each subject is not required, cases with missing data are dropped from the analysis which can lead to biases (e.g. sampling bias) in the results.
