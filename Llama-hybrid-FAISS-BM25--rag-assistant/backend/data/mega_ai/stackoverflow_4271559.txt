magento indexControllor.php url rewriting not working properly

Hi i build a indexcontrollor in module brand like this class Blank_Brand_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action { public function indexAction() { echo 'Foo Index Action'; $this->addaction(); } public function addAction() { echo 'Foo add Action'; $this->deleteAction(); } } When I put in the address: http://www.myshop.com/index.php/brand/ , it echos Foo Index Action With this URL, though, it does nothing: http://www.myshop.com/index.php/brand/add What could be the problem here causing this? This could save a lot of problems for me which I have with URL rewriting in Magento!
