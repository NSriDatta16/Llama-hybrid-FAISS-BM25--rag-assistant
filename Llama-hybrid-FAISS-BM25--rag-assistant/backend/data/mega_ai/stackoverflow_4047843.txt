asp:Textbox within asp:table

I am trying to pass a SqlParameter to a SqlDataSource . The SqlDataSource has a condition ...Where A.PERS_LNAME = @PERS_LNAME Now coming to configuring SqlDataSource , I click on 'Configure Data Source' and reach till the 'Define Parameters' step. I selected 'Parameter Source' = Control, but I don't see the 's ID's at all! Only the GridView 's id is shown in the dropdown. In short, I don't see the 's id at all This is how my is defined. Lastname: Firstname: Additional Info: The following two scenarios work, but the third one doesn't work. Please note that the difference between 2 & 3 is that I have introduced an extra column with a LastName LastName Can you help me where I am going wrong? Or is such embedding of asp controls not permitted?
