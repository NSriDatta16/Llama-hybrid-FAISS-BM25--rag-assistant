How to insert new row in Ultragrid

it is very difficult to find any answer on Ultragrid .. I have a small issue and could not solve it. how to insert new row when click on add button...if any previous row is there has to clea out and add only 1 new row.. how to delete row on click of delete button (i tried using deleteselectrow..but need to select row first..what if only 1 row is present then need to directly delete present row) I am using VB6 with MS Access as backend database. The recordset is bounded to database through√Ø Infragistics ultragrid. (Set ultraGrid.DataSource = rs) I have 3 columns in Infragistics ultragrid & 3 Textboxes on form. Now, when I move through the records in ultraGrid the exact data in the cells should appear in the related textboxes. in msflex i think we do with Text1.Text = MSHFlexGrid1.TextMatrix(MSHFlexGrid1.Row,1) How to get this job done in ultragrid?
