In general, if your problem can be expressed as a Markov Decision Process , you can apply reinforcement learning to it. This means the following flowchart should be a good visual representation, where an agent takes an action $A_t$ in some state $S_t$ and the environment responds with a reward $R_{t+1}$ and a new state $S_{t+1}$ . I am definitely not saying that every problem that can be expressed as an MDP should be solved with reinforcement learning. If for example, you were trying to optimize some known convex function, you could frame it as an RL problem. But why would you when there are already incredibly efficient solvers of these problems already? RL is often turned to for its generality. I would usually try RL only if there weren't an easier way.
