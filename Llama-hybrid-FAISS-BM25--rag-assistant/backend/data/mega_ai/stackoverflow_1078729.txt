How to calculate the height of a MultiCell/writeHTMLCell in TCPDF?

I try to create a PDF with multiple pages and need to calculate the height of each individual element (MultiCell) in advance to prepare for a page break. According to the documentation there are a couple of functions out there like GetCharWidth/GetStringWidth to support me in doing it on my own, but besides a potential performance lost I probably will not do it the right anyway. Suggestions to achieve my goal in a more elegant way? Reference: TCPDF
