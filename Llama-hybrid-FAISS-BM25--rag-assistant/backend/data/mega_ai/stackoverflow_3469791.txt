Magento search result to my way

i've been triyng to change the default result page of magento, i want the products grouped by categories, it don't include the subcategories but the products, the search criteria is the product name, so, i was triyng to use the defalt simple search of magento, untill now no result, maybe i have to override the search and make a new one, i know that with this i can get all the categories and its product collection, $categories = Mage::getModel('catalog/category') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect('*'); foreach($categories as $category) { $array = $category->getParentIds(); $children = explode(',',$category->getChildren()); $products = $category->getProductCollection(); } but i need to filter by the produc name, the result i'm secting to show is like this Category I - Product I - Product II Category II - Product III - Product IV
