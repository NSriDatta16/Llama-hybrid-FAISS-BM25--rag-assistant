MCMC: why params that are directly sampled from posterior converge slower than that sampled from Metropolis steps

I am fitting a Bayesian model (the core is a linear state space model) using MCMC. Most of the parameters are sampled directly from their analytic posteriors whereas the left are sampled from Metropolis steps. In many situations I am surprised that the some of the former parameters converge slower than the later. May I ask is it normal? What is possible reason of this?
