Most likely your server doesn't have an MTA (mail transfer agent) installed. PHP's mail() function doesn't send the email itself, it passes the result to the system's default MTA. Quick question - are you using a Windows-based server? Unix/Linux servers almost always have an MTA in their default setup (usually sendmail or exim or some such), but Windows servers generally don't; you have to install one yourself.
