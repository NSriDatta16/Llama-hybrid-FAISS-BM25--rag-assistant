Of all of the answers given above, only djenson47's answers retain separation of presentation and content . The drawback of the collapsed border model method is that you can no longer use the table's border or cellspacing attributes to separate the individual cells. You could argue that this is a good thing, and there are some workarounds, but it can be a pain. So I think the first-child method is the most elegant. Alternatively, you could also set your TBODY class' overflow property to anything other than "visible." This method allows you to retain a separated borders model as well: tbody { overflow: auto; border-top: 1px solid transparent; } footer Body 1 Body 1 Body 1 Body 2 Body 2 Body 2 Body 3 Body 3 Body 3
