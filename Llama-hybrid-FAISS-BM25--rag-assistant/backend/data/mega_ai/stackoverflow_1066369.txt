In response to Emily 's answer. No. With the img inside the p, you can float the image right but the text will not stay in a column. It will wrap underneath the image. Any right margin or padding you apply to the p will also apply to the img. While she's right, as far she goes, there is a workaround. Though it's not ideal: p {position: relative; padding-right: 950px; /* width of the image + 50px margin */ } img {position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; } This should put the image in the top-right corner of the p , while forcing the text into a column between the left boundary of the p element and the 950px right-padding. Not ideal, and a little messy, but it allows for the columnar effect without adding extra tags. ... unless you want to add a clearfix br ( br.clearfix: display: block; clear: both ) at the end of the paragraph (to force the p tag to extend past the image for short paragraphs).
