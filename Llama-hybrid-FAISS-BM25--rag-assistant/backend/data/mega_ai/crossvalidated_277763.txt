Is the frequentist framework more appropriate than the Bayesian one, according to Popper's theory?

According to Karl Popper, only falsifiable hypotheses are truly scientific (quoting Wikipedia ): no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. In keeping with these theoretical premises, which statistical framework is more appropriate, the frequentist or the Bayesian?
