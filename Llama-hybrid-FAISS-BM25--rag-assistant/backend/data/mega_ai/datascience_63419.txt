Since the recording of data is same at regular time intervals for every patient, you are getting a good daily time series data. And given your question which says you are recording a single measurement daily that means you have a univariate time series analysis problem, as the forecasting is based on just the past values of series data not any other variables. Hence the data is definitely helpful. Just keep in mind to not forecast for longer intervals, since the cycle of data is daily, you can forecast may be upto next three days (may be try to start with just one day. You can try ARIMA for this.
