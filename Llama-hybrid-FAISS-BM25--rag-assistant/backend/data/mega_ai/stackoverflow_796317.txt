Since you tagged this Win32 I'm assuming you're working on a 32 bit machine, in which case you simply don't have enough address space to memory map all of your data set. This means you will have to create and destroy mappings into the file as you "jump around", which is going to make this less efficient than you might expect. In practice, you typically have a bit more than 1 GB of contiguous address space to memory map the file into on a 32 bit windows box, and you can end up with less if you fragment your address space. That being said, doing this with memory maps does have a benefit if you are memory (not address space) constrained, since when you memory map a file as read only (as opposed to explicitly reading it into memory) the OS will not have a second copy in the file system cache.
