CNN Style 'Alert' in Drupal?

I'm sure most of you have seen the CNN type alerts, the ones that flash at the top of the screen when the administrators want to. Is this already done in Drupal? I am thinking you would need some kind of jQuery for the animation, simple enough, but what mechanism would you need to allow the user to X the alert away, and not show it again?
