This paper follows an approach very similar to the one you suggest, but they stratify the samples. In their case, each model sees a particular part of the geographic space, which lets the different submodels specialize. Figures 6 and 8 show that this partitioning can lead to better results than trying to fit the whole country with a single model. I haven't read the paper in detail yet, but when I spoke with the first author about it last week, he seemed to indicate that no fancy procedure was needed to combine the results--he just took the average prediction from all the relevant models.
