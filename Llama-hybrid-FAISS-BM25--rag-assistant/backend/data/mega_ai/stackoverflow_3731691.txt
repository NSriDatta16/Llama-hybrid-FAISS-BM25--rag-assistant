Move them to an initializer and add the file to .gitignore EDIT: There is a directory in config called initializers. This is where you place code that is supposed to run once when your application starts. In the past, environment.rb was used for these settings, but initializers keep things better organized. I would create a file in the initializers directory called "load_keys.rb" or something like that. In this file, you would put the exact code that was in your environment.rb file that you don't want in github.
