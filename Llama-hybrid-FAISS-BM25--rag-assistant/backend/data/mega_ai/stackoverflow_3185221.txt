Running a Quartz job with Java class name stored in database

I have a two jobs in Quartz which will run perfetly well but I find I have to use code like: jd = new JobDetail(sj.getJobName(), scheduler.DEFAULT_GROUP, PollJob.class); ct = new CronTrigger(sj.getJobTrigger(), scheduler.DEFAULT_GROUP, "0 20 * * * ?"); scheduler.scheduleJob(jd, ct); I have to hardcode PollJob.class to run the job and sj is an object read from the database containing PollJob's details. But I would like to set PollJob.class from the database as well. I've tried casting to a class by: Class cls = Class.forName(sj.getJobJavaClassFile()); jd = new JobDetail(sj.getJobName(), scheduler.DEFAULT_GROUP, cls)); And using a class reference directly as: jd = new JobDetail(sj.getJobName(), scheduler.DEFAULT_GROUP, Class.forName sj.getJobJavaClassFile())); But the job simply doesn't execute. There are no exceptions generated that I can see and no stack trace? I'm running a JVM on Windows 7. Any ideas? Mr Morgan.
