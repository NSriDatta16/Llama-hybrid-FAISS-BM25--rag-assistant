Just to let you know, Firefox and Chrome consider all Ajax request as non-cachable. IE (all versions) treat Ajax call just as other web request. That's why you see this behavior. How to force IE to download data at each request: As you said, use 'cache' or 'nocache' option in JQuery Add a random parameter to the request (ugly, but works :)) On server side, set cachability (for example using an attribute, see below) Code: public class NoCacheAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute { public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context) { context.HttpContext.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); } }
