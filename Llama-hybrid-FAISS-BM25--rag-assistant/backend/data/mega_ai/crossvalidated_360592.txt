Agreed with others who said data should be "Normally" distributed. Any distribution will overlap with a normal distribution if you transform it. If your distribution is not normal, the results you will get will be inferior compared to the case when it is normal, as stated by some here... You can transform your distribution if you need. You can opt the PCA and use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) instead. If you read the reference in the first answer, in the Appendix section it states that the assumption is a Normal distribution.
