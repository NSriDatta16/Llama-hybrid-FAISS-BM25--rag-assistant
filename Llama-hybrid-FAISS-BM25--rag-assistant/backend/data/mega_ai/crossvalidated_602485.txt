Did my university class choose wrong $H_0$

This has been bugging me for a while, and I'm not getting an answer where I study, so maybe someone here can help me out. (Don't worry, this isn't homework) Consider this question: Assume that you, Bob and Nate have a height of 172, 174 and 169 cm. Also assume the heights to be independently normally distributed with a known variance of 50. We have a hypothesis that the average height of the people in this course is 188 cm. Test this hypothesis with a 5% significance. When we did this in class, the teacher chose hypotheses as such: $H_0 : \mu = 188$ $H_1: \mu \neq 188$ $T = \sqrt{3}\frac{\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=1}^3\, X_i - 188}{\sqrt{50}} \approx -4$ Now using $R=(-\infty,z_{0.025}) \cup (z_{0.975, \infty})=(-\infty,-1.96) \cup (1.96,\infty)$ $T \in R \rightarrow$ we reject $H_0$ My question is , didn't they make a mistake and flip the hypotheses around? imagine if we failed to reject $H_0$ , wouldn't this mean that we would "probably erroneously" have to assume $\mu = 188$ for eternity, until shown otherwise? My follow up question is , is it possible to perform a hypothesis test with no prior knowledge? How would one test for: $H_0 : \mu \neq 188$ $H_1: \mu = 188$ This is my first post here in stats, so I hope it doesn't break any rules. Many thanks for your help.
