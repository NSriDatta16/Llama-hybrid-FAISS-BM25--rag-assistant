Error When Trying to Open a URL in Ruby on Rails

Environment: Ruby 1.9.2, Rails 3.0.3, Ubuntu When I try to open a URL using: open("http://www.cnn.com") I get the following error: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - http://www.cnn.com from (irb):9:in `initialize' from (irb):9:in `open' from (irb):9 (It's a difficult topic to search). This is happening in both irb and in my app. It used to work under Ruby 1.8.7 and Rails 2.3.4 but it appears that something has changed.
