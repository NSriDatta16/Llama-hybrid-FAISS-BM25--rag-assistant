Controlling eGit's treatment of symbolic links

I am setting up a project that will be shared among several programmers at my organization. We are using git--to which I am a newcomer. The project directory includes symbolic links to documentation directories that should not be under version control. I want to maintain the symlinks under version control as symlinks, rather than having them dereferenced and all of the content of the symlinked directory placed under version control. I find that the git command line tool behave the way I want: git add -A . However if I try to use the Eclipse version of git, eGit, to add all the currently unversioned files, using Team->Track on the project context menu, eGit wants to add every file in the symlinked directories. Is there a way to tell eGit that, no, these are really symlinks, and should not be dereferenced?
