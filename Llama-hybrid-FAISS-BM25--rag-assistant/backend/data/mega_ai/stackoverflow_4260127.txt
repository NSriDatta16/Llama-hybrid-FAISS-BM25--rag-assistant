Something confusing about digital certificates

A digital certificate is a digital document that certifies that a certain public key is owned by a particular user. Thus if you trust the CA that signed the certificate C , then you can trust that specific public/private key pair is owned by the owner of certificate C . a) Assume client A wants to establish a connection with server B located at url www.some_domain.com. When establishing a connection with B , A may receive from the other end a X.509 certificate C and a public key, belonging to the owner of certificate C . But how can client know that owner of C is really a server B and not some other entity that hijacked ( if that is the correct term ) the connection and sent its own certificate and public key to A ? Only way I can think of for client to know whether owner of C is really B , is if C's Subject field also specifies the domain for which this certificate is valid or if it specifies the organization to which this certificate belongs ( but that only helps if client knows to which organization www.some_domain.com belongs )?! thank you
