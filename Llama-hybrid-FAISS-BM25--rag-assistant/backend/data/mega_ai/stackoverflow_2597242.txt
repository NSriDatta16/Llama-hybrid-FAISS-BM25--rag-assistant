If you're looking for technical reasons, I don't think there's anything to justify the cost of a large code move. As far as I'm aware, namespaces don't confer any kind of technical advantage or performance benefit. It's easier to write decent autoloading functions for a well-structured set of namespaced PHP code, but other than that, I can't think of anything that would be a ground-shaking definitive reason to start converting. If anything, there's probably a tiny bit of overhead for namespace resolution (benchmarks would be neat to see, but I'm sure it's a negligible difference). That being said, I've recently started updating an old set of code to use namespaces, and I'm enjoying the organizational capability that it provides. The code has a tendency to be a bit more verbose, but I switched IDEs to Netbeans 6.8 at the start of the upgrade, and the autocomplete takes care of a lot of the tediousness of importing and references namespaces. The namespace support impressed me, actually. It's made the whole project quite easy, and actually, dare I say it, fun.
