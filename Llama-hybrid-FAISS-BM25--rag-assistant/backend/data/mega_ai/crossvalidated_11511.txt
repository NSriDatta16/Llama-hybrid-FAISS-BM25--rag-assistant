You have time series data and one develops an equation for intra-day usage which may use either an auto-projective ARIMA model or a set of fixed dummies (23 in number) to predict hourly expectations. One has to be concerned with detecting "unusual data" so that your model/parameters reflect the main body of data and not being impacted by the exceptions. You might also be concerned with inter-day activity as different days of the week may have different effects. I have found that there are also interaction effects where the hourly distribution depends on the day-of-the-week. Additionally there may be known events/holidays that need to be accounted for. Upon building a suitable model , the residuals provide an estimate as to the expected variability yielding a "safety stock" which can be useful in guidance. The suggested statistical model for this is called a Transfer Function which is a hybrid between regression and ARIMA modelling.
