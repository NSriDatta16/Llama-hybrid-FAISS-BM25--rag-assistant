I like Fluent NHibernate and I think it's mature enough if you are going to start a new project. Using it on a new project should allow the Fluent NHibernate project to continue to mature as yours progresses. There is a possibility for breaking changes (as happened recently with the convention mappings) but you should be able to deal with those. I've had a few issues with the mappings but the project is pretty responsive to bug reports and has mostly worked as expected. The mapping options are: Xml mappings - Standard of NHibernate. The maintenance headaches are well known but the advantage is that you have access to all of the configuration options provided by NHibernate. There are a few less-used configuration options are still being added to Fluent (at least last time I paid attention). So, if you are anticipating some crazy mappings, you may want to consider this option. Standard Mapping - Provided by Fluent. You can create the mappings through code and is much better for refactoring and authoring. Not much to say about it, in my experience, other then that it works well and is a big improvement on the xml option. Auto Mapping - Provided by Fluent. Allows you to map object properties by convention and it attempts to create the mappings automatically. It's a good idea but I think it still has some maturing to do. I'm currently using this mapping method and it works fine but I have ended up writing a large number of conventions and specifying the object relationships that it doesn't feel like it's saved much effort from the standard mappings. Fluent NHibernate also provides nice test helpers for testing your mappings and some configuration APIs that can make it easier to configure NHibernate. Overall, it's a good project and it provides some nice additional functionality to NHibernate. edit: One additional thing to note: If you start off with Fluent NHibernate and decide it isn't going to work for your scenario, you can easily migrate back to the xml mappings. Fluent NHibernate allows you to export the mappings it creates and you can use those exports to not lose whatever mapping work you've already done.
