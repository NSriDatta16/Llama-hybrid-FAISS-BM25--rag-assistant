Howto truncate text in a div

I want to truncate the text of my post. I used some jquery plugins to accomplish that but the problem is that first the whole text loads on the client and then the javascript executes the code to truncate the text and in result there is an ugly effect where you can see the whole text for millisecons depending on your connection before it get's truncated. Should i truncate also in the server? I'm using codeigniter with wordpress and i thought of using the_excerpt or something but it is not elegant. Any ideas?
