Working with a Java library from .NET

I need to work with a third-party Java library from .NET. Can anyone recommend a more elegant way to do this short of using a local socket connection to a Java wrapper. The information I've come across so far seems a little out-dated, and suggests things like using COM. The library is used to connect to a server. I think some RMI stuff is happening internally. Does that rule out using IKVM? (My very brief tests with ikvmc resulted in lots of warnings, but I haven't looked into these yet.) Thanks.
