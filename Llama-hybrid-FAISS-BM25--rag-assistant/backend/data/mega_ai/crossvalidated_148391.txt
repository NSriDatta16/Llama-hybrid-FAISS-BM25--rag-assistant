Goodness of regression model

What are the main indicators of goodness of a regression model? Are they MSE (mean squared error) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error , R-squared and adjusted R-squared only? Can mean of absolute residual values as a fraction (or percent) of mean of dependent variable values also be a good indicator? By goodness I mean to accurately and clearly (in understandable terms) show how well the model is predicting the dependent variable. mean(abs(residual_values)) / mean(dependent_variable_values) Absolute may need to be taken since if large deviation occurs on both sides, the mean may still be small. This value may be more understandable than mean squared error. Edit: I am asking in context of neural network being used to predict a numeric outcome variable after being fed a number of predictor variables. So I am more interested in knowing how accurately the network predicts the outcome variable. By 'clear' I mean that non-statisticians should also understand how well the network is predicting the outcome. In that respect the formula given above show the fractional or percent error being made by the network. Is this formula less accurate than more established measures such as R_squared or MSE?
