The specific scenario you outline (13:00-14:00 every Monday) cannot be properly served by normal indexes against datetime data. It would require a lot of dissecting of the datetime data into the day of week + the time portion to get at that info. For this scenario, breaking it into a column for day of week and another for time of day (hour) will work a lot better and can be indexed separately or as a composite (across both). Performance is very different - instead of looking at 1/168th of the data (theoretical average) or more realistically about 1/50th of the data (working hours) using indexes on day-of-week + time-of-day, the query would otherwise have to run 2 transformations (to get day-of-week + time-of-day components) then run that through a filter.
