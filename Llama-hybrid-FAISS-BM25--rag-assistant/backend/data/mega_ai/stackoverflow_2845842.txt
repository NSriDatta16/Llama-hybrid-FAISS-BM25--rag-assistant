WPF data grid for financial style reporting?

I'm looking for a decent WPF data grid or solution involving one to represent financial data. I've looked at many - the WPF one, XCeed, Ingragistics, DevExpress, etc.... but none of them seem to offer the simple requirement I have: I want to be able to display group subtotals in their columns in the group row, e.g. GROUP 1 xxxx.xx GROUP 2 xxxx.xx ROW 1 xx.xx ROW 2 xx.xx Does anyone know of a grid that does this, or a nice supporting collection that implements aggregate functions (group totals would need to be used in individual line items) so that existing grids with a bit of XAML styling would work? Thanks in advance, Stephen
