I've found Gantt charts to be useful for planning a project's time line and allowing for X days of vacation, slippage, etc. They're also great for making sure all resources are 100% allocated throughout the entire project. When actually working on the project, as both a developer and team leader, I've found it best to work in short iterations with clear tasks defined for the whole team. As things slip, change, or people are added/removed from the project it's nice to be able to adjust the Gantt chart and see the outcome of the changes on the project.
