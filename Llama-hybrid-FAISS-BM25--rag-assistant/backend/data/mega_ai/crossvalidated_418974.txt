A geometric distribution may be better suited to the problem you describe. A poisson distribution is basically a binomial distribution in the limit, and is a good approximation when the number of trials $n$ is large and the probability $p$ of the Bernoulli process is small. Thus $\lambda \approx np$ , where $\lambda$ is the mean expected value. And, if you want the average value to be 15, you should use the distribution $Poi(\lambda = 15)$ . To calculate the probability k events, use the following formula: $$P(K = k) = \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda}$$
