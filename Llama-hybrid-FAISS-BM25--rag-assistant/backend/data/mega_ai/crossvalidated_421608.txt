you have 272 values that are not taken at fixed time intervals THUS you data set is not a classic time series data set. I took your 272 values and plotted them ( as you did ) and obtained . If you segment your data based upon time between (x) .. set 1 where X 64 there is no relationship. Globally there is a relationship but this is a classic case of a spurious relationship due to a concommitant effect and realized by pooling all the data. I don't think , I was much of help other than identifying a few spurious data points i.e. outliers.
