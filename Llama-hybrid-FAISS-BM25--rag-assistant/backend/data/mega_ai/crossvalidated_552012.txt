Predicting failures of a part using historical failure data

Suppose I want to forecast the number of failures of part $A$ operating in my system. In my repertoire, I have historical failure numbers for part $A$ as well as the number of units of part $A$ that were operating in the system when the part failed. The objective is to forecast failures from this historical data and determine what year inventory for part $A$ will be fully depleted. We assume that one failure depletes one unit of inventory. Data example: Years Failures In Service 2017 100 2000 2018 200 3000 2019 150 2500 2020 250 3300 One challenge of the data is that the in service number changes over time. For some years, fewer parts may be operating in the system than other years. Furthermore, failures for part $A$ are not necessarily linear. Current analysis simply takes an average of the last three years, e.g. $(200 + 150 + 250)/3 = 200$ , and repeats this number in future forecasts (e.g. for 2021 we assume $200$ failures, in 2022 we assume $200$ failures, etc..) for parts that do not behavior linearly and fitting a simple linear regression line on parts where the failure history does behave linearly to estimate a "failure growth rate", which corresponds to the slope of this line. I wish to enhance this analysis by incorporating the changing in service numbers and providing actual robust models for nonlinear historical failure data. The straightforward method seems to be to weigh the yearly historical failure numbers by the number of units in service that year, and then running a prediction model on this data (using all the tools in a data scientist's toolkit). However, I am concerned with what happens to the in service number once part failures are replaced by newer parts. If failed parts are being replaced by newer parts, then does this not completely invalidate the trained prediction model since the newer parts won't necessarily follow the same distribution of the older parts with historical data? If this is the case, then is it even useful to use historical data of failures over theoretical approaches for forecasting future failures?
