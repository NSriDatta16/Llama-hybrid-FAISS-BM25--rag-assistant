Well you can just put it at 255 if you want. varchars is a Variable length storage type. This means theres 1 byte which stores the actual length of the string, varchars dont use up more bites then needed so storage wise it really does not matter. This is described on the mysql page Description can be found here http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html It is illustrated halfway the page check the table. VARCHAR values are not padded when they are stored. Handling of trailing spaces is version-dependent. As of MySQL 5.0.3, trailing spaces are retained when values are stored and retrieved, in conformance with standard SQL. Before MySQL 5.0.3, trailing spaces are removed from values when they are stored into a VARCHAR column; this means that the spaces also are absent from retrieved values. Conclusion: Storage wise you could always go for 255 because it wont use up additional space and you wont get intro trouble with string getting cut off. Greetz
