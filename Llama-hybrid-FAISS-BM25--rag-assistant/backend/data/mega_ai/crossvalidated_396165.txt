Dimensionality Reduction for Optimally Preserving KNN

Do any dimensionality reduction techniques find embeddings which optimally preserve the K-nearest neighbors of each point? If no algorithm provably does this, are there algorithms which heuristically achieve this more often than, say, PCA? I imagine that an algorithm which builds the nearest neighbors graph and then uses this to find a new embedding would do something like this. (I'd also be interested in a python library implementing any such algorithm)
