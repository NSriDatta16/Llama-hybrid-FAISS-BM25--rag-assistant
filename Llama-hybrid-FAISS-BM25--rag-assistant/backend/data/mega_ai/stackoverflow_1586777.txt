I go for the shallow tree approach, myself. One of the negative consequences of many-layered namespaces is the proliferation of same-named and same-functioned classes within a single project (differentiated only by their different namespace locations), or even worse: same-named and differently -functioned classes in the same project. Having only a single namespace in a project forces developers to give each separate class a good, self-descriptive name. Having multiple folders in a project is still a good idea, however (for organizational purposes), and I wish there was an option in Visual Studio such that classes added inside a sub-folder can not automatically have the folder names added to their namespaces (there may be such an option in the versions newer than 2005). I work around this by always adding new classes at the root level and then dragging them into their appropriate folders.
