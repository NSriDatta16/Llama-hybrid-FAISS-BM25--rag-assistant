Best statistical test for biological experiment with ordinal independent variable and binary outcomes over a time course

I am analysing a dataset with the following characteristics: We have three different groups. The difference between them lies in different levels of expression of a specific gene (no expression, medium expression, high expression). This could then be thought of as an ordinal variable. The response variable is a purely binary outcomes, yes/no. The measurements are taken over the course of three time points. The sample measured for each group is measured at each time point is different. From what I've read, ordinal logistic regression or proportional odds regression may be appropriate, but these are not methods I am familiar with and I am unsure their assumptions are met here. What would be the best approaches to study the magnitude of the effect size and the significance of the difference between groups?
