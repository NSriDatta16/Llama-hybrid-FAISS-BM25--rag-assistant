Significant p-value and anecdotical BF

I'm conducting frequentist as well as Bayesian analyses. However, I have difficulties to interpret data. Indeed, results showed significant p-value, but anecdotal BF10 ( I'm reading an article written by Wetzels et al. (2011) in link with this topic. In both case, I don't conclude about acception of H0 or H1 ? Generally, I have evidence when I conduct a test with BF10, but small evidence when test aims to assess evidence for H0. Are there reasons? And is there a link with statistical power ? Indeed I have small sample, can we imagine that more participants would conduct to increase the evidence for H1 or H0 of BFs ? Have a nice day Cheers, PM
