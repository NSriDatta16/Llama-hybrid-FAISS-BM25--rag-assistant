Survival analysis: How to estimate lifetime value of contracts that are on-going without censoring?

The problem: I am trying to estimate the lifetime value of a group of customers with on-going contracts. This would be trivial if I had a dataset where all the contracts had run their course, but these are contracts that are running for years, and I simply cannot wait for years to conduct an "easy" calculation. I need to estimate the lifetime value now. I have tried to scour the internet for an answer, from common statistical formulas to scientific studies. The crux of the problem is that my dataset is biased. The contracts that "die" early by definition did not live longer. The contracts are continuous contracts that can be terminated at any time. Every month, a couple of new contracts start, and occasionally some end, and they form a dataset. If, say, all the contracts signed in 2020 were already dead, I could simply calculate mean lifetime. However, 90 % of the contracts signed in 2020 are still alive and kicking. The average length of a contract is 342 days. (All live and ended ones.) The average lenght of a dead contract is 424 days. But because of the contracts started in 2020, only about 10 % have actually ended, the average lifetime is surely much, much more than 424 days. The question: Is there some kind of a formula where I could project how these contracts will die in the future? Especially if some kind of normal distribution assumption is made? The estimate does not have to be accurate to the last decimal point, but I would like to be in the ballpark. (i.e. , if the "true" mean lifetime is 10 years, its ok if the esitmate is 8 or 12, but not if its 2 or 20.) Using right censoring at this point would probably completely destroy the estimate, since I have so, so few "complete" observations. The data: I have attached a part of the dataset below. I know its a bit of a messy implementation, but the "start to now" column calculates the amount of days from start to today, while the days to end calculates from start to the end date. The "MIN" column takes whichever is smaller, allowing me to calculate means for all contract lenghts that dont count dead contracts as living.
