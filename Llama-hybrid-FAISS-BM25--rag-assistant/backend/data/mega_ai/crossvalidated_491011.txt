Considering a general primal problem: $$\min_w f(w)$$ subject to $$g_i(w)\leq 0 \forall i, h_j(w)=0 \forall j$$ This gives us the Lagrangian: $$ \mathcal{L}(w,\alpha,\beta) = f(w) +\sum_i\alpha_i g_i(w) + \sum_j\beta_j h_j(w) $$ KKT condition says that $\alpha_i^*g_i(w^*) = 0 \forall i$ Now let us state the soft margin SVM: $$\min_w \frac 12 w^Tw + C\sum_{i=1}^m \xi_i$$ subject to $$y_i(w^Tx_i+b)\geq 1-\xi_i \forall i \in \{1,2,..,m\}$$ $$\xi_i\geq 0 \forall i \in \{1,2,..,m\}$$ It is importatnt to notice that both of these constraints are inequalities. This means both of these will appear in the KKT conditions. This solves your trouble: I am troubled that $\xi_i$ doesn't appear in the complementary condition. (It does). The Lagrangian can then be written as: $$\mathcal{L}(w,b,\xi,\alpha,r) = \frac{1}{2}w^Tw + C\sum_{i=1}^m{\xi_i} - \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i [y_i (w^Tx_i+b)-1+\xi_i] - \sum_{i=1}^m r_i \xi_i$$ We have by setting derivative wrt $\xi_i$ to 0: $$\alpha_i+r_i=C \forall i \in \{1,2,..,m\}$$ Applying the KKT condition at optimal point: $$\alpha_i[y_i(w^Tx_i+b)-1+\xi_i] = 0 \forall i \in \{1,2,..,m\}$$ $$r_i\xi_i = 0 \forall i \in \{1,2,..,m\}$$ Case 1: $$\alpha_i=0\implies r_i=C\implies \xi_i = 0 \implies y_i(w^Tx_i+b)-1+0\geq 0 $$ $$ \implies y_i(w^Tx_i+b)\geq1$$ Case 2: $$0 $$ \implies y_i(w^Tx_i+b)=1$$ Case 3: $$\alpha_i=C\implies r_i=0\implies \xi_i \geq 0 \implies y_i(w^Tx_i+b)-1+\xi_i=0, \xi_i\geq 0$$ $$\implies y_i(w^Tx_i+b)\leq1$$
