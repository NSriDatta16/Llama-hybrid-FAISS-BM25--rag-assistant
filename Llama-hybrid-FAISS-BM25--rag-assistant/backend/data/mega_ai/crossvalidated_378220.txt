I'm going to talk a little more in a general/intuitive sense since there are already great statistical resources out there for this. An example would be here . The Chi-square test per se (the test statistic, p-value, conclusion) does not tell you about individual sides of the die. However, you can look at the residuals (difference between observed counts vs. expected counts) to get an idea about individual sides of the die. Even better, you can use one standardized version of the residuals called the Pearson residuals. $$ r_{i} = \frac{O_{i}-E{i}}{\sqrt{E_{i}}} $$ for $i = 1$ ,..., $6$ sides of the die. If $r_{i}$ is negative, then there were less observations of side $i$ than would be expected under the null hypothesis (of the die being fair), and if $r_{i}$ is positive, there were more observations than expected under the null. Large (absolute) values of $r_{i}$ provide more evidence against the null hypothesis, and in fact all of the $r_{i}$ together contribute to your final chi-square statistic: $$ \chi^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} r_{i}^{2} $$ You could perform significance tests of the $r_{i}$ individually as well. This would correspond directly to your technique - testing the individual probabilities of each the sides of the die separately. But then you have to ask what you are trying to answer. Are you interested in the whole die, or in just one side? That would determine if your method is valid. If you're interested in just one side, you don't need to check the other sides. Just test that one side and ignore the individual tests and the overall chi-square test. If your're interested in the whole die, then the method of checking each side individually will distort your Type 1 error rate compared to the chi-square test. To get an intuitive sense why, consider the formula above: $$ \chi^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} r_{i}^{2} $$ The chi-square test considers all of the residuals together. Under the null, some will be larger and some will be smaller, but the chi-square test will in effect average (in a broad sense of the term) all of their respective values. But individual tests hone in on the residuals with greatest (standardized) values. Overall, this would make your individual tests technique have higher Type 1 error rates than the chi-square test. You could do multiple comparisons to guard against this higher Type 1 error rate. Based on your individual tests idea, you would want to guard against the family-wise error rate , so one appropriate multiple comparison technique would be the Bonferonni correction.
