Some documentation on the exact meaning of feature importance is here: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/R-package/discoverYourData.html#feature-importance . The default There are a couple of things that should be mentioned here. First, you say that this feature has a value of 0 for 1425 rows, and that it "has data" for 5 rows. The value of 0 is also data, unless this is actually some kind of "missing data" label! In any case, XGBoost will just consider the value 0 to be a normal value. Secondly, you don't give the distribution of the class labels for the 0 valued items, but of the other, 3/5 have class 1, i.e. 0.6 probability of class 1. If most of the items are class 0 then the overall probability of class 1 will be much lower - less than 0.1 in the test sample - so this is a relatively good predictive feature for these 5 cases. As for this having the 2nd highest feature importance, it might just be that the other features increased the accuracy by even less. You should try to see if that makes sense by exploring the data.
