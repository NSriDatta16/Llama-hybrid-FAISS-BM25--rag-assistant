Do I need to include interaction in the model when I am only interested in overall effect?

Say I am doing a linear model, with treatment and study effects, and I know the treatment effects are different across studies. I want to estimate the OVERALL treatment effect (NOT study-specific ones). Now there are two models in my consideration: Model 1: E(Y) = TRT + STUDY Model 2: E(Y) = TRT + STUDY + TRT * STUDY My question is: Do I need to use Model 2 (with the interaction term) when I know I'm only interested in estimating the OVERALL treatment effect? Will model 1 be good enough since it will give me the average treatment effects across studies anyway?
