I was under the impression that the QVariant class was not intended for pointer storage. However, if you really want to do it, you could always do something like LiteNode* myPtr = new LiteNode; QVariant v(reinterpret_cast (myPtr)); //or quint64 for 64-bit apps myPtr = reinterpret_cast (v.value ()); That way you don't even have to declare your object type as a Qt Metatype.
