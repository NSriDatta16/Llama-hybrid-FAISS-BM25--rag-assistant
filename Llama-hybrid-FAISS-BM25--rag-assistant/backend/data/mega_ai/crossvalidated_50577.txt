No, the exponential distribution has lots of smaller values and fewer larger values. It is typically for things like the waiting times between random events that are equally likely to happen any time. What you are talking about is a particular type of non stationarity in your time series. Typically you would seek to remove thus exponential growth before doing your analysis. Taking logs could be one way of bringing the data back to linear growth that is easier to work with.
