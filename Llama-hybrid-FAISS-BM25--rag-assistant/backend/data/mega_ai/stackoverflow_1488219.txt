Using sessions will be more efficient. But (assuming the data in the session as cache) any other script not invoked by the user, which updates the dataset you're using, should invalidate the cache somehow. This means that the cache (now maitained in a session) should be accessible to other scripts. So it might be easier to maintain the cache in files (or you could use php_apc or memcached ) instead of sessions. I think there are many caching classes that are good but the only experience I have is with Zend_Cache and it is really easy to use. It supports APC, memcached, file, etc as backends (a.k.a storage)
