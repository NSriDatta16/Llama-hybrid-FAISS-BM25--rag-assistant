I suggest this organization: one process reads Twitter, stuffs tweets into database one or more processes reads database, processes each, inserts into new database. Original tweets either deleted or marked processed. That is, you have two more more processes/threads. The tweet database could be seen as a queue of work. Multiple worker processes take jobs (tweets) off the queue, and create data in the second database.
