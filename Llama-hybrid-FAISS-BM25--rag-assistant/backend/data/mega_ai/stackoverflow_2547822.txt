It depends on the RDBMS system, and how you define the column. You certainly could define one that only requires one byte of storage space [in SQL Server, it'd be CHAR(1) ]. Overhead for row headers, null bitmasks, possibly indexing uniquefication, and lots of other cruft can complicate things, but yeah, you should be able to create a column that's one byte wide.
