Edit - this answer misses the point of the question - see the comments below. I'm only leaving it here in case anyone else misinterprets it like me. Your question 2 first. To assess whether your population is normally distributed or not, use graphical methods. Standard methods include a histogram, a line plot showing an estimate of the density, and a qq plot comparing to a theoretical distribution. The first two give you an intuitive feel for the shape of the data and you can use a different colour line to show the normal distribution as a reference point. The qq plot takes a bit of practice to interpret but is the best method for comparing to an actual distribution. I'd use all three (or at least the density line plot and the qq plot) in combination. Any stats package will let you do this. Edit/addition: In your case as the observations are taken sequentially you should also draw a straightforward time series plot to give a sense of whether it is stationary or moving over time, and there is a range of basic time series diagnostic plots that you should look at too. If there is a structural trend in your observations over time the whole approach will need to be thought through very carefully. You are correct that when populations are not normally distributed often the mean is not a good summary measure. The main reason is that it can be heavily influenced by a single outlier. A good summary measure for your purposes is probably a 20 percent trimmed mean - which cuts the top and bottom 20% off your data and takes the mean of what is left. A median is the same as a 50% trimmed mean and, while less influenced by outliers than the mean, often goes too far in discarding information in the bulk of the data. In comparing the trimmed means of your various sub samples you should use a bootstrap method to quantify how much uncertainty there is in the various estimates from the different sub samples. The graphical methods I mentioned above in assessing your distribution against normal can also be used to compare the distributions of your various sub samples. A good addition is a boxplot, which takes an approach similar to that suggested by your colleague. A range of graphics to explore the data, in combination with comparing the trimmed mean and using a bootstrap for inference, is probably what you need. Your question 1. It's not clear to me why you need the global mean and standard deviation and what they would be used for (see my comment). I may come back and edit this question if I understand this better. As it is, you need to think through what you mean by a global mean, given you are (if I understand the situation correctly) manipulating the system yourself.
