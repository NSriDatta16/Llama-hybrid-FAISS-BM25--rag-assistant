Here's an article about how to organize your PHP project, from Rasmus Lerdorf, the architect who created the language: http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/38-The-no-framework-PHP-MVC-framework.html Despite the popularity of OO frameworks for PHP, Rasmus advocates a less OO approach. He knows more than anyone about PHP intended usage, and how to take advantage of its architecture for high-performance websites. edit: In response to the comment by @theman, I'll concede the article isn't a fine work of writing, but I think the content is important. Using PHP as it was intended to be used is better than struggling against its weaknesses to make it fit an OO mold.
