The Subversion documentation says this about the -t flag: This flag is automatically passed for you by the client when running over a tunnel agent such as ssh. That means there's rarely any need for you to pass this option to svnserve. I think you're probably looking just to run the server as a daemon: svnserve -d -r /Library/Subversion/Repositories/
