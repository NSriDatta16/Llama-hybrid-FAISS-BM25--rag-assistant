Found exactly what we need: Weka Machine Learning Library. http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ This is a data mining library that is strongly backed by Pentaho. Check out Weka's "related projects" section for even more Open Source goodness. Lucky for my lazy butt, there's also a Ruby binding library on Rubyforge, Rarff.
