I wrote a fairly thorough example on how to Bayesian decision making in AB tests here . A similar approach would work for you. The loss function would be similar to the example I linked to, except you would have more groups defined by the Cartesian product of size and color. You could very easily estimate a logistic regression for the probability of clicking on the image given the exposures.
