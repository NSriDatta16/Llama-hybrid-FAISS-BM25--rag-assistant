Convert time series data to supervised learning problem

I have a similar dataset like the one below. Each row represents a person and there are 3 different variables m1,m2,m3 with 3 measurements each. I am trying to frame this time series problem as a supervised learning problem so i can train an SVM and/or random forest. id Age gender m1_1 m2_1 m3_1 m1_2 m2_2 m3_2 m1_3 m2_3 m3_3 label 1 20 M 12.4 34 12 13 324 34 34 232 12 0 2 30 M 123.4 324 2 32 32 4 3 2 2 1 My idea would be to reshape the data like this: Note that I only did for the first row on the dataset above id Age gender m1 m2 m3 Label 1 20 M 12.4 34 12 0 1 20 M 13 324 34 0 1 20 M 34 232 12 0 Basically, if there are 3 measurements per variable, I'd have 3 rows to reflect this information. Am I going in the right direction with this approach? If not, could you point me to the right direction? Thank you for taking your time in advance.
