How to build a model where multiple data points contribute to a result

I’m trying to figure out how to massage data and model the following scenario: Customers at a restaurant rate the quality of the service between 1-10. I have data on individual interactions between the servers and customers. Say - length of interaction, type of interaction (refilling beverage, ordering, cleaning, etc). Hypothesis here is each interaction contributes to the final score. I want to build a model that tells me given an interaction, how does it move the score. My intuition is if I arranged the data as individual interactions, with output of final score, that’ll give me what I want. Is that true?
