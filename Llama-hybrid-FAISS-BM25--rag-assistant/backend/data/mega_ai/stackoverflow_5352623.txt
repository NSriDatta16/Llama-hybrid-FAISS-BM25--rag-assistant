Some things look mixed up. You have view for users, but you are creating User::Account there?! In controller you didn't create that account. Perhaps: @user = User.new :account => Users::Account.new But pay attention that you either need to move your logic in Users::AccountController or if you want to create both User and it's account in the same view, than you use nested_forms for account and than you should post form to your @user model with accepting_nesting_attributes for account too.
