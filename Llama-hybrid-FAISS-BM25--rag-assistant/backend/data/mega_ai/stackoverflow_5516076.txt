As an average programmer on mainstream platforms, you do not need to worry too much about one byte not being 8 bit. However, I'd still use the CHAR_BIT constant in my code and assert (or better static_assert ) any locations where you rely on 8 bit bytes. That should put you on the safe side. (I am not aware of any relevant platform where it doesn't hold true).
