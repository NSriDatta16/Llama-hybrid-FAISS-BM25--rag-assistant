Let me suggest a different approach that is simpler and relies on fewer assumptions than Heitz Chi Square approach. Going back to your data set, you essentially have a time series of annual death penalties running from 2002 to 2014. And, except for 2013 in the other years the average is about 4 per year. Now, 2013 is very different at 19 in that year. Your hypothesis really should be is whether the 19 occurence in 2013 is statistically significant or not. The easiest way to do this is by using linear regression. For it to be interactive, I propose doing it with LINEST in Excel. To investigate whether 2013 figure is statistically significant, we can structure our linear regression in two different ways. Both regressions will have the same dependent variable structure. We know the exact figures from 2012 to 2014. And, for the earlier years we know they sum up to 45. So, you can enter a bunch of annual figures with a bit of variation (let's say between 2 and 6) as long as they sum up to 45. In the first regression, you will use three regressors: 1) Intercept; 2) a Trend variable (1, 2, 3,...); and 3) a dummy variable for 2013 (1 in 2013 and 0 in all other years). Within this first regression, you will see that the 2013 dummy variable comes in with a very high value at around 15. This makes perfect sense because at 19, it is 15 units higher than the average of the other years around 4. And, the same 2013 dummy variable comes with a very high t stat of close to 12, meaning it is very statistically significant (any t stat > 3 is already very statistically significant). In the second regression, you replicate the first regression except you do not use a 2013 dummy variable. In this case, you will calculate the residuals of this regression and subsequently the standardized residuals of this regression. Next, you observe how much of an outlier is 2013 by looking at its standardized residual or Z value. In my case, the residual was - 11.8 and the standardized residuals was -38.3. Any standardized residual whose absolute value is greater than 3 denotes a very statistically significant outlier. Both regression methods fully confirm that the year 2013 is extraordinary and way above the norm or trend rate as depicted by all the other years. By conducting your regression using LINEST you will see that the values you assign to 2002 to 2012 do not affect your outcome of the statistical significance of 2013. You will get slightly different results than mine. However, directionally your results will match mine. 2013 again is a very statistically significant extraordinary year compared to the other years in the data. Given the number of data points you have, I think the above approach will be far more conclusive and robust than using a standard multiple group hypothesis testing approach like ANOVA or its nonparametrics equivalents. That's because those approaches will not work well with one category that has only 2 data points or maybe even just one depending on how you segment your data (in 2 or 3 different groups). The linear regression approach entirely circumvented this problem.
