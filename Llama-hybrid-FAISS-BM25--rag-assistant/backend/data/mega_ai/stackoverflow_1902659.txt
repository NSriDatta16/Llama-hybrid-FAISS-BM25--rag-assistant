Point your iPhone here, the link provided by Neil doesn't seem to be working for me. Link Update. I accessed the website with my itouch and this is the response: User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (ipod: U;CPU iPhone OS 2_2 like Mac OS X: es_es) AppleWebKit/525.18.1 Browser Name/Version: M_webkit/3.1.1 So I'm assuming it's safari 3.1.1
