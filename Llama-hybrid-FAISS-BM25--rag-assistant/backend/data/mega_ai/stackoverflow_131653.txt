Inline style to act as :hover in CSS

I know that embedding CSS styles directly into the HTML tags they affect defeats much of the purpose of CSS, but sometimes it's useful for debugging purposes, as in: asdf What's the syntax for embedding a rule like: a:hover {text-decoration: underline;} into the style attribute of an A tag? It's obviously not this... bar ...since that would apply all the time, as opposed to just during hover.
