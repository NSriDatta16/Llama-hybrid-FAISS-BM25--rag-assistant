If you define a string as: char *str1 = "apple"; you are not permitted to modify the contents - the standard is quite clear that this is undefined behaviour (a) . Use: char str1[] = "apple"; instead and it will give you a modifiable copy. It's functionally equivalent to: char str1[6]; strcpy (str1, "apple"); (a) C99 6.4.5 "String literals" , paragraph 6 states: It is unspecified whether these arrays are distinct provided their elements have the appropriate values. If the program attempts to modify such an array, the behavior is undefined.
