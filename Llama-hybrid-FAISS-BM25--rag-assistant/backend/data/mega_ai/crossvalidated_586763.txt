This question sounds like an XY problem to me. There's no "Effective degrees of freedom" for seasonal/cyclical data. The fundamental problem here is that seasonal data is nonstationary: the values of your parameters are changing over time, while any estimates of your model are going to have to assume the parameters are constant. Until you correct for that, your estimates are not going to be consistent, regardless of what you use as your degrees of freedom. I'd recommend going through a good resource on time series modeling, either a textbook or the documentation for the R forecast package . Pay close attention to the parts on seasonal time series and ARFIMA models, which should address your concerns. As for p-values, the package will automatically calculate them for you. I have averaged the data from multiple nearby locations so not worried about spatial degrees of freedom I wouldn't recommend doing that, unless you're very certain that measurements are almost independent; it invalidates your p-values if the data aren't independent.
