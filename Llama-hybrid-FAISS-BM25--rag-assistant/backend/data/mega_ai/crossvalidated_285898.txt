Hierarchical models - empty groups and missing groups

In hierarchical models (HLMs, Hierarchical Bayesian models, etc.) parameters are estimated for each group: | population | |----------------+----------------+---------------| | group 1 | group 2 | group 3 | |----+-----+-----+----+-----+-----+----+-----+----| | x1 | x2 | x3 | x4 | x5 | x6 | x7 | x8 | x9 | Best practice says I should split my data to in-sample (for training) and out-of-sample (for testing) data. What if my in-sample data contains no samples for group 3? What is the best way to handle this?
