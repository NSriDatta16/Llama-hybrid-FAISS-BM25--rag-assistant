Get out of the mindset of 'classification'. Use an older, direct probability model such as the logistic regression model. If you have a nominal (polytomous; multinomial) $Y$ to predict, use the multinomial logistic model. If $Y$ can be ordered, then use ordinal logistic regression or other cumulative probability ordinal models. If you have too small a sample size for the number of candidate features, consider using the lasso. The output of logistic regression is a true probability of class membership.
