To answer question 2: The problem you're having is probably because IE's filter rotation and standard CSS3 rotation use different rotation points - ie the point around which the element is rotated. One uses the top-left corner of the element, the other uses the center point. The best reference site for cross-browser rotation that I know of is this one: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/03/09/cross-browser-css-transforms-even-in-ie/ Hope that helps.
