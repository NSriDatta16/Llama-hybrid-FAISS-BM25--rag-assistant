To classify your images into 5 different orientations you can use any classifier provided you have the labels for the five different orientations. If you want to use deep learning you can use a Convolutional Network, which is the go-to choice when it comes to image classification. To learn a more compact representation of your images you could replace your network's final layer with an embedding layer similar to unsupervised word-to-vec, this way you would have vector representation of your images and could easily return the 10 closest images.
