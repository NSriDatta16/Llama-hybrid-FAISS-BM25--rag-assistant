The proper way to provide a label to a form element is to use : Some form controls automatically have labels associated with them (press buttons) while most do not (text fields, checkboxes and radio buttons, and menus). For those controls that have implicit labels, user agents should use the value of the value attribute as the label string. The element is used to specify labels for controls that do not have implicit labels Since it is a semantic element providing meaning to your markup user agents can make sense of it and tend to helpfully direct clicks on the label to the element itself ( very helpful for tiny controls like checkboxes). Also you're providing helpful assistance to people using screen readers or other accessibility features. You shouldn't use or to actually label an element. For auxiliary help text, however, they might prove useful. But imho you should stick to the semantic capabilities of HTML where possible and sensible. This is such as case in my eyes.
