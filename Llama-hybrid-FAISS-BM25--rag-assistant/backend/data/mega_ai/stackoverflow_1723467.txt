Microsoft SQL 2005 active cluster node has 100% CPU load after clustering

Before moving to the SQL Server 2005 cluster we had on avarage 60% CPU load. After moving to active/passive cluster (with the exactly same hardware), the load on active node CPU is becoming 100% and after a while time-outs are comming from our web application. Any ideas what could be a couse? Additional info: OS: Windows Server 2008 Enterprise; SQL: SQL Server 2005 SP3 Enterprise; Both nodes has exactly the same hardware
