A question about DDD, 5-tier model and business logic

As I get it, the model in is DDD divided into these tiers: Storage (database, file, cache ...) Mapper (takes data from the storage) Repository (manages data for a single entity type, can use different mappers) Entity (a simple data container, independent of other tiers) Service (handles business logic like Get the 5 newest posts ordered alphabetically by title , uses the Repository) So, this is are the 5 tiers (please correct me if I misunderstood something). And the question is: If I have business logic that is related to a single entity, should I implement it in the Entity, or in the Service? For example, if I have a post and want to retrieve all its comments that are approved, should it be Post.getApprovedComments (entity) or CommentsService.getApprovedCommentsForPost(Post post) ? (No, it's not right to use post.getComments().filter(comment -> comment.approved) , because that moves business logic out of the Model. Just in case someone asks.)
