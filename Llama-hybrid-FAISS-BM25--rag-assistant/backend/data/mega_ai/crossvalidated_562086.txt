The idea of these types of questions/puzzles is to apply some Bayesian analysis and use the test result to update the probability that you are sick. The people that got a positive test result are either sick and got a correct test result or not sick and got an incorrect test result. The ratio of those two cases are the odds for being sick. For example. Say 1 000 000 people do the test and the outcome is: $$\begin{array}{} & \text{sick} & \text{not sick} & \text{total} \\ \text{positive test}& 99 & 9999 & 10098 \\ \text{negative test}& 1 & 989901 & 989902\\ \text{total} &100 &999 900 & 1000000 \end{array}$$ Here we see that among the sick people 99% test positive and among the not sick people 99% test negative. If you have a positive test then you are one of the 10 098 people with a positive test, but only 99 among those are truly sick. So you have $\frac{99}{10098} \approx 0.98\%$ probability of being sick. So your problem is to make that table. Below this is done stepwise Fill in the total amount of people $n$ (the actual value does not matter, it will drop from the equation eventually) $$\begin{array}{} & \text{sick} & \text{not sick} & \text{total} \\ \text{positive test}& & & \\ \text{negative test}& & & \\ \text{total} & & & n \end{array}$$ The prior distribution sick is $p=0.0001$ , you can fill this into the totals $$\begin{array}{} & \text{sick} & \text{not sick} & \text{total} \\ \text{positive test}& & & \\ \text{negative test}& & & \\ \text{total} & p n & (1-p) n & n \end{array}$$ If you know the probability distribution of the test result/outcome given the state sick/not-sick, then you can fill in the rest of the table. If a fraction $x$ of the sick people have a positive test $$\begin{array}{} & \text{sick} & \text{not sick} & \text{total} \\ \text{positive test}& x p n & & \\ \text{negative test}& (1-x) p n & & \\ \text{total} & p n & (1-p) n & n \end{array}$$ If a fraction $y$ of the non sick people have a negative test $$\begin{array}{} & \text{sick} & \text{not sick} & \text{total} \\ \text{positive test}& x p n & (1-y) (1-p) n & \\ \text{negative test}& (1-x) p n & y (1-p) n & \\ \text{total} & p n & (1-p) n & n \end{array}$$ We can complete the totals on the right $$\begin{array}{} & \text{sick} & \text{not sick} & \text{total} \\ \text{positive test}& x p n & (1-y) (1-p) n & x p n + (1-y) (1-p) n \\ \text{negative test}& (1-x) p n & y (1-p) n & (1-x) p n + y (1-p) n\\ \text{total} & p n & (1-p) n & n \end{array}$$ Then the probability to be sick given a positive test result is $$\begin{array}{} P(\text{sick} | \text{positive test}) &=& \frac{x p n }{x p n + (1-y) (1-p) n} \\ &=& \frac{xp }{xp + (1-y)(1-p) } \\ & = & \frac{x }{xp + (1-y)(1-p) }p \end{array}$$ In your problem, it is only stated that the accuracy is 99%. This is not a very complete description. The detection can make two types of errors a sick person with a negative test, and a not sick person with a positive test. The ratios of these two can be different. In some of these problem statements, it is plainly just stated that the accuracy is 99% (like in your problem/puzzle), and implied that the false positive and false negative rates are the same and 1%. This implication is not correct/accurate but if you ignore this error in the question then you can say $x = y = 0.99$ and solve the above equation $$\begin{array}{} P(\text{sick} | \text{positive test}) &=& \frac{x }{xp + (1-y)(1-p) }p \\ &=& \frac{0.99 }{0.99 \cdot 0.0001 + 0.01 \cdot 0.9999 } 0.0001\\ &=& \frac{0.99 }{ 0.010098 } 0.0001 & = & 0.009803922 \end{array}$$
