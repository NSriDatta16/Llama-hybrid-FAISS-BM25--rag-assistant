Is it possible to disable the dragging waiting time in an UIScrollView?

When the user touches into an UIScrollView and wants to scroll, there is a little delay. UIKit tries to find out if the user wanted to touch the content in the scroll view or if the user wanted to scroll. So it waits a moment if the finger moves far enough, and then starts scrolling. Could I tell it that it must start scrolling with no delay? I have a situation where the content really doesn't care at all about touches, so the UIScrollView doesn't have to wait, it can immediately start scrolling.
