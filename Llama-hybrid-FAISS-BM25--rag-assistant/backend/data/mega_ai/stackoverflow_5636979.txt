Magento - Pagination with different number of elements displayed depending on the page number

I'm trying to achieve a non-standart behaviour in magento; Within products categories, I basically need to display a different number of products depending on the current page number. I'm not quite sure that I can specify this just by a configuration settings in magento admin. So I suppose I will need to hook into magento core to achieve this. Any recommandation on where to start this / how to override default behaviour? Thanks in advance
