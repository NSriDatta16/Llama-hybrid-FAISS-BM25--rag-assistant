Normalization in SVM

I have applied libsvm with a linear kernel to a set of instances and I have obtained a 68 % success: instance1 : f11, f12, f13, f14 instance2 : f21, f22, f23, f24 instance3 : f31, f32, f33, f34 instance4 : f41, f42, f43, f44 .............................. instanceN : fN1, fN2, fN3, fN4 Taking the same set of instances but multiplying each value ( f11*1000 ... fN4*1000 ) I have obtained a 90% of success. However, I the multiplied by 1000 is normalized the percentatge of success turn to 68%. It seems something related with normalization but I don't know which it is the reason.
