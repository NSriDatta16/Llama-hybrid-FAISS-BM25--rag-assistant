Usually, invite-only beta testing pretty much restricts you to existing or potential customers. If you have customers of this product (you don't because you say it's "new") or of other products from your company, invite them to test your product. They won't all say yes. If you don't have customers, or you don't get enough beta testers, it's time for your sales critters (which sounds like it may be you) to get into action in creating some customers. Offering a beta, at no cost and no obligation, can often be an enticement to people that will actually encourage them to buy, especially if their bug reports are taken seriously. So this morphs your question into "how do I find potential customers for my app?" And that will depend on what your app is.
