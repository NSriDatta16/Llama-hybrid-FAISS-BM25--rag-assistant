How to apply imputation when creating an analytical base table?

I am asked to read up on how to deal with missing values. From what I read I can use imputation with a package like MICE (for R) to automate this process. However I also read that when I am missing over 5% of data for a certain feature I should dismiss it and remove it from my ABT (Analytical Base Table), which will be used for Machine Learning. However if the above is true then how should I deal with the following situation: I got 2 tables of which one will form my ABT. The other one is used to engineer new features. The one used to create new features missed over 5% of the data for a column. The problem is that this column is pretty important. Without it the other columns have no use any longer. Should I ignore this table when engineering new features or should I just remove the rows missing a value for this feature?
