I'm not sure about building an app like this, but SmugMug is an existing app that hits most of your requirements. Can upload unlimited JPGs as part of base cost, other files can be uploaded at additional cost Photos can be categorized into galleries per client. Galleries can be locked down, with clients getting unique user/pass to their gallery Not 100% sure if you can email a link directly from the site, but I believe you can. Additionally, if you get a pro account, clients can order prints online (no need to build your own payment processing), you can "theme" the galleries how you like, automatic watermarking, etc. The base cost is $40-$150/year, depending on what level you choose, plus whatever you need for additional file storage. Not sure if it meets all your needs, but just throwing it out there. Note: I am not affiliated w/ SmugMug, just a satisfied user.
