Time series that is never stationary by differencing

When I was looking at time series I noticed that a common approach to time series modelling is the ARIMA model which basically does differencing until a stationary series is found and then fits the ARMA parameters. Is it possible to construct time series that are infinitely often differentiable but never stationary when differenced? I did not see how to construct one and was thinking of a series similar to the Weierstrass never differentiable function but this did not seem fruitful. Ideas would be appreciated!
