Completely different inferences between single-trial difference and meta-analysis comparison

I have the following data mydat Each (study, treatment) combination produces a risk of responders/exposure . In study B, we see that the risk of Treatment 1 = 211/1251 = 0.169 and Treatment 5 = 8/625 = 0.013 , and this risk is significantly different based on a two-sample t-test for just Study B. Trials A and C reveal risks for Treatment 5 to be 22/277 = 0.079 and 36/477 = 0.075 respectively, still far lower than the Treatment 1 in Study B (although I know, it's from a different trial so results aren't transferable). In any case, a direct comparison in Study B of Treatment 5 vs 1 shows significance, and additional trials still have far lower proportions, so it seems most likely that a network meta-analysis should reveal significance as well. Let's proceed with the network meta-analysis with package gemtc require(gemtc) net = mtc.network(mydat, treatments = data.frame(id = c(1, 5, 7), description = c("T1", "T2", "T3"))) model The risk ratio of Treatment 5 vs Treatment 1 is 0.07, but the confidence intervals don't show significance. Why is this so? I understand network meta-analysis handles trial hetereogeneity via random effects, but it still seems bizarre it's not significant, since a head-on comparison from Study B reveals significance. All MCMC diagnostics reveal no problems with the sampling either.
