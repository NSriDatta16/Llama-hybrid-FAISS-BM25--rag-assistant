Updating a row in a data file with values from another row

I have some data in tab delimited form that gives the result of device identification from user-agents (UAs). but there are several rows where the devices are wrongly identified and I need to change them to the correct ones. For instance there are cases when and iphone or htc wildfire UA is identified as another phone. So for there cases I need to update the device information with the correct device by searching for certain keywords in the UA. for example, 781 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; fi-fi; HTC_Wildfire_A3333 Build/ERE27) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17 htc_wildfire_ver1_suba3333 HTC Wildfire Android this is correct but a similar case is wrong 775 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; fi-fi; HTC Wildfire Build/ERE27) AppleWebKit/525.10+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Mobile Safari/523.12.2 (AdMob-ANDROID-20100709) T-Mobile Pulse Android So, I have to do something like this. I know that if the UA column contains the term HTC and Wildfire it is that phone. So, I want to look for all the UAs that have the strings HTC and Wildfire but the columns 3 and 4 (manufucturer and model) are wrong and then update them with the correct device information from row 781 which I know is correct. I would manually put in the code that row 781 is correct and if the device is not correctly identified I would put the info from column 3 onwards of row 781 for all these cases. Of course this is one case and there are several cases like this and I would repeat the same logic for each of them. Also there are other columns besides these four that I've not shown. how would i accomplish this in a perl script (preferably, but a bash solution is also ok).
