I have splitted the periods not in fixed time windows, but in dynamic ones. Eg. If we take @Ricardo's Alerts, I would take the values of all the variables from that "period". The table should be like this for the latest "period" per Sensor: Sensors | Var1 | Var2 |...| Target Where VarX are the categories from the categorical variables we want to use as independent variables (hot encoding). The VarX will have the count of each category for the time period. Now we can predict with a logistic regression, or even a random forest, or even with XGBoost algorithm the Target variable from the VarX variables per Sensor, even though they have different time frames. Bonus: If we want a small timeframe (let's say the shortest reaction time is the best), then we can weight the Target per delay time and change the model to continuous variable prediction.
