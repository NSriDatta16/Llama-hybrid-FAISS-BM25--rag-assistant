Try differencing $x_{t}-x_{t-1}$ and test again. You might also use differences of the logs to stabilize the variance. Sometimes doing seasonal differencing (with or without logs), rather than consecutive observations, will work better. Sometimes you may need to difference more than once. Essentially, differencing can sometimes help stabilize the mean of a time series by eliminating trend and seasonality.
