I think what you are saying is that you have two types of columns... type 1 and type 2. You have a target variable $y$ to estimate. What you are suggesting to do is to estimate $y_1$ with the type 1 columns, then $y_2$ with the type 2 columns, and finally estimate $y$ as a function of $\hat y_1$ and $\hat y_2$. Although this is certainly possible, you don't indicate why would you be interested in doing this. If you want to do dimensionality reduction, I would recommend you to do PCA instead, and then regress $y$ into the principal components. The problem of your approach is that you are introducing unnecessary noise for the estimation of the parameters.
