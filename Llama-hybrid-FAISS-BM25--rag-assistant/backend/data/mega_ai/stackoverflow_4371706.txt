Is there a way to justify-align floating HTML elements with CSS?

Essentially, I'm trying to achieve the affect of "text-align:justify" but with floating block elements. I have many blocks that I want to justify-align. Ie. each line is horizontally-spaced differently to make sure lengths of each line are the same. (Non-ragged right edge). Is there a way to do this with CSS? If not, is there a suitable JS library to achieve this? Or is this just infeasible?
