Enemy detection in 3D video games without labeled dataset

I'm working on a tool for single-class object detection in video games, which should be able to detect enemies in 3D environments. The main problem is, that I cannot use any labeled dataset. Instead I can use gameplay material and game-engine/human player as source of knowledge. Basically I plan to run training process alongside human/bot player playing the game, and make it try to guess location of enemies for each frame, having game-engine/human player as a feedback loop, judging if it pointed at any distinct object at all, and if this object can be considered as enemy. Trained tool should be able to detect enemy based only on pixels of a single game frame. I'm having some problems in finding out how to approach this problem. Most resources I found about object detection are focused on more traditional CNNs trained with big labeled datasets. I thought about using Reinforcement Learning, because it somehow seem to fit my assumptions about having consecutive states (gameplay frames in this case) and feedback loop assigning reward, but on the other hand using RL for object detection seems somewhat unnatural to me (but I would love to be proved wrong). Anyway, I will greatly appreciate suggestions of any keywords, articles or solutions that may be helpful or point me in the right direction. Or maybe I should think of some completely different way of approaching this problem?
