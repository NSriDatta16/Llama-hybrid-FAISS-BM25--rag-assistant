This is here to support Internet Explorer 5 and encourage it to use UTF-8 for its forms. The commit message seen here details it as follows: Fix several known web encoding issues: Specify accept-charset on all forms. All recent browsers, as well as IE5+, will use the encoding specified for form parameters Unfortunately, IE5+ will not look at accept-charset unless at least one character in the form's values is not in the page's charset. Since the user can override the default charset (which Rails sets to UTF-8), we provide a hidden input containing a unicode character, forcing IE to look at the accept-charset. Now that the vast majority of web input is UTF-8, we set the inbound parameters to UTF-8. This will eliminate many cases of incompatible encodings between ASCII-8BIT and UTF-8. You can safely ignore params[:_snowman] In short, you can safely ignore this parameter. Still, I am not sure why we're supporting old technologies like Internet Explorer 5. It seems like a very non-Ruby on Rails decision if you ask me.
