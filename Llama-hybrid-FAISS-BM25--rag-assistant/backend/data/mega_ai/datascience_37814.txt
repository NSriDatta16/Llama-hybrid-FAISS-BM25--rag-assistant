Extracting specific data from unstructured text - NER

I have a reasonably simple problem to solve. I need to extract reservations numbers from unstructured text. Based on my research, it seems to be an NER problem. Based on a visual analysis of the dataset, I could notice that the reservation number is frequently near specific keywords, such as 'confirmation', 'reservation', 'confirmation number', 'reservations number', etc. First, I decided to try a Regex rule to extract the data, but some minimum variations might render this solution inefficient. The reservation number can have very different variations, such as: ZXC51657856, EA5FFD4, 45615177413515, QT454545EF, At this moment, I don't have a dataset available to train a classifier to solve this issue. I would like to receive some ideas from the community to guide me towards an elegant solution to this problem, as I'm pretty new to ML in general and time is limited.
