As far as I know, spaces must be encoded in cookies. Different browsers react differently to un-encoded cookies. You should URL-encode your cookie before setting it. String cookieval = "my value"; String cookieenc = URLEncoder.encode(cookieval, "UTF-8"); res.addCookie(new Cookie("myCookieName", cookieenc)); ASP.NET does the encoding automatically, in Java you have to do it yourself. I suspect the quotes you see are added by the user agent.
