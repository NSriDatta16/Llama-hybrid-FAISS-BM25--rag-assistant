Here's a possible, but not pretty workaround - Setting Computed on a column will make it read only, but will make the default value work. It's possible to have a real Computed column, say "LastChangedAt_computed" that either shows the value of "LastChangedAt_default" or "LastChangedAt_manual". Now, the computed column shows the value of the default column, unless the manual column is not-null, in which case it is shown. In the model, the StoragePattern of the default column needs to be "Computed". It's an ugly solution, but it should work.
