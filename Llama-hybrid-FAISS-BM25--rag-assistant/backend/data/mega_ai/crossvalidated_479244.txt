Suggestions on binary classifiers for high dimensional categorical data set?

I have a binary classification problem with 210 variables (2 levels 0/1) and I am wondering how should I approach this problem as algorithms which I used (logistic regression, random forests) did very poorly predicting all as 0. Data set has 12 861 observations with 2810 1s and 10 051 0s. I tried also some feature selection using Boruta algorithm based on random forest, Pearson correlation and Cramer's V. Narrowing down list of variables to 20 most important ones didn't help as well (still only 0s). Do you have any suggestions on how to tackle this? Would deep learning be suitable for such problem? I have also done some visualization with t-SNE and PCA but nothing interesting there. Many thanks
