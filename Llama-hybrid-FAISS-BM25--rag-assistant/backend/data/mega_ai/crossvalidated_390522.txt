Logistic regression is a classification method that basically learns a probability function $\pi_\theta(x)$ over the input space by fitting the parameters $\theta$ . If the predicted probabilities are learned with the appropriate loss function, than logistic regression has the potential to learn an unbiased estimation of the binary event probabilities, whenever its has sufficient capacity (input features). The log loss allows such unbiased estimation. Consider the fact that the log loss function is simply the negative log likelihood of a Bernoulli distribution $z \thicksim \text{Ber}(p)$ . The maximum likelihood estimation for $p$ is unbiased given a set of observations for variable $z$ . In the case of classification over some input space $\mathcal{X}$ , one can imagine having one Bernoulli distribution for all points in $\mathcal{X}$ . Most often, you will only have 1 observation $y_i$ per Bernoulli distribution, which is located at $x_i$ . Jointly applying maximum likelihood estimation for all observed Bernoulli distributions $y_i \thicksim \text{Ber}(\pi(x_i))$ will apply several constraints to $\pi_\theta$ . Since all these constraints leads to unbiased estimations, and as long as the function $\pi_\theta$ is sufficently flexible to fit the true underlying probability function $\pi^*$ , then the learning procedure is consistent and will converge to the optimal model as you get more data. Thus, limiting the model capacity (fewer features for instance) can hinder the calibration of a logistic regression by increasing the distance between the best learnable model and the true model. Using an incorrect observation model with the logistic regression will lead to uncalibrated probabilities. Modeling binary events with a normal distribution is inappropriate, and should not be used in combination with logistic regression. The loss function corresponding to the normal distribution observation model is the Mean Squared Error. Thus, using an MSE loss would certaintly hinder its calibration.
