"It is the goal of MacRuby to enable the creation of full-fledged Mac OS X applications which do not sacrifice performance in order to enjoy the benefits of using Ruby." - the MacRuby README MacRuby isn't a 'translation layer' as Rob says. It's Ruby on the same object system that Cocoa is using. You can certainly build "first-class" applications with it, and also accomplish things that are inconvenient with Objective-C. Be careful not to confuse MacRuby with RubyCocoa. Apple did not 'pull all the templates' for MacRuby, because they've never shipped by default. Furthermore, LLVM's integration with Apple's platforms grows with each release. The next release of XCode will rely on LLVM for advanced code-completion, checking, and compilation. If Apple is deemphasizing anything it's the GCC. One might also note that MacRuby has similar limitations in API coverage as Objective-C does: for instance, creating authenticated apps or accessing the keychain requires wrapper classes for both languages.
