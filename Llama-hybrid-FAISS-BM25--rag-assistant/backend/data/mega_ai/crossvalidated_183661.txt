How to understand mutual Granger causality

As stated in title, when we have a time series model of two variables, e.g x and y, and conduct the Granger causality test to examine the "causal relationship" between two variables, we can be in a situation that x Granger causes y and y also Granger causes x, that is, a mutual Granger causal relationship. How to understand and interpret such relationship in real case? I know that the result of Granger causality test does not equal to real causal relationship in philosophy sense, but how to make sense to such result?
