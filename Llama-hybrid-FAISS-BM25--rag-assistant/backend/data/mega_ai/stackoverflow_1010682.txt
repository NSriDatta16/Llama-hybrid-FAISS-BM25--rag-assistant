Can you post your pom file? Or at least the relevant sections? You should have something like the following: ...snip... org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.2 xml org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.2 xml Also, are you following the standard maven directory layout for your source? Where is your pom file with respect to your source files, and what does your directory layout look like?
