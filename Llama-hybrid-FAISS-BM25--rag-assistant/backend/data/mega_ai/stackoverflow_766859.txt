dragging user controls from one flowlayoutpanel to another

how can i add drag and drop capability of a custom usercontrol from 2 flowlayoutpanels? Usercontrol keeps being null on the following line of code below private void flowLayoutPanel1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { UserControl userControl = e.Data.GetData(typeof(UserControl)) as UserControl;
