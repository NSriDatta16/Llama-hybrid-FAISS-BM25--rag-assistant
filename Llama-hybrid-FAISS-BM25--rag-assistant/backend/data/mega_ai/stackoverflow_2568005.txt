You should use two separate queries to do that : delete from images where p_id = 123; delete from projects where p_id = 123; i.e. : First, delete the images, that depend on the project (foreign key ? ) And, when nothing depends on the project anymore, delete the project itself. And, as a security precaution, you should wrap all this in a transaction, to get a all or nothing behavior -- well, if you are using a storage engine that suppors transactions, like InnoDb. See 12.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax , about that, in the MySQL Manual.
