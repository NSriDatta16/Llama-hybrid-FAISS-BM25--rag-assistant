Reading the same file multiple times in Python

I need to download a zip archive of text files, dispatch each text file in the archive to other handlers for processing, and finally write the unzipped text file to disk. I have the following code. It uses multiple open/close on the same file, which does not seem elegant. How do I make it more elegant and efficient? zipped = urllib.urlopen('www.abc.com/xyz.zip') buf = cStringIO.StringIO(zipped.read()) zipped.close() unzipped = zipfile.ZipFile(buf, 'r') for f_info in unzipped.infolist(): logfile = unzipped.open(f_info) handler1(logfile) logfile.close() ## Cannot seek(0). The file like obj does not support seek() logfile = unzipped.open(f_info) handler2(logfile) logfile.close() unzipped.extract(f_info)
