How do I insert into a table and get back the primary key value?

I have a primary key set up to auto increment. I am doing multiple queries and I need to retrieve that primary key value to use as a foreign key in another table ( IsIdentity = TRUE ). Is there any elegant way to get back the primary key value when I do an insert query? Right now I am requerying and getting the highest value in that column which seems really hacky. Any suggestions?
