Which transformation is better for a PCA?

I'm analyzing morpho-functional indices of forelimbs in a subterranean rodent (e.g. olecranon length / ulna length x 100) and I don't know how to treat data prior to a PCA. Which transformation is better? Natural logarithm, log10, angular transformation, or no transformation?
