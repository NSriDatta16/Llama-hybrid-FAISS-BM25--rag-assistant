If a time series problem does not have any significant auto correlation then that means that it cannot be predicted using uni variate time series. For example, if a problem has a high auto correlation, then that means that it's previous values can make a good feature for predicting the future values. And the opposite is true. If a problem has a low auto correlation value, then lag variables are not a very good feature. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the problem cannot possibly be predicted, it just means that if you want to forecast well, then you can't use just lag variables as a feature. This is called multi variate time series. So, it sum this up, if there is not a very high auto correlation, then that means that you need more features than just a lag variable.
