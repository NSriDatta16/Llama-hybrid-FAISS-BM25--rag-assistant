this is some sample code about RESTful calls to Windows Table Storage Listing tables: http:// .table.core.windows.net/Tables Deleting tables: http:// .table.core.windows.net/Tables('TableName') In order to create a new table you have to create a POST request to the next Uri: POST http:// .table.core.windows.net/Tables And this could be the body for your request: 2010-11-18T11:48:34.9840639-07:00 ProductTable If you need INSERT a new entity, you should use the next Uri: POST http:// .table.core.windows.net/ And the request body as the following Atom XML: 2010-12-13T13:26:48.8875037Z My descripcion Entity Name Definitions Things 0001-01-01T00:00:00 Deleting entities http:// .table.core.windows.net/ (PartitionKey="Definitions", RowKey="Things") Using the REST API to update or merge data is really a combination of the DELETE and the insert REST API's. The URI to update or merge the local entity back to the table storage is the same URI as the delete operation http:// .table.core.windows.net/ (PartitionKey="Definitions", RowKey="Things")
