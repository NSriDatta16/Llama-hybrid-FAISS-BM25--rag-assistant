What's the best way to organize multiple subviews?

As someone who is fairly new to iPhone development, I've been trying to find good design patterns for managing multiple subviews, specifically where the subviews need the same type of delegate methods to be defined. For example, I have a view where I need to swap between 2 UITableViews based on user actions. Both UITableViews need a UITableViewControllerDelegate object defined to populate the rows, etc. Do you more experienced iPhone devs find that overloading the main view controller as the delegate for both subviews is the right way to do things? Currently I have 2 objects defined that each act as a delegate for each UITableView to try to keep things more organized. It accomplishes what I need it to, but is this a good pattern to follow? I would assume there are some best practices out there to avoid various pitfalls with memory management and fun things like that. Thanks in advance!
