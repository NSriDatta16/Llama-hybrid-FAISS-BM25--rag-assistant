How about trying formatting the experiment this way? 'product_id' | 'Year' | 'market_value' | 'retired' 01222 | 2015 | 20.0 | Yes 01222 | 2016 | 19.0 | Yes 01222 | 2017 | 18.0 | Yes 01222 | 2018 | 17.0 | Yes . . . . . . . . 01222 | 2021 | 12.0 | Yes Alternatively, a retired product must have experienced deterioration over the years. Thus assuming a linear pattern of deterioration starting 2015 until 2021 : 'product_id' | slope | y-intercept | 'retired' 01222 | 2 | 0 | Yes Furthermore, this data is "Panel data", a short time series per unique productid , not a regular time series problem. On that account, do not introduce the product id column at all to the neural network or ML when using that representation. You don't want it to treat every product separately! Instead, replace it with an integer value if possible, perhaps some product specifications. Finally, probably RNNs will not be most useful for this short panel data, perhaps CNNs (they can capture longitudinal patterns ) or maybe LSTNets.
