Start by creating a NSMutableURLRequest: NSMutableURLRequest *theRequest = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://…"]]; [theRequest setHTTPMethod:@"POST"]; [theRequest setCachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageNotAllowed]; [theRequest setTimeoutInterval:5.0]; [theRequest setHTTPBody:@"http body…"]; NSURLConnection *theConnection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:theRequest delegate:self]; if (!theConnection) { // Error… } and set the http body to the required xml message. To find out how that message has to look like, use the debug option of the Frontier client ( http://metacpan.org/pod/Frontier::Client ). Then implement the necessary Delegate Methods in your class. In your case I think the didReceiveResponse is sufficient as you dont't want to read more complex data. - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSHTTPURLResponse *)theResponse { if ([theRresponse statusCode] == 200) { // Everything is fine… } } Good luck! cmitt
