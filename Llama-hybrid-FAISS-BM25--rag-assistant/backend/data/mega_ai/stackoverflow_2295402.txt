Sean, I have struggled with the same thing. I ended up putting a copy of applicationContext.xml in test/resources/META-INF/spring and modifying the line below: In that 'test' directory the property place holder points to, i have put another database.properties which configures hsqldb. Finally, I had to have a different copy of persistence.xml which configures the SQL Dialect (also in applicationContext.xml) I suppose that a more elegant solution through use of pom.xml magic is possible, but for now this seemed like an acceptable solution to me.
