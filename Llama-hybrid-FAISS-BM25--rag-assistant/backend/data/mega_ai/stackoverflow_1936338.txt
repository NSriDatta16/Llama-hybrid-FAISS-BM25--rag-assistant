How do I make a side-scrolling iPhone app?

I am working on a side-scrolling iPhone app, and I have every resource, except the actual side scrolling part! How do I make an app so that it side-scrolls? To be more specific, I want the view of the app to scroll when a UIImageview(player) hits the right/left border of the screen. I am extremely sorry for all of this confusion! All I am making is a SAMPLE iPhone app only to be used in the simulator. In the app, I have a UIImaageview that moves when you touch arrow UIImageviews. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL INFORMATION SAID BEFORE THIS SENTENCE WORKS PERFECTLY! Now, my problem is that I want the UIView to scroll only ONE picture(this means it doesn't go forever ;)). I have tried using a UIScrollView, but that didn't work. Finally, I am not planning to use Cocos2D or any other game engine besides a basic UIview. This is only a test app, not a coding extravaganza...
