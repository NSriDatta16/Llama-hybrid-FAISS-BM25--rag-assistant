Calculating a 12-month moving average of weekly series, but anchored at the last day of the month

I have a zoo object oi.zoo with weekly data. I would like to sooth this with a 12-month moving average (easy enough), but I can't figure out how to anchor the right edge of the the moving average window at the end of the month (to correspond with the on which factors I am regressing). For example: > head(oi.zoo) 1986-01-15 1986-01-31 1986-02-14 1986-02-28 1986-03-14 1986-03-31 2966182 2986748 2948045 2990979 2993453 2936038 > head(mkt) 1926-07-31 1926-08-31 1926-09-30 1926-10-31 1926-11-30 1926-12-31 2.62 2.56 0.36 -3.43 2.44 2.77 I have some other factors and plan on using dynlm to regress. Thanks!
