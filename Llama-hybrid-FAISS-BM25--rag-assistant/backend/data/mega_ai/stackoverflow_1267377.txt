Yes, there are lots of great programmers who practice unit testing. How about Martin Fowler, Robert C "Uncle Bob" Martin, Michael Feathers, and of course Kent Beck. The question is not "Does Jon Skeet practice unit testing" it's could YOU work on Jon Skeet's code and know if you broke it or not? Could you work on your own code you wrote two years ago and know if you broke it or not? and finally...exactly how many QA people do you have at your office? and how much time do you spend with software in QA not generating money for you? How fast can you identify bugs? Unit testing is something we do to move the cost of developing software up to the beginning, when its cheaper, before 20 QA people start looking at it and before you loose a customer because you could not fix a bug fast enough. I know I would never hire a developer who thought they were above unit testing, even if they were the most kick ass programmer in the world. Because If he was hit by a bus tomorrow where would I find someone with the exact same brain?
