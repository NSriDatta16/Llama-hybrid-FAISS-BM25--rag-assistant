Most recent tag before tip in mercurial

I mark releases with hg tag . When I release a bugfix, I don't want to increment the version number, but I want to use the most recent version number during the build process. If I run hg tags , it will show tip first, then the version numbers in descending order. I can get it running hg tags | head -n2 | tail -n1 . I wonder if there is a more elegant, pure mercurial way to get it.
