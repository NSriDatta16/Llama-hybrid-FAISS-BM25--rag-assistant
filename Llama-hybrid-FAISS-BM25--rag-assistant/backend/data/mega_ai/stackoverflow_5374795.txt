Core Data, sorted search â€” is it possible?

In my application i have to search for strings from an array of NSStrings in an array fetched by a core data request. The fetched array contains about 30,000 entries (and it is bound to grow), and the strings array can be up to hundreds of thousands of strings. What i do now is select all the strings from the Core Data storage, and loop through the strings array, create an NSPredicate and use it to filter the Core Data fetched array. I thought that if i sort both of the arrays beforehand that would allow to narrow down each consequent search, but is it possible at all to search an array beginning from a certain position using a predicate? Best regards, Timofey.
