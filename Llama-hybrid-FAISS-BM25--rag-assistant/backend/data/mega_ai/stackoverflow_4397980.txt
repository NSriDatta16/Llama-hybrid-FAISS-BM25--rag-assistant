I'm making a game with my friend. Now there is a question about levels. First version was built with XML. There is a few reasons I don't like it: too much data and there were some problems with parser we used. We are using Boost so I decided to look at json-parser . The structure is much smaller and optimized. What do you think, isn't this too radical to change from powerful xml to simple json? Would it be enough of json-structure power to organize big game-level with a lot of extra-data and attributes?
