Variance of the sum of N correlated random variables with equal variance

According to this Wikipedia article, In general, the variance of the sum of $n$ variables is the sum of their covariances. So if the variables have equal variance ${\sigma}^2$ and the average correlation of distinct variables is $\rho$ , then the variance of their mean is, $$ \text{Var}(\overline{x}) = \frac{{\sigma}^2}{n} + \frac{n-1}{n} \rho {\sigma}^2 $$ So if $n=2$ with $\rho=1$ , then $\text{Var}(\overline{x}) = \sigma^2$ . I'm struggling to see how this formula relates to the one below, $$ {\sigma_{x+y}}^2 = {\sigma_x}^2 + {\sigma_y}^2 + 2 \rho {\sigma_x}{\sigma_x} $$ In this case if $\sigma_x = \sigma_y$ then $\sigma_{x+y} = 2\sigma_x$ . How can I relate these two formulas in the $n=2$ case where $\sigma_x = \sigma_y$ ? Thanks in advance.
