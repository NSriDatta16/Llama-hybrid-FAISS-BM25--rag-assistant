Get files from a given URL on the basis of pattern passed using Perl on Unix

I have been told that a given URL contains several xml and text files and I need to download all the xml files starting with AAA(that is AAA*.xml) inside a given directory. Credentials to access that URL are provided to me. Please not that size of xml files could be in GBs. I have used below code to achieve the same- use strict; use warnings; use LWP; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $username ='scott'; my $password='tiger'; # Create HTTP request object my $req = HTTP::Request->new( GET => "https://url.com/"); # Authenticate the user $req->authorization_basic( $username , $password); my $res = $browser->request( $req , ':content_file' => '/fold/AAA1.xml'); print $res->status_line, "\n"; It prints 200 OK status but I am not able to get the file. Any suggestions? Man
