As others have pointed out, it sounds like the browser is caching the redirect; there are various types of HTTP redirect, and depending upon the status code, the browser may or may not be allowed to cache the redirect. You could try altering the response code to issue a 303 See Other , which is a type of redirect that user agents aren't supposed to cache. For example: header( 'Location: http://www.example.com', true /* overwrite */, 303 ); For more information about HTTP redirect codes, take a look at the HTTP 1.1 specification ; specifically section 10.3, which deals with redirection.
