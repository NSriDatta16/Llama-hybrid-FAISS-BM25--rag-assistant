The plugin you would like to have would have to be on the client side (Obviously if you do not trust people having access to the hosted repository). Any strong cryptographic algorithm generates big variations in the output from very similar input (due to their high entropy). That means even if you would have a solution: it would be a disaster in terms of performance, both computation time and storage space requirements and network bandwidth use, and a disaster in feature loss: server side diffs would be broken for example, you would have to make all operations on the completely decrypted files on the client side. Weak encryption (mangling the charset for example, that would make diffs usable again) is not safe especially with source code, where braces and brackets and from there loops and any other letters can be extremely quickly decoded. I hope this proves that going this way is not leading to any possible practical solution. Maybe I am missing something. I am looking forward to reading interesting comments on my answer! :-)
