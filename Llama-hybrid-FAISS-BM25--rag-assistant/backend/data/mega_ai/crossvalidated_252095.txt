Sequence classification via Neural Networks

What exact kind of architecture of neural networks do I need for a sequence binary/multiclass classification? The sequences can be of different length and are to be discriminated by a certain occurrence of smaller subsequences in it. It would be great if you can provide Lasagne/Keras layers setup and their parameters. Thanks.
