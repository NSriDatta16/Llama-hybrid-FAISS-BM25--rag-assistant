As far as I know, the R version of randomForest calls the same Fortran code as the original version. Furthermore, it's trivial to parallelize the randomForest function. It's actually one of the examples provided in the foreach documentation . library(foreach) library(randomForest) rf Given that random forests are embarrassingly parallel, the biggest optimization you can make is running them in parallel. After that, I don't think there's any other low-hanging fruit in the algorithm, but I could be wrong. The only issue is that you lose the out-of-bag error estimate in the combined forest, but there's probably a simple way to calculate it (I'd actually love to find out how to do this).
