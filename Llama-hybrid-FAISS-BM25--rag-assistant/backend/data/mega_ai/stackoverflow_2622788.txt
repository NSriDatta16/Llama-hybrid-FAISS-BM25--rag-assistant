You need to call shutdown-agents to kill the threads backing the threadpool used by pmap. About pfilter , it should work but run slower than filter , since your predicate is simple. Parallelization isn't free so you have to give each thread moderately intensive tasks to offset the multithreading overhead. Batch your items before filtering them.
