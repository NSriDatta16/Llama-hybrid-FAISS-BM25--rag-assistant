Here is the basic idea for the GC. ========================================== Every application has a set of roots. Roots identify storage locations, which refer to objects on the managed heap or to objects that are set to null. For example: -- All the global and static object pointers in an application. -- Any local variable/parameter object pointers on a thread's stack. -- Any CPU registers containing pointers to objects in the managed heap. -- Pointers to the objects from Freachable queue The list of active roots is maintained by the just-in-time (JIT) compiler and common language runtime, and is made accessible to the garbage collector's algorithm
