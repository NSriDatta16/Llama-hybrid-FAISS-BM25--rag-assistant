I'd recommend reading the two Pragmatic Programmer books on SVN and CVS called " Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS " and " Pragmatic Version Control Using Subversion ". Both are excellent resources full of recipes describing what you want to do rather than the nuts and bolts descriptions of technology itself in the books previously mentioned. HTH cheers, Rob
