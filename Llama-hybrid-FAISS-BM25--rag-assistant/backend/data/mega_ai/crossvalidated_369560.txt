How do we compare different models performance

I am doing some research work regarding deep learning, I have a model and now I want to know and compare how my model performs as compared to others existing model.(like capsule networks, CNN ets..) I have no idea of about how to evaluate model performance:- Que 1. For how many epochs and for what batch size(lets say for mnist digits dataset) do I need to train my model? Que 2. Is there any time condition to train my model, or I can train my model for same no of epochs as other models? Like lets say comparisons have been made after training models for 1 hour. Or is there any condition that I have to train my model for particular amount of time(like 1 hour)? Que 3. What is the state of the art accuracy and error for mnist dataset today? Que 4. How do we calculate error? Thanks for helping :)
