Wine like for Android

I am pondering the idea of a Wine-ish compatibility layer on Android. The idea is to run Symbian apps on it as both OSes share ARM hardware. I have no knowledge of Symbian but I think that given the hardware capabilities of Android devices this could be done with less effort than Wine's windows emulation. What would be the most significant difference to overcome in this emulator? (threading, storage, ...)
