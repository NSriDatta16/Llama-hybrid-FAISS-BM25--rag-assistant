you don't need measure theory. Measure theory is used by mathematicians to justify other mathematical procedures eg taking limits of integrals approximations. Most engineers would not have studied measure theory, they would just use the results. The math knowledge required for ML is roughly characterised by being able to integrate a multivariate Gaussian- If you are confident about that then you probably have the multivariable calculus,linear algebra and probability theory background necessary. I would recommend Think Stats by Allen Downey - which aims to teach probability/statistics to programmers. The idea is to leverage programming expertise to do simulations and therefore understand probability theory/statistical methods. allen downey blog (he has written others ) Think stats (free) pdf )
