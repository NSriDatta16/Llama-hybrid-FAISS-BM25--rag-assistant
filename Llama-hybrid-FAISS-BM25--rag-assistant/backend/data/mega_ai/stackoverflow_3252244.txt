I totally think you should go down the path of splitting the the runs before and after the Content Control that you want to replace with a table into seperate paragraphs. It's only really error prone if you give Word a reason to have weird runs though. Like I wants a new thing will be three runs because wants is syntactically incorrect in this sentence and Word will flag that as dirty and unless/until you choose in Word to correct it or to ignore it, it will remain three runs. That's the only issue I would foresee. However, if you've got a strategy around that (like forcing users to spell-check their documents), the rest is certainly doable. If you're not familiar with Eric White's blog, it will be your best friend when developing with the Open XML SDK in Word. For example, these articles alone should answer most/all of your questions about how to use functional transformation to parse, insert and replace.
