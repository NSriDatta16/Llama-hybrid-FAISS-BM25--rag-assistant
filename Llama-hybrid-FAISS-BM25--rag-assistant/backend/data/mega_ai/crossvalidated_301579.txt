Language Model compare probability scores between Length varying sentence

My question is : How can I compare Language Model( LM ) score for two sentences with different lengths ? Probabilities are , and since LM scores for a sentence are multiple of probability of bigram or trigram, depending upon it's a bigram or trigram model, the probability of scores of longer sentences will mostly be smaller. So, how should I normalize the value of scores according to length ? I am pretty sure, atmost everyone after reading LM would have had same doubt. But I couldn't find much on internet. Would appreciate for any leads on this.
