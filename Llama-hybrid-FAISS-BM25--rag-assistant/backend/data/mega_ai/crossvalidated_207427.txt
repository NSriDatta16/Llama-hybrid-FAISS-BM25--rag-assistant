Confused with the reference level in logistic regression in R

I am confused with the answer from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23282048/logistic-regression-defining-reference-level-in-r It said if you want to predict the probability of "Yes", you set as relevel(auth$class, ref = "YES") . However, in my experiment, if we have a binary response variable with "0" and "1". We only get the estimation for probability of "1" when we set relevel(factor(y),ref="0") . n |z|) (Intercept) 5.324099 1.0610921 5.017565 5.233039e-07 x 2.767035 0.7206103 3.839849 1.231100e-04 model2 |z|) (Intercept) 5.324099 1.0610921 5.017565 5.233039e-07 x 2.767035 0.7206103 3.839849 1.231100e-04 I think if we want to get probability of "Yes", we should set relevel(auth$class, ref = "No") , am I correct? And what is reference level here means? Actually, what is glm() to predict in default if we use response other than "0" and "1"?
