Okay so looks like this needs to be done using two statements: Dim MostRecentShareDates = _ From s2 In query_collection.DBContext.ShareInfos _ Where s2.ShareDate I tried using the 'Let' keyword to embed the first statement into the second, but that would not compile either. Now the nice thing about this is the Linq has delayed execution, so until you traverse the collection returned by the second statement, no SQL gets generated. Linq is then smart enough to combine the two code fragments into one SQL statement, essentially exactly the same statement as I wrote in my original SQL above.
