Computing Sampling Cost Tradeoff

I'm working with a Bayesian Optimization problem where the accuracy of sampled data varies based on sampling cost (low-uncertainty data is expensive, high-uncertainty data is cheap). What kinds of approaches are there for quantifying this trade-off, and making decisions about what is the best balance between sampling cost and data accuracy? And what is the name/term for this kind of analysis? I'm not familiar with this topic so I don't know what to search for.
