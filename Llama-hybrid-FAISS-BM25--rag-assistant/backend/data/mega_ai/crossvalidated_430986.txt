Short term(10 mins period) forecast using ARIMA

I have 14 months(01/07/2018 to 30/08/2019) of one minute data, which I have aggregated to 10 mins block. So I have a data of dimension "61056 * 350". From this I am using 12 months of data to train the model and 2 months of data to validate it. I am using R version 3.6.0 to build my model. I want to forecast the temperature for all 144 time points for next day using the data till previous day. Let's say I want to forecast temperature for 12/10/2019 (00:00 -23:59) using data till 10/10/2019 23:59. After building my model using data till 30/06/2019, how can I do that? I am using the following method to build my model. library(data.table) library(tseries) library(astsa) library(forecast) #reading the dataset dataset $Time) Time)>"2019-07-01",] #converting the DV into a time series y EDIT: Removed two questions from this thread.
