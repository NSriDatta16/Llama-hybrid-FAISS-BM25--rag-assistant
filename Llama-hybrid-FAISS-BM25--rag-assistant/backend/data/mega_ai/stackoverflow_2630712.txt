I suggest buying a cheap Atom Mini-ITX board, some of which come with multi - 4+ RS232 ports. But with Serial->USB converters, this isn't really an issue. Just get an Atom. And if you have code, port your software to Linux. Here is a link to a Jetway Mini-Itx board , and a link to a 4 port RS232 expansion module for it. ~$170 total, some extra for memory, a disk, and a case and PSU. $250-$300 total. Now here is an Intel Atom Board at $69 to which you could add flash storage instead of drives, and USB-serial converters for any data collection you need to do. PC104 has a lot of value in maximizing the space used in 19" or 23" rackmount configurations - if you're not in that space, PC104 is a waste of your time and money, IMHO.
