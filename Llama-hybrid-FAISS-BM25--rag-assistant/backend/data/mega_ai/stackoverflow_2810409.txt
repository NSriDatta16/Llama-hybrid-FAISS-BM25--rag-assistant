To me it seems you're having two different questions. For the socket part, I suggest you use Beej's guide to socket programming if you want to have full control about what you do. If you don't want to/don't have the time to treat this part yourself, you can just use a C++ socket library as well. There are plenty of them; I only used this one so far, but others might be as just good (or even better). Regarding your parsing algorithm, you may first write down everything about the message format, so you'll have a strict guideline to follow. Then process step by step: First, extract the "first word" and just keep the following parameters in some list. Check if the first word is valid and if it is known. If the "first word" does not match with any of the predefined existing functions, just ignore the message (and eventually report the error to the client application). Once you have the matching function, simply call it passing the others parameters. This way, each function will do a specific task and your code will be splitted in an elegant way. Unfortunately, it is difficult for me to be any more explicit since we somehow lack of details here.
