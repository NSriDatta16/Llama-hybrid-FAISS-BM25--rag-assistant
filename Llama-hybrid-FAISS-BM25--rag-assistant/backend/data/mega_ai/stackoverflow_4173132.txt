If this is real world example and you need exact match on either name or surname then parse all string in second array and create new array with all parsed substrings and store index to original array's elements that the substring is part of: [ {"Maxwell", 0}, {"O'Flaherty", 0}, {"Robert", 1}, {"Jenkins", 1}, {"Mrs.", 2}, {"Smith", 2} ] Now you can find exact match, and know to what person it relates.
