The problem is you're enclosing $url in string literal 's. If you run curl_getinfo($curl_handle); you'll see the url it's requesting is http://$url which is obviously not valid. Array ( [url] => http://$url [content_type] => [http_code] => 0 [header_size] => 0 [request_size] => 0 [filetime] => -1 [ssl_verify_result] => 0 [redirect_count] => 0 [total_time] => 0 [namelookup_time] => 0 [connect_time] => 0 [pretransfer_time] => 0 [size_upload] => 0 [size_download] => 0 [speed_download] => 0 [speed_upload] => 0 [download_content_length] => -1 [upload_content_length] => -1 [starttransfer_time] => 0 [redirect_time] => 0 [certinfo] => Array ( ) ) EDIT Here is the updated code I'm using to test: This works for me. However, the only other problem I see that could prevent you from receiving data back is your insanely low connection timeout. Try setting it higher. Again, the above code does work. UPDATED AGAIN The reason you're recieving an error back is because the target site checks for a valid user agent. Something like: curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.15"); works just fine.
