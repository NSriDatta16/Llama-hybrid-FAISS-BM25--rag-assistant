The storage capacity of the Mnesia database for the different types of tables has been discussed in this previous SO question: What is the storage capacity of a Mnesia database? where a great answer is already available. Obviously (but I guess you've already seen it) the official doc is available at: http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/mnesia.html Also, reading from the Mnesia FAQ : 11.5 How much data can be stored in Mnesia? Dets uses 32 bit integers for file offsets, so the largest possible mnesia table (for now) is 4Gb. In practice your machine will slow to a crawl way before you reach this limit. Finally, Mnesia tables can be fragmented . This is discussed here and there . These are my 2p.
