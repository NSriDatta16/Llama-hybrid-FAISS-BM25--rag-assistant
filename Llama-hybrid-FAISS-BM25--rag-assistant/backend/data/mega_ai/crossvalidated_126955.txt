If your p-values are coming out of a table generated by STATA, R, SPSS, or something similar, than the p-values result from the following statistical test. $$ H_0: \beta = 0 $$ $$ H_a: \beta \neq 0 $$ $p > 0.05$ means that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the %5 level. In certain areas of applied statistics it is important to include non-significant terms when they are correlated with significant terms. This is because for a regression model with $k$ independent variables to be consistent and unbiased; it is necessary that for every $i$ observation $$ E(u_i\,|\,x_{i,1},x_{i,2},...,x_{i,k}) = 0 $$ where $u$ is the residual term. This is known as "conditional mean independence" or "zero conditional mean". It means that for any given values of the $x$'s, the average of the residuals is the same and therefore it must equal the average value in the entire population. A proof of this fact involves the use of probability limits and linear algebra, and I will refrain from showing this here. Some good references are http://w3.uniroma1.it/belloc/Introduction%20and%20SLR.pdf which discusses issues with violating "conditional mean independence" and http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics2010.pdf pg 68-69 which walks through a proof of regression consistency (both are for econometric application). Take the following example, suppose y followed the below process: $$ y=\beta_0 + x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2 + \varepsilon $$ Where the $\beta$'s are the true coefficient values and $\varepsilon$ is a disturbance term. If we omit $x_2$ then the resulting model would be $$ y=\beta_0 + x_1\beta_1 + w $$ Where $w= x_2\beta_2 + \varepsilon $. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are correlated then $$ E(w_i\,|\,x_{i,1}) \neq 0 $$ So linear regression of $y$ on a constant and $x_1$ would not be a consistent estimator of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. This is called omitted variable bias. Since in practice we do not know the $\beta$ terms, we refrain from omitting insignificant terms to avoid the above bias and inconsistency.
