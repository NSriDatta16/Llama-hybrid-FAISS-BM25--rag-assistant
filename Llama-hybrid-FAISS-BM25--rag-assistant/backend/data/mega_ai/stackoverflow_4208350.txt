There are no widely-accepted rules about organising the code in a C++ app. I, for example, prefer using namespaces, creating a separate folder for each namespace and putting all the headers and sources related to that namespace into the corresponding folder, thus the project root contains only the file with main(), makefile, and possibly a couple of other files. However, others might have different preferences.
