Difficult to find comprehensive instruction for Magento 1.4 with theming changes and local.xml, however there's possibly a bug with the columns in grid view as noted here: http://www.lotusseedsdesign.com/blog/change-grid-view-column-4-product-listing I got by with this in local.xml for a one column page/4 column grid: empty 4 one_column 4
