Regarding your main points: "obvious advantage of DVCS": it bears repeating that, especially in an academic environment with potentially strict IT rules for not allowing external connection, the DVCS allows working with a local repository. That means you do not have to be "connected" to one central repo to access the full history of a project, and that right there could be the main contribution of DVCS to scientific programmers. But that also mean you must have some kind of policy in order to allow any given work to "come together" and be consolidated into one repository, which does not mean there will be only one "central" base: one could imagine several central repos for several big projects. Still, that require administration (not to be under-estimated). And that "consolidation" process can be quite difficult due to your main first point: branching: the student need to branch carefully (since it is so easy). I saw my share of branch named 'toto', 'Monday', 'myName', ...: once published into another (more central) repo, what are we supposed to do with those ? If 20+ branches are to be merges in order to finalize one common code,... the process can become error-prone very quickly. Quick comments on your other points: deployment (what you call "pushing to server"): yes DVCS can be used for some kind of deployment, but that means you have organized your repo to include some kind of "release component" (the set of file you want to push on the server) and you have versionned them. And release management includes many other steps which cannot be all memorized in the DVCS, like for instance the de-variabilization process where you replace variable within configuration files with actual values adapted to the target server (port numbers, local paths, ...). You can attempt to manage those configuration files directly valued through branches, but in my experience it becomes quickly too complex to follow. collaboration: that is not reserved to DVCS. (VCS offer them too). Note that for some format (Word Document), their internal revision system could be more efficient.
