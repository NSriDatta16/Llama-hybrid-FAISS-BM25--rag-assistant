Should I create a heuristic that checks every column or is there a machine learning algorithm I can apply? I would go with unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. Use 'normal' data as training data and then predict what is normal and what is abnormal. Depending on your needs you can fine-tune the cut-off. One-class SVM should work. Or a combination of one-class SVM and SV Data-Description for possibly better results .
