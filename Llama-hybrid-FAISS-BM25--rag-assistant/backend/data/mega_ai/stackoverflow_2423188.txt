Changing the .ipa file artwork of compiled iPhone application

Just do following steps & you will understand what problem I am facing right now. Create a new project from template. File / New Project - Navigation based application. Create any 32 x 32 image (.png) from any image editor & name it as icon.png Drag that file to your applications resources. Compile & run your project on iPhone. iPhone application will have proper icone as we have placed icon.png file under resources. But the problem starts now. When ever we compile. There is a build directory under your project. go to "Debug-iphoneos" Select yourapplication.app Drag it under applications ( - iTunes - ) Application on iPhone has an iCon ( oops icon ) but it has no icon on iTunes Y? Why ? How to place an icon on iTunes ?
