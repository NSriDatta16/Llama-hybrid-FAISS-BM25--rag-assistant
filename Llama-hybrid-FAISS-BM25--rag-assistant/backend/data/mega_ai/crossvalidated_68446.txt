Do you know much about ARIMA modelling? The (fixed) data is suggesting to model A as and ARIMA $(0,0,0) \times (1,0,1)_4$ process (i.e. with a seasonal autoregressive parameter and seasonal moving average parameter at lag 4). The other two series are approximately stationary. So going by the Box-Jenkins methodology (yes I know there are problems with it), you should be able to fit the above ARIMA model to A and then regress the residuals against the other two series. Sadly I'm only educated to MSc level, so maybe someone smarter than me might give fuller details. EDIT: Here is my R code if it helps, since you sound like you're new to R:- tsData although the arima fitting procedure is warning me about a convergence error.
