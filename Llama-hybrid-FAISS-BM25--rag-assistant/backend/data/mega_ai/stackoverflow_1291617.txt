I just created a test project with that line of code, and it works fine for me. It's not even case-sensitive, so that's not the problem. All I can assume is that you're outputting the path wrong, or the resource isn't there. When adding to Xcode, did you add the actual folder "plists" (by dragging it to the Resources group and choosing "Create Folder References for any added folders", for example)? Have you checked the compiled app's contents to see if the "plists" folder is actually there?
