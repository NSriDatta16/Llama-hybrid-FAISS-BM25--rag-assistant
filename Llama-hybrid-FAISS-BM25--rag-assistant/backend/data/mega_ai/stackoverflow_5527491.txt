I would start by figuring out the answer by hand to say a half dozen or so... then model how you did the problem in a program... Then after you have a working "brute force" answer try to solve the problem more elegantly. I would start this problem by trying to put as many of the bigest size tiles in first then fill in where you can with the next bigest size that will fit. then smaller... until filled. You might use Arrays or arrays to spacially keep track of the filled in space... however I suspect there is an easier way to do this via some simple calculations... like taking the dimensions and take the smaller of the two and utilizing log base 2 or something like that... I am sure there is a nice neat recursive solution.. base on the powers of two .. then you could unravel that into a non-recursive solution...
