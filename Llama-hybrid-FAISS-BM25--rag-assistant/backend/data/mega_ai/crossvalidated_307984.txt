Forecasting with AR model and differenced time series

I want to n-step ahead forecast a time series with the AR(4) model and a first order differenced time series. Now my question is, if I get the concept right. Im assuming, I have to do the following equations but I am not sure The model itself: X(t)-X(t-1)=a(1) (X(t-1)-X(t-2))+...+a(4) (X(t-4)-X(t-5)) => X(t)=X(t-1)+a(1) (X(t-1)-X(t-2))+...+a(4) (X(t-4)-X(t-5)) First forecast: X(t+1)-X(t)=a(1) (X(t)-X(t-1))+...+a(4) (X(t-3)-X(t-4)) => X(t+1)=X(t)+a(1) (X(t)-X(t-1))+...+a(4) (X(t-3)-X(t-4)) Second forecast: X(t+2)-X(t+1)=a(1) (X(t+1)-X(t))+...+a(4) (X(t-2)-X(t-3)) => X(t+2)=X(t+1)+a(1) (X(t+1)-X(t))+...+a(4) (X(t-2)-X(t-3)) and so on. Am i right with that?
