to my opinion: as so as "Residuals in a statistical or machine learning model are the differences between observed and predicted values of data." - you can always plot these differencies manually when evaluating your model at test_ds (or even train_ds). If see any pattern (e.g. parabolic trend) - improve your model (e.g. add one more dense layer to input this non-linearity in model's consideration). Improve your model till achieving main characteristics of a good residual plot: high density of points close to the origin and a low density of points away from the origin It should be symmetric about the origin == in order to completely capture the predictive information of the data in your model (of course, you would better take into consideration residual plots as well as metrics you have chosen) P.S. at least striving to achieve Brier score=0. Most is said by proper scoring rules used to evaluate your model (though not everything) P.P.S. of course, they could not be i.i.d. always as so as not always you're modelling (with ML) normally distributed var. But in order to get unbiased regression - of course you need normality of residuals. Otherwise, identify the degree of non-normality in residuals and try to diagnose the problem. == for the adequacy of the model. ( here and here , OR here )
