Embedded nosql open source java database

I'm developing an open source product and need an embedded dbms. Can you recommend an embedded open source database that ... Can handle objects over 10 GB each Has a license friendly to embedding (LGPL, not GPL). Is pure Java Is (preferably) nosql. Sql might work, but prefer nosql I've looked over some of the document DBMSs, like mongodb, but they seem to be limited to 4 or 16 mb documents. Berkeley DB looked attractive but has a GPL like license. Sqlite3 is attractive: good license, and you can compile with whatever max blob size you like. But, it's not Java. I know JDBC drivers exist, but we need a pure Java system. Any suggestions? Thanks Steve
