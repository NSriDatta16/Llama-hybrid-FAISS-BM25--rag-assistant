Retry-after HTTP response header - does it affect anything?

If I want to politely refuse service on a web site due to temporary overload, the HTTP response 503 Service Unavailable seems appropriate. The spec mentions sending a Retry-after header with the 503. Is there any point? Does Retry-after affect anything? Do browsers pay any attention to it?
