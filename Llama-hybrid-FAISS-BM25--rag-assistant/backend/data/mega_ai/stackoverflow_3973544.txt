Regular expression remove tag after a paragraph with a given class

Is there a way to select all tags that follow a paragraph with a given class? i.e. This is a paragraph There may be other in the HTML so I cannot use this: br {display:none;} and I cannot delete all tags. If there is a way to select these particular tags then I can use CSS. There are about 700 pages and I do not want to go through each of them to make sure if the is needed or not. I do know that it is not needed following a paragraph with the class of "myclass". If there is no way to select these tags then I think that I can use BBEdit to do the search and replace using a regular expression. But I don't know how to write the RE that would work. TIA, Linda
