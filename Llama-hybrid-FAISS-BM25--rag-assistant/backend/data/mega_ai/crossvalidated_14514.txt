You could start with something simple like finding principle components or independent components . You could also get a little crazy and generate all the 2-way interactions of your variables. Obviously, as you generate and test more features, you need a feature selection algorithm that is more robust against overfitting. Some modeling algorithms, like MARS , random forests, and non-linear SVMs automatically find certain interactions among your original features.
