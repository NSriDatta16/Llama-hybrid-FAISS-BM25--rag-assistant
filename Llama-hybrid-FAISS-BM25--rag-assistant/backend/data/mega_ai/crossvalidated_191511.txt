There are different ways to do a prediction analysis or a regression if you want and maybe the answer to your question is a bit too broad. You can do a classical regression with linear or non-linear model, which i think is what you have done. You can do a regression with a Bayesian approach if you want to weight more your "a-priori knowledge": Wiki You can have a machine-learning approach: Wiki You can apply non-parametric methods if you don't know the population distribution: Wiki You can apply robust regression methods: Wiki I think there is some material here to start investigating your answer
