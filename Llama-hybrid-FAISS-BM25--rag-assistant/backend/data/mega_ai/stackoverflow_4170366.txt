Invalid jQuery dialog

Why is the dialog only draggable within the viewpoint? A simple div element may be draggable outside the viewpoint (please see the picture at savepic.net/187084.jpg); what I am looking for is to make the dialog draggable outside the viewpoint too. What is the option to provide? Please consider the code at http://jsfiddle.net/MwXKE/
