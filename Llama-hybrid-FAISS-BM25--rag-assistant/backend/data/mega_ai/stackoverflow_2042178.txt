Chrome and Safari XSLT using JavaScript

I have the following code that applies a XSLT style Test.Xml.xslTransform = function(xml, xsl) { try { // code for IE if (window.ActiveXObject) { ex = xml.transformNode(xsl); return ex; } // code for Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, etc. else if (document.implementation && document.implementation.createDocument) { xsltProcessor = new XSLTProcessor(); xsltProcessor.importStylesheet(xsl); resultDocument = xsltProcessor.transformToFragment(xml, document); return resultDocument; } } catch (exception) { if (typeof (exception) == "object") { if (exception.message) { alert(exception.message); } } else { alert(exception); } } The code is working in IE and firefox but not in Chrome and Safari. Any ideas why? Update ResultDocument = xsltProcessor.transformToFragment(xml, document); The line above is returning null. No error is being thrown. Update The code is not working as the xslt file contains xsl:include. Need to find a way to get the include working I will paste progress here Update It has been recomended that I use the http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Transform/ plugin. I am trying to use the client side libary as the example of include works here ( http://daersystems.com/jquery/transform/ ). The code works in IE but still not in chrome. Test.Xml.xslTransform = function(xml, xsl) { try { $("body").append(" "); var a = $("#test").transform({ xmlobj: xml, xslobj: xsl }); return a.html(); } catch (exception) { if (typeof (exception) == "object") { if (exception.message) { alert(exception.message); } } else { alert(exception); } } } xml and xsl are both objects being passed in. Update I tried changing the XSL file to being something very simple with no include and Chrome is still not applying the stylesheet and IE is. The XSL that is being brought in as an object is: test Update The end result that I want is for the xsl to be applied to the xml file. The xsl file has in it includes. I want the trasnfer to happen on the client ideally. Updated Rupert could you update the question with the xml and how you're calling Test.Xml.xslTransform ? I got the xml using ie8 The code is being called as follows: xsl = Test.Xml.loadXMLDoc("/_layouts/xsl/xsl.xslt"); var doc = Test.Xml.xslTransform(xData.responseXML, xsl); xData is the xml returned by a web service.
