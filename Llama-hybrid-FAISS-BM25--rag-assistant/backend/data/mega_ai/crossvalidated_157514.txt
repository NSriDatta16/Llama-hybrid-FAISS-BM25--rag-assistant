What you suggest implies to estimate a gigantic number of parameters to say the least. Unless you have a more than huge dataset you should avoid this technique. Why not simply log-transform your score ? It follows that you consider the size of the ratio on your score. 2100 for 2800 would be as bad as $700*21/28=525$ for $700$ which seems more appropriate. If you have scores with 0, I would (unconfidently) suggest to translate the whole scoring from 1 to avoid a problem.
