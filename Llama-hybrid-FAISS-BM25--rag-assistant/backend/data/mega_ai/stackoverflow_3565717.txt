jquery clone doesn't seem to retain draggable/droppable events

I have a row where I can drag items into it, and sort them. This all works ok. I even have a delete event on each item, so it can be removed from the row. I want an option where I can clone the row. I do this by using the clone function below: clonedrow = $("#row1").clone(true); clonedid = "row"+nextRowNumber; //nextRowNumber is a variable calculated by counting the rows that exist already. clonedrow.attr("id",clonedid).insertAfter("#row1"); This all works, apart from the fact the draggable/sortable events in 'row1' are not copied to the cloned row. Am I doing something wrong? I thought by adding 'true' it copies the events...? FWIW when loading the page, I have a function which automatically builds the first row, and applies the draggable/sortable/delete events to it...
