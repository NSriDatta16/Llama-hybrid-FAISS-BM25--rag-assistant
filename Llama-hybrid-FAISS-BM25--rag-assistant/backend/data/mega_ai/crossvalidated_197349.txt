Can frequentists use Bayes theorem?

I understand that Bayesians interpret probability as belief, which can be updated with evidence. We happen to compute the posterior with Bayes theorem. What is the difference between Bayes Theorem and Bayesian Statistics? Are they just named after the same guy? Can a frequentist approach incorporate Bayes theorem (not for updating the probability)?
