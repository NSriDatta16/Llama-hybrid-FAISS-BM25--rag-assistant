Summing Differently-Distributed, Correlated Random Variables

I have four mutually correlated time series. Each contains 40 observations but is fundamentally and decisively differently distributed from its peers. The first series follows a Laplace distribution, whereas the second series follows a log-normal distribution, while the third series follows a Levy distribution, and the fourth follows Johnson's Bounded distribution. I also have another set of data that follow an ARIMA process. My task is to find the 99% and 99.9% bounds (which means I can't just re-sample from the original series) of the product of a) the sum of the simulated four data series and b) simulations from the ARIMA process. My question is this: How can I sum across such differently distributed, yet-correlated processes and multiply them by yet another differently-distributed process? Is this even feasible? Please note that I must use Python (with which I am more than comfortable) for this project. While I remain comfortable with stochastic processes, my linear algebra is a bit rusty, as it's been 10 years since I've dealt with eigenvectors / eigenvalues. Thank you for your time and kind assistance!
