performance of random forest with the size of dataset?

I have two datasets (with 17 features) for the same domain. the first is smaller in size than the second, and a prediction task. I've first tried with several Neural networks configurations, the results were as expected, NNs performed better with the second dataset (the larger one). When I have tried the Random Forest, I've found that it performed much better with the smallest dataset, which I can not understand or explain, because they said that random forest is data-hungry and that Bootstrap resampling is not a cure for small samples. Can someone explain to me these results?
