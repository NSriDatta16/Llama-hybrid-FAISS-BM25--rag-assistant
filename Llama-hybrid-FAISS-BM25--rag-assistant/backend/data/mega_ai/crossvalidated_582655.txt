In your second referred post ( PCA scores in a for portfolio replication task: stumble over mean-centering question ), @ttnphns, you provide an example with centered Principal Components (denoted as PC) and decentered Principal Components (denoted as dePC) . The there provided data matrix also exemplifies my intended use case. In my use case, the higher V1 or V2 are, the better. Attaching a screenshot with the data matrix from the example and with the higher of the two variables per row, i.e. either V1 and V2 or PC1 and PC2 or dcPC1 and dcPC2, marked with a green background. We can see that while the decentered components dePC1 and dePC2 seem to reflect the magnitude from V1 and V2 (given how the load on them), more closely than the centered PC1 and PC2. For the Factor Analysis I'm still not sure how to compute the uncentered Factors mathematically correctly.
