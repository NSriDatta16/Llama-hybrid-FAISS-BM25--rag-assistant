There are circumstances where such a thing might be made to work - assuming you can supply suitable predictors to your logistic regression, but (i) dichotomizing the spread may be less useful than leaving it continuous (ii) I think formal hypothesis testing is a bad idea for assessing model assumptions, since it doesn't answer a useful question (imagine, in large samples, a very small trend in spread - it might be highly significant, but really quite unimportant in terms of its impact on the inference in the original model). More important to think about the effect-size ( how much impact on our inference? ) rather than the significance ( is our sample size large enough to detect it? ). We almost never satisfy the assumptions exactly , and we don't gain anything from testing what we already know - either we reject, which tells us nothing more than what we knew before, or we don't, which only tells us our sample size was to small to detect what we already know to be the case. Neither tells us how bad the failure of the assumptions might be for us.
