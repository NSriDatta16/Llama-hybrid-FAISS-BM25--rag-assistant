Ok sorry for uing the wrong terminology. I want to add the control into Visual Studio 2005's toolbox (or indeed Expression Blend's Asset Library) so that I can drag and drop it into any C# WPF applications I create. The problem is I don't know what the Expression Blend Keyspline control is called and how to get access to it (ie what dll to include as a reference)? I can try and go through Expression Blend's dll's etc searching for the control but I'm not sure A) that this will work, B) that its a bit long winded, C) what the licensing is for such controls.
