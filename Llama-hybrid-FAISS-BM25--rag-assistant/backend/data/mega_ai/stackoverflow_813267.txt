How to store special characters (', ", &, etc) in mysql database, so they can be searchable?

Im having a small problem with storage of special characters like quotes, double quotes and ampersands. I put every POST request through mysql_real_escape_string(), and when I add a string like "That '70s Show" it gets stored as "That &#x27;70s Show" in the mysql DB. When I echo it out, it works fine... but when I try to run a % $string % search for "That '70s Show" , it will not find the record. I have magic_quotes disabled. How can I get around this?
