I don't know if C# regex's are the same as perl, but if so, you probably want to escape the [ and ] characters. Also, there are extra characters in there. Try this: string pattern = "^servers\[i\]=\[\"(? .*)\", (.*), (? .*)\];$"; Edited to add : After wondering why my answer was downvoted and then looking at Val's answer, I realized that the "extra characters" were there for a reason. They are what perl calls "named capture buffers", which I have never used but the original code fragment does. I have updated my answer to include them.
