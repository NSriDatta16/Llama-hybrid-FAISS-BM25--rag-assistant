Avoid click event on a widget

Hello i have this widgets that i have to avoid the click event when i going to move them using DND and my question is how i can avoid the default behavior? My biggest problem is with the select widgets because shows the options and dissapear the widget. This is the code of the draggable element. $(elmnt).draggable({ cancel: null, scroll: true, scrollSensitivity: 100, refreshPositions: true }); BTW: I am using jQueryUI to make the draggable Thanks!!!
