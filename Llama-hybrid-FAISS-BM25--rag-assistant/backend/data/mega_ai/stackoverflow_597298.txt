This is a classic example of a problem that deserves an optimized solution rather than trying to solve for "The OPTIMUM". It's similar in some ways to the " Travelling Salesman Problem ", but you also need to segment the locations during the optimization. I've used three different optimization algorithms to good effect on problems like this: Simulated Annealing Great Deluge Algorithm Genetic Algoritms Using an optimization algorithm, I think you've described the following "goals": The geographic area for each paper boy should be minimized. The number of subscribers served by each should be approximately equal. The distance travelled by each should be about equal. (And one you didn't state, but might matter) The route should end where it began. Hope this gets you started! * Edit * If you don't care about the routes themselves, that eliminates goals 3 and 4 above, and perhaps allows the problem to be more tailored to your bonus requirements. If you take demographic information into account (such as population density, subscription adoption rate and subscription cancellation rate) you could probably use the optimization techniques above to eliminate the need to rerun the algorithm at all as subscribers adopted or dropped your service. Once the clusters were optimized, they would stay in balance because the rates of each for an individual cluster matched the rates for the other clusters. The only time you'd have to rerun the algorithm was when and external factor (such as a recession/depression) caused changes in the behavior of a demographic group.
