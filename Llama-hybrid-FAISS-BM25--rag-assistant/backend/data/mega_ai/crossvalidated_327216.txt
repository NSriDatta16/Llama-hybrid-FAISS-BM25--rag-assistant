"Ref" is shorthand for reference category . Whenever an independent variable consists of categories, logistic regression procedures (if using this particular sort of contrast -- an indicator contrast) will choose one category by default as the reference to which each other category is compared. Here, the odds of the outcome being "1" are estimated as being lower (0.57 as high) for North cases as for Downtown cases, all else being equal. The intercept (also known as the regression constant ) tells you nothing about the role of any independent variable, but it does serve a function in a predictive equation that can be derived from output like this. You can use the constant and the two other coefficients to assign to each observation a predicted probability of the outcome being "1", depending on that case's values for the independent variables.
