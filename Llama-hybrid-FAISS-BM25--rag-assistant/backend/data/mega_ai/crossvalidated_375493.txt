To test if a recent value or a set of recent values are "different from what was expected" ... I would construct a hybrid model using needed ARIMA structure and user-suggested causals and any empirically found Intervention Variables via Intervention Detection http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html using the historical data . If user specified causals are in play then this would be a Transfer Function . See Time Series Forecast / Transfer Function for an example. I would then add a dummy variable to the model which was based upon the historical data . I i had 100 observations in the past and I wished to test whether the 101'st observation was exceptional that would be series of 100 zeroes followed by a 1. The test for the new period effect would be based on the t value for this hand-crafted dummy indicator. In a similar fashion, if I wished to test whether a set of new values deviated from expectations the one handcrafted dummy series would have a set of '1' values not just a single "1'. An equally viable 1 step approach would be to use all the data ( say 101) values and investigate whether or not a pulse is found at the last point ( i.e. the 101'st value ). If it is found then one can conclude that there was an exceptional activity at that point. Confidence limits around a prediction might seem like a good approach but unless monte-carlo resampling (bootstrapping) is used symmetry assumptions are not normally ( joke here ! ) correct or useful.
