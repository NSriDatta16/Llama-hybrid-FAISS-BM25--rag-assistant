LaTeX "\indent" creating paragraph indentation / tabbing package requirement?

The LaTeX code provided below shows the usage of the command \indent as it appears in the document, but it does not produce the desired indentation within the document. Is there a specific package associated with the command \indent or \= ? IÂ´m asking for a step by step method of producing an indentation within a document for only one paragraph, regardless of location within the document. \documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{graphicx} \topmargin -3.5cm \oddsidemargin -0.04cm \evensidemargin -0.04cm \textwidth 16.59cm \textheight 21.94cm \parskip 7.2pt \parindent 8pt \title{Physics} \author{Pareshkumar Brahmbhatt} \date{March 17, 2010} \begin{document} \maketitle \indent Now we are engaged in a great civil war. \end{document}
