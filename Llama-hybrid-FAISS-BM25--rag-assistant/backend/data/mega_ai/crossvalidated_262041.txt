Calculating the evidence from an MCMC sample

I have a an MCMC sample file containing a list of points in parameter space. I have the value of the parameters in my model at each point, and the likelihood at each point. Of course I also have the prior ranges for each parameter. How can I calculate the model evidence? I mean it's just an integral of the likelihoods over all the parameters with. Can PYMC do it?
