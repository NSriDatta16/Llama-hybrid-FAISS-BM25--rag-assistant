Ruby: attr_accessor generated methods - how to iterate them (in to_s - custom format)?

I need a Class which has an semi-automatic 'to_s' method (to generate XML in fact). I would like to iterate through all the automatic methods set up in my 'attr_accessor' line: class MyClass attr_accessor :id,:a,:b,:c end c=MyClass.new So far I'm doing a basic: c.methods - Object.methods => ["b", "b=", "c", "c=", "id=", "a", "a="] I am facing a few challenges: 'id' may cause a slight headache - as Object already seems to have an 'id'. The 'c.methods' call above, returns Strings - I'm not getting any other meta-data ? (In Java 'method' is an object, where I could perform further reflection). I have one-to-many relationships I have to deal with ('c' is an array type of other object types). This is what I'm trying to do: I want to design a simple Object which has a 'to_s' which will build up an XML fragment: for instance. 1 Title Stuff .... And then inherit my data-classes from that simple object: so that (hopefully) I get a mechansim to build up an entire XML doc. I'm sure I'm re-inventing the wheel here as well...so other tried-and-tested approaches welcome.
