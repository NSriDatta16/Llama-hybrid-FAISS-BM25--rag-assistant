Include and Reference Resource File from C# class

I have an image that is used in some PDF files that my C# application generates. I know how to reference the image file when it is located in my workspace, but when I compile the program, I don't see the image anywhere in the compiled directory. Can someone tell me what happened to that file, or do I have to manually package the file along with my program when I send the program to the users? I added the image to the workspace by drag-drop to the resource directory of one of my namespaces.
