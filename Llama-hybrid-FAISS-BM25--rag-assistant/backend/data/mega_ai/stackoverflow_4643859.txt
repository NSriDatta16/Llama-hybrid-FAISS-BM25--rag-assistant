Visual Studio Advanced Query Builder MySql adding "def." before table names

From within the .xsd designer I drag a table from a MySql connection on the list and begin configure it. When I open the Advanced Query builder, The sql is changed from what was in the initial box select * from x; to select * from def.schema.x where schema is the actual schema and the problem is that I don't see where the def prefix is coming. MySql version 5.5.8, MySqlConnector 6.3.4, Visual Studio 2008, Windows 7 64. This same process was working fine on XP. Any ideas?
