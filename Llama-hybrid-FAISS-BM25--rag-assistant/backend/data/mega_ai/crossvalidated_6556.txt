The "failsafe" way to find a sufficient statistic in just about any problem: Calculate the Bayesian posterior distribution (up to prop constant) using a uniform prior. If a sufficient statistic exists, this method will tell you what it is. So basically, strip all multiplicative factors (those factors which do not involve your parameters , but may involve functions of the data) from your likelihood function. I would suggest that the "sum function" stuff is your sufficient statistic (although the notation was not clear at the time I answered this question). NOTE: the use of a uniform prior may make the posterior improper but it will show you what the functions are sufficient for your problem.
