First thing -- I wouldn't roll my own system here. Either wait for Windows or use an open source package. I think it's pretty inflammatory to cite this as an example of closed-source v. open source. It's an example of updating a section of a gigantic code base versus updating a very small one. It's an example of regression testing possibly thousands of dependencies versus regression testing the isolated library (it would be up to you to test your code against an open source library's changes). It's also an example of importance. If your application requires that the time zone be correct, then it would be better to have an implementation you can modify than to be at the mercy of Microsoft (basically an interpretation of "don't outsource your core business").
