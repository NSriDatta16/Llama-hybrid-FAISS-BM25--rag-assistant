VB.NET: Scrollbar "button"?

I plan on using a scrollbar for, well, scrolling an image. The image is 200x500, however, the only visible area is 200x250. So I set the max value to 250, and the min value to 0. The idea is that if I drag the scrollbar's button to the bottom, 250 pixels will have moved for the image, right? But wait, the scrollbar's button is.... very small. And the scrollbar is actually pretty long. Is there a way to make the scrollbar's button longer?
