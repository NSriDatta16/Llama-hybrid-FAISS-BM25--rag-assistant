Is RL applicable to environments that are totally RANDOM?

I have a fundamental question on the applicability of reinforcement learning (RL) on a problem we are trying to solve. We are trying to use RL for inventory management - where the demand is entirely random (it probably has a pattern in real life but for now let us assume that we have been forced to treat as purely random). As I understand, RL can help learn how to play a game (say chess) or help a robot learn to walk. But all games have rules and so does the ‘cart-pole’ (of OpenAI Gym) – there are rules of ‘physics’ that govern when the cart-pole will tip and fall over. For our problem there are no rules – the environment changes randomly (demand made for the product). Is RL really applicable to such situations? If it does - then what will improve the performance? Further details: - The only two stimuli available from the ‘environment’ are the currently available level of product 'X' and the current demand 'Y' - And the ‘action’ is binary - do I order a quantity 'Q' to refill or do I not (discrete action space). - We are using DQN and an Adam optimizer. Our results are poor - I admit I have trained only for about 5,000 or 10,000 - should I let it train on for days because it is a random environment? thank you Rajesh
