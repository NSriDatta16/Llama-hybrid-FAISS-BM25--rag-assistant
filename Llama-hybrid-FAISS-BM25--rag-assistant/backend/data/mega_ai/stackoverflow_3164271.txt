photologue django

I am trying to implement the photologue django photo gallery here: http://skam.webfactional.com/blog/2007/08/08/django-based-photo-gallery-tutorial/ I dont understand this part: You need to have the current user’s info outside requests, have a look at CookBookThreadlocalsAndUser and add the middleware in your “MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES” settings. Here the Link to CookBookThreadlocalsandUser: http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/CookBookThreadlocalsAndUser What Middleware do I have to install? What exactly is Threadlocals? Is it possible to install this without fully understanding Threadlocals: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage
