There's a lot of books out there for iPhone development, but you don't even need to buy one to get started. The Apple Developer sites iPhone Dev Center contains both reference material, and Getting Started guides, including coverage of Objective-C and some Mac development fundamentals like Cocoa and Foundation, which will come in handy on the iPhone OS too. If you already know Objective-C, the Head First iPhone Development book is a great read that gets you writing concrete apps quickly, although it's not suitable for someone new to programming in general. For a more thorough and comprehensive start, you might want to check out Apress' books, including 'Beginning iPhone 3 Development' and 'Lean Objective-C on the Mac'.
