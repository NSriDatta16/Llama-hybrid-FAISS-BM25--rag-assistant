I have given the same answer elsewhere, but I think it deserves its place here: In the late 90s I had to write several web sites in Informix Universal Server web blade (aka Illustra web blade) For anyone who doesn't know anything about this execrable environment, it forced you to use the most bizarre language I have ever come across. As Joel Spolsky described it When it did run, it proved to have the only programming language I've ever seen that wasn't Turing-equivalent, if you can imagine that. More on it here http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/illustra-tips.html And an example of a 'simple' if condition: cond=$(OR,$(NXST,$email),$(NXST,$name),$(NXST,$subject)) I wish I could find the full api document, as looking back now in hindsight it would be hilarious / unbelievable / tragic. One example of it's dire nature was the fact that it had no loops . Of any kind. It was possible to hack looping functionality by creating a query and iterating through its rows, but that is so wrong it makes me feel sick. edit: I've managed to find a complete code sample. Behold: WINSTART bug $WINSIZE $START $(IF,$( $(+,$BEGIN,$WINSIZE) $1 ,$BEGIN,1)"> Previous $WINSIZE Rows $(IF,$( ,$END,$WINSIZE),$(>=,$MI_ROWCOUNT,$WINSIZE))"> Next $WINSIZE Rows Prettify doesn't know how to colour it, quelle surprise
