Yes, I think a HAR model can be applied to time series other than realized volatility. It corresponds to a restricted autoregression*, and the restriction can be helpful if it reduces the model's variance more than it increases its (squared) bias. *The lower frequency autoregressive components could be expressed as sums of high-frequency autoregressive components, and then every component in the sum effectively shares the same slope coefficient in the model.
