I doubt any sane person would go this route these days, however some of what you describe could be done with Window's Structured/Compound Storage . I only mention this since you're asking about Windows - and this is/was an official Windows way to do this. This is how DOC files were put together (but not the new DOCX format). From MSDN it'll appear really complicated, but I've used it, it isn't the worst API in Win32. it is not simple it is fast, I would guess it's faster then the registry. Individual object's state can be read/written without needing to read some larger entity. There is no decent editor, however there are some real basic stuff (VC++ 6.0 had the "DocFile Viewer" under Tools. (yeah, that's what that thing did) I found a few more online. You get a file instead of registry keys. You gain some old-school Windows developer geek-cred. Other random thoughts: I think XML is the way to go (despite the random access issue). Heck, INI files may work. The registry gives you very fine grain security if you need it - people seem to forget this when the claim using files are better. An embedded DB seems like overkill if I'm understanding what you're doing.
