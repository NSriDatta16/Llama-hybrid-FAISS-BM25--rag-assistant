Even though you have no recorded death events (i.e. all your data is censored), you can still make inferences using survival analysis. However, there is a tradeoff: you won't be able to use any non-parametric or semi-parametric models. These include Kaplan Meier model and the Cox model. You are resigned to use a fully parametric model (not a bad thing!). For example, a Weibull, or a Gamma, or spline model. All these handle censoring of death events, even 100% censoring, and will provide coefficient estimates of your covariates, produce median survival times, etc. Software: in R, there is flexsurvreg in Stata, there is merlin in Python, there is lifelines (I'm the author) If you'd like, you can go one step further and include the prior information you have about lifespans - "mean is Bayesian parametric model. Basically, you choose priors on the unknown parameters that reflect your current knowledge about lifespans.
