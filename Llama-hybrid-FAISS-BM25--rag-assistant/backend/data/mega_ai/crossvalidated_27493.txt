While the Hauck-Donner effect is closely related to it, I think the problem in your case is (quasi)-complete separation. This refers to the phenomenon that a certain combination (including interactions) of predictors will give rise to a subset of the observations where you observe only zeros or ones (basically a combination of predictor values will separate the two classes). Then the maximum likelihood estimate will not exist (it will be infinite, which makes its standard error rather large too). This is what V&R write in the quote by @NRH. If you have many predictors, especially categorical ones, this just becomes more likely to happen for a particular combination of predictors. The HD effect then occurs for the Wald test in such a situation. A canonical treatment of qcs is Albert and Anderson 1984 article in Biometrika. You might want to look at the noverlap package (no longer on CRAN) in R which contains utilities to deal with quasi-complete separation, or the brglm package, that can deal with qcs.
