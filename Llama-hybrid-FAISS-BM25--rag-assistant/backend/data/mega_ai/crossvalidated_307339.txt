Hot deck imputation, ''it preserves the distribution of the item values'', how can that be?

I read in this link , under section 2, first paragraph about hot deck that ''it preserves the distribution of item values''. I do not understand that, if one and the same donor is used for a lot of recipients, then this may distort the distribution or do I miss something here ? Also, the result of Hot Deck imputation must depend on the matching algorithm used to match the donors to the recipients ? More general, does anyone know references comparing hot deck to multiple imputation ?
