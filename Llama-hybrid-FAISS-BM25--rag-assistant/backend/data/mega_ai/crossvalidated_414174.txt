One possible describing feature importance in unsupervised outlier detecion is described in Contextual Outlier Interpretation . Similar as in the Lime approach, local linearity is assumed and by sampling a data points around the outlier of interest a classification problem is generated. The authors suggest to apply a SVM with linear kernel and use estimeited weights for feature importance.
