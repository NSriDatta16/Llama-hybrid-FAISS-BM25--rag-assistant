How can I make and enforce a generic OneToOne relation in django?

I'd like the exact same thing as django.contrib.contenttypes.generic.GenericForeignKey , but OneToOne instead of ForeignKey . I thought an easy (albeit marginally inelegant) workaround was to add unique=True to the field in question, but that borks.
