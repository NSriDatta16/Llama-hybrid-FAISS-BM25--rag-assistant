Indeed. It is assumed that all test statistics that fall in $\Gamma$ are rejected and others are not. Also note that in a pure (i.e., subjective) Bayesian framework, there need not be multiple hypotheses to define the pFDR. This is, however, now the view Storey has been promoting. This Wikipedia entry actually discusses a different meaning/definition of the q-value, which preceded Storey's definition and makes life rather confusing (see also here ). The "individual" hypothesis discussed is the marginal hypothesis rejected. It is true that hypothesis will typically not be rejected alone. That is why the marginal rejection is discussed. It should indeed be the minimal FDR. The two competing approaches to multiplicity control are: (1) Set an error level and find a procedure that controls it. (2) Estimate the error level and reject when the estimated error level reaches a desired value. The estimated $pFDR(\Gamma)$ depends on the sample. It's value does not depend on the sampling distribution of each test statistic (it is simple arithmetics), but it's sampling properties will naturally depend on the sampling distribution. Particularly, the test statistics need to be independent for Storey's estimator to be unbiased to the true $pFDR(\Gamma)$.
