mysql escaped string storage

Could somebody explain me how to store a escaped string in a column limited in size of a mysql table. I mean, if I have a column to which I define a size (let's say varchar(10)), if I insert "abcdefghij" the limit is reached, but if I insert "abcde'ghij" I exceed the limit since the escaped result of this last string is "abcde\'ghij" although the original size is 10! How to control this?
