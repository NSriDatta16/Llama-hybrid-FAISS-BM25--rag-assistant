Instead of "link this field to the node" you could use "output this field as a link" and set alt text to nid. To do this: Add another field of nid Drag field to top of list and set to exclude display Set "output this field as a link" and then Link path to "node/[nid]" Then set alt text to be [title] Alternatively if the title attribute is really required you could manually add it to the template file. To see which template to edit click Theme: Information in the Basic Settings page. Copy the tpl name and code to your active themes directory and then add the title attribute.
