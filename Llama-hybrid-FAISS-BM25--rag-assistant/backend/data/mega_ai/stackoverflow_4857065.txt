Loading an attribute value without loading an entire entity

So I was writing a piece of functionality where I was getting the parent category ids of a category and wanted to get the url_key of one of the parents in Magento. I wanted to do this without having to load the category and found this method getAttributeRawValue , which can be found here /app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Resource/Eav/Mysql4/Abstract.php . Basically it seems unnecessary to load a whole entity then to just get the attribute value associated to that entity id. It gets me what I need, but I am wondering if it is all that much better then loading the category and getting the attribute. Is loading the category essentially doing the same thing but doing it for every attribute?
