Android blows up when I with the following we trying to leverage the SQLite db I created here

I get the following error when I attempt to create dynamic columns. I thought this was legit, but apparently Android and SQLite don't like this. I'm sure I'm missing something simple, but I just can't recall. Error message is: no such column: sundayResult: , while compiling: CREATE TABLE DAYSUSED( _id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY autoincrement, sunday INTEGER NOT NULL, monday INTEGER NOT NULL, tuesday INTEGER NOT NULL, wednesday INTEGER NOT NULL, thursday INTEGER NOT NULL, friday INTEGER NOT NULL, saturday INTEGER NOT NULL); SELECT _id , volume_level , vibrate , CASE WHEN sunday = 1 THEN 'Sun' ELSE ' ' END AS sundayResult , CASE WHEN monday = 1 THEN 'Mon' ELSE ' ' END AS mondayResult , CASE WHEN tuesday = 1 THEN 'Tues' ELSE ' ' END AS tuesdayResult , CASE WHEN wednesday = 1 THEN 'Wed' ELSE ' ' END AS wednesdayResult , CASE WHEN thursday = 1 THEN 'Thur' ELSE ' ' END AS thursdayResult , CASE WHEN friday = 1 THEN 'Fri' ELSE ' ' END AS fridayResult , CASE WHEN saturday = 1 THEN 'Sat' ELSE ' ' END AS saturdayResult , sundayResult || ' ' || mondayResult || ' ' || tuesdayResult || ' ' || wednesdayResult || ' ' || thursdayResult || ' ' || fridayResult || ' ' || saturdayResult || ' ' AS days_of_week FROM DAYSUSED The last line will work if I do a direct call to the actual columns like: , sunday || ' ' || instead of what I have currently which is: , sundayResult || ' ' || I've looked all over and don't know what else to try, as I'd really like to alter the data for the cursor. Thanks, Kelly
