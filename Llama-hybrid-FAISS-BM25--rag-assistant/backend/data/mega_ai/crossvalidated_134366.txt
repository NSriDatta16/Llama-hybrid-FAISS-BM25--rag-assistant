You have arrived to the stationary form of the local level model: $$ \Delta y_t \equiv x_t = \underbrace{\Delta \alpha_t}_{\eta_{t-1}} + \Delta \epsilon_t \,, $$ where $\Delta$ is the difference operator such that $\Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$. Now, I think it is easier to first check the statistical properties (mean, covariances, autocorrelations) of this stationary form. For example, the mean of this process is given by: $$ \hbox{E}[x_t] = \hbox{E}[\eta_{t-1}] + \hbox{E}[\epsilon_t] - \hbox{E}[\epsilon_{t-1}] = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0 \,. $$ You can do the same to obtain the covariances of order $k$, $\gamma(k)$: \begin{eqnarray} \begin{array}{ll} \gamma(0) &=& E\left[(\eta_{t-1} + \epsilon_t - \epsilon_{t-1})^2\right] = \dots \\ \gamma(1) &=& E\left[(\eta_{t-1} + \epsilon_t - \epsilon_{t-1})(\eta_{t-2} + \epsilon_{t-1} - \epsilon_{t-2})\right] &=& \dots \\ \gamma(2) &=& \cdots \\ \gamma(>2) &=& \cdots \end{array} \end{eqnarray} You just need to take the expectation of the cross-products of all terms bearing in mind that $\eta_t$ and $\epsilon_t$ are independently distributed, they are independent of each other and the variance of each one are respectively $\sigma^2_\eta$ and $\sigma^2_\epsilon$. Then, it will be straightforward to get the expression of the autocorrelations of order $k>0$, $\rho(k) = \frac{\gamma(k)}{\gamma(0)}$. This will have a form that is characteristic of a moving-average of order 1, MA(1) (the autocorrelations are zero for $k>1$) and, hence, $x_t$ can be represented as a MA(1) process and $y_t$ as an ARIMA(0,1,1) process. In order to find out the relationship between the parameters of the local level model and the MA coefficient, you can equate the expression of the first order autocorrelation obtained before with the expression of the first order autocorrelation of a MA(1). Following the same strategy as above, you can find that $\rho(1)$ for a MA(1) with coefficient $\theta$ is given by $\rho(1) = \theta/(1 + \theta^2)$. The expression that you get by doing this will also reveal that the local level model is a restricted ARIMA(0,1,1) model where the MA coefficient $\theta$ can take only negative values. Edit Equation (c.5) is okay. You can get the relationship between the parameters of the local level model and the MA coefficient solving the equation (c.5) for $\theta$. You can rewrite it as a quadratic equation to be solved for $\theta$. One of the solutions can be discarded because it implies a non-invertible MA, $|\theta|>1$. When solving this equation, it will be helpful to define $q=\sigma^2_\eta/\sigma^2_\epsilon$. Also, check that $\frac{\sqrt{\sigma^4_\eta + 4\sigma^2_\eta\sigma^2_\epsilon}}{2\sigma^2_\epsilon} = \frac{\sqrt{q^2 + 4q}}{2}$. This way you will get a more neat expression. Then, given that $0
