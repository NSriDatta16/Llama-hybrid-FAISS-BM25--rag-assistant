Faster R-CNN / Mask R-CNN: is it possible to fix the number of instances?

Is it possible to get a fixed number of boxes/instances from Faster/Mask R-CNN algorithms? I am using Mask R-CNN to segment 5 layers in a retina OCT image. But it only produces 2-3 layers, even though all the input images in the training set have 5 layers annotated. Is there a way to force a fixed number of instances?
