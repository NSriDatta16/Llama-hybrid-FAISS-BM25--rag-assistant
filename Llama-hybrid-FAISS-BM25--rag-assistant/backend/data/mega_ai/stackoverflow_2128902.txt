Many of the current IoC containers would allow you to do such a thing through its dependency injection (DI) possibilities. In fact, when XML configuration was all the rage in DI land, you would pretty much get all this out of the box. Today many IoC containers support a programmatic way of setting up dependencies, which you can quite easily hook to whatever XML file you want to provide. Check out this example with the IoC container StructureMap : IContainer c = new Container(); c.Configure(ce=> ce.For(typeof(A)).Use(typeof(A)).WithProperty("Test").EqualTo("Hello")); var a = c.GetInstance (); Debug.Assert(a.Test == "Hello"); By parsing an XML file containing information like targeted type, name of the property, its value, and then calling the above API, you can get what you want.
