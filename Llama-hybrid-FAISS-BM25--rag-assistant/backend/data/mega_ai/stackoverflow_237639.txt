Be very careful when logging potentially confidential information which has arrived over https. The user will expect it to be encrypted end-to-end (which may be a legal requirement). Ensure you don't send it via plain email. Normally I'd say log all of the request including get, post, cookies, form state (in ASPNET), user agent, other headers, date/time, server machine etc BUT under some cases that would result in some information being logged which you're not supposed to permanently record (such as credit card numbers being passed through to a payment provider). Sending it by email is even worse. It's worth doing a check if HTTPS is on, and if so, reduce the amount of information you log to avoid this problem. I just sent through a string to say whether the field was empty or non-empty.
