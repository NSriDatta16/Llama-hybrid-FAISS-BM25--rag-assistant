I have seen data scientists doing Writing Image processing and image recognition algorithms, Design and implement decision trees for a business use case, Or simply design and implement some reports or write ETLs for data transformations. Data science , however, is a super-domain of machine learning It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science, in particular from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, uncertainty quantification, computational science, data mining, databases, and visualization . Machine learning engineer seems to be a designation where your employer has already narrowed down to the Approach, Tools, and a rough model (of what to deliver) to extract knowledge or insights from data using machine learning and your work will be to design and implement machine learning algorithms to deliver the same .
