Without knowing the goals and details of your model, I probably could not answer the question fully, so here are just some tentative suggestions. There are cases to use, say, ACS 2006--10 income data to construct some income measure for 2010. See here for an example, and I quote: The other substantial change in the methodology is the replacement of the decennial 2000 sample estimates of school-age poverty as one of the inputs to the school district estimation process with estimates derived from the latest five-year sample of the American Community Survey (ACS 2006-10). In the 2010 decennial census, no long-form survey questions were included. This decennial sample data has now been replaced by the continuous measurement ACS. So the SAIPE program also replaced the decennial sample estimates as an input to the school district process. There are tradeoffs in using the two different sources as an input to the school district estimation process. The survey associated with the decennial 2000, in general, has lower errors associated with sampling than the ACS five-year survey. To the ACS advantage, the ACS five-year estimates are more timely relative to the decennial 2000 as an input to 2010 estimation. Combining the two effects, preliminary evaluation indicates that the ACS five-year estimate as an estimator of current-year poverty represents an improvement in relative error compared to using the decennial 2000 estimate. The impact on the final SAIPE school-district estimates will thus yield an improvement in precision, but a fuller evaluation is required to give more detail on how the uncertainty of these estimates have improved. It depends on your empirical model to see whether the median income in 2009 is exactly what you needed, or is it sufficient to use a five-year average. Or if whatever you are trying to estimate takes time to affect your outcome variable, then previous-year averages may even be preferred to current-year estimates. If 2009 estimate is strictly preferred, have you considered ACS 3-year files instead of 5-year files. 3-year may strike some balance between data reliability and year-to-year changes. Further more, is median income what you really needed? Maybe share of shcool-age children who are in poverty is as good a measure? Again, there is no way for me to know that. I only use it as an example, and the annual data is available here . Also, for part C of your question, I would suggest using yearly data to check, despite lower precision of the variables. Or at least take a look at year-to-year changes in median income around 2009.
