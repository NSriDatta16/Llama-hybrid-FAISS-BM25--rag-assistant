for me its not ajax (firebug do not show any ajax activity). Just pay attention... look at the JS tab or Firebug. You are adding http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js in your page. So, even before the page is loaded, googgle-analytics server already got a request sent to it :) There is no need to use ajax. And you can beautify ga.js using the tool Adnan has mentioned in his answer to see what the ga.js does after it is loaded ==== EDIT ====
