Although this is a time series that might best be handled through time series modeling, let us assume that the drops are independent and only (possibly depend on manna dropping slightly). Then you could look at this like analyzing an itnervention. Take the set of paired differences between demand prior to the price drop with demand after the price drop and apply either a paired t test or a Wilcoxon signed rank test (with the choice depending on the appropriateness of the normality assumption on the paired difference).
