Given the markup above: div.container { width: auto; overflow: hidden; } p { white-space: pre-wrap; } ...And then insert several hard returns into the string-of-unbroken-words at tested intervals. The width: auto pair is a placeholder; the computed width of that div should equal the width of the page canvas. Alternatively, you can set your text as an image and apply it as the background of the div or paragraph with a repeat value of no-repeat .
