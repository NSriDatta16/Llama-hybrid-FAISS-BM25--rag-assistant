How to Make Magento Show The Entire SQL Error

Every once in awhile I am programming something in Magento and I get a MySQL error. When the exception displays on the screen it only displays the first few characters of the query that it was trying to execute. Is there a way to get Magento to display the entire query in the stack trace?
