I think in this case it makes sense to use mean values for continuous variables modal (most frequent) values for each categorical variable (watch out for ties). Otherwise your average person might wind up a statistical Frankenstein, like Johnny Cash's stolen Cadillac . Some statistical packages set the baseline category to be the modal category for categorical variables, which makes things easier for you since you can just ignore those terms when you let software handle the dummy variable creation rather than doing it manually. Also, don't forget to wrap the index function inside the inverse logit function $$\Lambda()=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p} }{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p} }$$ to get back to probabilities. This would make your prediction 0.72 instead of 0.96 (sticking to your original choice of covariate values).
