The periodogram (a scaled squared FFT) shows strong concentrations of variance in frequencies close to zero --exactly which cannot be ascertained from your plots. The periodogram is an inconsistent estimator of the spectrum of a stationary time series, hence the very erratic behaviour you see in your second plot. In order to gain a further insight in your series, you should either smooth the periodogram (look at argument spans= and taper= of spec.pgram() ) or resort to a parametric estimate of the spectrum (look at spectrum(...,method="ar") and choose the autoregressive order using AIC for instance).
