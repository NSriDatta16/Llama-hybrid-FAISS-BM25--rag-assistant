Your description is incomplete. What is $p$? We can guess that the assumptions you are making is that $p$ is the parameter of binomial distribution, so that $$ x \sim \mathcal{Bin}(n, p) $$ and you want to estimate it from the observed data. You may take a maximum likelihood estimate of it as $\hat p = x/n$, but what you are showing is the Bayesian beta-binomial model, where you assume that parameter $p$ is a random variable and you assume a uniform beta distribution for it. In such case, the beta distribution you are describing is the posterior distribution of $p$. But this is the distribution of $p$ estimated from your data and the prior, not the distribution of $p$.
