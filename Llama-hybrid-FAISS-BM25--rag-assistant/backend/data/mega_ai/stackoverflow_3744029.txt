Assuming that you are complaining about the Eclipse Java editor's completion behavior, I don't think there's anything you can do about it. If it really worries you, create a bug report on the relevant Eclipse component. Better still, create and submit a patch that fixes the problem. EDIT I had a trawl through the Eclipse JDT open bugs/issues, and there are various issues related to final in various contexts, though not specifically this one (as far as I can see). It is also worth noting that there are a LOT of open JDT issues ... so an issue with a viable patch is much more likely to receive attention.
