Sounds like you're probably CPU bound. All the programs you listed depend highly on memory and CPU rather than disk speed. Since it looks like you have plenty of memory I'm guessing it's mostly CPU slowing you down. If you really do wish to improve your disk performance without spending much money you can try putting your disks on a Raid 0 setup. This will make your computer treat them like one large data storage volume and speed things up by reading from both disks simultaneously. Keep in mind that this also increases the likelihood that you will lose data since the rail volume could become corrupt or one of the disks could fail (causing data on both disks to be lost). Alternately, you can try buying a faster disk drive. Newegg sells Western Digital Raptor drives (Currently the fastest SATA non-SSD disks available) from between $100-$150 (after rebate) http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=40000014&Description=raptor&name=Internal%20Hard%20Drives . These could give you a 20-30%+ boost in disk IO depending on how good your current drives are.
