Drupal 6 - make a module for every block of dynamic information?

I have a Drupal 6 website with about 20 pages. Inside every page, I need to create a lot of widgets with information either stored inside the database or from external web services. Most of the time, a "view" (from the view module ) is just not enough to solve the requirement. Up until now, any time I need such a widget, I create a new module which implements hook_block. Then, I drag and drop this new module inside the panel I want. I will need to create about 20 modules. This works pretty good. However, I'm not sure if this is the correct-drupal-strategy and I would love to receive some feedback from experienced Drupal developers.
