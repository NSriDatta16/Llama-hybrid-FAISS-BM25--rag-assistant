iPhone 4 display issue with Google map in object tag

I am embedding a Google map into an html page using the tag. The map is displayed inside of a set of tabs. It works fine in all major desktop browsers, android phones, and the iPhone simulator. However, it's displaying incorrectly on an iPhone 4. http://rjthieneman.com/property/northcrest-plaza/ If you view it on an iPhone 4 or iPad, the map will not stay inside the tabs, instead it will display in the top left corner of the screen and cover the page. Any help would be appreciated. Update I ended up using an and it seems to work. I'd prefer to use the tag though
