DragDrop registration did not succeed in Setup Project

We have some installation project in Visual Studio solution (Other project types -> Setup and deployment -> Setup project). This project has another library type project with Installation class named InstallationCore like project output. In user action, I call to Install and Uninstall functions of installer of InstallationCore. InstallationCore has windows forms for interaction with user. There, in forms, I use Drag and Drop functionality for Drag and Drop text from Tree View to Text Box. But in line: txbUserName.AllowDrop = true; I get error of JIT debugger: Unhandled exception has occured DragDrop registration did not succeed System.InvalidOperationException: DragDrop registration did not succeed And long stack trace after that. Important to say, that when I run Installer function from test project the error did not occur and all work fine. Error occurs only when I run the .msi package. Any suggestions?
