How do I get cost function of logistic regression in Scikit Learn from log likelihood function?

The log likelihood function of logistic regression is as below: \begin{align} \ln(L(x, y; w)) &=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [y_i\ln(p(x_i;w))+(1-y_i)\ln(1-p(x_i;w))] \\&=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [y_i\ln(\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-w'x_i}})+(1-y_i)\ln(1-\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-w'x_i}})] \end{align} The cost function including penalty and L1/L2 regularization is as below, see link I understand C and L1/L2 norm but cannot derive cost function, can anyone help with the derivation process?
