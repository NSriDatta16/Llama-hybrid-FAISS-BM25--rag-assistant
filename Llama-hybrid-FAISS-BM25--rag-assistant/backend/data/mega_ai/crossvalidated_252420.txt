Probability of N bins containing events for a poisson process

Suppose a receptionist, answering phones at a business, takes 3 minutes to help each caller. Thus, in each hour, there are 20 time windows in which a call could be answered. Calls arrive following a poisson process with an average rate of 5 calls per hour. If 5 calls arrive during a particular hour, what is the probability that none of the 5 calls occur while the receptionist is busy, so that no calls are missed? What is the probability of exactly 1 missed call? Of 2 missed calls? Is there a general solution to this kind of problem given N calls and W windows of time? Here's the solution I came up with: The arrival of calls is a Poison process, so the probability of a gap between calls of 3 minutes or more is p = $e^{-\lambda t} = e^{-\lambda * 3} $. Now if we have $N = 5$ calls in an hour, then there are $N-1 = 4$ gaps and the probability that all of the gaps are 3 minutes or longer is P(no missed calls) = $ (e^{-\lambda * 3})^{N-1} = (e^{-\lambda * 3})^4$ The probability of exactly one missed call is the probability that one and only one gap between calls is shorter than 3 minutes: P(1 missed call) = $ 4* (e^{-\lambda * 3})^{4-1} * (1-e^{-\lambda * 3})^1 $ Where the pre-factor of 4 comes from the fact that any of the 4 gaps can be the short one. Similarly, the probability of exactly two missed calls is P(2 missed call) = $ (^4_2)*(e^{-\lambda * 3})^{4-2} * (1-e^{-\lambda * 3})^2 $ Clearly this generalizes to a binomial distribution where the probability p (small p) is a function of the arrival rate $\lambda$. I'd be grateful for any feedback as to whether this is correct/reasonable.
