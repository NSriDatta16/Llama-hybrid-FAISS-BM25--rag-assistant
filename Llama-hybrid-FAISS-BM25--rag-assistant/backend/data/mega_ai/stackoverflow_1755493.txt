Clover has the feature that it shows you the poorly tested, highly complex code. This is good so you don't waste time increasing code coverage by testing getters and setters. Many tools can calculate the cyclomatic complexity of a function. If this value is to high, you just not going to be able to test all the permutations of the function. Code coverage is a means - not an end. Code coverage does not prove code is correct, and the coverage tool is only useful as the bugs it helps you uncover.
