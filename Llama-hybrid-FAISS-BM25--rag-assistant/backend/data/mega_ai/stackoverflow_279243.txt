Ignoring CSS, since that will give the semantic meaning, when does span provide additional semantic value by chopping up a sentence or string of words? Ignoring CSS (and other non-HTML markup), never. A span >'s only purpose in life is to carry markup that you can't express in HTML. Markup such as span style="dropCap" >, which doesn't have an equivalent in HTML but has existed in print publishing for hundreds of years, and which is always applied to just one character - the first letter of an item (article, whatever), without causing a word-break (or any larger break). It seems that in all cases, other elements are better suited to adding semantic value, making span a purely layout element. Is this true? Yes and no. The only real value of span > is that it is semantically neutral. That is, unlike for example p >, it doesn't do anything that you might want to have it not do when you're using it to carry other markup. And there are times, like span style="dropCap" > above, when you don't want any other effects.
