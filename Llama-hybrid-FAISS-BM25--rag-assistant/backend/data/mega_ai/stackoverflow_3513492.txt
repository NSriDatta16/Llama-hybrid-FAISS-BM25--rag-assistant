Are you sure the users really have Cookies switched off? It could be that users have persistent cookies switched off (the ones that write a file to the user's hard drive) and still have browser session cookies switched on. Browser Session cookies live in memory and disappear when the user closes their web browser, but normally this is enough for server-side Session State to work properly. In nearly all cases where clients have cookies disabled, it's always persistent cookies only. The in-memory ones are still enabled and work fine, you can still track users, but only for as long as the browser remains open, this might be enough for you I don't know. Update: I just noticed you said this needs to persist across sessions (as in user closing browser down and going back to site later). Have you looked at HTML5 storage options ( LocalStorage in particular), it's a simple Key/Value store, and it's reasonably supported across browsers even versions of Internet Explorer.
