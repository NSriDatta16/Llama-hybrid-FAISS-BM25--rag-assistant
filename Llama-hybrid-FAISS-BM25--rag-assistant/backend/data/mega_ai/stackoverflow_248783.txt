You don't mention what your server-side language is. Or, more pertinently, what framework you are using -- if any -- on the server-side. IME, I organise things on the server-side and let it all shake out onto the web page. The framework is given the task of organising not only JS that every page has to load, but also JS fragments that work with generated markup. Such fragments you don't usually want emitted more than once - which is why they are abstracted into the framework for that code to look after that problem. :-) For end-pages that have to emit their own JS, I usually find that there is a logical structure in the generated markup. Such localised JS can often be assembled at the start and/or end of such a structure. Note that none of this absolves you from writing efficient JavaScript! :-)
