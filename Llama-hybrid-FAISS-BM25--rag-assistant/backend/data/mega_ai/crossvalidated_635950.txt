Can I use simple regression for means of count data that are not whole numbers?

I'm a beginner at stats and only need to understand the basics. I've learned simple, logistic and Poisson regression and am trying some problems. I have a set of count data which have been averaged across repeated samples to create a data set of mean counts (so not whole numbers) for each experimental plot. The distribution of these mean data points is not normal (it is positively skewed) - I think this is expected for count data. My notes say you should use Poisson for count data, but only when the values are whole numbers. I don't have the original data points, just the mean values. I've tried a simple regression and the residuals look OK to me - is this the right approach? I've attached the Q-Q plot below. I've also added the scatter plot of count means (y axis) against the independent variable (x axis), and the histogram showing non-normal distribution of count means.
