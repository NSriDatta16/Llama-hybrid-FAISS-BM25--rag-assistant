For Prior definition in bayesian regression with R package MCMCglmm, how to convey different strength of believe via parameter nu?

I understand the strength of the Prior is set via parameter nu however, I can not find information what nu expresses in statistical terms, e.g. how strong would a prior that is similar to the number of variables x be in this example? #Inverse Wishart (multivariate, variables=x) prior.miw I also saw a lot of examples for weak priors with nu=0.01, does it mean we have a 1/100 degree of belief in the prior compared to the posterior?
