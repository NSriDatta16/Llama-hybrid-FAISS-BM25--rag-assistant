They are equivalent up to computational issues that arise from doing math on a computer. $$R^2=1-\dfrac{SSResiduals}{SSTotal}$$ $$ RMSE = \sqrt{\dfrac{SSResiduals}{n}} $$ Both are just functions of the sum of the squares residuals (“errors” in a mostly-acceptable-even-if-technically-incorrect machine learning slang). Setting aside some issues that can arise from doing math on a computer, maximizing $R^2$ is the same as minimizing $RMSE$ .
