App Engine: What is the fastest way to check if my datastore query returns any result?

I like to check if there is any result for my datastore query in the Google App Engine Datastore. This is my query: users = User.all() users.filter("hash =", current_user_hash) What is the fastest and most elegant way to check if my query returns any result? PS: I know a way to do so, but I'm very unsure if it is very efficient...
