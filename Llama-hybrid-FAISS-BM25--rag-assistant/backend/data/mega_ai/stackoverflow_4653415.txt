Elegant solution for multiple forms on single page

I'm building a web application (in Django) that will accept a search criteria and display a report - once the user is satisfied with the results, save both the criteria and a reference to these objects back to the database. The problem I'm having is finding an elegant solution for having 2 forms: Display (GET) the results of their criteria. Enter in some descriptions, and save (POST) everything back to the database. I'm leaning towards AJAX for the GET stuff and a POST for the save, but I wanted to make sure there wasn't a more elegant solution first.
