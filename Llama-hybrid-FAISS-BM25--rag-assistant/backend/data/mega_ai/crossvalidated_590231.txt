Suppose $X\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ and that $y_i = f(x_i)$ where $Y\sim Bin(p)$. Is the confidence interval of $\bar{y}$ dependent on sigma?

I have a discussion at work on this topic and want to leverage the wisdom of the stats crowd :-) Suppose $X\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ is observed and that $y_i = f(x_i)$ where $Y\sim Binomial(p)$ . Note that $f()$ is some function translating X to zeros and ones. Let y be the vector containing the observed $y_i$ for $i=1,2,...,n$ The goal is to compute confidence intervals for the observed values $\bar{y}$ . Today, I do this via basic bootstrapping y and computing the confidence intervals with the reverse percentile interval method. Is information/uncertainty included from x via this computation method? Is information lost by not including the uncertainty from x directly? What is the expected difference in confidence interval between bootstrapping x vs y for $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ ?
