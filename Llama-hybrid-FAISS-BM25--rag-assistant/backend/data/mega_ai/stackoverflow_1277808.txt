Reusability I see two approaches. You can either create individual pages for the sections that you want to reuse, and then simply link to them wherever appropriate. This is trivial in HTML. You can alternatively create a snippet or fragment of HTML with the information for that section, and then use Server-Side Includes (or a similar technology) to include it inline wherever it's needed. This way the content will appear to have been written on every individual page, but when you need to make an edit it's still only in one place. Search If the site is public, let Google index it, and just offer a Google search box. You're not likely to get better results than that. Printability A "print stylesheet" in CSS is easy to put together, and can eliminate all the graphical elements that make the site attractive on the web, preserving all the content for use on paper. Printing the whole document at once would require some small bit of programming to combine all the contents together into a single page for the purpose of printing. Personally, I'd prefer to even offer that service, to discourage people from wasting the paper. Of course, we can offer all manner of insight into how to achieve any of these things, but since it sounds like you're after general advice at the moment, that's mine.
