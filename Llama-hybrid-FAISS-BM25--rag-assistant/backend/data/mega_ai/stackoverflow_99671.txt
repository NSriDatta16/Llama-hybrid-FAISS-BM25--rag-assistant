I cover this in one of my large apps by just making sure that the tables/models are conceptually grouped by name (with almost 1:1 table-model relationship). Example: events event_types event_groups event_attendees etc... That way when I'm using TextMate or whatever, the model files are nicely grouped together by the alpha sort. I have 80 models in this app, and it works well enough to keep things organised.
