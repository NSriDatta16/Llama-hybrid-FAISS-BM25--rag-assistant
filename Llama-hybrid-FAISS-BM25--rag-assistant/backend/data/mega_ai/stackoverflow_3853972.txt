Windows Form Custom Panel with Transparent Child Issue

I've created a custom panel (inherited from Panel) that override OnPaint method to paint the inner rectangle with LinearGradientBrush. public void PaintPanel() { // Re-calculate the CalculatePanelHeight(); Graphics _g = this.CreateGraphics(); Point _startPoint = new Point(0, m_TopAreaHeight); Size _size = new Size(Width, m_BtmAreaHeight); Rectangle _btmRect = new Rectangle(_startPoint, _size); LinearGradientBrush _btmGradBrush = new LinearGradientBrush(_btmRect, BackColorBottom, BackColorBottom2, LinearGradientMode.Vertical); _btmGradBrush.GammaCorrection = true; _g.FillRectangle(_btmGradBrush, _btmRect); ... } protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) { PaintPanel(); base.OnPaint(e); } However there're 2 quirks: Whenever any control with transparent background is dragged into the custom panel, its background becomes White. My custom panel doesn't support transparent background (the color turns to White whenever I set one of the gradient color to transparent). Would anyone offers some insights please? Thank you.
