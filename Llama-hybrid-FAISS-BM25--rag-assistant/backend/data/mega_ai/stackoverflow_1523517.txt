Refactoring tool for Spring.NET

Currently I get to edit a lot of Spring.NET XML files, and I do find this work to quite repetitive and, frankly boring. Most of the stuff I do is sort of 'refactoring' - generalising XML declaration for instances and "inheriting" from those generalised structures to declare more specific ones. As I said, it's a no-brainier type of task but it does require a lot of attention and concentration and it's easy to make a mistake. I would imagine that a lot of editing of Spring.NET xml files can be automated with a tool similar to ReSharper. Can you recommend anything?
