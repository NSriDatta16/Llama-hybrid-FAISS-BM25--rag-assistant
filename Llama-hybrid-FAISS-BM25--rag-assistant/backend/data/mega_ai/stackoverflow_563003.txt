I strongly recommend the book " Java Concurrency in Practice ". Each of the choices has advantages/disadvantages: Vector - considered "obsolete". It may get less attention and bug fixes than more mainstream collections. Your own synchronization blocks - Very easy to get incorrect. Often gives poorer performance than the choices below. Collections.synchronizedList() - Choice 2 done by experts. This is still not complete, because of multi-step operations that need to be atomic (get/modify/set or iteration). New classes from java.util.concurrent - Often have more efficient algorithms than choice 3. Similar caveats about multi-step operations apply but tools to help you are often provided.
