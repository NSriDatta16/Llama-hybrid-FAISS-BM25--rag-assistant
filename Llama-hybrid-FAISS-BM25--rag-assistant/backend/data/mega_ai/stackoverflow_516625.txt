Is there a Bayesian filter library for .NET

Is there a Bayesian filter library for .NET? I would like to setup a group of folders and have emails automatically moved to those folders based on what has been previously moved to the folder. If you are familiar with FogBugz auto-sort, that's exactly what I would like to do.
