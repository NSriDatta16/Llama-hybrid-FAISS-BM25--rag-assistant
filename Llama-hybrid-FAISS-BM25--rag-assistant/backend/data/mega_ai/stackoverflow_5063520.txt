IE thinks jpeg is bmp

I have a image thumbnail function that basically just re-sizes the image and outputs it via GD It shows fine on all browsers, except in IE where it thinks it's a bmp file... which is fine usually except when I'm trying to use jquery to drag it and the file takes ~10s to render everytime I drag it... not sure why... When I try to save the image file, it will default to Untitled.bmp and not let me change the file type. I even tried to load the image file directly by copying it from the cache, and it works fine, so the file itself is ok... but I just can't get symfony to output the image in a way ie 'likes'... things I have tried so far: Content-Type: image/jpeg Content-Type: image/pjpeg Content-Type: application/download + Content-Disposition: attachment;filename="test.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg + Content-Disposition: attachment;filename="test.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg + Content-Disposition: inline:filename="test.jpg" Content-Type: application/download + Content-Disposition: inline;filename="test.jpg" I have added Content-Length to all of the above and it goes fine through on firebug's net panel... but ie's developer tools > image report says the filesize is -1 bytes. The only thing left that I can think of is the url of the image: http://www.example.com/imagePreview?component[0][id]=1&component[0][option_id]=5&component[1][id]=2&component[1][option_id]=4&width=400 I tried to add a .jpg at the end, but it still refuses to read the file as a jpeg... So yea, I need some ideas and help from you guys
