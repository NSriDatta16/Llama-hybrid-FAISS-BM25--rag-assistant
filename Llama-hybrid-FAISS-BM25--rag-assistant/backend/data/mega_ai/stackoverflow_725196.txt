SSAS - Many to many dimension with "one" table

I have an organization table and an organization membership table Org table: |OrgId|Name|...| Org membership table: |MembershipId|Parent organization id|Child organization id| This describes an org structure where one organization can be a child of several parent organizations, the parent organizations may in their turn be children of other parents. There are no circular references like o1 is child of o2 that is child of o1. I am struggling to model this as a dimension in SSAS. Is it possible?
