Maybe TWebBrowser saves the Useragent it had at the time of creation in ControlData property? Try deleting and re-adding the control to the form on a computer with IE8.0 installed. At any case, those User agent strings looks oddly similar. It's probably the same IE8.0 engine, no matter what it prints.
