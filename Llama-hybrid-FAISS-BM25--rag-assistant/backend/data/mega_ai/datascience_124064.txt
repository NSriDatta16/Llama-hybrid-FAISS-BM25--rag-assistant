If your use case is producing probabilities of 3 classes, you should use multiclass precision/recall/f1, rather than the @k versions. value@k type metrics are typically used in retrieval/ranking problems where the model output is used to rank order some set of things. For example, a simple recommendation system might be a binary classifier. 1 means recommend to user , 0 means don't recommend to user . The model outputs a probability value between 0 and 1, which is used to rank order possible items to show. Since the user will only see the top k subset of items (ie top 10 items sent to user feed), we want to compute our metrics on just the top subset as this is most relevant to the use case.
