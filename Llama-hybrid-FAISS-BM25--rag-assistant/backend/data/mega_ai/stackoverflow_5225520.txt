VS 2008 find/replace with collapsed regions

I just started using #region / #endregion to organize my C# code. Now it seems that Ctrl-H (quick find & replace) with LookIn=CurrentDocument does NOT replace within any #regions of code that happen to be collapsed at the moment. Am I dreaming or is this really the behavior of VS 2008 ? (Seems dangerous to have global replace depend on your active window state.) if I'm not dreaming is there an edit setting buried somewhere to change the behavior ?
