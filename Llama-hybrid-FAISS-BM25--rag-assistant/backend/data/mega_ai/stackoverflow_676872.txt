Well, the simple answer is you can't. In the case of Firstclass.rect = your __setattr__ is called. But in the case of Firstclass.rect.bottom = 3 the __setattr__ method of the Rect instance is called. The only solution I see, is to create a derived class of pygame.rect.Rect where you overwrite the __setattr__ method. You can also monkey patch the Rect class, but this is discouraged for good reasons.
