Calculate the arithmetic average and standard deviation of a survey response

If I have a market research with population of 100 individuals: 10 spend less than 10 dollars in clothing 20 spend between 10 - 20 dollars in clothing 30 spend between 20 - 100 dollars in clothing the remaining do not spend at clothing. How do I calculate to arithmetic average and standard deviation of the data?
