Do earlier hidden layers learn more concepts/features than later ones, in neural networks?

I am wondering whether there is a general statement of the sort "earlier layers in neural networks learn more concepts/features than later layers" or the other way around. The output layer not being taken into account, as it should learn as many concepts as there are classes (in a classification task). Are there any resources or papers which tackled this questions, maybe in image classification? thanks
