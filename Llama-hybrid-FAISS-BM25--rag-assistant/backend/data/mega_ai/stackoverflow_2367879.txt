Here is the corrected (working) Album Class: [Table(Name = "Albums")] public class Album { [Column(IsDbGenerated = true, IsPrimaryKey = true)] public int AlbumID { get; set; } [Column] public string Title { get; set; } private EntitySet _tracks = new EntitySet (); [Association(Storage = "_tracks", ThisKey = "AlbumID", OtherKey = "AlbumID")] public EntitySet Tracks { get { return _tracks; } set { _tracks.Assign(value); } } } [Table(Name = "Tracks")] public class Track { [Column(IsPrimaryKey = true)] public int TrackID { get; set; } [Column] public string Title { get; set; } [Column] public int AlbumID { get; set; } } The problme was that I wasn't creating an instance of the Album object as Darin pointed out. The unit test now works correctly. I've tested both with the fake repository as well as the live data and everything works! It's odd that the MSDN examples ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx ) didn't show the assignment either.
