Could anyone explain these terms, "input space", "feature space", "sample space", "hypothesis space", "parameter space" with a concrete example?

People use these terms "input space", "feature space", "sample space", "hypothesis space", "parameter space" in machine learning. Could anyone explain these terms with a concrete example, such as sklearn MNIST dataset? , which has 1797 Samples, 10 Classes, 8*8 Dimensionality and 17 Features. Please do NOT talk about in general. For example, in this particular case, is the feature space a set of 17 elements {0, 1, ..., 16}?
