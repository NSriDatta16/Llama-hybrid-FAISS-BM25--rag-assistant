how do you extract the root directory?

I am still learning php. 'SCRIPT_FILENAME' => string 'D:/Project Storage/wnmp/www/folder/index.php' (length=45) 'SCRIPT_NAME' => string '/folder/index.php' (length=18) 'DOCUMENT_URI' => string '/folder/index.php' (length=18) 'PHP_SELF' => string '/folder/index.php' (length=18) 'REQUEST_URI' => string '/folder/helloworld/helloworldtwo/etc' (length=15) as you can see i just want to get the helloworld/helloworldtwo/etc any idea to extract the folder ? so it will be helloworld/helloworldtwo/etc ? what im thinking is im defining my folder like $root = 'folder' . then i extract it if it match, but the problem is with what ? the second idea is to get from php_self or anything above to get the first from /first/second.php, but again i dont know the best way to do it. and another problem is when we have like two folders in the front ? btw thanks for all of the replay, im still doing some read php.net, test, and try. 'SCRIPT_FILENAME' => string 'D:/Project Storage/wnmp/www/folder/index.php' (length=45) 'SCRIPT_NAME' => string '/folder/folder2/index.php' (length=18) 'DOCUMENT_URI' => string '/folder/folder2/index.php' (length=18) 'PHP_SELF' => string '/folder/folder2/index.php' (length=18) 'REQUEST_URI' => string '/folder/folder2/helloworld/helloworldtwo/etc' (length=15) the question is still the same how can i get the helloworld/hellowrodltwo/etc the right way. edit* guys thanks a lot i have made a solution $str = 'folder/folder/helloworld/helloworldtwo/etc'; $folder = 'folder/folder'; $q = str_replace($folder, NULL, $str); echo $q; but if there is anything / alternative or a better way to do it please do. Thanks again.
