Assuming you have JDK6; xjc is in the bin/ folder of your JDK, something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin\xjc.exe The JDK comes with jaxb, while there might be newer versions around from http://jaxb.java.net/ or other implementations available, you probably don't need to concern yourself with that at this point. JAXB can do a lot of things, I'm not entierly sure exactly what you're trying to accomplish. If you have an xsd, you can generate java classes from it by running e.g. xjc -p com.mypackage myschema.xsd And include the generated classes in your project (More typically you'd run that as part of your build process). Or can I define object to XSD mappings so that I'm in control of the mapping, not some default code generation? The generated classes are just pojos with some annotations, you could create those classes yourself and be in full control of the mapping via annotations. As said, jaxb can do a lot of things, here's just some basic examples, SearchParam/SearchType is a class generated by xjc from a small custom .xsd Serialize an object to an XML file JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(SearchParam.class); Marshaller marshaller = context.createMarshaller(); marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true); List hours = new LinkedList (); hours.add("2009.12.11"); hours.add("2009.12.13"); SearchParam param = new SearchParam(); param.setFilter("greater"); param.setHours(hours); param.setSearchType(SearchType.Fuzzy); marshaller.marshal(param, new FileWriter("/tmp/SearchParam.xml")); Deserialize an xml file JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(SearchParam.class); Unmarshaller unMarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller(); SearchParam param = (SearchParam) unMarshaller.unmarshal( new FileInputStream("/tmp/SearchParam.xml")); Deserialize and do schema validation JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(SearchParam.class); Unmarshaller unMarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller(); Schema schema = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI) .newSchema(new File("/tmp/schema1.xsd")); unMarshaller.setSchema(schema); SearchParam param = unMarshaller.unmarshal( new FileInputStream("/tmp/SearchParam.xml")); More information http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnazf.html http://jaxb.dev.java.net/
