Intuitive explanation of state space models

Having looked into options for modelling and forecasting a financial time series based on mixed frequency data, I came across state space models, which seems worth exploring. I've however been unable to find a clear, intuitive and largely un-mathematical explanation of how a state space model works or what they do to allow mixed frequencies. As all the info I have found on this topic seems very technical I, and hopefully others, would very much appreciate some clarification on what seems to be a pretty powerful tool.
