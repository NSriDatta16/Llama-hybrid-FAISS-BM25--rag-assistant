What is the most efficient method to handle long time sequences (LSTM)?

I am using LSTM and I have several long time sequences of varying length. Most of them are about 6,000-7,000 timesteps on average, but several are around 40,000 long. I am not sure which of this would be the best choice: Leave them as they are. Pad the short sequences and use truncated backpropagation (but would it work, since the sequences have so many zeros?). Split only the biggest sequences so that all the sequences are around 6,000-7,000 sequences. Pad some of them if needed. (I think this is the best option but I am not sure.) Split all of them to the smaller sequences. (I read this question: What is a feasible sequence length for an RNN to model? and according to it it seems that there is no need to do so, and it's just better to use truncated backpropagation on the longer sequences. Am I right about it?)
