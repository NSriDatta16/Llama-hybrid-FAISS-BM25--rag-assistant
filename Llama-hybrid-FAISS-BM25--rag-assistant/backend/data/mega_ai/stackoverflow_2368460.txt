You will have better performance doing an attribute scope query (ASQ). Here is some example code: DirectoryEntry group = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://CN=All Staff,OU=Groups,DC=domain,DC=local"); DirectorySearcher searcher = new DirectorySearcher(); searcher.SearchRoot = group; searcher.Filter = "(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person)(mail=*))"; searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add("mail"); searcher.SearchScope = SearchScope.Base; searcher.AttributeScopeQuery = "member"; List mail; using (SearchResultCollection results = searcher.FindAll()) { mail = new List (); foreach (SearchResult result in results) { mail.Add(result.Properties["mail"][0].ToString()); } } Generally speaking System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement is going to give you slower performance than System.DirectoryServices. However 99% of the time you won't be able to notice it. However in this case your example is iterating through each object and pulling it across the wire, while my example is leveraging LDAP to do all the work on our behalf. Note that this code only works for groups with less than 1000 members. If you have a group larger than that you'll need to page which is more complicated code but not a big deal.
