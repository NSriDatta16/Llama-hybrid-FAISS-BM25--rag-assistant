Writing a program in 2 languages?

Can a program be written in more than one programming language? The stuff I read on The Daily WTF seems to imply that big companies/organizations employ several different languages when building a large application. How does that work? I know from working with Django that dynamic web pages are often put together with a bunch of different languages (Python for the controllers, HTML + Django's templating language for the view, and SQL for the models), but what about programs , ie stuff that would turn into an .exe when compiled?
