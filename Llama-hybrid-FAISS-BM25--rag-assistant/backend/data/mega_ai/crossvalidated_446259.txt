If you're interested in inference and the missing variable is only a control, just drop it. You assume that it's uncorrelated with the others, so it won't change their estimates. It might widen the standard errors a bit, but you can also got another model dropping the missing observations. Fitting that one is a good test of your assumptions: the coefs should be similar. If the missing variable is of central interest, just drop the observations that don't have it. You're assuming MCAR, after all. If doing pure prediction: multiple imputation will work, fine, but consider averaging the predictions, rather than averaging the coefficients. You don't need to worry about rubin's rules for standard errors on coefs.
