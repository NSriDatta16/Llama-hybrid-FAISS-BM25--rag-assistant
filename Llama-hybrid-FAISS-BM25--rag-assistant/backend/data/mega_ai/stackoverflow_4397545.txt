Flash Editor font size on Mac vs PC problem

I have the exactly same font on Mac and on PC. I have created the .fla file on PC with Flash Professional CS5 and when I open it on Flash Professional CS5 on Mac, the font is noticeably smaller. This causes all kinds of layout problems between our PC and Mac Flash developers. I've searched google, but found no working solution to this. Embedding the font did not help. Is there any way around this? The best I've managed to come up so far is to run Flash editor inside virtual Windows when developing with a Mac. Edit: The font is not smaller, but there are problems on spacing between the rows of text with some fonts that cause layout problems.
