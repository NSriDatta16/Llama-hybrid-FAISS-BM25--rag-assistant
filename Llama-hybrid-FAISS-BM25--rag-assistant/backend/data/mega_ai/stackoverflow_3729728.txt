Magento: Best way to avoid extension conflicts

What are the best practices when creating a Magento extension to avoid conflicts with other extensions that get loaded to a store. I know how to code with the override method, observer methods and the details behind how to do that the preferred way. That still doesn't stop you from having conflicts with other modules out there and upgrades. Alan Storm, if you read this, I also have read your recent post about overrides and upgradability. Is that the best way to think for this type of situation as well? I also see extensions and articles people have created to allow multiple classes extend the same class.
