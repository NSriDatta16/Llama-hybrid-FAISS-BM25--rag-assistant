It depends on what you want to do with the results. Even if none of the 1,836 raw time series really had different variances from their filtered counterparts, you would find about 5% of your p-values being significant using a standard significance level of 0.05. I assume you are trying to make money by investing based on your results. In that case, one approach would be to determine how much money you will lose by concluding that the variances are not the same when, in fact, they are. Based on this you can set whatever significance level you want based on how often you can afford to be wrong, that is based on how large of losses you can absorb.
