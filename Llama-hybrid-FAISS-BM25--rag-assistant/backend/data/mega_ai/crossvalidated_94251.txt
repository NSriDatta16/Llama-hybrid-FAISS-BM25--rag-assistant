AR(p) is a time series model, I don't see how and why would you apply it to your case. If you think that the error depends on the size, then you are talking about heteroscedasticity not the autocorrelation . The latter happens when your observations come in a certain order (not necessarily in time) and their noise is correlated with each other, the former happens when observations have different variance and there's no ordering involved. Your packages are not observed according to their size, like small packages are weighed first. If your packages were observed this way, then you could talk about autocorrelation. In presense of heteroscedasticty you can keep using OLS, but the parameter covariances will be messed, which I don't think you care about much. If you want to adjust for this problem, then use so called hac estimators. The popular one is Newey-West estimator, which can adjust for both autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity
