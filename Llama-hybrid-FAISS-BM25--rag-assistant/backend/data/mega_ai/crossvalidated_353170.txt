What is known as "DAgger Problem" in imitation learning?

I have seen in imitation learning papers that they have mentioned their algorithm suffered from "DAgger problem". Can someone please explain me this. Is it about taking the same action by the agent again and again? 5. Conclusion Although we have implemented a model that enables InfoGAIL to use visual input and intended to show that it increases the applicability of InfoGAIL, we instead discovered that InfoGAIL (and by extension GAIL) suffer from the “DAgger problem.” This is not through a fault of the original algorithms, but it is a fact of using distribution matching (like with a generative adversarial framework) with experts that take only one type of action or with environments that lend themselves to these kinds of skewed state-action distributions.
