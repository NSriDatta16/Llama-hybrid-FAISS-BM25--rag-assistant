You can think of a monad as a C# interface that classes have to implement . This is a pragmatic answer that ignores all the category theoretical math behind why you'd want to choose to have these declarations in your interface and ignores all the reasons why you'd want to have monads in a language that tries to avoid side effects, but I found it to be a good start as someone who understands (C#) interfaces.
