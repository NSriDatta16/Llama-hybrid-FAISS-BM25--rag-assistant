What would you recommend to read to a person who is going to write his own DB?

Since there are no answers to my previous question . I'm really thinking to implement a custom DB which will satisfy my requirements. Yes I know, sounds crazy. But what books, articles and etc. would you recommend to read? If it does matter the requirements for my DB are following Graph oriented - optimized for storing graphs and traversal(e.g HyperGraphDB, Neo4j) Running in memory, but having a persisted storage (e.g. Redis) Distributed (e.g. membase) Had .NET adapter (TCP/IP, not HTTP REST) I don't look for technical details, just want to find some source of theoretical information on how things usually done and what choices do I have.
