You have to use the jquery's text() function . What it does is: Get the combined text contents of all matched elements. The result is a string that contains the combined text contents of all matched elements. This method works on both HTML and XML documents. Cannot be used on input elements. For input field text use the val attribute . For example: Find the text in the first paragraph (stripping out the html), then set the html of the last paragraph to show it is just text (the bold is gone). var str = $("p:first").text(); $("p:last").html(str); Test Paragraph. Test Paragraph. With your markup you have to do: $('a#a_tbnotesverbergen').text('new text'); and it will result in new text
