I've recently run into the same problem, trying to launch an agent on a Mac OS X 10.6 machine using SSH. To get password authentication to work you'll need to edit /etc/sshd_config on the client node, setting PasswordAuthentication yes In the Hudson dashboard take the node offline, make sure the configuration has a valid username and password, and launch the agent. Also make sure that the Remote FS root directory is owned by the build user you're connecting as. For password-less ssh authentication, first check which user the Hudson master is running as. Lets assume that this is tomcat55 . Generate a public/private SSH key pair (with an empty passphrase), then verify that the Hudson user can connect. $ ssh-keygen -t rsa Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. $ # authorize the hudson master on the hudson node $ scp /home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa.pub hudson@macnode:~/.ssh/authorized_keys $ # test the connection $ ssh -i /home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa hudson@macnode On the Hudson mac node, the /etc/sshd_config needs to allow for password-less access. Protocol 2 PubkeyAuthentication yes In the node configuration clear the password field, and set the private key field (in this example it is /home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa). You should now be able to launch the agent: [01/19/11 22:38:44] [SSH] Opening SSH connection to macnode:22. [01/19/11 22:38:44] [SSH] Authenticating as hudson with /home/tomcat55/.ssh/id_rsa. [01/19/11 22:38:45] [SSH] Authentication successful.
