Theoretically, if you have the information about the prior probability, use MAP; otherwise MLE. However, as the amount of data increases, the leading role of prior assumptions (which used by MAP) on model parameters will gradually weaken, while the data samples will greatly occupy a favorable position. In extreme cases, MLE is exactly same to MAP even if you remove the information about prior probability, i.e., assume the prior probability is uniformly distributed. So: If dataset is large (like in machine learning): there is no difference between MLE and MAP; always use MLE. If dataset is small: MAP is much better than MLE; use MAP if you have information about prior probability.
