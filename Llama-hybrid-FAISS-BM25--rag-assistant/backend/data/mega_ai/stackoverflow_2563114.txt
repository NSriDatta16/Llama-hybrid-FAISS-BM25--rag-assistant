My favorite (for ease of use) is our modified wfSpy utility. It is available at my blog: http://www.cplotts.com/2009/10/28/an-ode-to-wfspy/ The original utility is from CodeProject ... but that version doesn't have the ability to drag the mouse on top of a control in your application. Hawkeye (already mentioned above) is a favorite of mine as well ... more powerful than wfSpy ... but definitely harder to use. wfSpy is great for quick and simple spying (and of course editing of properties on the fly).
