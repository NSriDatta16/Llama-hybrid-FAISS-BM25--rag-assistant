How can IDF be different for several documents?

I am using LETOR to make an information retrieval system. They use TF and IDF. I am sure TF is query-dependent. But IDF should be to, but: "Note that IDF is document independent, and so all the documents under a query have same IDF values." But that does not make sense because IDF is part of the feature list. How will IDF for each document be calculated?
