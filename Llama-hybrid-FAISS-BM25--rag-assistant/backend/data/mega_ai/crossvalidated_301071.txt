How to account for remainder in forecasting?

I've done an STL decomposition of a time series. While trend accounts for major variations, remainder has a "cyclical" setup. I want to know what other forecasting methods I can apply to maximize data explanation via trend and seasonality and would like to see it decomposed. I only know of ETS as a tool. I'm a fresher in the world of statistics. Help appreciated!
