Convolutional neural network - Using absolute of tanh on convolution output

I've watched an online lecture regarding CNN ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wORlSgx0hZY ) that confused me a bit. At roughly 8:35 in the lecture it was stated that it is important to use the absolute value of the tanh function on the output from the convolutional layer. I've never heard that before and I can't quite understand it just based on the lecture. Can anyone expand on that? The lecture connects this to how "the polarity of features is often irrelevant to recognize objects" and "the rectification eliminates cancellations between neighboring filter outputs when combined with average pooling". I've attached an excerpt of the slide used in the lecture below:
