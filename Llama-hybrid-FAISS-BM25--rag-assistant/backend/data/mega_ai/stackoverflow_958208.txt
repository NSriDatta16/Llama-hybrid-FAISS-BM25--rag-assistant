If you are specifically interested in doing network programming with an emphasis on distribution and GPU/graphics stuff, you may want to check out the open source (GPL) CIGI project ( sourceforge project site : CIGI is an open simulation protocol for communication between a host device and IG (image generator). The Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) is an interface designed to promote a standard way for a host device to communicate with an image generator (IG) in the simulation industry. CIGI is a fairly active project on sourceforge , initiated and backed by BOEING , and is multi-platform software: The goal of the Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) SG is to evaluate industry and government interest in developing a standard image generator interface. Typically, today's Image Generator (IG) vendors have their own closed, proprietary run-time interfaces. At I/ITSEC'02, Boeing proposed their Open Source Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) as a run-time interface that could be adopted by the simulation community. Boeing indicated that they would like to see a standards organization adopt CIGI and develop it into a robust and broadly accepted simulation industry image generator run-time interface standard. The SG is discussing this proposal, evaluating alternatives, and generating recommendations and a proposed action plan. Here's some wireshark-based info on CIGI
