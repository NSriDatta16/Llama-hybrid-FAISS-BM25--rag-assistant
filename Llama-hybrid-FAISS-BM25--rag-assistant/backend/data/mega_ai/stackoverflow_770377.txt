Aside from collaborating with a 3rd party ASP-style vendor (like Pluck ), I'm not sure you're going to find something like this. I've seen components to support comments in the ORM (such as Commentable Behavior Plugin for Propel within symfony) but that doesn't give you anything in the way of forms, sanitization, display, user validation, etc. And then there's the question of features: Do you want flaggable comments? Rich HTML? Emoticons? URL Parsing? Nested comments? Moderation tools? Profanity filtering? I suppose all of this depends heavily on what type of existing system you're adding this to, as well (can you leverage AJAX? MVC? Postbacks? etc) but really I think it's a fairly broad topic which is why you'll probably just want to roll your own.
