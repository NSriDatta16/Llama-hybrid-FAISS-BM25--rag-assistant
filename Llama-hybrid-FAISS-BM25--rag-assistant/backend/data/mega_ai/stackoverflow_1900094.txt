override description or stringValue in cocoa?

I want to have an descriptive string for an object in Cocoa. I'm thinking about overriding either the description method or the stringValue method. Which is preferable and why? The only guideline I could find was in here stating You are discouraged from overriding description. Is this indeed what you would suggest? Any other preferred overrride point?
