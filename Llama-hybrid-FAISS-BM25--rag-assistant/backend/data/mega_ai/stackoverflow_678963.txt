Losing session state after close of a window opened with window.open

Currently we're opening a new aspx page with window.open. The window.open is in a javascript function (openNewWindow()) in the current aspx page which is called when an asp.net hyperlink control is clicked. The links are dynamically created on the page by our framework and so I'd like to avoid changing that functionality. The problem seems to be that when this new 'child' window is closed, session state is lost. I should mention that session is available in the child window just not in the 'parent' window after the 'child' window is closed. Funnily enough, it seems that elsewhere in our application, if an open.window call is added to a page by using a ClientScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript call on the codebehind click event of a hyperlink control (rather than it calling a function that is coded in the aspx) session is preserved. The latter solution would be difficult to implement in the current framework code without a significant change and all the regression testing that would entail. Anybody got any ideas how to keep the session state alive after the close of the child window. BTW this is occurring in IE7 and our app is asp.net 2.0 based. Thanks in advance for your insightful and elegant solutions to this problem! ;o)
