Project organization in perforce

I created several web applications that use the same static files (css, js, images). When I use svn for version control, I use an external repository (svn: externals) to add files to the current project. For example: - Project_1 ---- Webapp -------- Static (external to static's repo) - Project_2 ---- Webapp -------- Static (external to static's repo) I could easily use it in their web pages by adding a link like /static/ ... But now our company has moved to perforce. How can I support the current structure? We also use maven, I think to pack these files as a jar and use as a dependency, but then my editor (idea) does not see that this dependence are js-scripts and styles. And i need to repackage and deploy jar file when create minor changes. How to use maven correctly?
