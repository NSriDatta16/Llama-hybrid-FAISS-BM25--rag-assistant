Magento indexing is somehow similar to normal database indexing, but the differece is that you need to do it manually in some case. when you do indexing, for example the catalog indexing then it make entry of your catalog product in the separate table for the different type of sorting, A small example is store, suppose you have a product and different detail for the different store, then first it will fetch the record from the complex joins in the separate table(when you will perform indexing) Other best example is layered navigation indexing: if you will run the layered navigation indexing then it will check in the product database for the all shop by filter attribute then on every attribute how may product are available it will also store that value. Mainly such type of indexing are required if you are doing some direct database changes or though your own custom code Please let me know if you have other query on indexing
