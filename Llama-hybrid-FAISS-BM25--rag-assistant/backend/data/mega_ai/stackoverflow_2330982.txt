The last few versions we've shipped with SASL auth to prevent unauthorized access in untrusted environments. In development trees, we have pluggable storage engine support allowing you to do fun things like isolate caches between apps. e.g., I have a deployed instance with many users who can't see each other's data. User1 can cache dog and User2 can cache dog and they do not interfere.
