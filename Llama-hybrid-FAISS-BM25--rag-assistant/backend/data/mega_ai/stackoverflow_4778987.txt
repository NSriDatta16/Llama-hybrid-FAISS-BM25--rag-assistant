jquery - How to stop an overflow div scroll down when drag an element out of it?

I have two divs: one top, one bottom. Top div has overflow: auto and a scrollbar. When I drag element from top div to bottom div, the scrollbar auto scroll down. I know this is a normal behaviour but I want to stop that. Screenshot: http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5235/simplezttpleditor.jpg
