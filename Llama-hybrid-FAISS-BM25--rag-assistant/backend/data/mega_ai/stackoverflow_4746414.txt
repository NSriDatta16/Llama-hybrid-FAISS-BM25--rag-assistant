Rails 3 Active Record Calculations: Sum and Average at the same time

Is there any way to get activerecord to calculate the sum and average of a query at the same time ? For example I want to do something like this - which doesn't work ! Person.group("gender").count.average("age") And get back Gender Count Average Age Male 32 13.5 Female 26 14.7
