Effect size derived from LME longitudinal model: the statistical findings projected back down onto a group of people

I have been studying the change in a metric X with a linear mixed effect model. I have built this model in a multivariate setting, so I can see how each of my covariates (Time, sex, age) affect X. Subsequently, I assessed how the time-differences were impacted by sex and age using simple interaction models. I paste here my code and results here: mod1.lme summary(mod1.lme) mod3.lme summary(mod3.lme) Then I have substracted the mean to the metric BMI, because I was told this would eliminate the regression to the mean for this metric df1$bmi_acc = df1$bmi-df1$mean_bmi and assessed its longitudinal impact like this (maybe I should have done it with an interaction model?) THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IN THIS POST : From these results I could say that there is change over time in the metric X (based on mod1), and that there are several variables affecting this the variable X crossectionally, but after testing them all in interaction models, I see that only sex (women(==0) progress more than men(==1)) and people with high BMI have a higher progression over time. EFFECT SIZE: For example, given these results, I would like to know if I can say (based on my cofficients) that for example women with high BMI would progress at xy % per year, while a an average men with BMI xy , and a starting X of xy , would progress at xy % per year. The way I normally interpret these coefficients is: (based on mod1) For every year, you will increase 1.72 in X (so 581.48 + 1.72). The other covariates in that model are crossectional and I am not sure how to interpret them in this context. I am confused though as to how to include the interaction models in this context. Shall I forget about mod1 and focus on the specific interaction models? My interpretation: SEX: Based on model 3: For every increase in a year, you will suffer an increase of 2.76 in X, that if you are a woman, will be 1.78 in addition to men. So the final model will be: Women: 687.23 + 2.76 +1.78 = 691.77 (being a woman you would expect an increase in X of 0.66% per year) Men: 687.23 + 2.76 = 689.99 (being a man you would expect an increase in X of 0.40% per year) For BMI (based on model 2) where every increase in a BMI unit would increase X by 3.79... Going from a BMI of 25 to 31 Kg/m2 in one year would mean: 6*3.79= 22.7 697.89 +22.7 = 720.59 (an increase of 3.25%) if we merge this with the previous context. We would say: Women: 0.66% + 3.25% = 3.91% Men: 0.40% + 3.25% = 3.65% Is this all right?? I am trying to make my results easy to read for clinicians. Thanks!!
