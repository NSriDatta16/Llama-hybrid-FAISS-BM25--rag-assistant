Is there an elegant way to store an ontology graph and the definitions/data associated with nodes?

I have written a simple module to store and manipulate an ontology which is provided in a flat file using Perl. For this, I use the Graph module which is excellent. One issue I am having to deal with is how to store the textual definitions for the vertexes in the ontology. Each term has a small text description which I want to store and retrieve. At the moment, as Graph does not support this directly, I use an internal hash. I was wondering, is there a more elegant way of having a single data structure to store both the ontology graph and the definitions/data associated with nodes?
