Do you simply want to have a 'drop' event on DOM elements but think you need to care what is being dropped onto them? My initial approach to similar issues started with the 'drop', not the drag, but found that the 'ondrop' event is not very portable, implying I should use a framework like jQuery instead. See: See here for a jQuery UI framework approach with demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ See here for a less framework oriented approach with some disscusion on the topic: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/01/10/cross-browser-html5-drag-and-drop/
