I don't think the order of the where clause has any impact. I think the MySQL query optimizer will reorganize where clauses as it sees fit so it filters away the largest subset first. It's another deal when talking about joins. The optimizer tries to reorder here too, but doesn't always finds the best way and sometimes doesn't use indexes. SELECT STRAIGHT JOIN and FORCE INDEX let's you be in charge of the query.
