Drtsn32.exe only catching exception once per reboot

I'm trying to setup Drwtsn32.exe as the crash handler on a windows xp embedded system. I have run drwtsn32.exe -i from the prompt to install it as the default handler. Then I added a couple different fragments that would cause exceptions into our application as a test: int y = 0; int j = 0; j /= y; int* p = 0; (*p) = 0; When I run our application for the first time, I get a Drwtsn32.exe popup correctly, the application closes, and drwtsn32.log is written and shows my crash. When I run the same application again, I get no popup, and no log is written. This repeats until I reboot, when the popup and log are both generated a single time, then the problem persists. On a different system, I see different functionality - drwtsn32.exe does not generate an error (although I do see the MS Send Report popup) and the log is generated every single time, without requiring a reboot. Does anyone know if I am missing a configuration option, or if a component is missing in our Windows XP Embedded Image? Thanks
