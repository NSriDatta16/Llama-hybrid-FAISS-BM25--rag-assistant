Build numbers in sync across many tools or not?

We currently have many office products and a embedded product. They all have the same version scheme major . minor . build number . svn revision . With nightly and manual builds incrementing the build number. From a development support front this makes it really easy to manage 'correct version', but the in-field support guys panic when one tool changes from v10 to v200 and we say there's no changes. Are there any problems with this scheme (all in sync) that we are missing due to our love for it? Update: It's the build number that is increasing by leaps, the major minor are only changed on a yearly type scale. the svn revision is the same for all files at time x, but the nobody really pays that attention. All .exe's and .dll's etc have the same X.Y.W.Z number. So the office product go from 1.1.10.1234 to 1.1.132.4321 when we do lots of work on the embedded product.
