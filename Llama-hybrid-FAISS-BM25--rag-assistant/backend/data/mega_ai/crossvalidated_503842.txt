What do the individual parts of the full name mean when something like ResNet-FasterRCNN is mentioned?

What i mean by the title is as follows: Say I went into Tensorflows Object Detection Model zoo and picked some model like, Faster R-CNN ResNet101 V1 1024x1024. My question is, what is the architecture and what is the technique? Does Faster-RCNN point to the technique the architecture ( i.e. ResNet 101 ) uses or is FasterRCNN also a standalone architecture? If what i'm saying above doesn't make much sense then what do both "Faster RCNN" & "ResNet 101" refer to within the context of the whole name of the model "Faster R-CNN ResNet101 V1 1024x1024"? Any help would be appreciated.
