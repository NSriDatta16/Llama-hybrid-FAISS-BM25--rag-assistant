You could embed a NER library (see opennlp, lingpipe, gate) in to a custom parser, generate new fields and create an indexingfilter accordingly. This is not particularly difficult and the advantage compared to doing this on the SOLR side is that you'd gain from the scalability of mapreduce (NLP tasks are often CPU-hungry). See Behemoth for an example of how to embed GATE in mapreduce
