I had a similar problem, I found it to be the user_agent check in the core.php file, set this to false! What was happening was after a page refresh the session id changed and I was logged out, but in the Session object there was an error saying Attempted Session Hijack!!! pr($this->Session); Set this to false in core.php! Configure::write('Session.checkAgent', false);
