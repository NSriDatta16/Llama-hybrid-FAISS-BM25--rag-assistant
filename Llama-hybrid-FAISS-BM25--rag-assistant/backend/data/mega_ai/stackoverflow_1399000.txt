the javaws executable accepts a run-option -arg which allows the called to send arguments to the application. I think these are appended to the arguments in the jnlp file. So your call might look like this: javaws [options] -arg my_file.jpg http://example.org/launch.jnlp Edit: The above solution only works with OpenJDK's javaws which accepts the -arg parameter. Another option, according to this blog post , is that you can pass arguments to the JNLP file using URL query string parameters. This will obviously only work if you execute javaws with the full URL and won't work if you access it as a download link. I have not tested this so it may or may not work.
