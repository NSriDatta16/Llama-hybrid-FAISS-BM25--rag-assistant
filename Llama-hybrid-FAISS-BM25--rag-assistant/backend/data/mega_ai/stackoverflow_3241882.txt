I did that using middle click and drag to see the example. On my laptop, I just use my horizontal scroll bar. I expect that this is happening because the page is rendering larger than the space available. However, the CSS involved is specifically disallowing scroll bars, though scrolling still works. I'm not precisely sure if I call that a bug or a feature.. I've found it nice to be able to scroll sideways on random things that are too large (overfilled iframes without scrollbars, for example). Also, what is your 'question'?
