"Please wait" image on every user action with ASP.NET 3.5

In our ASP.NET 3.5 application, we would like to implement a "Please wait.." feature : on every user action (button click, tab change, etc.) we would display a little spinner on top of the page (actually in a separate frame that we use already have). We thought of this solution : "hijack" the _doPostBack to intercept every event, display the spinner image, then execute the original _doPostBack function register a client script block in the ASP.NET codebehind to hide the image when the processing ends My question is : do you think it's a good solution ? it's certainly not very elegant but it seems quite efficient. Is there another solution/pattern to do this kind of thing ? PS : we do not use JQuery and we use UpdatePanels
