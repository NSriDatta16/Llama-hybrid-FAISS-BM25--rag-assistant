A logistic regression with a categorical predictor variable (in R: fitted_model ) should be fine (followed by anova(fitted_model) ). For small data sets you might want to worry about the asymptotic nature of the likelihood ratio test (which is what's used when you say anova() ), but your data set isn't small ... You can fit the same model more efficiently if you collapse the data set into the form clicks total time ... (i.e. the data set will only have three rows, one for each time) and use glm(cbind(clicks, total - clicks) ~ time, family = binomial, data = ...) or glm(clicks/total ~ time, family = binomial, weights = total, data = ...)
