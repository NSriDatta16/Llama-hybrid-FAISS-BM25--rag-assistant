How can I get a value of a property from an anonymous type?

I have a datagrid populated by a Linq query. When the focused row in the datagrid changes I need to set a variable equal to one of the properties in that object. I tried... var selectedObject = view.GetRow(rowHandle); _selectedId = selectedObject.Id; ... but the compiler doesn't care for this at all ("Embedded statement cannot be a declaration or labled statement"). It seems like the property should be easy to access. Inspecting the object during runtime shows all the properties I expect, I just don't know how to access them. How can I get access to the anonymous object's property? Edit for Clarifications: I happen to be using DevExpress XtraGrid control. I loaded this control with a Linq query which was composed of several different objects, therefore making the data not really conforming with any one class I already have (ie, I cannot cast this to anything). I'm using .NET 3.5. When I view the results of the view.GetRow(rowHandle) method I get an anonymous type that looks like this: { ClientId = 7, ClientName = "ACME Inc.", Jobs = 5 } My objective is to get the ClientId from this anonymous type so I can do other things (such as a load a form with that client record in it). I tried a couple of the suggestions in the early answers but was unable to get to a point where I could get this ClientId.
