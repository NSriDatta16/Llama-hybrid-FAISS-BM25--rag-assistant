On Google image search when you remove the frame it functions as you currently propose, by returning to the original frame source. For XSS reasons, finding the current location shouldn't be possible, and if it was it would be considered a bug and fixed in subsequent browser patches, so it might not be best to rely on such a quirk if one existed. A way to elegantly break out without revealing location would be nice, though. This might be something you can propose to the HTML5 group.
