Logistic regression - predict tree disease probability based on state of nearby trees

I have a dataset of trees, each with a location and a binary variable that indicates whether the tree is sick. I would like to predict the probability of a tree being sick at a location as dependent on the probability of trees at a radius of some kilometers from its location. My question is whether it defies model assumptions.
