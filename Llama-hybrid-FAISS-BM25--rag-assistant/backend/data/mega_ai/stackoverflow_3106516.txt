The :member key is reserved for using resources, it looks like it is expecting it as a parameter and is causing the route to not match and then to match to something else down the way. I think if you remove the :member key, it will work. map.namespace :admin do |admin| admin.napespace :organizations do |organization| organization.org_deals 'org_deals', :action => 'org_deals' end end
