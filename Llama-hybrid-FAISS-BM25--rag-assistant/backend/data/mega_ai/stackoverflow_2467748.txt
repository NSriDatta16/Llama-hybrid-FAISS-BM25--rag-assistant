I'd just shove the numbers into strings. It's the easiest and the most compatible solution. Most common programming languages provide string to number conversation in their standard libraries. If someone else needs to read your database with a different program later they don't need to figure out your binary storage format. Another bonus is you can store numbers larger than an unsigned int64 if you need to.
