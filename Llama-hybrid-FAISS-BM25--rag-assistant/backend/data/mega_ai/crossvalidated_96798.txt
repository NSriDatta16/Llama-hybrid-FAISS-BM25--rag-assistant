I'm certainly no expert and would love others to comment on this, but: I'm not sure what your outcome is but you said it was measured 1/0. for the sake of the example i'll pretend that your outcome is "happy with consultation" yes=1 and No=0. I think that for the people with multiple consultations you have a easier task. You could work out proportion happy responses for each person based on their multiple consultation (e.g person 1 had 6 consultations was happy 3 times and not happy 3 time = 50% happy). You could then work out an 'Overall'average happiness across all people by adding up the % happy for each person and dividing by the number of people. You would then get an 'overall average % happy' measure. You'd also get a standard error around this overall % . You basically now have data that could be analysed with a t test or other measures based on a normal distribution. Where you don't have a repeat for the person, you cannot do this. the best you can do is work out a proportion of happy responses, across all participants. lets say you had 4 participants who only had 1 consultation (p1 was happy=1 p2 was happy=1, p3= 1 and p4=0) so the proportion happy is 75%. You would now have to use binomial tests e.g a z test - which i believe are not as powerful (I have just posted a question on this). YOu may have to analyse your data for the no repeats, and the repeats separately. Unfortunately you can't just pretend that you repeated data is from different people because this would violate assumption of independence, so i sense that a different approach is needed with the repeated measures vs no repeated measures data.
