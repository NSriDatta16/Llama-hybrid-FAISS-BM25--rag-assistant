Generation of random variables via composition and inversion

What are the main pros and cons of each method and when to use each one? Law [2007] mentions that: "Again, the reader is encouraged to develop the inverse-transform method for generating a random variate from the right-trapezoidal distribution in Example 8.4. Note that especially if a is large, the composition method will be faster than the inverse transform, since the latter always requires that a square root be taken, while it is quite likely (with probability a) that the former will simply return $X= U_2 \sim U(0, 1)$ . This increase in speed must be played off by the analyst against the possible disadvantage of having to generate two or three random numbers to obtain one value of X." So basically, for the right-trapezoidal distribution (mentioned in the quote) it might be useful to use composition since it's likely to be faster. However, I am not entirely sure why it so? Say I am generating a random variable using the inverse method. Have a CDF and need to find it's inverse. If it's impossible I am likely to use the inverse transform sampling using the fact that the CDFs are weakly monotonic and right-continuous and will generalize the inverse CDF to a form of $F^{-1}_X (u) = \inf\{ x|F_X(x)\geq u\}$ for $0 . It can be a little time-consuming but say I will get the inverse CDF. Then I am creating uniform variable $U$ and use it to generate the random variable using the inverse CDF. I do not understand how the composition method is quicker. Since for composition, I first need to identify that I can in fact use composition from its PDF. Then I create the first uniform variable $U_1$ use it to decide on the distribution (case of composition I assume there are at least two). And then I create another uniform variable $U_2$ and use it to generate random variable. But I still need to know the inverse so that I know what to output? It just seems to me that in the composition method I still need to calculate the inverse in order to know what the random variable will be. LAW, A. M. [2007], Simulation Modeling and Analysis , 4th ed., McGraw-Hill, NewYork. The minimum working example that I can think of is $f(x) = 0.5 f_A(x) + 0.5 f_B(x)$ , where A is exponential with parameter $0.5$ and B is exponential with parameter $2$ . By looking at the PDF $f(x)$ I can see that we can here use the composition method. And the generation method will be something like: Generate $U_1,U_2 \sim U(0,1)$ . If $U_1 , then output $X = -\frac{\log(U_2)}{0.5}$ Else output $X = -\frac{\log(U_2)}{2}$ But if I didn't know what the inverse of exponential distribution is, I would not know what to output. And the composition method would also involve the inversion part. Am I right? I don't see how it would be faster in that scenario.
