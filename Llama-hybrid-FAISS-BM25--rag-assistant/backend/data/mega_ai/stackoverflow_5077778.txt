Visual Studio 2010 installation issue

I've tried to install Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7, but failed on every occasion, however, I've tried to give all the possible privileges, also, I've used a tool to remove everything related to it, and reinstalled after that, but to no avail. I've repeatedly had this issue: [02/22/11,09:51:20] Microsoft .NET Framework 4: [2] Error code 9 for this component means "The storage control block address is invalid. " [02/22/11,09:51:21] Microsoft .NET Framework 4: [2] Component Microsoft .NET Framework 4 returned an unexpected value. [02/22/11,09:51:21] Microsoft .NET Framework 4: [2] Return from system messaging: The storage control block address is invalid.
