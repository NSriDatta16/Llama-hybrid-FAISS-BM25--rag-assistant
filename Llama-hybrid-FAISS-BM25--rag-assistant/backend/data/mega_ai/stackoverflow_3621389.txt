Er. Not the best solution I'd think but you can break up the words into an array and loop them out into multiple LIKES. Do some replaces to yank out ANDs, ORs etc and then run an explode. Then just loop. $sql = SELECT * from Buckets where"; Loop the array, $sql .= " bucketname LIKE '%" . $arrayEl[i] . "% OR'. Just make sure on the last iteration to not include the last OR or append a last line of 0=1 etc. Not elegant, not efficient but in this case it'll work. You'd honestly be better off running a full text search if its a text field.
