When accuracy in the cross-validation process less,is reducing the features a good idea?

I am doing a project for classifying the presence of cars/bikes in an image.I have extracted the features from the images(data-set of cars and images not belonging to that of cars) and applied K-means clustering to get a uniform feature vector X for all images.Now upon applying Cross Validation( Folds=10) upon the data-set yields me an accuracy of ~61% when trained using SVM classifier( RBF Kernel).In this case,is reduction in the number of features a good option(before giving the feature obtained from image before giving it to clustering)? Thanks and regards
