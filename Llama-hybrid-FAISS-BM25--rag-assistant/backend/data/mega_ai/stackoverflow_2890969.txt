This is probably not the most elegant, but it works: $ git fetch $ git status | sed -n 2p # Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 23 commits, and can be fast-forwarded. $ git reset origin/master~22 > /dev/null $ git status | sed -n 2p # Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 22 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
