Can bidirectional RNN use variable sequence length?

A bidirectional RNN consists of two RNNs, one for the forward and another for the backward sequential directions, which outcome is concatenated at each time step. Would this configuration restrict the model to always use a fixed sequence length? Or would it still work as the unidirectional RNN, which can be applied to any sequence length? This question was raised because the bidirectional architecture merges the output of both forward and backward RNNs at each time step. Thus, if the sequence length was 4, the outputs of both forward and backward RNNs would merge this way: 1th forward with 4th backward, 2nd forward with 3rd backward,... 4th forward with 1st backward. However, if a different sequence length was used this merge order would be modified: Let's say the network was trained with sequence length 4, but at test time a sequence length of 5 was used. Merge would be: 1th forward with 5th backward, 2nd forward with 4th backward... 5th forward with 1th backward. Would this shift in merge order negatively affect the bidirectional RNN performance?
