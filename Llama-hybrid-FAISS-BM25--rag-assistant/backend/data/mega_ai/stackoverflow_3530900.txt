The slot is executed multiple times (as others said already). Some more notes: In former times, the pattern for "connect exactly once" in cases where there might have been a connection before, was to first call disconnect and then connect to enforce exactly one connection. Now, since 4.6, there is also the more elegant Qt::UniqueConnection, see http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#ConnectionType-enum
