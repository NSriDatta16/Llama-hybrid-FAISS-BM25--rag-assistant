Even though you may think that comparing the bits of pointers is harmless (after all, they're just addresses in memory, right?), there are good reasons why the language standard doesn't encourage it. For one, if you have code whose results depend on the relative ordering of pointers (e.g, the order of results depends on iteration order through a set or map of pointers), the results will be unstable: Changing the version of compiler or operating system release can change the results. Reproducibility is valuable enough to make this instability worth avoiding.
