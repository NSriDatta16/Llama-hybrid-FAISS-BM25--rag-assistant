Binary Tree applications - Storing dates

I'm working on a simple app and the specs mandate that a binary search tree must be used for storing dates in DD/MM/YYYY format. Question is, I'm having a hard time visualizing the structure and how nodes shall be organized. Sorry for being vague, but can I get some pointers? Thanks for your time!
