Spectral density of a time series R implementation explanation

I am doing signal analysis for the fist time and am using the implementation to found in the stats package to obtain the spectral density of a time series, so I can know which frequencies of the signal have the most power. Now although I understand the general propose of the analysis, (the plot meets the shape it was supposed to have in my dataset), I don't understand the scales obtrained through the use of Spectrum(). For example when I do the spectrum(lh) example, it gives me in the Frequency axis a scale of 0 to 0.5 if I say the time seris has a frequency 1. Could anybody explain to a new guy how do I obtain the values in the frequency and spectrum Axis?
