I myself got rid of a bunch of these annoying sync errors on windows, when I started distributing ipa files instead of zip files. Just drag your app bundle into itunes (on your Mac). iTunes will create a .ipa file inside "~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/", then send that file to your users, no need to zip it as it is already compressed.
