Classifying data, and then performing linear regression on the classes

Is it valid to perform a classification on a data set, separate the data by class, and then perform a regression on each of the groups? The reason why I ask is that the histogram for my data looks like this: This is a histogram where the x-axis has ranges for the response variable, and the y-axis is the count for the number of data points that fall in the range. My idea was to use a linear model for the data near 0, and a different linear model for the other data. To separate the data into two categories, I classified a data point as "small" if the response variable is near 0, and "normal" otherwise, and I trained a different linear model for data from each category. To predict the test data, I first predicted whether it was "small" or "normal" using logistic regression, and then put it through the appropriate linear model, depending on how it was classified. This ended up improving my accuracy by quite a bit, but I'm a little hesitant to use it. I've done some research on this topic, and the method seems to be similar to cluster regression, but I haven't come across any examples where someone used a supervised classifier to split the data. My question is whether or not this is a valid approach to take, and if it is, whether there is any literature on it. On the other hand, if it is not a valid approach, what could I do instead?
