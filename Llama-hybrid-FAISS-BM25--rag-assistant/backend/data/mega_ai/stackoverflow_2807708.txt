C# Multi-Comparisons possible?

is it possible in some way to compare multiple variables to one constant in a if statement? It would be very helpful if instead of if ( col.Name != "Organization" && col.Name != "Contacts" && col.Name != "Orders" ) { } I could just say if ( col.Name != "Organization" || "Contacts" || "Orders" ) { } And I know I could use a list but in some instances I dont want to... Thanks!
