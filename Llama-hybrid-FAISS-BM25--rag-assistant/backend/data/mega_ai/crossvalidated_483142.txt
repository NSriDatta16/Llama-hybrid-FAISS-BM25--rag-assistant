As Robert Long says in a comment, "With single imputation, you shouldn't be doing it in the first place." There is a well respected way to deal with missing data, by doing multiple imputations. The idea is to acknowledge and incorporate variability in the imputation process by producing probabilistically several different imputed data sets. You then perform your analysis separately on each of the imputed sets, and combine the information in a way that takes both within-set and between-set variability into account. That gets around the inherent circularity that you rightly fear with the single-imputation approach. Functions implementing the imputation and analysis process are available in many statistical software systems. This online book is a helpful introduction. And yes, including the outcomes (prices in your case) is an important part of the multiple imputation process.
