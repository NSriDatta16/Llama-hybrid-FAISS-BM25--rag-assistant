Building a Mixed Effects Logistic Regression in R for Panel/Longitudinal Data

I have a dataset with 200 firms, each with 7 years of data on several numerical and categorical/factor variables, say, $(x_1,...,x_n)$ , and a binary outcome variable $y$ ( not fixed over time). ID | Time | X1 ... Xn | Y 1 1 ......... 0 1 2 ......... 0 1 ... 1 7 ......... 1 These variables vary both by the firm ID and with time and hence I am looking at building a mixed effects logistic regression model. Assuming that the predictors $(x_1,...,x_p)$ are the fixed predictors, and $(x_q,...,x_n)$ are those that vary with time, I currently have this formula: model Since the predictors vary by ID and with time, I wanted to ask the following: How I can go about thinking about and specifying a model to predict $y$ while incorporating the ID and time? Are there any practical examples/references I can look at to better understand how to model this classification problem? Given that I have several predictors, is this the right modelling approach for the data I have described? Many, many thanks!
