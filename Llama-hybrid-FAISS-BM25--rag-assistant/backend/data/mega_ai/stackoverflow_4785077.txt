How to determine if a Windows OS font would support bold or italic

How do you determine if a particular font supports bold or italic regardless whether it's a True Type or Type 1? I have the following scenarios relating to embedding a Flex font issue: I have 3 TTF font files called Unknown1, Unknown2 and Unknown3. Let's say they're installed for now When I embed the fonts, Flex tells me that Unknown2.ttf doesn't support a bold weight or Unknown3.ttf doesn't support an italic style My question is, how did Flex knew all of that? I've been searching through C# and Java libraries but none of them seem to offer what I need. Or apparently, I'm not looking hard enough. Anyways, are there classes in Java or C# that can provide me with some signature like: Font unknownFont = Font.getFontFromAnyDirectory("Unknown2.ttf"); unknownFont.supportsAnyStyleCalled(Font.BOLD);//Returns false. unknownFont.supportsAnyStyleCalled(Font.ITALIC);//Returns true. // unknownFont = Font.getFontFromAnyDirectory("Unknown3.ttf"); unknownFont.supportsAnyStyleCalled(Font.BOLD);//Returns true. unknownFont.supportsAnyStyleCalled(Font.ITALIC);//Returns false.
