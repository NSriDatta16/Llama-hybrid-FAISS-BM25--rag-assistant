In my (admittedly limited) experience with SSIS, it is quite good at rapidly getting something up and running, but frusteratingly limited in getting something that "feels" like the most elegant, efficient solution to a programmer. Since the Excel Source Editor seems to take only files as input, you need to give it a file or reimplement its functionality in code that can take a blob. I understand that this is unsatisfying, but in the end, this is a time saving tool.
