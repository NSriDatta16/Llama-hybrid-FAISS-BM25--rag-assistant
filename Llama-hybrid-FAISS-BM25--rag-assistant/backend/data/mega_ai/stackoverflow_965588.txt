Try looking at MSDN's documentation on the TextRange object . It contains samples of how to access the Font properties of the TextRange object. EDIT: You can access things like Bold and Italics programmatically in this manner: TextRange.Font.Bold = msoTrue EDIT EDIT: There are several methods by which you can select only certain text in a text range. See the following: Characters Method Lines Method Paragraphs Method Words Method According to the sames from this link , you can select a portion of the text using one of these methods and set the font programmatically. For example: Application.ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(2) _ .TextFrame.TextRange.Words(Start:=2, Length:=3) _ .Font.Bold = True That example was taken from the Words Method link.
