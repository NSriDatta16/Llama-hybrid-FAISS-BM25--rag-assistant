60 instances is much to little. You probably need 60 instances to get a meaningful location estimate of a single cluster. At 10 clusters, the average cluster size is just 6. Many clusters will likely be based on a single data point! You may even have duplicates? Then at this "flipping" point, every point is exactly encoded in your model. Afterwards, you even get a lot of redundancy, which is probably why the quality decreases again - it is becoming ambiguous, with no more fresh data available at all. You are badly overfitting your data.
