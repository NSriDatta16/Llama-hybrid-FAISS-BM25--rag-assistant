I just want to add to what has already been said. With Cascading Style Sheets you can apply styles to a lot of types of documents. The common use case is to apply CSS to HTML pages. In this case, the general idea is to use the content property only for aesthetic purposes. Another use case is instead to apply CSS to XML documents. In this case the document usually does not contain elements for page structure (div, h1, etc...). So, in this scenario, by using the content CSS property more frequently, you can better define the page and the relations between elements and data. For example you could prepend a description paragraph before a table, or appending the email address after the name of a person. Note that in HTML pages these page-structure elements should be part of the HTML document itself while they are usually omitted in a XML document and so they can be added using the content CSS property.
