You can do a certian amount of this out of the box in Ada. For example, you can make integer types that cannot implcitily interoperate with each other, and Ada enumerations are not compatible with any integer type. You can still convert between them, but you have to explicitly do it, which calls attention to what you are doing. You could do the same with present-day C++, but you'd have to wrap all your integers and enums in classes, which is just way too much work for something that should be simple (or better yet, the default way of doing things). I understand the next version of C++ is going to fix at least the enumeration issue.
