From an NLP perspective, the main issue is to identify and extract the terms/relations of interest from the text. It may be easy if the sentences always appear like these simple examples: one can use pattern matching "the is [and ]" (no need for ML). However with general text it's a quite complex problem which would probably require training an ad-hoc model from annotated data. This would generally involve the tasks of Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction .
