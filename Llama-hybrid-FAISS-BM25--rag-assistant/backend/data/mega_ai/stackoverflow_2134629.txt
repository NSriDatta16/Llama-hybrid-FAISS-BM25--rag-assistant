Weighted voting for 5-star systems with lots of voters You can use Bayesian estimates to calculate weighted voting. IMDb (Internet Movie Database) uses this calculation to determine its IMDb Top 250. (Note: IMDb uses 10 stars but the formulas are identical using 5 stars). The formula for calculating the Top Rated 250 Titles gives a true Bayesian estimate: weighted rating (WR) = (v ÷ (v+m)) × R + (m ÷ (v+m)) × C where: R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating) v = number of votes for the movie = (votes) m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 3000) C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.9) IMDb Reference Wikipedia Reference
