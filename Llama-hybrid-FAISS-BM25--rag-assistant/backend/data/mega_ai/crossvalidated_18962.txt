The Kalman filter is a very simple version of a hidden markov chain in which the states are described as normal distributions. There are several tutorials and introductory texts dealing with kalman filters (easily found through google). If this is too simplistic, there are several extensions (Extended Kalman Filter, switching Markov models, etc.). It really depends on the specific problem in which you are interested in applying them.
