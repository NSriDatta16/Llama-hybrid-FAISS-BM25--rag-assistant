Adding to the previous answers, there are approaches where the topology of the neural network emerges endogenously, as part of the training. Most prominently, you have Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) where you start with a basic network without hidden layers and then use a genetic algorithm to "complexify" the network structure. NEAT is implemented in many ML frameworks. Here is a pretty accessible article on an implementation to learn Mario: CrAIg: Using Neural Networks to learn Mario
