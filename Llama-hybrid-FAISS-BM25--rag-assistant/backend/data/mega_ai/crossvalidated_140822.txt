You can include terms with fixed coefficients using an offset . Technically, an offset is a predictor with coefficient fixed at 1, so you will first need to create a new variable that has the linear combination of the $X$'s with coefficients estimated from the first model. Model for first data set: $$logit(P(Y=1)) = \beta_1X_1 + \dots + \beta_kX_k,$$ giving estimates $\hat\beta_i$. Model for second data set: $$logit(P(Y=1)) = \gamma Z + 1\cdot(\hat\beta_1X_1 + \dots + \hat\beta_kX_k),$$ giving estimate of $\hat\gamma$ with standard errors and all the inference. Most software for generalized linear models (such as logistic regression) has a way to include an offset. It is most commonly used for Poisson regression, but as you can see, it can be useful for other situations as well. Here is how this would work in R: set.seed(456724) # first data set dd1 The output is: Call: glm(formula = Y ~ Z + offset(pred1), family = "binomial", data = dd2) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6432 -0.5135 0.2310 0.4945 1.5744 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.205 0.440 -0.466 0.6413 Z 1.070 0.418 2.560 0.0105 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 38.598 on 49 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 30.536 on 48 degrees of freedom AIC: 34.536 You can't really see the presence of the offset here, but for comparison, here is the output without an offset term: Call: glm(formula = Y ~ Z, family = "binomial", data = dd2) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.1183 -1.1191 0.5753 0.8910 1.6962 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.0911 0.3767 2.896 0.00377 ** Z 0.9369 0.3888 2.410 0.01597 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 62.687 on 49 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 54.906 on 48 degrees of freedom AIC: 58.906 The estimates of the coefficient of $Z$ happen to be pretty close to each other, but you can see that the deviance is quite different, and the residual deviance is much lower when the additional predictor is included.
