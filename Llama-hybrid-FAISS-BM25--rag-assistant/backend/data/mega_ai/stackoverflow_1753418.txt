First off, I have not used kernlab much. But simply looking at the docs, I do see working examples for the predict.ksvm() method. Copying and pasting, and omitting the prints to screen: ## example using the promotergene data set data(promotergene) ## create test and training set ind That seems pretty straight-laced: use random sampling to generate a training set genetrain and its complement genetest , then fitting via ksvm and a call to a predict() method using the fit, and new data in a matching format. This is very standard. You may find the caret package by Max Kuhn useful. It provides a general evaluation and testing framework for a variety of regression, classification and machine learning methods and packages, including kernlab , and contains several vignettes plus a JSS paper .
