Can I get an estimate of the survival function from the age distribution

In an industrial example, I have an age distribution of a particular component. I know the ages of the items currently in service. From this information, can I deduce the average lifespan of a component? Can I deduce the lifespan if I make certain assumptions about, say, constant rate of arrival of new components, or a particular form to the survival function?
