Yup, Rich got it (I coded this feature into FogBugz a long while back). If you have to do this on the client you have no choice but to sort the data, iterate through it generating table row after table row, and every time you hit a new sort value you create a new thead w/ the appropriate information. To be honest it would be a pretty cool modification to this jQuery plugin: http://tablesorter.com/docs/ and you'd be able to leverage a lot of their work. If you're going to put in the time and create a general solution, might as well make it accessible to the community.
