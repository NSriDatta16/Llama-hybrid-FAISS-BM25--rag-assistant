Retail Sales Model

Excuse any errors as I'm fairly new to STATA. I'm aiming to generate a retail promotional sales model (Multiple Linear Regression Model) whereby my y-variable is volume of sales at time t, and my independent variables are: number of TV ads number of print ads number of radio ads average promotion price for brand i average promotion price for all brands in category Can you provide me with an identification of what assumptions of time series analysis I may not abide by/need to look out for? Especially while including so many exp-variables.
