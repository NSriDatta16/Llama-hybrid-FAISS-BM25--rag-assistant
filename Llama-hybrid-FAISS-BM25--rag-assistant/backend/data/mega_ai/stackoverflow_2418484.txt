Jon Skeet has useful a guide . There's also a free guide from the C# in a Nutshell book Also, the new 3rd ed of C# via CLR by Jeffrey Richter has been updated with several chapters on threading including coverage of Tasks, Parallel LINQ and so on. For in depth coverage of Windows threading check Duffy 's book as Jon suggests. It is really good.
