To assess the accuracy of your SVM for your particular dataset use the bootstrap technique. Sample with replacement from your training data (performing CV on the sample if you wish to find the optimal hypers) $n$ times (1000 is great, but do what you can) and then evaluate on your testing (all of it, no sampling). Order the results and take the middle $x$ % for an $x$ % confidence interval. By the way if you want to make robust predictions save your $n$ models and take their average to obtain a prediction. This technique is known as bagging and can be shown to monotonically increase accuracy. If you have a large dataset you may want to use a method not bounded cubically by the number of samples (IE a linear SVM or gradient boosting, neural network, etc.)
