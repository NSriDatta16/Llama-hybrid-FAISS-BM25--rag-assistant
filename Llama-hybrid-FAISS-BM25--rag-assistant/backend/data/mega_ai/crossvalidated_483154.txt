Conditional on $\theta$ , the distribution of $y$ is normal with mean $160 + 0.5 (\theta - 160)$ . For each realization $y'$ from this conditional distribution, the posterior mean of $\theta$ is $$ \hat\theta(y') = 160 + 0.5 (y' - 160). $$ So the expected value of $\hat\theta(y')$ conditional on $\theta$ is $$ 160 + 0.5 [160 + 0.5 (\theta - 160) - 160] = 160 + 0.25 (\theta - 160). $$ The bivariate distribution is introduced into the example so that one can talk about "...under repeated sampling of $y$ conditional on $θ$ ...", i.e. from the conditional distribution of $y$ on $\theta$ . In any case, it seems very Bayesian, and a bit strange from the frequentist perspective, to speak of "...under repeated sampling of $y$ conditional on $θ$ ...", where $\theta$ is the variable one is trying to predict. (For a frequentist, unbiased prediction means the mean of the predicted value $\hat{\theta}$ equals the mean of the variable $\theta$ conditional on the predictor, $E[\theta|y]$ .)
