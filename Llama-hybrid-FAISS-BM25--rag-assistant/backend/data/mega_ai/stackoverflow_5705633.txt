Error when trying to execute JavaScript after page navigation on WebBrowser control

I use a WebBrowser control in a WP7 app and have set IsScriptEnabled to true. Then when trying to invoke a script via InvokeScript of the WebBrowser I see a strange behavior: The script gets executed correctly on the first page. Then I navigate to another page via Navigate() and try to execute a script I get following error message: "An unknown error has occurred. Error: 80020006". I have tried to set IsScriptEnabled to true before navigating to the next page - no luck. Waiting for the completing of the document loading state doesn't help either. All HTML files are stored in isolated storage and get displayed correctly. Only the script interaction doesn't work. Any ideas?
