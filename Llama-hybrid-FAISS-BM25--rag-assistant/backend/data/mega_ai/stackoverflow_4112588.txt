Scroll Iframe on IPhone

I have a web app that wraps the main site content in an Iframe to enable some elements that are persistent across the site (only way to do what I'm after as far as I can tell). It works fine on most browsers, but there is a scrolling problem on the Iphone: The content displays, but trying to scroll does a drag and drop operation instead. Is there any way to tell the Iphone browser to use normal scrolling in that specific Iframe? Example site: http://carlocapocasa.com Thanks a ton and a half, Carlo
