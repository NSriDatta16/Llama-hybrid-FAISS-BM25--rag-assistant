Agreeing with @StephanKolassa, I'll just look from an algorithmic perspective. You'll need to sort your samples with respect to produced probabilities, which is $O(n\log n)$ , if you've $n$ data samples. Then, your true class labels will order like $$0\ 0 \ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1 \ ...\ 1 \ 1\ 0\ 1 $$ Then, we'll put a separator $|$ at some position in this array; this'll represent your threshold. At most there are $n+1$ positions to put it. Even if you calculate the accuracy for each of these positions, you won't be worse than the sorting complexity. After getting the maximum accuracy, the threshold may just be chosen as the average of the neighboring samples.
