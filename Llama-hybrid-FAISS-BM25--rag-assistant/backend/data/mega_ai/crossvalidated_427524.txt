When averaging models, which models need to meet assumptions?

I have 16 variables and am running all possible models (65,535 total!), then averaging the best models. A model including all variables has normally distributed residuals, but some of the 65,535 individual models will not have normally distributed residuals. Do all of those models have to meet the assumptions? Or just the final model after averaging?
