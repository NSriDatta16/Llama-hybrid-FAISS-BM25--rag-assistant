bootstrap time series using the rank

Don Walpola wrote a good overview of the bootstrap techniques used for time series ( https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/450894 ). I searched through the literature, and did not find a single method taking advantage of the rank of a time series to create bootstraps with similar properties. The idea is simple. Let's consider a time series $y_{n}$ with n $\in [1,N]$ . Create $z_{n}$ a bootstrap with replacement of $y_{n}$ so that both time series share same ranks. That's it. A short example in R with 5 bootstraps: x This method looks more simple and efficient than a block bootstrap. Am I missing something? Thanks !
