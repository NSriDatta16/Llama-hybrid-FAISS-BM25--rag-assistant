LSTM for classification

I am new to neural networks and I want to use LSTM to classify the on/off state of devices based on power values. In my training dataset, I have power values, device one (0,1), and device 2 (0,1). 0 for no change in the state and 1 for when they are switched on and off. The testing dataset has only power values. The dataset has a temporal dependency, so I decided to use LSTM. Now, I am not able to prepare my data for this neural network. Could anyone please give me some tips/ guidelines or link to any resource? I would be thankful! This is what my training data looks like; def df_to_X_y_2(df, window_size = 12): df_np = df.to_numpy() X = [] y = [] for i in range(window_size, len(df)): row = [[a] for a in df_np[i-window_size:i,0]] label = df_np[i-1,1:] X.append(row) y.append(label) return np.array(X), np.array(y) I am using Keras and this is the model I came up with; model1 = Sequential() model1.add(InputLayer((12, 1))) model1.add(LSTM(64)) model1.add(Dense(32, 'relu')) model1.add(Dense(2, 'sigmoid')) cp1 = ModelCheckpoint('models/model1/', save_best_only=True) model1.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), metrics=['accuracy']) model1.fit(X2, y2, epochs=10, callbacks=[cp1]) This is not giving me good results. There are a total of 12 ones (True) values for device 1 and 4 Trues for device 2 in my test data but it is not predicting one even once. I tried this model as well but no luck. model2 = Sequential() model2.add(InputLayer((12, 1))) # model2.add(LSTM(64, activation = 'tanh', recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid')) model2.add(LSTM(64)) If someone's interested this is the detailed explanation of the task. The task at hand involves developing a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) program that classifies continuous aggregate power loads into switching events. The dataset contains aggregate power loads and switching events for specific appliances. The goal is to analyze the data and develop an algorithm that accurately classifies the continuous aggregate power into switching events. The classification algorithm needs to identify the patterns in the continuous aggregate power, and accurately predicts switching events.
