What are some options for an offline chatbot on Android?

I have already created an online chatbot for my Android app using Dialogflow (formerly api.ai). It allows users to add a new item to their inventory. I now need to create an offline version of this chatbot. However, Dialogflow does not allow you to download the agent to work offline. I have looked into several options, including RiveScript and ALICE (Pandorabots). These seem to be a bit too low-level for my purposes and require quite a bit of customization. I was wondering if there are any options similar to Dialogflow that can be used offline.
