Standard deviation of a ratio and calculation of weight

I have several "skilled" and "unskilled" wage observations for a number of countries, and would like to construct a single skilled-unskilled wage premium by country as the ratio of the simple average of skilled and unskilled wages. Since individual wage reports are noisy, I would like to give more weight to wage premium estimates that have a reasonable number of observations in both categories in subsequent analyses. What would be a reasonable way of calculating the weight for each wage premium estimate? We can assume that the error terms of skilled and unskilled wage reports from a country are independently and normally distributed. Some more considerations: If it was just one average wage, I think the central limit theorem suggests to weight each average by the square root of the number of observations that gave rise to it since Sd^(meanwage)=Sd^(individ. wage)/sqrt(N), and hence the standard deviation of the average decreases in the square root of N. What is the analogous formula for Sd^(meanwage_skilled/meanwage_unskilled)? And given that it will likely be a little more complicated and involve the number of both skilled and unskilled wage observations, any suggestions on how to translate this into a weight for the wage premium? Thanks!
