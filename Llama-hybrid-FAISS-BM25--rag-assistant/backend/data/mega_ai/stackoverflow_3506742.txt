With collaboration from Amro and Jonas variable_ranks = tiedrank(variable_data')'; Ranker has been replaced by the Matlab function in the Stat toolbox (sorry for those who don't have it), [R,TIEADJ] = tiedrank(X) computes the ranks of the values in the vector X. If any X values are tied, tiedrank computes their average rank. The return value TIEADJ is an adjustment for ties required by the nonparametric tests signrank and ranksum, and for the computation of Spearman's rank correlation. TIEDRANK will compute along columns in Matlab 7.9.0 (R2009b), however it is undocumented. So by transposing the input matrix, rows turn into columns and will rank them. The second transpose is then used to organize the data in the same manner as the input. There in essence is a very classy hack :p
