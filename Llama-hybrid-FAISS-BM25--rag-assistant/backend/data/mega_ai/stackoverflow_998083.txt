You can check out Infobright Community or Enterprise Edition, I think. It is column-oriented storage designed for analytics purposes and big (existing installations up to 30 TB now as they say) data and good compression rate. Data loader are also pretty fast and connectors exists for ETL-tools (Talend, kettle and so on). Community edition available free under GNU GPL terms, but allows to add data only via native loader. Enterprise edition supports add/update by single row via DML. Another benefit that you can use it with all tools that supports MySQL connections. Column-orientation allow you, f.e., add columns for date component on every needed aggregation level (I use date, week numbers, months and qtr.) for better performance, but it's good without it as well. I use it for relatively small (yet) amount of business transactions data for analytic purposes with R as data analysis tool via mysql interface and python (numpy) scripts as some kind of ETL. Cons: lack of official utf-8 support, aggregation by function values (select month(date from ...)) not implemented yet (plan: july 2009, AFAIK), but I use ETL for this.
