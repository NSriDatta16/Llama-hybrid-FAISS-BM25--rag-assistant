PCA Interpreting strong negative and positive loadings

I ran a PCA on survey data asking whether respondents trust different levels of government, where they rank their level of trust from 0-7. Whilst I can interpret PC1 as a weighted average of individual scores for each variable (Local, Regional, National, International), I can't understand how to interpret PC2. Would it be correct to assume that positive scores on PC2 indicate higher trust in Regional and National governments whilst negative scores indicate higher trust in International Governments?
