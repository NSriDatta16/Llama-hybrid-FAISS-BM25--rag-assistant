How are residuals calculated in rugarch package

I have a question regarding the "rugarch" package in R. I try to fit a ARMA(1,1)+GARCH(1,1) to a time series $x$ using the following command: spec The code above gives me the following result: Optimal Parameters ------------------------------------ Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) mu 0.001001 0.001315 0.761040 0.446633 ar1 0.008470 0.351193 0.024118 0.980759 ma1 0.119446 0.345840 0.345379 0.729809 omega 0.000025 0.000016 1.571823 0.115992 alpha1 0.127315 0.053834 2.364961 0.018032 beta1 0.814652 0.069936 11.648563 0.000000` Now my question is the following, how are the residuals calculated? The one you obtain from the command residuals(fitted) ? I mean for me I would assume that for instance, if $r_t$ is residual at time $t$: $r_t = x_t - \mu - AR_1x_{t-1} - MA_1r_{t-1}$ But already for their first residuals, how do you obtain it? Here are my values of $x$ : $x_1 = 0.009888849$ $x_2 = -0.008468736$ $x_3=0.014004795$ and the residuals from command residuals(fitted) : $r_1=0.008887706$, $r_2=-0.010606758$ $r_3=0.014350796$. Using my method I get: $r_1 = x_1 -\mu = 0.007927641 \neq r_1$ $r_2 = x_1 - \mu - AR_1 x_1 - MA_1 r_1 = -0.01099179$ and so on. Basically it is not far, but it is also not what they have, so I would like to know if someone could tell me what I am missing here? Thanks!
