Migrating Portal to completely different host

Pretty new to DNN so please be kind... I am assisting a friend who hosts websites for many non-profit organizations. He is trying to migrate all of them to DNN to allow them to maintain the sites themselves. One was set up successfully last year as PortalID = 0 and uses the default database. Then a friend requested hosting on DNN and we set them up as another portal as PortalID = 1. Now this friend is moving hosts and we are somewhat in a quandary. It looks like all portal data is being stored in the same default database. Our question is how do we moved the portal data into individual databases so it will be quite easy to backup the database and send it to the client? And where do we set up the databases when we create a new portal? Or did we set this up incorrectly? Please be somewhat specific if you answer. I am a newbie.
