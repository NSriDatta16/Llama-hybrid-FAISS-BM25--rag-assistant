capture the last WM_SIZE

When I resize my window I want to tell another part of my program that my window has changed size. I read on MSDN that: WM SIZE Message The WM SIZE message is sent to a window after its size has changed. However, I receive the WM_SIZE even when dragging. I noticed that there is also a WM_SIZING message that is sent when my window is resizing. At the moment I do not see the difference between WM_SIZE and WM_SIZING. Is there some way I can capture the very last WM_SIZE message, as to not "spam" my program with resize messages?
