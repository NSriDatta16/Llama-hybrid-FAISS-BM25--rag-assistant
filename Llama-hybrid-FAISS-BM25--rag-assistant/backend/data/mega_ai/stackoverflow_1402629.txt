I wasn't at WWDC but I did buy the (whole) set, and basically... it's worth it. I don't have $500 lying around just like that, but the vids are a pretty awesome / high quality and more importantly, a compact and content-packed resource of information regarding iPhone/Mac development which I'd otherwise spend on a couple books and countless hours of googling, asking, research etc etc.. and basically it allowed me to circumvent newbie-errors and give me a headstart in many areas I'd otherwise wouldn't have had. Depending on how much your average hour is 'worth' professionally, these videos will pay of rather sooner than later, let alone the sample code.
