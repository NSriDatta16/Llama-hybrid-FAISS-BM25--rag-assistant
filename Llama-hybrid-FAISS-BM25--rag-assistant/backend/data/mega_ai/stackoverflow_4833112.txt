How do I get like to return data from multiple tables?

I'm trying to modify the following query to return data from multiple tables. I have the main contacts table where all contact details are stored. Companies are also stored in the Contacts table. Companies are mapped to Contacts in a join table named CompanyPersonMap. I also have an attributes table where the contacts are assigned certain attributes, possibly many per contact. Now, I want to return all the contacts that have a certain attribute assigned PLUS the person's Company name and address found in a different row in the Contacts table. This code works but only returns the contactId. Fine for what I needed but I can't figure out how to modify it for the above requirement. var peopleAndAddresses = Contacts.Where(c => c.AssignedAttributes .Any (aa => aa.AttributeID == 1153)) .Select(x => x.ContactID); Any suggestions for doing this? Thanks! Edit- I tried working on the .Select() statement and found the path from the contact to its organzation via the PersonOrgMap table. Unfortunately, I can't get any of the data about the organization. I tried .Any(), .All(), and .FirstOrDefault(). Any suggestions? .Select (c => new {c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.PersonOrgMap.FirstOrDefault (pom => pom.ChildContactID) })
