Neural nets form a broad class of models, and cover many parts of the taxonomy you're describing (and even extend outside it). An individual neural net (or subclass of them) could be placed into the taxonomy, but the entire class of neural nets cannot. For example, neural nets can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning problems, depending on the loss function. They can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the network architecture and activation function. Many other models (e.g. linear/logistic regression, kernel machines, PCA, etc.) are equivalent to a particular form of neural net. Neural nets can also be used to solve problems that are not statistical learning problems at all. For example, Hopfield nets can be used to solve optimization problems. There are even computationally universal neural nets that can implement every possible algorithm (see here , but this is a theoretical construction that would not be used in practice).
