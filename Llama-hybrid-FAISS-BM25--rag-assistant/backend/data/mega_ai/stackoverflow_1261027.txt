C++ unit testing with Microsoft MFC

I'm trying to convince my organization to start running unit tests on our C++ code. This is a two-part question: Any tips on convincing my employer that unit testing saves money in the long run? (They have a hard time justifying the immediate expenses.) I'm not familiar with any C++ testing frameworks that integrate well with MFC. Does anyone have experience with this, or use any general test harnesses that could be extended?
