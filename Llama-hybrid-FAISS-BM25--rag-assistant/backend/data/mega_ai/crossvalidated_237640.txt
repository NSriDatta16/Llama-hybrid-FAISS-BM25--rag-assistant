If you have an hard rule (Temperature >= 70 degree & stable for 10 readings) , you don't Machine Learning. If you want to learn a better rule to detect failure from temperature alone (maybe associated to the equipment associated to the sensor) you can use machine learning or, in this specific case, time series analysis. There's a lot of stuff already done on the subject, I believe.
