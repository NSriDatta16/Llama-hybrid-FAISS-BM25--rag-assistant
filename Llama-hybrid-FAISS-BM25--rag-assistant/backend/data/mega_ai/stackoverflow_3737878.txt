iOS 4.2: Flip image using block animations

I had this piece of code im my app: [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1]; [UIView setAnimationTransition:UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromLeft forView:imgView cache:YES]; imgView.image = img2; [UIView commitAnimations]; But use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later, and I should use transitionWithView:duration:options:animations:completion: I cant get this to work properly. Can anyone help me? Thx!
