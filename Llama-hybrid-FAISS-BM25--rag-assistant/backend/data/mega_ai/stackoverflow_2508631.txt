Pay attention to URLs, they make a big deal both for SEO and user friendliness. Some reading: Cool URIs don't change (w3.org) URL normalization (wikipedia.org) Update: I must add – to clarify my opinion about the whole SEO thing – that after you ignore some jibba-jabba from SEO industry (hey, it's their business!), what remains is mostly about good practices (technical, usability), which have existed long before they were given a (marketing) term "SEO": accessible, structured, relevant content under descriptive title & url. Just common sense things, which optimizes for users as well as search engines.
