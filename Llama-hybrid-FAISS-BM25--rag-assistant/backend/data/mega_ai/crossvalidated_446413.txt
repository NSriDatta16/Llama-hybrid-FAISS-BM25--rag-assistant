This is all in the documentation of package plm , e.g., the package's vignette. I believe you got confused due to the various fixed effects you would like to estimate. You would need to specify correctly what the observational units (individual dimension) and what the time dimension of your data is and put those into the index argument. If you look at firms, the industry (variable SEC ) is not the individual dimension but firm is the individual dimension (I will assume firm indentifiers are in variable firm ; looking at your data, it seems like it is ASSET4.Company.Name ). Now, I suggest you set up the data for panel structure first and then estimate the model (I consider this a somewhat cleaner approach). Set up data: pdata Let's fist estimate a two-way fixed effects model with individual (firm) and time fixed effects: fe1 To add more fixed effects, include them in the formula with factor(your_variable) like this for industry: fe2 The approach by Robert with the R packages lme4 (or nlme ) is a maximum likelihood approach. plm 's vignette contains a comparision and there are some good questions and answers about both approaches here on Cross Validated. What I laid out here is probably more what econometricians use and what you originally asked for.
