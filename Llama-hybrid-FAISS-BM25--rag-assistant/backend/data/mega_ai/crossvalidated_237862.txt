Bayesian Update for two Normal Random Variables following one observation of difference between them

Let's say we have a Normal Random Variable with unknown mean and variance. We want to estimate the mean and variance given a normal choice for a prior and some data. Let's call it X . Also there's another Normal Random Variable, also with unknown mean and variance It has it's own prior, which can be similarly parameterized. Let's call it Y . Then we observe the following: d = x - y where x and y are occurrences of X and Y respectively. We don't actually know what x and y are; all we see is d . We wish to update the hyperparameters of X and Y based on observing this data. My questions are: Is this a known problem with a solution worked out? If not, does anyone have any ideas of how to attack it?
