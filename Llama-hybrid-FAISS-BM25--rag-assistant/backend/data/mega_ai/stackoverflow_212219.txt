What are good starting points for someone interested in natural language processing?

Question So I've recently came up with some new possible projects that would have to deal with deriving 'meaning' from text submitted and generated by users. Natural language processing is the field that deals with these kinds of issues, and after some initial research I found the OpenNLP Hub and university collaborations like the attempto project . And stackoverflow has this . If anyone could link me to some good resources, from reseach papers and introductionary texts to apis, I'd be happier than a 6 year-old kid opening his christmas presents! Update Through one of your recommendations I've found opencyc ( 'the world's largest and most complete general knowledge base and commonsense reasoning engine' ). Even more amazing still, there's a project that is a distilled version of opencyc called UMBEL . It features semantic data in rdf/owl/skos n3 syntax. I've also stumbled upon antlr , a parser generator for 'constructing recognizers, interpreters, compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions' . And there's a question on here by me, that lists tons of free and open data . Thanks stackoverflow community!
