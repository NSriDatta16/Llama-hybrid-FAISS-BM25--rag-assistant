Having weird accuracy graph on deep learning binary classification model

I am doing deep learning binary classification on some data and got very weird results with the accuracy metric. In the first few epochs, it doesn't change at all but then it goes on this weird linear path. I have attached a picture below. Can someone tell me what this means since I am new to machine learning and I am used to nice logarithmic graphs?
