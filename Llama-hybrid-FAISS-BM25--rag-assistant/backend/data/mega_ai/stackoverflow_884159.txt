SQL: Calculating system load statistics

I have a table like this that stores messages coming through a system: Message ------- ID (bigint) CreateDate (datetime) Data (varchar(255)) I've been asked to calculate the messages saved per second at peak load. The only data I really have to work with is the CreateDate. The load on the system is not constant, there are times when we get a ton of traffic, and times when we get little traffic. I'm thinking there are two parts to this problem: 1. Determine ranges of time that are considered peak load, 2. Calculate the average messages per second during these times. Is this the right approach? Are there things in SQL that can help with this? Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
