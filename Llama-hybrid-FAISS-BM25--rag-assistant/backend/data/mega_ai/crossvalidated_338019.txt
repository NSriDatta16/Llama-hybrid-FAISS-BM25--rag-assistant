Please see the Lehmann Scheffe theorem (Theorem 2 in http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/cji/lecture9.pdf ), which states that if $U$ is a complete sufficient statistic, and $T$ is an unbiased estimator, than $E(T|U)$ is UMVUE. In your case, you have $ T = U $. Please check your claims about unbiasedness: A variant of your problem is addressed in https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/150586/expected-value-of-max-of-iid-variables?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa , where one of the answers show that the estimate is in fact biased
