I'm chiming in here because I can't find more current discussions on the topic of using moving average data as an INPUT to exponential smoothing. The OP is concerned about this -- my situation is the opposite in that I would feel more confident. Why? We have seasonality across the 12 months but our sales have some random factors which include how many Wednesdays are in a month and random purchasing behavior from customers. Month to month our sales can vary greatly but the long term trend is usually very apparent. I don't want to straight-line the forecast because it does have seasonality, but the month-to-month swings predicted by a triple exponential smoothing calculation relying on 12 month seasonality is just too large -- people will expect that a forecast of 300 in July and 100 in August really means we expect to sell three times the amount in July vs. August, but that's just what happened last year -- the forecast is really selling about 200 each month because the monthly variation is truly "noise." I was hoping to find some slick formulas to use excel's FORECAST.ETS function but smoothing the data to a 3 month moving average first (all within one formula -- I can do the moving averages directly but it makes the table huge and unwieldy). Unfortatenly nothing is coming up. But specifically to the OP I think I understand the reason for doing the smoothing on rolling average data -- it's because reducing the granularity of the data just creates noise (perhaps).
