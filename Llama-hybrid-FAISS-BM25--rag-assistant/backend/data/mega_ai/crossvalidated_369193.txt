The right-hand side of your glm formula needs some attention. If you have 3 factors which can potentially affect your outcome, you should define each of them separately in your data and then include them in your model. Something like this: glm(Outcome ~ Buffers*Nutrients*pH, ..., data = Data) where your Data would look like this: Outcome Buffers Nutrients pH ? Type1 Ca 6.5 ? Type1 Mg 6.5 ? Type2 Ca 6.5 ? Type2 Mg 6.5 Etc. It's not clear from your figure whether you have two levels for pH as well? The formula Outcome ~ Buffers*Nutrients*pH implies that the effect of Buffers on the Outcome may be different for different combinations of levels of Nutrients and pH. Similarly, the effect of Nutrients on the Outcome may be different for different combinations of levels of Buffers and pH, etc. In other words, you have a 3-way interaction between the three factors. You didn't provide enough information about your survival rate outcome to warrant more specific comments on the rest of your glm formula implementation. Do you run several trials for each combination of levels of your 3 factors? What do you measure in each of those trials? How do you use that information to determine the value of your outcome variable?
