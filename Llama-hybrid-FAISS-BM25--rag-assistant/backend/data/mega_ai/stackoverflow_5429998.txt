Try setting the User-Agent header for your request. FB and many other services often refuse to serve request with no User-Agent set. EDIT: It can be done like this: curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,array('User-Agent: AnythingYouLikeHere')); EDIT 2: The part about redirects is also true. To let cURL automatically take care of redirect handling, you can do this: curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,true);
