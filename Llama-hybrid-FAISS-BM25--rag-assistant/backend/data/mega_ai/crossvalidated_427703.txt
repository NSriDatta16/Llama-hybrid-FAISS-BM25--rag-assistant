randomForest same formula different results (with same seed!)

I am using randomForest function with same seeds, but gives different results. (with Boston dataset) set.seed=500 regressor = randomForest(x = training_set, y = training_set$medv, ntree = 100) Call: randomForest(x = training_set, y = training_set$medv, ntree = 100) Type of random forest: regression Number of trees: 100 No. of variables tried at each split: 4 Mean of squared residuals: 0.03206772 % Var explained: 96.78 OR : set.seed=500 regressor =randomForest(medv ~ . , data = training_set,ntree=100) Call: randomForest(formula = medv ~ ., data = training_set, ntree = 100) Type of random forest: regression Number of trees: 100 No. of variables tried at each split: 4 Mean of squared residuals: 0.1248719 % Var explained: 87.48 Gives different call results. Any helps? Thanks
