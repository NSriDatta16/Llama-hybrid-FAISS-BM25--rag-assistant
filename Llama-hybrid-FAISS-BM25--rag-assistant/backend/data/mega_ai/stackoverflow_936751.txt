Java crash outside JVM - works on Windows not on Linux

I am using OpenNLP and my English NameFinder on Linux (CentOS 5.3,Java 1.6.0_13) keeps giving me this error: An unexpected error has been detected by Java Runtime Environment: SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x0657e436, pid=3484, tid=2291964816 Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (11.3-b02 mixed mode linux-x86) Problematic frame: V [libjvm.so+0x57e436] An error report file with more information is saved as: /home/continuum/workspace/entity-extraction-data-service/hs_err_pid3484.log If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit: http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp The crash happened outside the Java Virtual Machine in native code. See problematic frame for where to report the bug. However, on Windows it works fine. I'm thinking perhaps a character encoding issue might be my problem, however I would like to see if anyone else has any thoughts on this or have run into it before. Thanks. Update: Other Java applications run fine.
