Significance (p-value) in regression/size of parameter estimate

In a linear (OLS) regression, I find that the sizes of the coefficients vary a lot: one of them is about 0.0005 and another is ~150. The p-values are all under 0.1. Is this reliable result? These are time-series variables by the way. Separately, in another OLS time series regression, I am finding a variable to be significant which according to the business client, should not be. This variable has much higher variance than other input variables we tried in the model and also has high correlation with the dependent variable. COUld the low p-value/statistical significance/ high correlation arise due to the variance? The other variables have low variance over the observed time period. Thanks for any insight.
