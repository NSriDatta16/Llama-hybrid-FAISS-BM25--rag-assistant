Can't you compute the center of the graphicspath and a radius? You could either compute center of gravity (average of coordinates) and add 2 times standard deviation - this should get you around 92% of your graph - most of the time it would be good, but will fail if your graph has most 'weight' in one end. You could also compute the center of the points - run through all points, get max/min points in all directions as when computing boundingbox, take the center of this and measure longest distance to your (max/min) points as radius. You could probably find a more sophisticated algorithm if you look for a bounding sphere algorithm - but if it is just to display something you could do some trade offs. If you are doing collision detection there exists some quick algorithms for that too :)
