RNN also means Random Neural Network. Its approximation capability was proved in two papers: Erol Gelenbe, Zhi-Hong Mao, Yan-Da Li: Function approximation with spiked random networks. IEEE Trans. Neural Networks 10(1): 3-9 (1999) Erol Gelenbe, Zhi-Hong Mao and Yan-Da Li: Function Approximation by Random Neural Networks with a Bounded Number of Layers, Advances in Computer Science and Engineering: Texts. Computer System Performance Modeling in Perspective, pp. 35-58 (2006) https://doi.org/10.1142/9781860948923_0005
