Keep in mind that while I have a Masters in Applied Statistics, I'm going to give you a very simple answer: take a course on probabilities. Most of the modern ML programming frameworks take a large majority of the math out of data science; you really just won't need it in most scenarios. But you will always need the ability to understand your results and the majority of results are expressed in probabilities. If I was new to data science I would take a (brief) course on probabilities, seek to understand what proportions and percentages really mean and then I would work to know a framework (like Tensorflow) really, really well. If you can do that, you can write some really interesting algorithms and not have to be obsessive about the math.
