Your Java Web Start program runs on the client, but your JDBC driver is loaded by your Tomcat server - those are two different environments running in two different JVMs. You say that you have a reference to your JDBC driver in your JNLP file - this is the part you need to look at. The jar file that contains your driver needs to be downloadable by the Web Start client through HTTP. I'm guessing that this is where the chain is broken. That said, I wonder about the safety of letting your clients download a JDBC driver and connect to your database. Bytecode isn't terribly hard to reverse engineer, and jar files are just a special case of zip compression.
