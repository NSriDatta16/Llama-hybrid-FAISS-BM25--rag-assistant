Need a good website URL to test against

I need a URL to just test basic http connectivity. It needs to be consistent and: Always be up Never change drastically due to IP or user agent. (IE: 301 Location redirect/ huge difference in content... minor would be tolerable) The URL itself has a consistent content-length. (IE: it doesn't vary from by 2kb at most, ever) A few examples, yet none match all 3 criteria: One example of always up: www.google.com (yet it 301 redirects based on IP location). Another good one is http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en . but the problem there is that based on a given holiday, the content-length can really vary.
