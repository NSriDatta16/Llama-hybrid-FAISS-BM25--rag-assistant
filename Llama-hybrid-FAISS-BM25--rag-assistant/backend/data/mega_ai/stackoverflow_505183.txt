Lucene uses its own internal "caching" mechanism to make index retrieval a fast operation. I don't think caching is your issue here, though. A 5000-index document sounds trivial in size, but this largely depends on how you're constructing your index, what you're indexing/storing, how you're querying (operationally), document size, etc. Please fill in the blanks with as much information as you can about your index.
