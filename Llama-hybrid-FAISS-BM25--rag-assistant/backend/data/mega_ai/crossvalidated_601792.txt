OK, to be honest i don't know if i'm not missing something from simple trigonomethry, but here's my solution. From the standardized set of plot_values obtained in the previous code, you can create a simple plot and look at it: plot(plot_values) plot(plot_values, type="l") What visually makes a decrease in the steepness of the graph? That a line is at an angle of less than 45 degrees to the horizontal axis. Here we got first line with more than 45 degrees. Given that the graph/plot points are standardized, the distances between the individual objects are the same (they are 1, that is line a) then the steepness ends where the direct value relative to the next point (line c) is simply less than the y-axis 1. Then the line b will be directed at an angle less than 45 degrees and its steepness will end. So we can find it like this: # make new variable plot_values2 = plot_values # let's leave the heights of the triangles the same, # that is, let's subtract the next value from the previous one for (i in 1:(length(plot_values2)-1)) { plot_values2[i] = plot_values2[i] - plot_values2[i+1] } # with last value = 0 not to distort our results plot_values2[length(plot_values2)] = 0 # let's get first result lower than 1, and that's it number_of_PCA_factors = (match(TRUE, (plot_values2 If there is something wrong with this set of code, please let me know or correct it.
