You'd have to regularly poll the table somehow, from a client, windows service or SQL Server Agent. Of course, you don't know if it will be picked up or picked up twice: it is possible I'd consider creating a SQL Server Agent job when the row is inserted to pick this up if you don't have too many (for managability rather then any upper limit)
