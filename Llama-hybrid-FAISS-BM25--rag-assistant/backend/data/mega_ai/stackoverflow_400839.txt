Is it possible to get high quality graphics in 2D?

I'm considering between using 2D and 3D for a game am leaning towards 2D, but most of the 2D games that I see look like they're hand drawn and the graphics don't really look good. Is it possible to create slick-looking graphics in 2D at all? I was thinking of animations such as: Rays coming out of the hands/eyes of a player that attack the opponent Fire coming out of dragon's mouth A glow coming from a player or an orb that glows Fireballs being produced during fights Are these things possible in 2D without that 'amateur'/'hand drawn'/DOS game kind of look in them?
