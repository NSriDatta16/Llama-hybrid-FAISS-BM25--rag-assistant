The question is what is the difference between the two methods? Well if you read the API you will find the difference. In the first case the component is added at the "end" of the container. In the second case the component is added at the "specified position" in the container. Since there is only one component added to the DragLayer, theorectically it shouldn't make a difference which add method is used. However, because you also have a component on the DefaultLayer, it may may a difference. The only way to know for sure is to look at the source code. However as has already been suggested in your other posting. This code should not be done in the mouseDragged() event. As multiple drag events are generated, it does not make sense to continually "add" the chess piece to the drag layout. All you need to do is change the location of the chess piece as the mouse is moved. That is why the mousePressed() event is used to add the chess piece to the drag layer.
