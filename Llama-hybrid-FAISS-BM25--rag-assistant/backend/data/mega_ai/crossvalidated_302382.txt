You can use 2, e, or 10, it should be fine, and this isn't really exact science since you're assuming it's logarithmic without any basis anyway. But... if you really want to be precise, then finding an unknown parameter that best fits the data is the whole idea behind machine learning! you can run any machine learning algorithm to predict the accuracy based on the N. The simplest, and maybe best here to avoid overfitting, is just to use linear regression to predict accuracy from log of N. In general, you're trying to find base b to minimize the squared distance from the data you have, you can fins it with gradient descent. Or more simply in this case, just calculate the sum or squared distances for a bunch of dots, for a closed set of possible b - 2,e,3,4...10, and see which one is the best.. good luck!
