I have a pre-commit hook that might fit the bill. This hook allows you to completely ban the use of certain file names based upon a regular expression. You can ban any file that starts with "._" and if someone tries to add one, they won't be able to commit it. After a few rejected commits due to having "._" files, developers will update their global-ignores to include those files. You can't set global-ignores for all of your users, but this pre-commit hook will encourage your users to set it on their own. It works on the same principle of how electric sockets discourage users from sticking a fork into them. After the third or fourth time, even the most stubborn developers learn that it's not a good idea.
