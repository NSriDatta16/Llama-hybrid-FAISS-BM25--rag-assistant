Yes, well, mostly. Open the KatMouse dialog by right clicking and choosing settings. Go to the Classes tab, and drag the icon on the bottom of the dialog to an open vs2010 window. That'll add the new class to KatMouse. Now double click that new entry to bring up the settings for that class, and turn off the "Window has wheel scrolling support" checked box. Unfortunately it seems like the class name changes for every source window, so I think you have tell KatMouse about every source window every time you launch vs. :(
