You can create a Library in Simulink that contains code you can reference multiple times. Go to File -> New -> Library. In the model window that opens, you can create any number of subsystems with whatever code you want. Then, just drag a subsystem from the library into your model. The subsystem will now appear in your model with a little arrow icon in the lower left. This indicates that the subsystem in the model is a link. You can drag as many instances of the library subsystem into your model as you wish, just as you can call a function as many times as you wish in any other programming language. If you right-click on the subsystem in your model, you can select "Link Options -> Go To Library Block" to get back to the library. You can make changes in your model and propogate them back to the library as well.
