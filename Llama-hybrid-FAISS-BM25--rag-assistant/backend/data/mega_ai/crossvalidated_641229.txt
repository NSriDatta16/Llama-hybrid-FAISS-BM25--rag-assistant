What you can also do is to start by performing PCA e.g. with prcomp function in R, then perform a spearman correlation between the eigenvalues(rotations) and your target numerical variable for each pc. Rank the correlation coefficients for the respective pcs. This will help identify which pc has the strongest correlation with your target variable. Then obtain say the top 10% features with the highest absolute loading scores (eigen values) for the pc with highest correlation with your target variable and feed these features for lasso regression, where you also use cross validation. The lasso will help you identify features that have predictive value for your outcome. You can then use features with predictive influence for your outcome as predictors of your linear model. In summary my suggested approach puts pca before lasso. It works for me pretty well.
