Test-driven development, which you used as your example, isn't really a "design pattern". Design patterns are ways of structuring your program to solve common, but abstract problems. A classic example is the Factory pattern. When you want to encapsulate (i.e., prevent the caller from messing with) aspects of object creation, you use a Factory to handle the process of making a new object. You might want to run a Google search for the "Gang of Four", who wrote the textbook on design patterns (found here ).
