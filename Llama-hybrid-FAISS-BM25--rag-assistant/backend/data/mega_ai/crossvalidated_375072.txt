I think you are providing support for the efficient market hypothesis : The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a theory in financial economics that states that asset prices fully reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information. Essentially, this means that the optimal forecast for future prices is the current price, which already carries all the information there is. Equivalently, the optimal forecast for price movements (i.e., differences in consecutive prices) is zero. Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street is a nice nontechnical introduction. There may simply not be much information in your data, even if the strong EMH may be false. You may need to leverage external information. Also relevant: Is it unusual for the MEAN to outperform ARIMA? and How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
