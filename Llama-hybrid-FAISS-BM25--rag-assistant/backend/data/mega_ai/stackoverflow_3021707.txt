Calling a wsdl in php over https using Zend Soap Client

When I'm trying to connect to a webservice I always get the next fault SoapFault exception: [s:Sender] An error occurred when verifying security for the message I also have to use a security header, full soap request is send: http://ws.agiv.be/crabtools/ICRABTools/GetAddressLocation urn:uuid:10000001blsd-ghfs http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous https://grab.beta.agiv.be/Tools/CRABTools.svc 2010-06-09T13:44:19Z 2010-06-09T13:49:19Z myUsername myPassword 2306852 My username and password are correct, I have allready tried to change the expiration date later but that doesn't solve it. What else could be the reason for this fault? Maybe I have to configure more things in my php-code. I created a class that overrides Zend_Soap_Client public function __soapCall($function_name, $arguments, $options=null, $input_headers=null, $output_headers=null) { $inputheaders = array($this->wsactionheader(),$this->unencryptedSecurityHeader()); $result = parent::__soapCall($this->functionname, $arguments, $options, $inputheaders); return $result; }
