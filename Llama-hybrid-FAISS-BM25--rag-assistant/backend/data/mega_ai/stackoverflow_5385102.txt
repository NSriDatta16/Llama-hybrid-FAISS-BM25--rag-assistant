While the first example sets DX and DY relatively to your current label location, the second example ignores the current location of the current location of your label. For example, if your current label location is (50,50) and you want to move it by (30,30). if you press the mouse when pointing to (70,70) (assuming it's within the label boundries): In your first example DX will be set to -20 and DY will be set to -20. Now, after the drag the new location will be (as mouseDragged implements) ((70+30)-20, (70+30)-20) = (80, 80) which is correct. In your second example DX will be set to -70, as well as DY. Now, after the drag, the new location will be (100-70, 100-70) = (30,30) which is wrong.
