Java side scrolling game on android

I'm trying to make an easy side scrolling game just to learn the ropes of game programming on android. I came up with a solution of how to make it but I don't really think it is the most elegant solution. I wanted to get some different ideas on how to implement my game, as I really have no other solution right now. Here is a quick explanation of how it works.. I basically have blocks or objects fall from the top of the screen. The blocks are defined from a pre-defined string I create using a custom 'map-editor'. I create all the blocks at compile time, position them on or off the screen and simply increment their coordinates with each iteration of the gameloop. It is actually done a little bit better then that, but that gives a short easy explanation on the basic idea. I heard from a few people that instead of incrementing each block position, have the blocks stay there and simply change the viewable area. That makes sense, but I have no idea how to do it. Can anyone share some ideas or links on how I can implement something like this? I know my current solution isn't the greatest. Thanks!
