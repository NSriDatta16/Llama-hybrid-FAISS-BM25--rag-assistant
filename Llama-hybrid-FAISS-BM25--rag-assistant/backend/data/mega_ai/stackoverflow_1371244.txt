C# Arrays & Properties

I'm pretty darn new to C# and I can't figure out how to express something pretty simple. I have a 3D array that is private. I have no problem with the function that exposes the contents to read: public Terrain Tile(int x, int y, int z) { return .... but I also want an internal function that provides read/write access with a coordinate transformation. There seems to be no way to specify a setter. Looking at Microsoft's site it appears that it wants [] 's instead of () 's but that results in the compiler thinking it's an array definition and of course it barfs all over the place. Googling elsewhere I find plenty of people trying to modify a field of something returning a reference type which of course fails but this array is full of enums, not reference types. Of course I can write a SetTile(x, y, z, terrain) function but being able to access it as an array is so much more clear & elegant, yet it appears to be impossible.
