T-SQL Query Help

I'm having trouble getting my queries to return appropriate results for the following queries though: For a given specific date list the guests that are scheduled to check out, group ed by the villa type; additionally also present their count. The guest reservation table has the following columns with data: ( confirm_no, agent_id, g_name, g_phone) The reservation table has the following columns with data: (confirm_no, credit_card_no, res_checkin_date, res_checkout_date, default_villa_type, price_plan) . SELECT g_name, default_villa_type FROM guest_reservation, reservation WHERE guest_reservation.confirm_no = reservation.confirm_no AND res_checkout_date = 24/12/2010 order by default_villa_type, g_name; SELECT COUNT(*) as total_checking_out FROM reservation WHERE res_checkout_date = 24/12/2010 Shouldn't that query work? When I run it, I get NO errors simply no results returned (and the count is 0), and looking at my table I know there should be 2 guest names returning as they checkout that day. Help?
