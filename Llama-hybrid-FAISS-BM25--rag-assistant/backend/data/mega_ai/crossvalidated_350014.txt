Will I loose a lot by doing a 2D stack VS a 3D cube? That is hard to say; I recommend trying the easy approach first and if you are unsatisfied with the results, proceed to a 3D network. From your description it sounds that the data are quite easy and the 2D approach could actually work. Is it even doable to do a 3D cube? Yes, convolutional networks operating on 3D data are not uncommon, especially in domains like medical imaging. These networks, however, suffer usually from the GPU memory limitations, so you will probably have to make trade-offs in terms of network depth and layer sizes.
