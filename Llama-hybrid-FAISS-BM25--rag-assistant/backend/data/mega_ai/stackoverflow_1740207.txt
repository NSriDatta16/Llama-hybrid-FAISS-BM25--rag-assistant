One reason could be historically, many computers did not have mixed case capabilities. In the days of COBOL , programs were all upper case. In the early 80's many 'personal computers' only came with upper case fonts. For example, you could get a lower case extender card for the Apple II+. When programs began allowing for mixed case, camel case was not popular. Many programs took what used to be in all caps, and just converted to lower case. Through the 80's various languages attributed meaning to case, and in the 90's Java popularized the camelCase syntax. Languages which have an older history, or are tied more closely to unix system programming tend to avoid making semantic use of mixed case.
