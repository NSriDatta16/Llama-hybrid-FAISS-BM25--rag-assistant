many-to-many not persisting in gorm/grails app

I have roughly the following in my grails 1.1 app class AppCategory { static belongsTo = App static hasMany = [ apps: App ] String name } class App { static hasMany = [ categories: AppCategory] String name } App app = new App() AppCategory appCat = AppCategory.findByName('blah') app.addToCategories(appCat) app.save() The correct tables (app, app_category and app_categories) are created and the columns all seem fine, but I don't end up with any records in the association table and no errors. The app_category table and app table are correctly populated. Do I need to manually manage a domain object for the association table? Or better yet, am I just missing something totally obvious?
