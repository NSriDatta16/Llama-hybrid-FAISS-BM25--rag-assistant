As nobody else has answered the question (Tomas's answer was not relevant), I asked a few experts in the field. Unfortunately, there is no nice way of stopping this and the best that they could come up with was to add logic in IErrorHandler to not log CommunicationExcepions with a message starting with 'The socket connection was aborted'. Not very elegant, but it does work.
