The link between AQL, RQL and the reliability of a process

The problem is to distinguish between the definitions of AQL, RQL and reliability in the field of quality control. Let us just pose the context. We wish to calculate the reliability of a manufacturing process and/or the quality of the manufactured pieces by doing attributes testing. The particularity of attributes testing is that, for each piece tested, the outcome of the test will be either 'passed' or 'failed'. I just remind here the definitions that I have at hand: AQL AQL stands for acceptance quality level. The AQL represents the poorest level of quality for the supplier's process that the consumer would consider to be acceptable in average. RQL RQL stands for risk quality level, it can be also denominated LTPD that stands for lot tolerance percent defective. The RQL is the poorest level of quality that the consumer is willing to accept in an individual lot. Reliability The process reliability is the probability that a process will perform its intended function without failure for a specified time under stated conditions. The following definitions will also be useful to go on: $\alpha$ producer's risk: $\alpha$ is the probability that a good product will be rejected as a bad product by the consumer. $\beta$ consumer's risk: $\beta$ is the probability that a product not meeting quality standards will enter the marketplace. Now, suppose we will inspect $n$ manufactured samples out of $N$ and, as soon as a default is detected, we reject the lot of $N$ items. Let us note $p_1$ for the AQL and $p_2$ for the RQL (usual notations). Then, taking into account the above, we can link $\alpha$ and $p_1$ and $\beta$ and $p_2$ thanks to the followings equations: $$ 1-\alpha = (1-p_1)^n = Prob(no \ defect \ are\ detected \ in\ the\ n \ samples | AQL = p_1), $$ $$ \beta = (1-p_2)^n = Prob(no \ defect \ are\ detected \ in\ the\ n \ samples | RQL = p_2). $$ On the other hand, the reliability $R$ is linked to the confidence level $C$ by the following equation: $$ 1-C = R^n. $$ I do not really understand what is the difference between the RQL and the reliability, and so, what formulas I should use to know how many samples I must choose to sustain with a certain confidence level that in $p$ % of the cases, my pieces are not defective. In addition, we can note that the formulas relating RQL and $\beta$ and $R$ and $C$ are the same with different parameters. The thing is that I receive pieces X from a producer and he gives me an AQL. These pieces X will then be merged with other components and I need to know what is the quality of the pieces X at the end of the process.
