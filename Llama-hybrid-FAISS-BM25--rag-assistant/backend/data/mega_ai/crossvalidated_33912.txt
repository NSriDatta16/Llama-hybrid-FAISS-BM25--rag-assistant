How do you identify the variables that separate several groups?

I don't have much background on statistics. I am working on multivariate morphometrics of a sample of frogs. I have a data matrix of 19 variables (continuous characteristics) for around 250 samples. The samples fall into 4 different groups (morphotypes). Is PCA the best way to see if the samples belonging to one group cluster together? How can one identify the variables that would contribute the most to separation of the clusters? What other methods could help in a study like this?
