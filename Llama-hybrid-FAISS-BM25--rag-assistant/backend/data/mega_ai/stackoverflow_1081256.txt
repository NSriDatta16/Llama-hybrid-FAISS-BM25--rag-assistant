I have used the 'binary buddy' system to good effect under vxworks. Basically, you portion out your heap by cutting blocks in half to get the smallest power of two sized block to hold your request, and when blocks are freed, you can make a pass up the tree to merge blocks back together to mitigate fragmentation. A google search should turn up all the info you need.
