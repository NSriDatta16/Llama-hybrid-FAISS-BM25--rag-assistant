paired t-test with a seasonality

I'm trying to test the hypothesis of whether a certain improvement of the product will affect the consumption of the products. I have a group of test subjects and I measured each test subject's consumption level before and after the product improvements(time series for each subject). But if the consumption level is related to the season, say month of the year, how can I test the hypothesis? Paired t-test doesn't seem to address the seasonality issue here.
