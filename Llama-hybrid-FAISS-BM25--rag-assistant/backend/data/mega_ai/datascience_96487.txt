DeepExplain in two different repos?

I see two different repos for "DeepExplain" neural network implementation. How do they differ? Are they the same algorithm but implemented by different people? https://github.com/slundberg/shap Deep learning example with DeepExplainer (TensorFlow/Keras models) https://github.com/marcoancona/DeepExplain
