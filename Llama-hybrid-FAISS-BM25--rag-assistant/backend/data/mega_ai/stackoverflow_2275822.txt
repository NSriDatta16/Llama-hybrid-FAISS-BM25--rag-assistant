Since you mention that it "can be cleaned up", I took the liberty of so doing: public class Thing { private String number; private String dueTime; public Thing(String number, String dueTime) { this.number = number; this.dueTime = dueTime; } public static void main(String args[]) { int x = args.length / 2; Thing[] order = new Thing[x]; for (int i = 0; i "anEvent" doesn't conform to the capitalized camel-case Java standard, so I renamed it. "Thing" isn't particularly meaningful, but there isn't much to work with here. The final else if clause can never be reached, because i % 2 either is or is not equal to zero, so I dropped it. And, of course, I'm creating new Things, which avoids the problem of the nulls. Enjoy.
