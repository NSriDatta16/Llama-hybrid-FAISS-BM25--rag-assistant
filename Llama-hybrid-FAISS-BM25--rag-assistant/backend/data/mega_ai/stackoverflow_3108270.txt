How to write a project Analysis or project brief?

We are a small (15 ppl) webdevelopment/design company with around 8 fulltime LAMP developers. In order to reduce the amount of errors we make and to prevent our budgets overtaking our estimates i've introduced some sort of technical analysis of our projects before development kicks off. This is a no brainer for an application developer but in our sector (webdev) it seems less than common practice. Up until now we just received a small brief our project manager assembled (often less than one page) and jumped head first into development with some catastrophic budgetting failures as a result. In order to tackle this problem i started reading on the subject, i've read CodeComplete2, Pragmatic Programmer and The Mythical Man-month. I think i've grabbed the concepts behind preparing and analysing a new project but i'm lacking practical examples. Does anyone know of an example technical analysis or extensive project brief that i can take a look at in order to better put the stuff i've read to practice? I'm a big fan of learn-by-example, no need to say that :)
