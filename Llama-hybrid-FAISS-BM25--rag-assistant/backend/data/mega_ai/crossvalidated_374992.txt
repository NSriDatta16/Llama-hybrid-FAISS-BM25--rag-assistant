I think your answer is right, although I'm not entirely sure about the killer line in your proof, about it being true "because they are i.i.d". A more wordy way to the same solution is as follows: Think about what $\mathbb{E}(x_{i}|T)$ actually means. You know that you have a sample with N readings and that their mean is T. What this actually means, is that now, the underlying distribution they were sampled from no longer matters (you'll notice you at no point used the fact it was sampled from a Gaussian in your proof). $\mathbb{E}(x_{i}|T)$ is the answer to the question, if you sampled from your sample, with replacement many times, what would be the average you obtained. This is the sum over all the possible values, multiplied by their probability, or $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{N}x_{i}$ which equals T.
