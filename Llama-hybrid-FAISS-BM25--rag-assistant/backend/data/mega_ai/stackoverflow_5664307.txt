Open source .NET DMS/CMS with API

I'm looking for a recommendation on an open source .NET CMS framework. The CMS framework must ALSO be specifically targetted for document management. I've posted this as a new question to: Hopefully get some fresh answers I have some unique requirements My requirements are: NO UI necessary. Not a deal killer if it does have one...but I want to leverage it SOLELY for the API. Should support document/content permissioning. Should support document/content versioning. Should use or be pluggable with a standard ASP .NET MembershipProvider/RoleProvider for authentication/authorization. Rich API (especially since I won't be leveraging the UI) for uploading/downloading content, permissioning, etc.. Should be easily pluggable into an existing ASP .NET website. Should be actively maintained (of course). Thanks.
