Time fields in Rails coming back blank

I have a simple Rails 3.b1 (Ruby 1.9.1) application running on Sqlite3. I have this table: create_table :time_tests do |t| t.time :time end And I see this behavior: irb(main):001:0> tt = TimeTest.new => # irb(main):002:0> tt.time = Time.zone.now => Mon, 03 May 2010 20:13:21 UTC +00:00 irb(main):003:0> tt.save => true irb(main):004:0> TimeTest.find(:first) => # So, the time is coming back blank. Checking the table, the data looks OK: sqlite> select * from time_tests; 1|2010-05-03 20:13:21.774741 I guess it's on the retrieval part? What's going on here?
