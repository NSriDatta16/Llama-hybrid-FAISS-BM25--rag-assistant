How to interpret marginal effects of dummy variable in logit regression?

For a project, I ran a logistic regression using continuous and dichotomous variables. How do I interpret the marginal effects of a dichotomous variable? For example, one of our independent variables that has a binary outcome is "White", as in belonging to the Caucasian race. Our dependent variable also has a binary outcome (hence the use of the logit model) so our our outcomes are expressed in probabilities. So to interpret the marginal effect of being white on our outcome, would it be something like " a 1% increase in being white affect your probability of the dependent variable by x amount " ? Any comments or suggestions welcome :)
