Hrmm, that's not many details, but if leaks doesn't show you where the leaks are, there are two important options: [i] Leaks missed a leak [ii] The memory isn't actually being leaked fixing [i] is quite hard, but as Eric Albert said filing a bug report with Apple will help. [ii] means that the memory you're using is still accessible somewhere, but perhaps you've forgotten about it. Are any lists growing, without throwing out old entries? Are any buffers being realloc()ed a lot?
