Multiple route parameters with clean URLs

I'm working a digg clone in ASP.NET MVC to help better teach myself ASP.NET MVC. I've been looking at how StackOverflow handles routing when passing in things like sorts and I guess I thought the whole point of using clean URLs is so you don't have things like ?sort=blah at the end of your URL for SEO. Is there a recommended way of including many, possibly optional parameters into your URLs whilst still keeping them clean. I had a few ideas and I'd like to get some feedback. Option 1: Use wildcards (yuck) Option 2: Add the sorting to the beginning of the URL since it has the greatest coverage and ALWAYS applies when viewing stories. Exampke (using StackOverflow) Instead of having ?sort=featured... https://stackoverflow.com/featured/tagged/asp.net-mvc https://stackoverflow.com/new/tagged/c# https://stackoverflow.com/tagged/asp.net (some sort of default) Anyway -- I can't seem to think of any other ways of doing this.
