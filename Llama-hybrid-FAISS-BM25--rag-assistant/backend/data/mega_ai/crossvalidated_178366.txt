The data that you have available is temporal data. Because of that there are two choices you can make. Either you use a window for your temporal data, and compute statistics over this window, say the mean, std deviation, etc. You can then update your model by shifting the time-window to the end of the period after every week. A more natural approach however would be to use a recurrent neural network, which is capable of processing arbitrary length time-sequences. At every time-step t you feed in the values of your features for that date, and make a prediction for the sales. You can then train the model by back-propagating through time the error between the prediction at time-step t and the actual sales at that time-step. For training I would use a fixed length time sequence of say T=20 (or as long as you deem that the variables will still have impact on future sales). You can obtain multiple training examples by sliding your window of T over your time series, and creating sub-time series of length T.
