It is very unlikely to run feature selection on such many features. Before, you do feature selection, you may ask why? In many modern machine learning models people are not doing feature selection at all, but use all of them to have better accuracy. You may want to do feature selection for reasons like increasing interpretability. But if you say you have 25K features, I am guessing the data may be images or one-hot encoded texts. For such data, feature selection you mentioned are not widely used. As @user2974951 mentioned, if you have n features larger than n data points, regularization should be used.
