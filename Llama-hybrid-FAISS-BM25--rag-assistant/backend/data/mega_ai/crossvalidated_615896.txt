You are probably good with an ARIMA model, although ARIMA is notorious for not really giving good forecasts. However, I would discourage "rolling your own" model - better to use a good automatic ARIMA model selection algorithm . This will take care of log-transforming (or using other Box-Cox transformations, and the back-transformations, which are not trivial!). Alternatively, consider exponential smoothing, e.g., ets() in the forecast package for R. This is still a very good benchmark.
