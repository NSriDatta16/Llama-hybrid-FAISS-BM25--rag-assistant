My coefficients / standard errors are too high in a Multinomial Logistic Regression

I have a data set with 1 Dv and 24 IVs, with which I am running a Multinomial Logistic Regression. The DV has 14 unordered levels (a list of future plans for students). The IVs are come in various scales (e.g. parts per million, percentages, etc). When I run a MLR I get coefficients in the 5.0e-05 range. Standard errors around the same. My model is as follows: mlr when I calculate the Z values with.... mlr.zvalues I get Z values in the thousands. I'm looking for suggestions regarding my assumptions and my calculations. Anything helps. Thanks!
