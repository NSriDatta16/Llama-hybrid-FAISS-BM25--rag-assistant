Just set it on the default application server like IIS, if your point is to create a handler to ashx youu could do as it follows: So, start off by creating rss.ashx Now lets have a look at the handler class: RSSHandler.cs namespace KBMentor2 { using System; using System.IO; using System.Web; public class RSSHandler : IHttpHandler { public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext context) { context.Response.ContentType = "text/xml"; context.Response.ContentEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8; string sXml = BuildXMLString(); //not showing this function, //but it creates the XML string context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(600)); context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); context.Response.Write( sXml ); } public bool IsReusable { get { return true; } } } } And there you have it. Looks pretty much like the first code we created, doesn't it? As for caching, you can solve it by accessing the Cache object from your code, see the context.Response.Cache calls. source for the code is: aspcode.net
