Define a "word" to be a maximal interval in which every point belongs either to a red interval or a blue interval. No chunk can end in the middle of a word, and every union of consecutive words is a potential chunk. Now apply a minimum raggedness word-wrap algorithm to the words, where the length of a word is defined to be the number of intervals it contains (line = chunk).
