Alexander Stepanov, in Lecture 1 of his notes , talks about his conversion to the idea of "structured" assembly programming. Wanting to follow up on this idea, I have searched-out books with titles like "Structured Assembly Programming in Foo". But what I've found has turned out to be coverage of some processor architecture rather than principles of program design. Most of the books mentioned in other answers here are consistent with that. I have looked at Knuth's AoCP, and it certainly is detailed and does use MMIXAL. But aside from a small bit in v. 1, ch. 1.4, it is about algorithm design, not program design. So it's really in a category with something like Cormen, et. al. "Introduction to Algorithms". So maybe there just isn't anything like what I was looking for.
