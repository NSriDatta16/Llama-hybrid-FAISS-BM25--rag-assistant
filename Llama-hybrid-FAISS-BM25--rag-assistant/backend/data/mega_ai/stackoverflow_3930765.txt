LaTeX: Use some characters in a string

I need a macro that extracts pairs of number from a string that looks like this: n1-m1,n2-m2,n3-m3,n4-m4 (it could be longer) where n1,m1,n2,m2,... are numbers from 0 - 15. How can I go about getting the pairs (n1,m1), and (n2,m2), (n3,m3), etc inside my macro? I will need to use each pair once, after which I can, if needed, disregard the pair. Assuming each digit is a 2-digit number (not an elegant thing to do), and butchering a code I found by Debilski in this forum, I managed to get the first pair doing the following: \documentclass[11pt]{article} \def\macroGetPairs #1{\getPairs#1.\wholeString} \def\getPairs#1#2-#3#4,#5\wholeString { \if#1.% \else % Test if pair was successfully extracted Got pair (#1#2,#3#4). Still left: #5\\ % Begin recursion %\takeTheRest#5\ofTheString \fi} \def\takeTheRest#1\ofTheString\fi {\fi \getPairs#1\wholeString} \begin{document} \macroGetPairs{10-43,40-51,60-73,83-97} \end{document} However, I am not sure how to get the recursion working for me to get the rest of the pairs. I thought that simply uncommenting the line %\takeTheRest#5\ofTheString should do it, but it does not work. Note that the macro's test call is: \macroGetPairs{10-43,40-51,60-73,83-97} Any suggestions? Thank you very much, ERM
