WPF WindowsFormsHost VS2008 Toolbox has grayed out all the Windows Forms controls

I'm trying to use WindowsFormsHost in a WPF app so I can use some Windows Forms components. This all works ok with no errors, but when I go to drag a Windows Forms component from the toolbox in VS2008, they're all grayed out. In a way this makes sense as only the WPF components are available. But how do you drop a Windows Forms component onto a WindowsFormsHost if they're all grayed out and unavailable?
