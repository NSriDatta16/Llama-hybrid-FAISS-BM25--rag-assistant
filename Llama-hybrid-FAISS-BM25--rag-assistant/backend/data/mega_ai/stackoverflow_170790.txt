FIT testing has improved our code coverage. It has been great because it is an entirely different tack. Background: we have a mix of legacy and new code. We try to unit/integration test the new stuff as much as possible, but because we are migrating to Hibernate/Postgres and away from an OODB, there isn't much point to testing the legacy code. For those who don't know, FIT is a way to test software from the user perspective. Essentially, you can specify desired behaviour in HTML tables: the tables specify the actions against the software and the desired results. Our team writes 'glue code' (aka FIT test) that map the actions to calls against the code. Note that these tests operate in a view 'from space' compared to unit tests. Using this approach, we have increased our code-coverage by several percentage points. An added bonus is that these tests will bridge across versions: they will test legacy code but then, later, new code. i.e. they serve as regression tests, in a sense.
