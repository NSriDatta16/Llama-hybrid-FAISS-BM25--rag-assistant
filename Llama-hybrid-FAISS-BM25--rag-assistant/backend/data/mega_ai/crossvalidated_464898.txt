Logistic regression analysis after changing variables to factors

I have done a logistic regression with my binary outcome. Majority of my variables in my model were changed to factors as they are categorical. I put my categories into levels ie. Very Low = 1, Medium=2, High=3. I do not understand why my output is numbered for example: skills2, skills3 & skills4? I just want to know if skills is significant or not, as for all the other variables. Please see my output below: Call: glm(formula = FOODLIT $T1D2 ~ FOODLIT$ EDUCATION + FOODLIT $SKILLS + FOODLIT$ CONFIDENCE + FOODLIT $`F&V` + FOODLIT$ PROTEIN + FOODLIT $CHOS + FOODLIT$ SKILLSB + FOODLIT $`CONF.
