You have: If wWWHomePage 6 Then I'm assuming you want it to say: If wWWHomePage = 6 Then Since the missing "=" will cause an error, but since that code really doesn't do anything anyway, other than just abort the script, you could simplify your code by only taking action if that value is not set, for example: If objItem.Get("wWWHomePage") <> 6 Then Set ppt = CreateObject("PowerPoint.Application") ppt.Visible = True ppt.Presentations.Open "\\abngan01\tracking\ppt.pptx" End If I'm also assuming "6" is some sort of flag you've set yourself, you might want to use something a little more descriptive like "PPTSTATUS006", or something along those lines.
