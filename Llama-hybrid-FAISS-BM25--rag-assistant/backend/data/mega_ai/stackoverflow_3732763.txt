Why does compilation of this simple C++ program using 'cpp' fail?

I am a beginner in C++ I am average at C. I have written the following code in C++ ( file.cpp ) #include int main(){ std::cout Then I tried to compile the above code using cpp file.cpp but got some errors. I don't know whats wrong When I tried to compile my C program (changed to and std::cout to printf ) using cc file.c, I didn't get any errors. What is happening here?
