What values of ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[7] should I use?

I am working on a data consisting of number of customers visiting a clinic for an X-ray scan on the daily basis. I have the data for the last 4 years. I am building a time series model to predict the number of customers visiting on a daily basis. On a usual week day there are around hundred customers per day. On Saturdays there are around maybe 30-50 customers and on Sundays there mostly no customers or less than 10 customers. I have divided the data in training and testing part. Below is the plot of raw data. Clearly the data does not looks stationary. I also used the ADF test and the KPSS test to check if the data looks stationary or not. adf.test(train_data) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ts_beverly_train Dickey-Fuller = -8.0101, Lag order = 10, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary kpss.test(ts_beverly_train) KPSS Test for Level Stationarity data: ts_beverly_train KPSS Level = 0.28099, Truncation lag parameter = 7, p-value = 0.1 Even though both the test shows the data is stationary, the plot does not looks stationary. So I tried to make the data stationary by differencing. Now the data looks stationary. I confirmed it using the ADF test and the KPSS test. adf.test(ts_volume_data2_diff1) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ts_volume_data2_diff1 Dickey-Fuller = -14.981, Lag order = 10, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Next I tried plotting the ACF and PACF after 1st differencing We can see a spike after every 7th lag in ACF as there is a weekly seasonality. To capture seasonality I want to run a seasonal ARIMA. Now I have two questions 1. What values of ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[7] should be consider? 2. What should I use to capture the long term yearly seasonality along with weekly?
