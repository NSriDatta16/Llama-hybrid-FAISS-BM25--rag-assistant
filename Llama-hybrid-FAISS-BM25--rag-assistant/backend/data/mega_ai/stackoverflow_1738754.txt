How can I implement an outlook-like calendar in ASP.NET that chooses a start and end date in one control?

I have a page where I am trying to mimic some of outlook's calendar functionality. I'd like to have a calendar control where the user can click a start and end date, maybe even by clicking-and-dragging. I like the single control because it feels like it will look better and the user will feel a little more comfortable selecting dates. I don't necessarily need to pick multiple individual, non-consecutive dates... just a start and end date.
