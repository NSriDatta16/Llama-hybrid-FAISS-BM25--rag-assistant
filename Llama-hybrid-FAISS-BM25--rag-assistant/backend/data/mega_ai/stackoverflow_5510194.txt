A key is any number of columns that can be used to uniquely identify each row within the table. In the example you've shown, your widget table has two keys: model_name, model_year widget_id In standard SQL, a foreign key may reference any declared key on the referenced table (either primary key or unique). I'd need to check MySQLs compliance. From MySQL reference manual on foreign keys : InnoDB permits a foreign key to reference any index column or group of columns. However, in the referenced table, there must be an index where the referenced columns are listed as the first columns in the same order. As an alternative, if you wish to use the composite key from your referencing table, you'd have two columns in that table that correspond to model_name and model_year, and would then declare your foreign key constraint as: ALTER TABLE OtherTable ADD CONSTRAINT FK_OtherTable_Widgets (model_name,model_year) references Widgets (model_name,model_Year). Re InnoDB vs MyISAM, in the docs for ALTER TABLE The FOREIGN KEY and REFERENCES clauses are supported by the InnoDB storage engine, which implements ADD [CONSTRAINT [symbol]] FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ... (...). See Section 13.6.4.4, “FOREIGN KEY Constraints”. For other storage engines, the clauses are parsed but ignored. The CHECK clause is parsed but ignored by all storage engines. See Section 12.1.17, “CREATE TABLE Syntax”. The reason for accepting but ignoring syntax clauses is for compatibility, to make it easier to port code from other SQL servers, and to run applications that create tables with references. See Section 1.8.5, “MySQL Differences from Standard SQL”.
