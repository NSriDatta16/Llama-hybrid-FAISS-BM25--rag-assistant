Questions about confidence interval and presenting metrics for classification problem

A friend of mine and I are working on our bachelor's thesis and we're getting close to its completion. We have a few disagreements about how to present the result metrics for the experiment that we're performing. The thesis involves detecting geographical ditches by classifying raster pixels on maps. We're using a random forest probability classifier and also doing some post processing work on the model output before producing a binary classification (ditch or non-ditch for each pixel). Due to the way we're doing post-processing (involving neighbouring pixels) we've decided to split the geographical area we're working with into 11 different zones of equal size, and perform something similar to 11-fold cross validation to evaluate the model. We train a model on 10 of the zones and evaluate on the one we didn't train on. We do this 11 times until all zones have been evaluation zones once. Now to the problem: The zones have varying amount of ditch pixels in them. Some may have only 50 000 ditch pixels while others have close to 500 000. If I understand correctly, the standard way you evaluate metrics with K-fold cross validation is simply to take the result from each fold, and averaging it with the results from the other folds. In our case I would argue that this leads to potentially lying with the statistics, due to the zones being so different in their class balance. Say one zone with 50 000 ditch pixels receives a 30 % recall, and one with 500 000 ditch pixels receives 90 % recall, it wouldn't be very accurate to say that the overall recall is 60 %. Instead, wouldn't it be better to add all the predictions together and take one big metric from all 11 experiments? Another thing we've been thinking about is if it's also accurate to produce confidence intervals on the metrics from the 11 folds. Will the confidence intervals not also technically be inaccurate if the class balance differences between folds are large? Thanks beforehand!
