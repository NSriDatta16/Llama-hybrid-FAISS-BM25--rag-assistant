Magento after Onepage checkout adding new products to cart

i would like to add some Products after the Checkout I have an observer and it's listening on 'checkout_onepage_controller_success_action' when i try $this->_getCart()->addProduct($product, $params); and save the cart the success page will be loaded but no new products in the cart. Any idea what's wrong?
