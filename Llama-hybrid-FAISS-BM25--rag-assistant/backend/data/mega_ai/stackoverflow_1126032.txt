Where to Store Metadata?

We bought a third party survey tool - ClassApps SelectSurvey - which is to be shared among at least ten of our company's applications. In our apps we would like to link directly to a given survey rather than having the user have to hit the survey sign on screen, and select from a huge list of surveys. Question is, given that a survey has metadata like user, organization, reporting period, etc., where should the metadata be stored? As metadata in the SelectSurvey database, or should we have associative tables in each of the other ten applications which contain survey ids?
