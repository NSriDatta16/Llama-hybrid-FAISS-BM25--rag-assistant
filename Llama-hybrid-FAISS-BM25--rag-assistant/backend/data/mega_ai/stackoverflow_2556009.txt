UIWebView NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData doesn't actually ignore the cache

I have a UIWebView object, with the caching-policy specified as: NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData This should ignore whatever objects are in the local cache and retrieve the latest version of a site from the web. However, after the first load of the site (ten resources in trace, HTTP GET), all subsequent loads of the site only retrieve a small subset of resources (three resources in trace, HTTP GET). The images all appear to be loaded from some local source. I have confirmed that my sharedURLCache has a memory usage of 0 bytes, and a disk usage of 0 bytes. Whenever the process starts fresh, the full version of the site is retrieved again. This leads me to believe that these resources are being stored in an in-memory cache, but as I noted before, [[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] currentMemoryUsage] returns 0. I have also tried explicitly removing the cached response for my request, but this seems to have no effect. What gives? Edit: Furthermore, the NSHTTPCookieStorage is cleared before each load, and I can confirm that the subsequent loads retrieve four resources now instead of three. The caching issue persists regardless of the change.
