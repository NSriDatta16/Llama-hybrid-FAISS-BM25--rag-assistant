1 question. 6 factors. Each with a Likert scale from 1 to 5. How can I analyze the results to answer my hypothesis?

I hope you're all doing well. I find myself in need of some statistical guidance for my research project, and I'd greatly appreciate your expertise.I'm working on a project exploring a certain country's preferences for different aspects (taste, health, sustainability, price) and their impact on the acceptance of meat alternatives. Hypotheses: H0: The main motivational factor for consumers when choosing meat substitutes is not taste, and other factors such as health, sustainability, and price are equally or more influential. H1: The main motivational factor for consumers when choosing meat substitutes is taste, and it holds greater importance compared to other factors such as health, sustainability, and price.I used a Likert scale to ask respondents to rate the importance of six factors (Taste being the first one). The Likert scale went from 1 to 5. 1 = Not important at all 3 = Neutral 5 = Very important Each row in my survey data represents one respondent. For each respondent, there is a rating (from 1 to 5) given for each of the six factors. In the survey, Taste emerged as the highest-rated factor, with 85% of respondents giving it a rating of 4 or 5 on the Likert scale. Despite this clear preference for Taste, my assessors believe that this information is not sufficient, and they expect me to find "statistical significant differences". I have zero knowledge about statistics, and unfortunately, none of my supervisors are willing to provide guidance. Given my lack of statistical expertise, could you recommend a straightforward way to test this hypothesis using the Likert scale data? I asked ChatGPT and it suggested to me to use ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the means or medians of the factors. I tried doing the Kruskal-Wallis test, but the results are questionable. Do you think that could work? I am looking for an approach that's simple to understand, as my assessors do not have a deep understanding of statistics. I appreciate any help or advice you can offer. Thank you in advance!
