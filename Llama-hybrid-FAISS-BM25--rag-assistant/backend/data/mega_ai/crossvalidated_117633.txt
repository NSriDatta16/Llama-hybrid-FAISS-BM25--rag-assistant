Good sources to get papers in machine learning?

I'm a CS master student (will be a PhD in three months or so). Today I was at my superviser's office and he had a friend discussing some ideas for their research. Then they mentioned a paper that I knew, that is highly cited, and I also believe is a very good paper. However they both said that it's a crappy paper and I had no idea why! Then also I mentioned arXiv as a resource for papers and they also laughed, as if it was a place for newbies or 'normal' papers. I was embarrassed actually. I would like please to know what are the best sources/places where I can find the best papers. Stuff that I read and people can't say they are 'crappy' papers.
