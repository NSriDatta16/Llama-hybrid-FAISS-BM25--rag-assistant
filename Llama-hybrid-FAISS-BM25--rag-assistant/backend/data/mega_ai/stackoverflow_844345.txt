The simple case is an inverted index. The most basic algorithm is simply: scan the file for words, creating a list of unique words normalize and filter the words place an entry tying that word to the file in your index The details are where things get tricky, but the fundamentals are the same. By "normalize and filter" the words, I mean things like converting everything to lowercase, removing common "stop words" (the, if, in, a etc.), possibly "stemming" (removing common suffixes for verbs and plurals and such). After that, you've got a unique list of words for the file and you can build your index off of that. There are optimizations for reducing storage, techniques for checking locality of words (is "this" near "that" in the document, for example). But, that's the fundamental way it's done.
