I hope your page is tiny because the performance of that selector is going to be aweful. I'd do two things: Add some sort of ID to the element you're wanting to select rather than basing it on content. If you know the content, you should be able to add an ID and select against that instead. Once you've got the source brought back, chain your selectors with operations. Once you have your loaded page element, just do a normal operation against it rather than combining your complex selectors up front. EDIT (more info): Your issue is likely due to how jQuery constructs the page fragments: http://api.jquery.com/load/ My bet is that by the time it gets to :parent it's already made a selection of content and there's no more parent to get.
