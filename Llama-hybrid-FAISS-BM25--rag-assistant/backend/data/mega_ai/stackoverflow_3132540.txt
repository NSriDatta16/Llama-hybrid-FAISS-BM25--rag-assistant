Multi-valued fields maintain ordering so you could have a multi-valued field for skills and another one for years of experience. When you read them back, just associate them by their order. Pay attention if you have a null or empty value. You will have to encode it using a special marker because en empty string or a null value will not be indexed and this will change the ordering. UPDATE Unfortunately, it is not possible in Solr to sort by a multi-valued field. See this link for explanations: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/performance-sorting-multivalued-field-td905943.html
