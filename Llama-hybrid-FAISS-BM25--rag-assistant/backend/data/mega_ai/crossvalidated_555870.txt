Imagine that you have 2 independent series $y_t$ and $x_t$ , both random walks (non-stationary series with a unit root). You run the following regression: $y_t=\beta_1+\beta_2x_t+\epsilon_t$ . Davidson & MacKinnon (see the red line in snapshot below from their textbook "Econometric Theory and Methods") did this simulation 1 million times for increasingly large sample sizes. With a sample size of 20, almost 50% of the time the t-statistic for $\beta_2$ rejected the null hypothesis $\beta_2=0$ . We found a relationship that doesn't really exist because we know that $y_t$ and $x_t$ are independent by design; therefore we found a spurious relationship . What's more alarming, the larger the sample size, the higher the proportion of time that the regression result will be spurious , and this proportion converges to 1. The phenomenon of spurious regressions is not something that afflicts non-stationary series only. Imagine repeating the above simulation, this time taking $y_t$ and $x_t$ to be independent stationary AR(1) processes with the autoregressive parameter $\rho_1=0.8$ . Davidson & MacKinnon did just that; see the results depicted by the blue line. For most sample sizes, some 35% of the time we will find a spurious relationship. Fortunately, the problem does not get worse the larger the sample sizes, as it did when the 2 series were random walks. If we repeated the above experiment but this time using a lower value for the autoregressive parameter $\rho_1$ we can expect to find a lower proportion of spurious relationships. For low enough a value of the autoregressive parameter the proportion of spurious relationships should be around 0.05 (the significance level). Whether you are looking to explain the co-movement of the 2 series, as you put it, or to predict one using the other, you will want to estimate $\beta_2$ consistently. If $y_t$ and $x_t$ are both random walks but instead of being independent (as in the first experiment above), they happen to be cointegrated then the OLS estimator of $\beta_2$ will be super-consistent (consistent and converges to the true value even faster). So, in summary, if the 2 series are both Integrated of Order 1 and they are cointegrated, then yes you can regress one on the other to estimate their co-movement. If they are not cointegrated, you shouldn't (think of the first of the above experiments). In this case, you should difference them and regress the two in first-differences. Even then, keep in mind that if the true process (of the first-differenced series) was an AR(1) process with a root close to 1, spuriousness will still show up. Time series analysis is a tricky business. Keep in mind that if $y_t$ is cointegrated with $x_t$ then $y_t$ will also be cointegrated with any lag of $x_t$ . So, if you conclude that $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, you are in business - and can run binary OLS regressions of $y_t$ on lagged $x_t$ , and $\beta_2$ will be consistent. You can then use a fit statistic (such as $R^2$ or $AIC$ ) to compare the results of these binary regressions for different lags of $x_t$ .
