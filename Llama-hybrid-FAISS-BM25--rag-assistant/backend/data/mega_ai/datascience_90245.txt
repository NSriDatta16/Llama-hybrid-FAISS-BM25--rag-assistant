NLP food review classification

I have a dataset consisting of a bunch of food reviews. I'm trying to build a model that determines if a given review talks about a food safety issue. The dataset has a lot of features, but relevant to my goal there are only two features of importance -- food reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings. I'd love a pointer or two to figure out how to approach this problem. As a first pass attempt, I'm thinking of pipelining all reviews into a sentiment analsyis filter and then look at the ones have keyword related to food safety (eg: "high cholesterol", "unsafe", etc)
