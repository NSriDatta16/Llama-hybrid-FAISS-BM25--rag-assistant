The Embedded Resources of the Input Builders are servered through the WebFormView engine. When your application is set to debug=false in your webconfig the view engine caches the view, so it is only loaded from the assembly once. The real reason why the input builders would be a little bit slower is that they use a master page to reduce the HTML you maintain. The Editor Templates will produce an input for example. The equvilent Input Builder will produce a label, input, and the html 'chrome" around the two so that you can specify it once and have it applied to every form that uses the input builder. The input builders are really for applying a convention for how your forms markup is built and it does it in a way that gives you control but also keeps your html fragments "DRY" (dont repeat yourself). Like everything there are tradeoffs. For the input builders, you trade off some runtime performance for developer productivity. At the end of the day if you needed to have a super performant form on a public website, your best option would be to server a static html file that posts to an MVC Action.
