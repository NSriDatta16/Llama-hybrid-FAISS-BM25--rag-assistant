Some advice/opinions regarding datatypes. Result - This is a time, you may want to do some calculations on this time, therefore you should store it as a time type. RaceNumber - This is a reference, whilst it is a number, you will be performing no calculations on this number. Therefore you should store it as a varchar rather than an int. This will avoid confusion as to its usage and avoid accidently manipulation of it as a number. Name - Look at the length of string you allow for the Name. Be careful about limiting this value by so much. 16 characters may be too small for some names in the future. Place - Is this required storage? Can you calculate the place of a runner based on their Result alone? However, you should keep a good primary key for your table.
