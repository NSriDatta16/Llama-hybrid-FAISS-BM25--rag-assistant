Can some series be seasonally unadjusted while others are adjusted in a VAR model?

I am modeling a SVAR to explain how oil price shocks have an impact on stock price, after downloading time series from the FRED database I noticed that Consumer Price Index is seasonally adj. unlike the other time series. Can I implement CPI or do I need to remove seasonality from the other time series?
