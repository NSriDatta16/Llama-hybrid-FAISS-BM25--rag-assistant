Comparison of cell counts with a right censoring

I have cell counts related to the action of different microorganisms and I want to compare their distribution. It's supposed they follow a normal distribution after a log transformation, but I can't register all the data due to the limit of measuring instrument, so I obtain a very similar normal curve but it's cut in the point in which I can't register the data, and if I run a K-S test, it doesn't support the normality hypothesis (but n is large). My questions: I find this can be an usual problem, so how would you demonstrate normality in these cases? or is it impossible? I think a Kruskal-Wallis test could works in my case, but I don't know if I have to take into account something else. Someone has suggested me to use an ANOVA due to my n is very high (n>2000) in each microorganism, despite the lack of normality, is this right? After reading comments I think I have a right censoring. I have seen in survival analysis is used a Kaplan-Maier estimator, but this case is different. Would it be better just remove censored data and run a non-parametric test?
