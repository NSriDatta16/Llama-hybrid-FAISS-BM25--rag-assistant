How do I calculate the tipping point of over/under odds in Football?

I am trying to understand how game odds work. One scenario I came across was the over/under scores for football (soccer) games in the form of a table like this: Date Home Team Away Team Handicap Over Under Payout 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +0.5 1.03 12.41 95.20% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +0.75 1.04 10 94.20% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +1 1.03 11.5 94.50% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +1.25 1.12 6.13 94.70% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +1.5 1.21 4.31 94.40% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +1.75 1.24 3.93 94.20% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +2 1.29 3.6 95.00% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +2.25 1.48 2.64 95.00% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +2.5 1.68 2.18 94.80% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +2.75 1.86 1.96 95.40% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +3 2.16 1.73 96.00% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +3.25 2.42 1.57 95.00% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +3.5 2.66 1.46 94.10% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +3.75 3.04 1.37 94.20% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +4 3.9 1.26 95.20% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +4.25 4.25 1.21 94.20% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +4.5 4.85 1.17 94.60% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +4.75 5.95 1.13 95.00% 4/17/2016 Team A Team B +5 7.7 1.08 94.70% I understand that 2.5 goals per game (handicap here) is generally the average goals scored, but I want to know from this data exactly what the market is thinking. We may also call it the tipping point or break-even point. How would I calculate that value?
