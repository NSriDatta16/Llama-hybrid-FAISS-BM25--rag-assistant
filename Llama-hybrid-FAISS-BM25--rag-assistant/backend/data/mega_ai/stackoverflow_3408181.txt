How do I install Devel::Cover on ActivePerl 5.8.7?

cpan fails with this weird error as follows Error: Unable to locate installed Perl libraries or Perl source code. It is recommended that you install perl in a standard location before building extensions. Some precompiled versions of perl do not contain these header files, so you cannot build extensions. In such a case, please build and install your perl from a fresh perl distribution. It usually solves this kind of problem. (You get this message, because MakeMaker could not find "D:\fbl_esc_bcd_tb\tools\perl\lib\CORE\perl.h") Running make test Make had some problems, maybe interrupted? Won't test Running make install Make had some problems, maybe interrupted? Won't install Problem is I can't install new active perl versions in this environment and the tool I want to coverage on does not run outside this environment.
