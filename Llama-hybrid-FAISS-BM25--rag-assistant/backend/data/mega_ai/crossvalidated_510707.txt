This would only work for generalized linear models (GLMs). With 'work' I mean that you get perfectly identical error estimates (e.g., train and test MSE) using the original predictors, and using a single predictor, computed by weighing each of the coefficients by their respective regression coefficients. Random forests are not linear models. Any deviations from linearity will be captured by the random forest, yielding differences between the predictions of the model with the original predictors as inputs, and the predictions of the model with the weighted sum of the predictors as input. Furthermore, variable importance measures approximate the amount of variance explained. Regression coefficients are on the scale of the standard deviation, not on the scale of the variance, so that will also contribute discrepancies.
