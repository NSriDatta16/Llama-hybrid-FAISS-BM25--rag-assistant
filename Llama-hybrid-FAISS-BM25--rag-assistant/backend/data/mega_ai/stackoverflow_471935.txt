user warnings on msvc AND gcc?

In MSVC I have this in a header: #define STR(x) #x #define STR2(x) STR(x) #define NOTE(text) message (__FILE__ "(" STR2(__LINE__) ") : -NOTE- " #text) #define noteMacro(text) message (__FILE__ "(" STR2(__LINE__) ") : " STR2(text)) and I do #pragma NOTE(my warning here) GCC has: #warning(my warning here) However MSVC (2003) throws a fit when it sees #warning and gives "fatal error C1021: invalid preprocessor command 'warning'" What can I do about this? Is there a way to have GCC recognize MSVC warnings or MSVC not throw an error on GCC warnings? Is there something I can do that works on both? I can have GCC warn me about unknown pragmas but that's not the most ideal solution.
