Sorry to be blunt, but you're going about this the wrong way. The question isn't one of 'tables vs divs' it's one of 'tables vs web-standards'. It's very tempting when you start out with CSS to wrap everything in a and be done with it, when really the point is to use the correct HTML element to represent the data it contains, and use CSS to style it. With that in mind, what is the actual content of the page? Is it a list of data? A series of paragraphs? Maybe it is actually tabular data, in which case a table is the right choice? Once you've determined that, and wrote the appropriate HTML, then you can start on the CSS. Sometimes you may have to add extra HTML elements to achieve the style you need, that's okay as long as you've already hashed out the structure and thought long and hard about such elements.
