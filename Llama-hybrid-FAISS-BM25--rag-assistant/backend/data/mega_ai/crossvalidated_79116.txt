I would think it is OK to do that, but you must be careful about two issues: 1) make sure your variables for the first PCA have same direction so that the PCs are representative of the spectra. In another words, all of variables for reflectance spectra should be either recorded from low to high or high to low. If the directions are mixed you still can do the second PCA but the PCs from first PCA are trouble in explanation. 2) Check how large of the total variance of spectra can be explained by the first 1 or 2 PCs. The larger of the proportion, the better for the second PCA. If the proportion is small, it may be not suitable to use these PCs for the second PCA.
