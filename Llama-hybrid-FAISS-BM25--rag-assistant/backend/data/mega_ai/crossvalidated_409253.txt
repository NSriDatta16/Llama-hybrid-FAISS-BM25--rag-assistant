I think you see the logical problem in your question. In the frequentist paradigm, it is fine to presume a population truth, generate data, and see if the estimates have good coverage, because that is what they are suppose to do. In the Bayesian paradigm, however, there is no ground truth to generate data from! Bayesians ask the probability of such truths given data, so in simulation we need different truths that give rise to data and then condition on the data. In practice, one ends up simulating the law of conditional probability, which, fortunately, holds always by definition. I take up this exact issue in Rouder, 2014, Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. https://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-014-0595-4
