Amazon Web Services with PHP - planing learning curve

As many PHP programmers, I am a kind of CMS guy, but also training my "framework" muscles too. From what I observe, there is more demand for Amazon Web Services in job descriptions. Hence, they are worth learning. But any learning should be well-targeted, with purpose, so I am asking questions below. My question is which kind of applications (by architecture and by domain) are the best targets for these services? Can you imagine some typical usage of Amazon web services that will most frequently be (is) requested by employers. Does using Amazon Web services mean that not only I can fully migrate to this platform, but that partial solution is OK too - e.g. writing regular PHP apps on regular hosting that invoke Amazon Web Services (storage, cloud, queues)?
