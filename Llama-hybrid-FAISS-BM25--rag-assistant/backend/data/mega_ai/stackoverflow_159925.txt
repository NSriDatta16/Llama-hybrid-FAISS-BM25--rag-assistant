How do I make a ListView row draggable in .NET?

I am not the most experienced GUI programmer, so bear with me here. I have a custom list view. I would like to be able to drag a row from the ListView to another control on a form. I know how to catch events that are fired when an object is dragged to a control, but I am not sure how to make a row itself draggable. I could always hack together my own solution, but I am hoping that there is a better (read: easier) way of doing this. EDIT: i would really like to drag a copy of the row, but I can always work out the details myself.
