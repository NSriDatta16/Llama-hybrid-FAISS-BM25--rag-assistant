Do you know of anyway to get a distinct result set without using the ResultTransformer when using SetFirstResult and SetMaxResults?

When i use SetFirstResult and SetMaxResult and if the query has joins the result have duplicate results instead of unique. Then i use all type of Distinct helpers for criteria api. But it doesnt filter the whole result set it just filters the paged result. How can i overcome this issue ? Thanks
