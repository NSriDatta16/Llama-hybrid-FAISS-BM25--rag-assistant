How to organize a large project with solutions/projects/folders?

We are working on a very large VS project. We want the project structure to "hint" developers on the logical components and design. For this purpose, which is best: One project with many subfolders and namespaces Split to multiple projects based on logical grouping of classes. Have all projects in the same solution with solution folders. Same as #2 but have multiple solutions instead of a single with subfolders.
