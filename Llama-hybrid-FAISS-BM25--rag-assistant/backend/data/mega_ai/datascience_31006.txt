Here is some, probably exaggerated criticism of TensorFlow: Tensorflow sucks by Nico Jimenez, 8 Oct 2017 The article was discussed on Hacker News . I highlight some quotes that I find interesting to consider. First, about its technical content. Despite its shortcomings, I share the same vision as this article. Here are my reasons: Tensorflow has a way too large API surface area: parsing command lines arguments handling, unit test runners, logging, help formatting strings... most of those are not as good as available counterparts in python. The C++ and Go versions are radically different from the Python version. Limited code reuse, different APIs, not maintained or documented with the same attention. The technical debt in the source code is huge. For instance, There are 3 redundant implementations in the source code of a safe division (_safe_div), with slightly different interfaces (sometimes with default params, sometimes not). It's technical debt. In every way, it reminds me of Angular.io project. A failed promise to be true multi-language, failing to use the expressiveness of python, with a super large API that tries to do things we didn't ask it to do and a lack of a general sounding architecture. (by batmansmk) Some speculation about the philosophy and politics behind TensorFlow: I think the author raises a good point about Google envy. TensorFlow is not the most intuitive or flexible library out there, and it is very over-engineered if you're not doing large-scale distributed training. The main reason why everyone talks it up so much is because Google heavily marketed it from the outset, and everyone automatically assumes Google == Virtuoso Software Design because they couldn't make it through the interview. Really it's just modern enterprise software which has five different ways to implement batch norm that they push on the community so they don't have to train new hires on how to use it. (by zo7) Or maybe it is built by a company that is doing large-scale distributed training, and they open sourced it not to cater to every need, but to help others trying to do the same thing they are. Companies are under no obligation to make sure their open source is well suited for others use cases. (by dsl) That was kinda my point, it's not the be-all deep learning library because they made it for their own use case, but its towering popularity (as in 10x the number of stars of other popular libraries) is not genuine. Also I highly doubt that the main reason Google open sourced it was to be charitable. (by zo7)
