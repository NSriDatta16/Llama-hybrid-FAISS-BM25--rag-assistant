This is personal experience mixed with workplace lore: VB.NET is capable of being little more nimble, compared to C#, because there isn't a standards committee (except for any that may exist at Microsoft). Most of the Google-able code hackery out there is done in C#, and most of the best resource books provide code samples in C# only. VB.NET is tainted with a history of VB being accessible to even the most incapable of developers. This is unfair, imho, because VB.NET is much more a "real" language. But the taint isn't going to be washed away any time soon, and "real" programmers still generally despise it. As for real life - I code in my own time in C# and VB.NET at work. I believe that because so much of the code one writes for .NET is calls against the framework objects, the differences are actually quite small. If you can declare variables in both languages you're 80% to being portable. If you understand the framework, the syntax of the languages is a small obstacle. EDIT to directly answer your question: We happily use both (though mainly VB.NET) and haven't ever had any problems. We use Visual Studio which allows us to pretty freely mix code files/assemblies. I would encourage you not to limit to a single language - I think some diversity is good for the brain.
