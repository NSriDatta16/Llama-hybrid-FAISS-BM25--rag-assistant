It would be easier to do with SVG than with canvas, especially using a library like Raphaël . See this demo – that is not very different from what you want to do. If you use Raphaël then it will be much more portable than canvas, because it will work even on IE 6 (using VML). Update: (Fixed the Fiddle example - it had some outdated dependencies - now it's fixed) Ok, see THIS DEMO . It should be pretty much what you explained or at least it should get you started. Here is the code: var R = Raphael(10, 10, 400, 400); var l = R.path("M100 200L200 200L300 200"); l.attr({ stroke: 'red', 'stroke-width': 4 }); var c = R.circle(200, 200, 10).attr({ fill: 'white', stroke: 'red', 'stroke-width': 4 }); function move(dx, dy) { var x = 200 + dx, y = 200 + dy; this.attr({cx: x, cy: y}); l.attr({path: "M100 200L"+x+" "+y+"L300 200"}); } function start() { c.stop(); l.stop(); } function end() { this.animate({cx: 200, cy: 200}, 2000, "elastic"); l.animate({path: "M100 200L200 200L300 200"}, 2000, "elastic"); } c.drag(move, start, end);
