PHP - Check if something was print in the browser

How can I check if something was print in the browser? I've tried headers_sent but it's for headers... If nothing was printed i want to download a file: public function download() { $file = null; $line = null; if(headers_sent($file, $line)) { /* generic exception... change that... */ throw new Exception('Headers was sent before in file ' . $file . ', line #' . $line); } header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header('Content-Type: ' . $this->mime); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=' . $this->name); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header('Expires: 0'); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); header('Pragma: public'); header('Content-Length: ' . $this->size); readfile($this->path); Thank you.
