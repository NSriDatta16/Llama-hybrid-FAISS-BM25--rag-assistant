Automated taxonomic identification of insects â€“ where can I find some good enough software or code?

Short context: my colleagues study plant-pollinator networks. Insect (pollinator) identification is a task that requires a lot of effort. I would like to know if there are already trained or trainable models with good accuracy used to identify pollinators (insects) from mobile phone images taken in the field (possibly, a close-up photo of the insect on a flower). Identification to family level would be good enough for their research. Maybe for some easy to identify insects, identification to specie level would be also possible. Note that, I could find few research articles that provide code (e.g. a GitHub repository with the model and workflows), but they are mostly focused on using sharp, good quality, close-up images taken in the lab from insect collections, with the goal to identify insects to species level, e.g: Valan, 2019 - Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with Expert-Level Accuracy Using Effective Feature Transfer from Convolutional Networks https://github.com/valanm/off-the-shelf-insect-identification Buschbacher, 2020- Image-based species identification of wild bees using convolutional neural networks, https://deepabis.github.io/ , https://github.com/deepabis/deepabis Valan (2019) presents a great illustration (below) about the increase in difficulty of such classification. This might get even harder when it comes to using mobile phone photos from the field with a lot of background noise. I also asked this question on research gate , but I think it might be interesting to have it on this platform too.
