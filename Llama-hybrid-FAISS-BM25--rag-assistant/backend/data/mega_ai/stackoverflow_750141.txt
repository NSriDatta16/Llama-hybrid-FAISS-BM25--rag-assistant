Your argument is valid, coding a site with tables is much faster off the line. The problem with tables is that they're significantly harder to maintain in the long run. By using divs you'll have a much simpler time when adjusting style or layout changes in the future. If the site you're creating will require (very) little to no future maintenance then tables would be arguably better/faster. However, if you are planing on making changes to the sites design/layout in the future (even just an average amount of changes/fixes), a div-centric design will be much more rewarding.
