didnt read it but it should pretty much cover it :) http://ad1987.blogspot.com/2009/02/reddit-style-voting-with-php-mysql-and.html alternativel you can go to google.com, type in "vote up down ajax php mysql" and press i'm feelink lucky. to display your top voted questions you should consider using a bayesian algorithm so you don't end up with top questions that have only one vote or something. didnt read it again but this might help (the sql query in the middle of the page looks good) http://www.andymoore.ca/2010/02/bayesian-ratings-your-salvation-for-user-generated-content/
