How can I (both) create a row and accessing that row in the same 'Stored Procedure'?

I'd like to get the value of the id column for an object just after I've created it. But I don't want to run another query for that. My book for beginner ( SQL Server 2008 for Dummies ) says that there are 2 tables ( inserted and deleted ) that hold the last row(s) that have been inserted, updated, or deleted. Unfortunately, only Triggers (says the book) can access those tables. But, if I use triggers, they will go off each time I " insert " a row even when I don't need them that functionality. Can I obtain the same effect with a Store Procedure (without having to run a separate query?) This is what I'm trying to do CREATE PROCEDURE myProcedure DECLARE @OrganizationName @ColumnID OUTPUT AS INSERT INTO Organization (OrganizationName) VALUES (@OrganizationName) SET @ColumnID = (// Please, I need Help here ...) Thanks for helping
