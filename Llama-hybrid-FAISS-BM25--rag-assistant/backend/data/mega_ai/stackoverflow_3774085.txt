Many people use HTML5 to refer to HTML5, Javascript, the DOM, CSS3, SVG, XMLHttpRequest, and a whole bunch of other web technologies. It's a bit of a marketing buzzword for "modern web standards." Note that some of this is justified, as HTML5 does add a lot more features for interactive content. For instance, the element , along with the 2D drawing context methods for manipulating it, are part of HTML5. Likewise, the and elements are part of HTML5. When people refer to HTML5 replacing Flash, they frequently say that because Flash is used for vector graphics, audio, and video, all of which HTML5 adds. There are also a variety of other new or newly standardized technologies for implementing interactive web content which are either in HTML5, or were started in HTML5 but have moved to their own specs by now, such as new form controls , contenteditable , drag and drop , cross-document messaging , web storage , and so on. And while SVG is a separate standard, from well before HTML5, HTML5 adds the ability to embed SVG directly into your HTML markup, so in that sense certain uses of SVG are aided by HTML5. And yes, HTML5 is not supposed to be too different from what you do with HTML 4. It's designed to be backwards-compatible with what browsers already implement; many "new" features in HTML5, such as contenteditable , already existed in browsers for a long time, but had never been standardized. Some features don't feel all that new because they're not, they're just newly standardized. Some, however, are radically different than what you could do in HTML 4; HTML 4 offered no facilities for attaching arbitrary structured metadata to your elements, or playing video, or providing a drawing surface for Javascript to draw on.
