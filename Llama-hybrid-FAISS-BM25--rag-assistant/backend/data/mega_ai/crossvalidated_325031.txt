The two simple solutions that come to my mind are: Choose a threshold for minimal number of votes that you consider as valid and do not consider the people who didn't reach the threshold in your competition. Shrink the ratings towards average (or other value) by weighting them by their counts. If the average rating that $i$-th person got was $m_i$ and she was rated by $n_i$ people, and $\mu$ is the global average of the ratings, then create a shrinked rating by $$ \tilde m_i = \frac{m_i n_i + \mu \alpha}{n_i + \alpha} $$ where $\alpha$ is the "pseudocount" of the $\mu$ rating. So if $n_i \alpha$ then the ratings gets closer to $m_i$. People sometimes call it the "Bayesian average" but the name is quite misleading. So you basically say that if you don't have enough votes, then you consider those employees as "average".
