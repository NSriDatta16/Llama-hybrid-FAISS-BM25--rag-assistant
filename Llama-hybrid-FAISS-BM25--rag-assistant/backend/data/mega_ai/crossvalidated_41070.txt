How to setup xreg argument in auto.arima() in R?

I am working on a small project with one time series which measures the customer visit data (daily). My covariates are a continuous variable Day to measure how many days have been elapsed since the first day of data collection, and some dummy variables, such as whether that day is Christmas, and which day of the week it is, etc. Part of my data looks like: Date Customer_Visit Weekday Christmas Day 11/28/11 2535 2 0 1 11/29/11 3292 3 0 2 11/30/11 4103 4 0 3 12/1/11 4541 5 0 4 12/2/11 6342 6 0 5 12/3/11 7205 7 0 6 12/4/11 3872 1 0 7 12/5/11 3270 2 0 8 12/6/11 3681 3 0 9 My plan is to use ARIMAX model to fit the data. This can be done in R, with the function auto.arima() . I understand that I have to put my covariates into the xreg argument, but my code for this part always returns an error. Here is my code: xreg The error message returned by R is: Error in model.frame.default(formula = x ~ xreg, drop.unused.levels = TRUE) :variable lengths differ (found for 'xreg') I learned a lot from How to fit an ARIMAX-model with R? But I am still not very clear how to set up the covariates or dummies in the xreg argument in auto.arima() function.
