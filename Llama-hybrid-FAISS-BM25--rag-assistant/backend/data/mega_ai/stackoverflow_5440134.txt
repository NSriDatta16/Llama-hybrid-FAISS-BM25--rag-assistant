An easy check would be to create a hashmap of character vs frequency for the original word. For ex. if your word is "Doppelganger", the map would be D->1 o->1 p->2 e->2 l->1 g->2 a->1 n->1 r->1 Create a similar map for the shuffled word. The two hashmaps should be equal. This, however, will only check that the shuffled word contains the same letters as the original word. You should also check that the word is actually shuffled by checking for String equality and running the shuffle multiple times as @Shengyuan has pointed out.
