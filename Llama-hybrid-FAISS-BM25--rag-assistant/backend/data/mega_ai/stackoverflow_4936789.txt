How to put a Google Visualization in and make it draggable with jQuery

I have a problem where divs become undraggable when populated by Google Visualization objects. It is almost as if the visualization is blocking the mouse from dragging the content. I realize I could add a handle outside the div, but I need the div look clean and simple(no handles or extra stuff). Here is an example: http://jsbin.com/awoma4/5/edit I need the visualization to fill the entire div and also be able to drag it around by clicking on it wherever, but now I'm at a loss. Any ideas? If this is not possible, perhaps there is a way to have a handle appear only on mouseover, and disappear otherwise?
