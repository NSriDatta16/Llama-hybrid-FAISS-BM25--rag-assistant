Random forest clustering

In my data the classes were defined by binning a variable in 10 bins. After growing the random forest its proximity matrix is viewed as the following MDSplot: As can be seen from the plot all classes are overlapped in all clusters. I wonder if it is possible to use this proximity matrix or any data from R randomForest object to go back to the data and re-define the classes so they would be minimally overlapped in clusters in this MDSplot, i.e. each class would reside in its own cluster.
