I believe you need a Mixed Model Analysis as you want to have ANOVA like results but on time-dependent observations, Some advantages of the MM: in an ANOVA you probably had to average the observations of your daily genes. not in an MM. You dont need a balanced ata set in terms of observations (e.g. the test which is a small brother of ANOVA needs fairly distributed groups) Missing values in a MM are allowed try this link : https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/introduction.html
