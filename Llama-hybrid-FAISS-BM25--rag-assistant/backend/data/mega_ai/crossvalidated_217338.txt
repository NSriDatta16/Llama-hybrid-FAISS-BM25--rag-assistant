Two ideas: Use resampling stats (rather than Gaussian) to determine what probability of the results you got based on prior year data. Would be especially good if you have multiple years of the old data. Compare the academic results outside of this class for the students in this class vs prior classes. As always, however, nothing beats: greater sample sizes for valid, reliable conclusions. Because: Law of Large Numbers (not "averages") and queuing theory.
