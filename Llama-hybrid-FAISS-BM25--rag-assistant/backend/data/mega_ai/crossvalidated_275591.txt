effect of family history on incidence, adjustment for parents not yet being diagnosed

I want to analyse a cohort study where individuals where followed for a number of years and to examine factors that influence occurence of disease (by a Cox model or logistic regression). One factor is family history (occurence of disease in patients, assessed at baseline). What adjustment is needed to allow for the fact that some parents may not yet be diagnosed - if its a disease occuring a lot in middle or old age (eg DM, CVD, cancer) - this is an issue I'd have thought when adjusting for age as younger individuals would likely have younger parents who although may be free od disease now may well be diagnosed in years to come.
