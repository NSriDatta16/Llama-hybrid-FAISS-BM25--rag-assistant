Probability of event

You average 3,000 customers per day, of which, on average, 54 are high net worth (HNW). If you have 200 sales associates, who average 15 interactions per day, what’s the probability that a sales associate would service a hnw customer on a given day? What’s the probability they would service a hnw client over the course of 6 days? 30 days? Everything is random; associates all have an equal chance of working with a hnw client for every interaction; associates can only service one customer at a time. Solution should not include replacement - This assumption is what’s causing me confusion on how to solve. I’m also not a student. This is a real business question I’m hoping to apply across numerous client types. This will enable me to show that the value of training client specific situations is not beneficial when 75% of our staff will only retain 25% of the training within 6 days if they have not applied it (per HBR). I keep getting 126% per the image below Thanks!
