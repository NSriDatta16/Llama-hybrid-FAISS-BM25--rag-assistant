Spawning Ruby programs from Ruby

Say I have a ruby script called hello_world.rb that has one line puts "Hello, world" And I want to call that from another ruby script called spawn_hello_world.rb pipe = IO.popen("ruby1.9.1 hello_world.rb", 'w+') if pipe puts pipe.gets end My question is: Is there a shorthand way of running another ruby process without having to call the OS in this way? I'm aware I could do pipe = IO.popen('-', 'w+') which would start another ruby interpreter and I could then send it commands using pipe.puts "puts "Hello World"" But this seems quite inelegant as well. I'm basically looking for a ruby equivalent to python's multiprocessing module
