Interpretation of a linear regression

I have some problems in understanding the results of two linear regressions on the same data. I have 2 variables and I want to know if there is a linear correlation between the two. Let's say velocity of a car and perceived velocity of the conductor. Let's say I have 4 velocities and 2 evaluations of the perceived velocities performed in 2 trials by 15 participants, on a 7 points Likert scale where 1 is very slow and 7 = very fast. Now if I take the AVERAGE values of the evaluations given by the 15 participants for the 4 velocities I get a clear linear relationship with $R^2$ = 0.7. However if I perform the analysis on the raw data (i.e. 15 participants * 2 trials = 30 values for each velocity) I get a $R^2$ = 0.2. Plotting the graph of the velocity data vs perceived velocity I get a mess of points very widely distributed. Why do I get this behavior? Which of the two analyses should I use? The first or the second? How can I interpret my values? Please let me know Thanks in advance
