How to access XML version of CruiseContol.NET Web Dashboard reports (over HTTP)?

I need to determine state of last build (success/failure) and I do it like this: report_url = 'http://.../ViewLatestBuildReport.aspx' success_marker = ' BUILD SUCCESSFUL ' page = urllib.urlopen(report_url) if all(success_marker not in line for line in page): # build is not good, do something ... But this is wasteful (loads entire HTML page), error-prone (I already ran into a bytes/unicode bug) and fragile.
