Windows Workflow 4.0 Activities not being added to the toolbox

I've created a class project in VS 2010 Beta 2. I've added one Activity to it. Saved it. Created another Activity. I would expect the first Activity to appear in the toolbox so I could drag it into my workflow, but it's not. Any ideas?
