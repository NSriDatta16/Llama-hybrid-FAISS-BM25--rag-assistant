him of wrongdoing in order for Altman to be reinstated. Taylor was expected be a member of the new board and Microsoft had also attempted to gain a seat. The Wall Street Journal reported that Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky and businesswoman Laurene Powell Jobs were also considered. Murati had intended to rehire Altman and Brockman, discussing the move with Adam D'Angelo. The Verge reported that Altman intended to return to OpenAI with support from Sutskever. The board chose to name former Twitch chief executive Emmett Shear as OpenAI's chief executive instead of reinstating Altman. Former GitHub chief executive Nat Friedman and Scale AI chief executive Alex Wang reportedly rejected executive offers from the board. Anthropic chief executive Dario Amodei refused to negotiate a deal that could have led to a merge of the two companies. In response, Microsoft appointed Altman as the chief executive of an artificial intelligence research team, joined by Brockman, Pachocki, Sidor, and Madry. Shear expressed interest in commercializing OpenAI with the board's support and stated his intentions to begin an investigation into Altman's removal. Dozens of employees announced their resignations in response to Shear's accession. The next day, a letter signed by 745 of OpenAI's 770 employees threatened mass resignations if the board does not resign; among the signatories was board member Sutskever, who defected from the board and publicly apologized for his participation in the board's previous actions. On November 21, The Verge reported that Altman was reinstated with Taylor, D'Angelo, and economist Lawrence Summers on an interim board. Taylor will chair the board. As part of the compromise deal, Altman and Brockman will not reclaim seats on the board. Altman agreed to an internal investigation into his alleged conduct, selecting two lawyers from WilmerHale to conduct the inquiry. In March 2024, the investigation determined that Altman's behavior "did not mandate removal". Taylor announced that Altman would rejoin OpenAI's board of directors with former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation chief executive Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former Sony Corporation general counsel Nicole Seligman, and Instacart chief executive Fidji Simo. In May 2024, after OpenAI's non-disparagement agreements were exposed, Altman was accused of lying when claiming to have been unaware of the equity cancellation provision for departing employees that don't sign the agreement. Also in May, former board member Helen Toner explained the board's rationale for firing Altman in November 2023. She stated that Altman had withheld information, for example about the release of ChatGPT and his ownership of OpenAI's startup fund. She said that Altman provided "inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place". She also alleged that two executives in OpenAI had reported to the board "psychological abuse" from Altman, and provided screenshots and documentation of "lying and being manipulative in different situations". She said that many employees feared retaliation if they didn't support Altman, and that he had already been fired from Loopt because of what the management team had called "deceptive and chaotic behavior". Aftermath OpenAI The removal left OpenAI in "chaos", according to The New York Times. According to Bloomberg News, a significant number of OpenAI engineers threatened to resign if the board did not reconsider Altman's removal. According to The Information, Altman's removal risked a share sale led by Thrive Capital valuing the company at US$86 billion. A potential second tender offer for early-stage investors was also at risk. The Information later reported that Thrive Capital's tender offer will continue after Altman's reinstatement. OpenAI delayed the release of its online chatbot store as a result of Altman's removal. Market effects Shares in Microsoft fell nearly three percent following the announcement. Ac
