You need a Team Leader with specific skills. Motivator : You have to keep your team Motivated. This is really hard to do, and requires a special personality. Without this skill, small teams like yours are hopeless. 1a. Request thoughtful answers to a controversial question and then after 7 minutes accept one of few answers and go on to something else. This shows that you take the long view and is highly motivating to your contributors Intelligence : For small projects like this, it's best if the Team Leader knows something about everything. If he knows something about everything, everyone is going to follow him. Objective : Remaining objective is very key. Organized : You have to be the most organized out of everyone, because when things get chaotic, people run. And I would say in small projects, this is the skill that most Team Leaders lack. I have been part of several small projects. I would guess that 90% of them fail. I would say it's primarily due to the Team Leader lacking in certain skills. BTW. Good Luck. I couldn't be a Team leader. :)
