how can I find a referenced Javascript method in a big website?

suppose I look at a webpage and I see something like: MysteriousClass mc = new MysteriousClass(); mc.CallMysteriousMethod() Now, the problem is that there are a zillion javascript files included into this page, and how am I supposed to find the one file that contains definition of this MysteriousClass? I know that this could be dealt with using a spider and grep and things like that, but is there a professional and elegant way to do this? Clarification: yeah, so I would like to do it statically, without debugging. So Firebug is the right way to go? As far as IDE go, which IDE should I use? Are there IDEs that will automatically download a website with all of its javascript dependencies and then allow static searches for methods and classes?
