I am presuming by re-order, you mean sort? If you use a dataset, the gridview should take care of all of this functionality for you. If you mean something else by reorder, you are going to have to do some hand coding, or use something like http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webforms/DragAndDropGridView.aspx perhaps.
