Which one is important: training or testing accuracy?

I split my data into 80% training and 20% testing data set. Using the 80% split and 10 cross-validations, I build the model and get the training accuracy. Then I test my model on the 20% split and get the testing accuracy. The question is: which is important training or testing accuracy? If I used 10 different machine learning algorithms on the same split, which accuracy will guide me for the best algorithm, training or testing accuracy? I searched on CV, but the following similar questions are unanswered: Which model is better based on test and training accuracy Should I use training or testing AUC for selecting best classifier? Should using training datasets or testing datasets for evaluating the performance of the models
