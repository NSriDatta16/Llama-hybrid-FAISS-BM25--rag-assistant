@Eric Why is a code solution that works getting voted down? Sure, it's ugly and might not be the fastest way to do it, but it's more instructive that saying "strtol" or "sscanf". If you try it yourself you will learn something about how things happen under the hood. I don't really think your solution should have been voted down, but my guess as to why it's happening is because it's less practical. The idea with voting is that the "best" answer will float to the top, and while your answer might be more instructive about what happens under the hood (or a way it might happen), it's definitely not the best way to parse hex numbers in a production system. Again, I don't think there's anything wrong with your answer from an educational standpoint, and I certainly wouldn't (and didn't) vote it down. Don't get discouraged and stop posting just because some people didn't like one of your answers. It happens. I doubt my answer makes you feel any better about yours being voted down, but I know it's especially not fun when you ask why something's being voted down and no one answers .
