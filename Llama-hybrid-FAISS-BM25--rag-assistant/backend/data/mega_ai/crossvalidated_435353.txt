Question About Graphing

Let's say I have two variables (smoking and lung cancer) that I'm trying to plot on a time series graph. My data for smoking looks like this: 1990/1991 66,000 people smoked, 1991/1992 75,000 people smoked, 1992/1993 86,00 people smoked and so on My data for lung cancer is: 1990 55 000 people developed lung cancer, 1991 80 000 people developed lung cancer, 1992 90 567 people developed lung cancer and so on Note: The number of people given in this example is made up. The actual figures were converted to a percentage. Now, my question is how do I plot the years on the x-axis when one has two years like in smoking and one has only one year like for lung cancer? Does my scale go like this 1990/1991, 1991/1992, 1992/1993, etc and then use this scale to plot both data points? So I'll use the 1990/1991 to plot both the smoking and lung cancer values (which have been converted to a percentage). I seriously hope I made sense in what I was trying to say.
