What kinds of statistical problems are likely to benefit from quantum computing?

We are at the advent of quantum computing , with quantum languages anticipating hardware quantum computers now available at high and low levels for simulated quantum computers. Quantum computing brings new elementary functions like entanglement and teleportation of qubits, measurement of qubits, and imposition of superposition on qubits. What kinds of statistical problems are likely to benefit from quantum computation? For example, will quantum computers provide more ubiquitous true random number generation? What about computationally cheap pseudorandom number generation? Will quantum computing help accelerate MCMC convergence, or ensure upper bounds on convergence time? Will there be quantum algorithms for other sampling-based estimators? This is a broad question, and acceptable answers will also be broad, but kudos if they differentiate quantum and classical computation. (If this is a too broad question, please help me make it a better question.)
