You can intercept the touches events with a gesture recognizer, and then programmatically add the recognizer to all your uibuttons. For instance: // // HighlighterGestureRecognizer.h // Copyright 2011 PathwaySP. All rights reserved. // #import @interface HighlightGestureRecognizer : UIGestureRecognizer { id *beganButton; } @property(nonatomic, assign) id *beganButton; @end and the implementation: // // HighlightGestureRecognizer.m // Copyright 2011 PathwaySP. All rights reserved. // #import "HighlightGestureRecognizer.h" @implementation HighlightGestureRecognizer @synthesize beganButton; -(id) init{ if (self = [super init]) { self.cancelsTouchesInView = NO; } return self; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { self.beganButton = [[[event allTouches] anyObject] view]; if ([beganButton isKindOfClass: [UIButton class]]) { [beganButton setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"grey_screen"] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [self performSelector:@selector(resetImage) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.2]; } } - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)reset { } - (void)ignoreTouch:(UITouch *)touch forEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (BOOL)canBePreventedByGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)preventingGestureRecognizer { return NO; } - (BOOL)canPreventGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)preventedGestureRecognizer { return NO; } - (void)resetImage { [beganButton setBackgroundImage: nil forState:UIControlStateNormal]; } @end Hmm. I didn't test this code, so if it doesn't work, don't sue me, just comment and we'll work it out. I just wrote it real quick for reference. Even if it doesn't work, the logic should still be sound. edit: Forgot to add, the way you'd add the gesture recognizer to your button would be like so: HighlighterGestureRecognizer * tapHighlighter = [[HighlighterGestureRecognizer alloc] init]; [myButton addGestureRecognizer:tapHighlighter]; [tapHighlighter release]; So basically you're declaring it, initializing it, and then adding it. After that, you'll want to release it, since the addGestureRecognizer retains it.
