What's a good method for combining data of different deep learning models?

Suppose I want to predict the probability of a person to buy something. I want to analyze the person image and I can use a convolutional neural network, but I also want to input in my predictive model how many times he bought something, where he goes more frequently and so on. What is a correct way to input in a deep learning model informations from different deep learning models?
