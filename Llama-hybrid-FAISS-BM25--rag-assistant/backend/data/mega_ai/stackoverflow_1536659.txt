Forms authentication List ApplicationNames

Setup: Multiple web servers with synchronized forms authentication. Multiple asp.net Applications running on these severs. What's working: SSO across all servers Authorization using asp.net roles What's not so good: All roles are "global" - I have "admin-app1" and "admin-app2" etc. Question: I know this can be solved by defining different "ApplicationNames" for each of the different applications but what is the most easy way to compile a list of all the different applications a logged on user has a role in? I would like to do something similar to: CurrentUser.Applications() to get a list of "all applications in which the current user has any role". Up to now I have used Roles.GetRolesForUser() to compile the list not very elegant or scalable. Using the SqlRoleProvider I can hack inte the DB to get the complete list of Applications and then compile an application list for the user by query the different application's role providers. My best shot so far but it doesn't feel like the best solution... Any hints or comments? BR, Jens
