It seems kind of unorganized. Merging version 2 into version 1? Eh? What version are you left with? Still version 1? With the features of version 2? Wha..? What I like for smallish projects: Trunk: This is where things get committed when the developer is confident that it's working. Do internal QA testing on the trunk. Tags: Make a new tag for each release, by copying from the trunk. Name your tags "/tags/v1.0" or "/tags/v1.1" or however you want to do it. If you need an external client to test something, name your tag something like "/tags/v1.0-beta" and give them that to test. Don't let them test with the trunk, because while they're testing you're still going to be developing! Branches: When you've got a feature that's going to take some time to develop, you can't commit it to the trunk before it's done. Make a branch. Name it after the feature you're implementing, like "/branches/user_logins". Bugfixes get committed to the trunk and are included in the next tagged release. If there's an emergency bugfix which must be released TODAY, but there's stuff in the trunk which can not yet be released yet, make another tag but copy from the tag of the buggy release instead of from the trunk, call it something like "v1.0.1", fix the bug there, give them a new release, and then merge that bugfix into the trunk.
