What pitfalls arise by using a custom view-state provider?

I have recently started researching how to use a custom view-state provider to move storage of viewstate from the page to the server. The obvious advantage of this is reducing the rendered page size and thus, increasing the user experience. Also, the biggest disadvantage that I know of is that server memory usage will increase. For this issue I can easily move the storage to a different server than the web server (AppFabric, for example) Besides this, are there other pitfalls that may arise? Are there situations where one would use the normal view state provider and not a custom view state provider? I hope my question is clear. Thanks!
