As a first step you could take a sample from the documents. This can be random sampling, but if you know that certain characteristics of the documents are particularly relevant you could use stratified sampling. The second step can be feature extraction. Define characteristics of the documents that may help predicting the accept or reject labels. Give clear definitions; you can use numerical scale, ordinal and nominal (including binary) variables. Determine features and labels in the sample. Third step, developing a prediction model. To predict the binary response there are many kinds of methods available. If you have some experience how some features affect acceptance you may want to build it into a model and use regression techniques e.g. logistic regression, probit regression, and model selection (e.g. stepwise variable selection). If you can't or don't want to build in pre-existing knowledge into the automatic assessment you can use machine learning techniques like random forests, logistic regression tree, support vector machines. Fourth step is validating your model on a second sample. The way to do this can be randomly partitioning your original sample into a modelling and a testing subset before modelling. When you know how well your automatic classification system performs you will be able to judge which documents need human review.
