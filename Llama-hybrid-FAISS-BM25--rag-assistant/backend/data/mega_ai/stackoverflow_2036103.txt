Two points: First, don't use a name that would otherwise require an apostrophe if you can avoid it. Second, you are right in being concerned about ambiguity. For example, you could have: getUsersGroup : gets the group of a list of users. If you are using an object-oriented language, this could have more information than just a group ID string. You could also have something like createUsersGroup , which would create a group object from a list of users passed in. getGroupOfUser : takes in some sort of user object; returns the name of the group of the user getGroupByUserId : takes in the user's name or a unique ID associated with that user; returns the name of the group of the user The best way to delineate the difference between all of these is to just use standard method comments that explain the method names. This would depend on what language you are working with and what style of method comments your organization conventionally uses.
