TeamCity can run build agents on different platforms, for example, one build agent on Windows and one on Linux. There is configuration available to specify which build agents each build goes to. TeamCity isn't free, as in speech, but there is a free, as in beer, version (the Professional Edition) with some limits (3 build agents, 20 users, 20 build configurations).
