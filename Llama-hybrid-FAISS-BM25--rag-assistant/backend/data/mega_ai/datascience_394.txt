Personally, we use S3 on top of GCE and really love it. Depending on how much data you're dealing with, Google Drive just doesn't quite match the 5 TB max that S3 gives you. Also, if you're using python, boto does a pretty fantastic job of making most aws services pretty accessible regardless of what stack you're dealing with. Even if you're not using python, they've got a pretty straightforward API that generally is more accessible than Google Drive. Instead of google drive, though google did recently release a cloud storage service, apart from drive, that lets you more closely integrate your storage with any gce instance you've got, google cloud storage They've got an API which seems to be pretty comparable to S3's, but I can't profess to having really played around with it much. Pricing-wise the two are identical, but I think that the large community and experience with aws in general still puts S3 squarely above both google's cloud storage and google drive.
