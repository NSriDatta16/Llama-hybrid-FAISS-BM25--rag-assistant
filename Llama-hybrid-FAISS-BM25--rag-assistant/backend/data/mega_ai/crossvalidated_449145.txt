Logistic regression with actual probabilities $\in(a,b)$ where $0<a<b<1$

When modelling probabilities with a logistic regression $^1$ , the range of fitted probabilities is $(0,1)$ . The logit function $^2$ asymptotes at $0$ and $1$ , so this is a good match. However, in some applications the actual range $^3$ of probabilities can be $(a,b)$ with $0 , causing a (potentially substantial) mismatch in the tails. For example, consider a population of individuals that all work and get paid. The payment depends on skill, effort and other things that we have measurements of. Each individual is also participating in a lottery with monetary outcomes that are normally distributed with an expected value of zero. The income of an individual is the sum of the job income and the outcome of the lottery. For any given constant $c$ , the conditional probability $p$ of an individual having income greater than $c$ , conditioning on skill, effort and the other things but not the outcome of the lottery, will satisfy $0 . (I am sure there are better examples out there, but this is one that came to mind first.) Questions: How can the logistic regression model be adjusted when $a$ and $b$ are given? (Or is no adjustment needed?) How can the logistic regression model be adjusted when $a$ and $b$ are not given, but we know that $0 ? $^1$ or for that matter, a probit model $^2$ or for that matter, the standard normal CDF $^2$ the range for the individuals of the population of interest
