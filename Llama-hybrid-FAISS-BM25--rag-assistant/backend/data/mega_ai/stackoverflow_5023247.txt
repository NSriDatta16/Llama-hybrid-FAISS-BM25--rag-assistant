How should I organize this code (OOP, interfacing)

I'm trying to create a structure for a graph. So far I'm trying to make up how I should create some classes for edges. Edges in graphs can be Regular, Directed, Weighted (or any of the above). So what do you think is the best way to organize this class, I was thinking of creating a interface IEdge, and then create the classes public interface IEdge{ } public class DirectedEdge implements IEdge{} public class WeightedEdge implements IEdge{} But now I've come with a problem, it's not very flexible, what if I want the following public class DirectedWeightedEdge implements IEdge{} How would you code this?
