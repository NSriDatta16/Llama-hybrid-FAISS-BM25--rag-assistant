Outlook: How to SetParent(_form.Handle, Outlook.Handle) without Paint issues?

I would like to set the top level window handle of Outlook to be the parent of a Settings form in my add-in (so it appears on top, stays in Outlook, etc). Using SetParent in other Office apps works fine, but in Outlook I get rendering errors. The form doesn't repaint correctly when Outlook is the parent (so if I drag it around or click out and back, other parts of Outlook are drawn on top of it). Any Invalidate-ing I do is ignored. Anybody know a good solution? Thanks! EDIT: The form I want to add is a .Net form, which might be part of the problem.
