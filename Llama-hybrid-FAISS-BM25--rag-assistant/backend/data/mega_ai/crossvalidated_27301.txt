Given a set of N features a PCA analysis will produce (1) the linear combination of the features with the highest variance (first PCA component), (2) the linear combination with the highest variance in the subspace orthogonal to the first PCA component etcetera (under the constraint that the coefficients of the combination form a vector with unit norm) Whether the linear combination with maximum variance is a "good" feature really depends on what you are trying to predict. For this reason I would say that being a PCA component and being a "good" features are (in general) two unrelated notions.
