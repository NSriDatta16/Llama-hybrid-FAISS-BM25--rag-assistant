This isn't an answer, but I know it's possible. I have seen this behavior in "Twitter for iPhone" and asked myself the same question. If you use that app, check out what happens when you swipe the individual tweets to reveal more controls underneath. This looks like it's part of TableCellView and some touch drag combination. As for the implementation of that... well, im too novice right now.
