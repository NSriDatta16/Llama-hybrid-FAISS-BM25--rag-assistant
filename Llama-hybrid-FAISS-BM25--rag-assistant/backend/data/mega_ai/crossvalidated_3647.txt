For demographic forecasting of any quality whatsoever you need to account for birth and death rates and, if possible, migration, breaking them down by gender (at a minimum) and, if possible, by race. These rates have all changed substantially during your time period and are likely to continue changing in the future. This information is available on the US Census Bureau's site. Many states have state-specific mortality tables available. I have performed such projections at state and even census tract levels with the same aim in mind (to support market research analysis for assisted living facilities) and found that a careful projection will differ substantially from purely statistical (demographically ignorant) procedures like moving averages or regression.
