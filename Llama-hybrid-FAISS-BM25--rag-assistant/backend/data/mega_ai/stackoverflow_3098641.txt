Is there an easy way of interpreting PHP code within an HAML file?

Currently this is how I write a php file using Haml: %ul#nav %li %a Output: I which I could have something like this: %ul#nav %li %a=$nav1 I checked pHaml and phpHaml but coudn't figure out how to use it, and I saw their last versions, and they are from 2007 (so it discouraged me even more). Placing Php inside a Haml file is really that unpopular? Is there a new and easy way of doing it?
