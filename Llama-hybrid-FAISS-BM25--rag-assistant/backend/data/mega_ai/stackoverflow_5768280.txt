I had this problem while using a syntax that used to work on xcode 3.x and does not work for xcode 4 anymore. I was using just "pragma" #pragma - My Pragma Text That used to work fine for xcode 3 but, for xcode 4, the complete syntax has to be used. This means that #pragma must always be followed by the "mark" keyword. #pragma mark - My Pragma Text EDIT Xcode 6 (fixed in beta 4) uses // MARK: syntax for swift files
