You will need a Memcache server and a Memcache client. I've found one of the best Memcache servers for Windows platforms is http://www.membase.com/products-and-services/memcached It is built by the original Memcached developers. Setup takes a few minutes and configuration is very easy through their web interface. The recommended Memcache client for .NET is Enyim http://memcached.enyim.com/ You can find configuration examples for Enyim at https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki Alternatively, I've actually found Microsoft AppFabric Caching (codenamed Velocity) to work better for .NET. I had serialization issues with Memcache and Linq objects, and AppFabric worked without a problem. Here is a tutorial on AppFabric if you're interested in that as well http://www.hanselman.com/blog/InstallingConfiguringAndUsingWindowsServerAppFabricAndTheVelocityMemoryCacheIn10Minutes.aspx
