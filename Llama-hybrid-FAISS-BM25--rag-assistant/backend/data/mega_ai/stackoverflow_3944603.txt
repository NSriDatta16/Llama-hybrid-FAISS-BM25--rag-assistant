Since you are unable to display columns in the Page Footer, what I do is create A @MyParam and set it as Internal. Under Default Values Select "From Query" then select the dataset and set the Value Field to the column one you want to display. Drag out a TextBox and place it in the page footer, edit the Expression for the TextBox and have it display the @MyParam rather than the column. This will repeat the entire column, not the "overflow" from the original column.
