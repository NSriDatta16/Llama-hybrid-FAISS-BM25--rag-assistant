ntified. These can be seen as city centers for example. By using the natural cities method in this way further border delineations can be made dependent on the scale the natural cities were generated from. Natural cities derived from smaller regional areas will provide less accurate but still usable results in certain analysis, like for example determining urban expansion over time. As mentioned before though, optimally natural cities should be based on a massive amount of for example street intersections for an entire country or even the world. This is because natural cities are based on the wisdom of crowds thinking, which needs the biggest set of available data for the best results. Also note that the structure of natural cities can be considered to be fractal in nature. It is important when head/tail breaks are being used to generate natural cities, that the data is not aggregated afterwards. For example, the amount of generated natural cities can only be known after they are generated. It is not possible to use a pre-defined number of cities for an area or country and aggregate the results of the natural cities to administratively determined city borders. Naturally natural cities should follow Zipf's law, if they do not, the area is most likely too small, or data has probably been processed wrongly. An example of this is seen in a research where head/tail breaks were used to extract natural cities, but they were aggregated to administrative borders, which following that concluded that the cities do not follow Zipf's law. This happens more often in science, where papers actually produce results which are actually false. Color rendering DEM Current color renderings for DEM or density map are essentially based on conventional classifications such as natural breaks or equal intervals, so they disproportionately exaggerate high elevations or high densities. As a matter of fact, there are not so many high elevations or high-density locations. It was found that coloring based head/tail breaks is more favorable than those by other classifications. [2] Mapping scaling hierarchy The pattern of far more small things than large ones frequently recurs in geographical data. A spiral layout inspired by the golden ratio or Fibonacci sequence can help visualize this recursive notion of scaling hierarchy and the different levels of scale. In other words, from the smallest to the largest scale, a map can be seen as a map of a map of a map, and so on. Further applications Other applications of Head/tail breaks: Serving as a method for efficiently estimating the absolute Boltzmann's entropy of numerical raster data Quantifying the multiscale representation of a polyline Increasing computational efficiency in data-flow analysis by emphasizing the head part of the flow dataset Temporal analysis of urban expansion related to the thermal environment Image analysis where anisotropy is measured in point patterns extracted with a digital pulse transform with the use of head/tail breaks Visualizing and analyzing spatial patterns in bilateral trade To identify urban function graphs, note that this paper applies head/tail breaks on a Gaussian kernel density estimation which reduces the accuracy of the head/tail breaks method. Essentially a natural cities approach is taken but the initial data chosen to perform head/tail breaks on has been reduced beforehand. For a better representation of urban function graphs head/tail breaks may be applied as the first step in delineating these areas. Analyzing structures or hotspots naturally occurring within data to highlight areas of interest (Based on natural cities). (Over)Tourism analysis based on short term rentals (like AirBnB) by creating hotspots out of the distribution of rented out apartments.
