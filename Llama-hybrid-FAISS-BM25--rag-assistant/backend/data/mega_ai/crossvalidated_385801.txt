Model architecture are application dependent. If you want to have spatial relation, then we prefer Convolutional network (CNN) and if you want to have temporal relation in data( like in text ), then use Recurrent network (RNN). But in this case you can also use CONV1D , it has given comparable result too. Now, coming to your question, for designing part, you have to be clear about, what you want to do? In this case, you can also try 1D-CNN, which have kernel size same as the input length. You can also use Auto-ML for automating things, where you need to define your data-set, it will find optimal architecture for us by trying different-2 setting. For more info, you can look at https://autokeras.com/ . But as you are new to field, i would say, try it by yourself. The model architecture is art and it come by experience.
