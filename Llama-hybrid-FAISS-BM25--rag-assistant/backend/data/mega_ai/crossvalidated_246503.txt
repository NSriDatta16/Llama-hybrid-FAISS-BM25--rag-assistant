See Hoeffding's inequality and Chernoff's bound here for different ways you can bound the $p_i$ values as dependent on $N_i$ (note that the estimate would just be the empirical average, but your confidence in how near that is to the actual value would improve). Note that as your $N_i$ values decrease, the estimate is less accurate (at the same confidence level). In order to make a statement regarding your certainty that $p_i > p_{i+1}$ would thus be dependent on both $N_i$ and $N_{i+1}$.
