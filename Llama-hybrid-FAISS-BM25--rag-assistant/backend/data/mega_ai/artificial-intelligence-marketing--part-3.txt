 consumer experience. By using consumer data and combining that data with AI and marketing techniques, firms will have better understandings of what their customers want, and make customized products and services for their customers. Ethics and algorithmic biases Algorithmic biases are errors in computer programs that have the potential to give unfair advantage to some and disadvantage others. Concerns for artificial intelligence marketing is the possibility that artificial intelligence algorithms can be affected by existing biases from the programmers that designed the AI algorithms. Or the inability of an AI to detect biases because of its own calculations. On the other hand, there is the belief that AI bias in business is an inflated argument as business and marketing decisions are based on human-biases and decision-makings. In part to further the shareholders goals for their business and from decisions for what they indent to sell to attract specific consumers . Ethics and misrepresentation In March 2024, the SEC charged Delphia (USA) Inc. and Global Predictions Inc. for using false claims about their AI capabilities in marketing materials, highlighting the ethical challenges of artificial intelligence marketing. Misleading AI marketing practices, such as "AI washing," undermine consumer trust and damage brand reputation. Research shows that leveraging data-driven approaches, including analyzing corporate disclosures and AI engagement metrics, improves the transparency and reliability of AI-powered marketing strategies. Collect, reason, act Artificial intelligence marketing principles are based on the perception-reasoning-action cycle found in cognitive science. In the context of marketing, this cycle is adapted to form the collect, reason and act cycle. Collect This term relates to all activities which aim to capture customer or prospect data; for example on social media platforms, where the platform will measure the duration of time a post was viewed. Whether taken online or offline, this data is then saved into customer or prospect databases. Reason This is the stage where data is transformed into information and, eventually, intelligence or insight. This is the phase where artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular play a key role. Act With the intelligence gathered in the reason stage, one can then act. In the context of marketing, an act would be an attempt to influence a prospect or customer purchase decision using an incentive driven message. In an unsupervised model, the machine in question would take the decision and act according to the information it received in the collect stage. Future trends AI marketing and user personalization AI's integration across many sectors is transforming innovation, improving efficiency and adaptability. AI's ability to analyze data, and patterns enables it to produce hyper-personalized advertisements. AI marketing will be an important tool for all businesses to thrive in contemporary times. For example, retail companies are doing everything they can to learn about us and our shopping habits. Target is one of the companies that has been smart about predictive analytics. Target AI models were able to predict if a woman was pregnant or not through their shopping habits. For instance, a woman suddenly starts buying unscented lotion and zinc vitamins which are signals that a woman is pregnant. Even if parents don't know that their daughter is pregnant, Target's algorithm can predict when she is due. Target alone estimates that they have made billion dollars by targeting pregnant women. AI allows companies to understand customers buying habits and make personalized ads based on consumers interests. AI's ability to predict and understand customer choices in realtime helps companies tailor their content according to customers needs. This allows companies to reach the right consumers at the right time. With precise targeting businesses can make more profits, increase custom
