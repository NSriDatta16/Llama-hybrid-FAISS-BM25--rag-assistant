Embedding SpiderMonkey in a portable C app

I'd like to embed Mozilla's SpiderMonkey in one of my C apps. On linux, I don't think it'll be a problem (I'm a linux user) but I must confess that I'm afraid that I have no clue on how to do it on windows using MINGW (I want the app to be portable) Is it possible to, say, just use the dll that comes with firefox? (I, honnestly, don't even know how to use dlls with MINGW) Do you have any tips, hints, tutorials on how to build (or just embed spidermonkey) on windows using MINGW (I refuse to use Visual Studio :) ) Or do you have an alternative solution other than SpiderMonkey that's easy to use, and can do some basic javascript stuff (I don't need DOM for eg.) ? Thanks a LOT!
