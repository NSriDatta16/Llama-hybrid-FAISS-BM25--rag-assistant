How to use densities for Naive Bayesian classification?

This is a simple question I think. I am using the following R package for non parametric naive Bayesian classification: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/rdrr.io/a/cran/naivebayes/man/nonparametric_naive_bayes.html However, it uses the pdf of the features directly and this is problematic as some densities return a value greater than 1. Can I standardise my features in some way to prevent this ? Cheers Duane
