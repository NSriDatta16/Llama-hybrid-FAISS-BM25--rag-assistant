STL is a more advanced technique to extract seasonality, in the sense that is allows seasonality to vary, which is not the case in decompose . To get an understanding at how STL works: the algorithm estimates every seasonal sub-serie (in a 7-day seasonality, it will estimate 7 sub-series: the Monday time serie, the Tuesday time serie, etc.), it will then estimate the local seasonality by running a loess regression on every sub-serie. This allows to capture the varying effect in the seasonality. If you do not want your seasonality to vary (in other words the estimated effect of each sub-serie will remain constant across the whole time serie), you can specify the seasonal window to be infinite or "periodic". This is equivalent to average each sub-serie and giving an equal weight to all points (you do not have any "local" effect anymore). decompose is essentially the same, as the seasonal sub-components will remain constant across your whole time serie, which is a special configuration of STL. This is pretty well explained here: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1 . STL estimates seasonality in an additive way. As explained a few pages later in the previous source, you can estimate seasonality in a multiplicative way by resorting to log transformation (or Cox-Box transformation).
