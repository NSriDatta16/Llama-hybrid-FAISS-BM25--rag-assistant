Write at the end of an xml

i have multiple Xml files, in a List . What i want is to transform those xml into one Xml with an Xsl : Failure Error N/A My problem is that when i am looping and apply the transform with a TransformerFactory it always erase the output XML. I want to edit the output instead. I know that i can do it in java with a temporary XML and after merge it, but i'm almost sure that it is possible in XSL? Thanks for helping
