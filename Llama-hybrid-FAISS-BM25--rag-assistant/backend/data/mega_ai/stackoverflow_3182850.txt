The usual method for approximating the Hessian in 3 dimensions is the BFGS The L-BFGS method is similar. Here you can find the source code for the L-BFGS (which calculates the Hessian as an intermediate result for solving ODEs) in several languages (C#, C++, VBA, etc.) although not in python. I think it is not easy to translate. If you are going to translate the alg from another language, pay particular attention to numerical errors and do sensitivity analysis (you'll need to calculate the inverse of the Hessian matrix)
