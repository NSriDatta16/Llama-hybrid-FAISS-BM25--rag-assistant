Combining a UILongPressGestureRecognizer with a UIPanGestureRecognizer

I d'like to combine a UILongPressGestureRecognizer with a UIPanGestureRecognizer. The UIPanGestureRecognizer should start with a long press. Is there a simple way to do this? or do I really have to write my own gesture recognizer? I wan't something like on the home screen. You press on an icon and after some time the icons start wobbling. Afterwards without releasing my finger from the screen I can start dragging the icon under my finger around.
