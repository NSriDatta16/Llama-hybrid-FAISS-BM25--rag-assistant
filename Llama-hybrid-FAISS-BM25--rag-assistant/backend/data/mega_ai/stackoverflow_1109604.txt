Parse URLs of major video streaming sites and generate appropriate code for embedding

Posting a video on tumblr.com allows you to just paste the URL of the video on youtube, vimeo, whatever and tumblr automatically does the embedding for you. I assume that this would be nothing more than a mapping between an URL-regex and the belonging HTML construct for embedding the video. Or it is just parsing the response of the URL and getting the construct from there. Is there already any utility, preferably in Java, for doing this? If not, how would you do it?
