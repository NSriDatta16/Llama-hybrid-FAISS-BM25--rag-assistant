How do I get rid of NaNs in MATLAB?

I have files which have many empty cells which appear as NaNs when I use cell2mat , but the problem is when I need to get the average values I cannot work with this as it shows error with NaN. In excel it overlooks NaN values, so how do I do the same in MATLAB? In addition, I am writing a file using xlswrite : xlswrite('test.xls',M); I have data in all rows except 1. How do I write: M(1,:) = ('time', 'count', 'length', 'width') In other words, I want M(1,1)='time' , M(1,2)='count' , and so on. I have data from M(2,1) to M(10,20) . How can I do this?
