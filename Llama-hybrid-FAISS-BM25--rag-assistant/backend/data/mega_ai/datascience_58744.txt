If you think fuzzy matching does not work, you basically have two options: Unsupervised: Try topic modeling to find „similar“ products. The problem is that you will need to pre-define the number of products (groups, aka „topics“), which can be a problem. Also topic modeling will only work well if there are sufficient differences in the descriptions. https://github.com/Bixi81/R-ml/blob/master/NLP_topic_modelling.R An unsupervised approach seems to be a good option for you, judging from what you wrote about your problem. Supervised: If you have a good set of descriptions with a label (e.g. product 1, product 2, etc), you can use some NLP model to predict which text belongs to which product. Not sure how much you know about it: You could start with a „ Bag of Words “ and try things like Lasso, Boosting , or even Neural Nets on this. Here is an example on how to apply Neural Nets to text classification. But be aware: in real world applications, text classification can be very tricky, especially if you have many classes (products in your case) and not so many observations per class (descriptions in your case).
