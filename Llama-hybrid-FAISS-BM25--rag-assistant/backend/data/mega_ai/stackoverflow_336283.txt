Unfortunately, TextBox, RichTextBox, and FlowDocument viewers always mark drag-and-drop events as handled, which prevents them from bubbling up to your handlers. You can restore drag-and-drop events being intercepted by these controls by force-handling the drag-and-drop events (use UIElement.AddHandler and set handledEventsToo to true) and setting e.Handled to false in your handler.
