How to configure the intermediate output directory in C#

I'm trying to organize my workspace and want my intermediate objects to be put in the ..\build\obj folder in relation to my .csproj file. So I put: ..\build\obj\Debug in the .csproj file. The intermediate objects are now put in that location when the solution is built, but the problem is that an obj directory is still created in the directory the .csproj file is in (something to the effect of obj\Debug\TempPE ) when the solution is opened. What is this directory for, and how can I relocate it?
