How do I correctly use Recursion in MATLAB?

I have a simple m file that I have created as a recursive function: function[velocity] = terminal(m,c,t,vi) %inputs: % m = mass % c = coeffcient of drag % t = time % vi = initial velocity if t==18, velocity = vi+(9.8-c/m*(vi))*2; return end velocity = vi+(9.8-c/m*(vi))*2; velocity %used to print out velocity for debugging terminal(m,c,t+2,velocity); end The calculation of velocity is being done correctly as it prints out every recursion. However the "ans" that is returned at the end is the first calculated value of recursion. My question is how do I correctly setup a matlab function recursively? Or can it be done, and is it better to use a loop?
