Is there any good reason to use PCA instead of EFA? Also, can PCA be a substitute for factor analysis?

In some disciplines, PCA (principal component analysis) is systematically used without any justification, and PCA and EFA (exploratory factor analysis) are considered as synonyms. I therefore recently used PCA to analyse the results of a scale validation study (21 items on 7-points Likert scale, assumed to compose 3 factors of 7 items each) and a reviewer asks me why I chose PCA instead of EFA. I read about the differences between both techniques, and it seems that EFA is favored against PCA in a majority of your answers here. Do you have any good reasons for why PCA would be a better choice? What benefits it could provide and why it could be a wise choice in my case?
