Dates countries joined/left international organisations

Does anyone know of a reliable data source containing the dates countries left or joined international organisations, for example,WTO, EU. etc? Ideally I'd like this going back to 1946. Even the year rather than exact date would be helpful.Bonus marks for it in a Python Package!
