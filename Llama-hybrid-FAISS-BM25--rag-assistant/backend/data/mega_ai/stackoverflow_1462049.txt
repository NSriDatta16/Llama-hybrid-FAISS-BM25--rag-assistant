XSLT - Adding Elements dynamically

I've a need to display certain XML content in tabular form (XSL-FO for pdf reports), and not all the columns to displayed are present in source XML. So, I was wondering if there is a way to transform source XML by embedding additional columns based on certain element values, and then process the resulting XML to display content? As an example, for source data: John Doe dev 100 Paul Coder dev 40 Henry Tester qa 80 Peter Tester qa 40 I'd like the data to be displayed as : Name Role Dev QA --------------------------- John Doe dev 100 Paul Coder dev 40 Henry Tester qa 80 Peter Tester qa 40 --------------------------- Role Totals: 140 120 --------------------------- I would like to know if I can use something like: So that I can embed elements 100 and so on at run time during first pass, and then use the resulting XML to display data for new columsn 'dev' and 'qa', that way, calculating totals for each role type will be much simpler (for eg. "sum(preceding-sibling::member/dev)" for dev column), and the data for each cell in 'dev' and 'qa' colums could simply be the value-of these tags respectively. It got the desired results the hard way using following stylesheet (page formatting details omitted to keep it brief), but am not convinced that this is the apt solution. ... Role Totals: ...
