Incorporating Posterior Samples In Bayesian Meta-Analysis

I have results from 25 experiments that include an estimate of mean effect and a thousand posterior samples of the effect. Rather than use the standard deviation of these posterior samples as the standard error, and then assume a normal prior, can I directly incorporate these 1000 samples for each experiment? My question is related to So how would you include Bayesian estimates in a meta-analysis? , but I don't think the answer directly addresses this question.
