What is crisp logic (in the area of classification)?

I have a brief question. I am having trouble finding a good reference that explains what crisp logic is. What I think: I have two classification models, a decision tree and a ruleset, which I think are crisp models. Since they say that an instance is either class A or not. I have another classification model, a logistic regression, that is not crisp, since it gives the probability that an instance belongs to this class. I want to mention this in a presentation that I have later today. I tried looking up this subject, but it would be great if somebody could just confirm how I interpreted it. I could also use a good reference to use in my paper. Thanks,
