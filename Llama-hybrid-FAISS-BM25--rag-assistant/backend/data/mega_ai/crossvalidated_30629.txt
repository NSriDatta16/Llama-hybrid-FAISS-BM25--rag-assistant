You could push the MCMC machinery one step further by simulating the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s conditional on $x_i$ and $w$. Indeed, your equation $$f(x_i|w)=\int_{\Delta(xi)}f(\mathbf{c}_i|w)d\mathbf{c}_i$$ states that $x_i$ is obtained by marginalisation over the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s. In statistical terms, the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s are latent variables: they are not observed, but they are useful in defining the sampling model. Therefore, an alternative solution is to incorporate all the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s within your model and to simulate them as well as $w$ conditional on the $x_i$'s: Gibbs sampling version: simulate the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s conditional on $x_i$ and $w$; simulate $w$ conditional on the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s (since they are independent of the $x_i$'s, conditionally on the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s). Metropolis-Hastings version: Make a proposal for a new value of $w$, e.g. $w\sim q(w|w_{t-1})$; Given $w$ and the $x_i$'s, simulate the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s; Accept the proposed $w$ with probability $$ \dfrac{q(w_{t-1}|w)}{q(w|w_{t-1})}\, \dfrac{\pi(w)\prod_i f(\mathbf{c}_i|w)}{\pi(w_{t-1})\prod_i f(\mathbf{c}_{i,t-1}|w_{t-1})}\,\wedge 1 $$ This way, you do not introduce an extra degree of approximation in the analysis. Even though simulating the $\mathbf{c}_i$'s obviously increases your computing time,
