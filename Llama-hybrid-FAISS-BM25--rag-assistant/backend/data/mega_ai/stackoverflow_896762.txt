Do you see any issues managing those views in standard way? I assume you create each view either from nib or pragmatically. You use UINavigatorController and/or UITabBarController and you add views, for tab bar controller as an array for navigator controller you pop up the first view and setup callback methods. Other views are pushed/popped as user navigates UI. I believe that UINavigationController will unload views if there's not enough memory and load it back when needed. If you postpone all the hard work until when the data are needed then you should be ok - unless you hit some limits but I can't tell since there's not enough details about what is in those views - complex data, images ...
