in GLSL under OpenGL ES 2, how can I write a shader that operates on the previous output

I need a shader that starts with a given texture, then each frame of animation operates on the previous output of the shader plus other input. How do I organize the framebuffers so that each frame has access to the output of the previous frame without having to move the buffer back and forth from the CPU?
