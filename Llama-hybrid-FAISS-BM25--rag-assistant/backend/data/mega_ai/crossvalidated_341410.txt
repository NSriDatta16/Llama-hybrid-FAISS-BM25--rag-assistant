What's the potential best model to solve this classification problem?

I'm facing a classification problem as follows: the features: an array of floats. The relationship between features and target is not notable, so I'm not expecting a 90% accuracy or so. As long as it can solve the problem it is good for me. the target: a float that could be positive or negative or zero. the problem: predict the sign of the target (i.e. 0 , + , or - ) so that the sum of sign * target reaches maximum. As comparison, I can predict with a brutal force guess using only one feature, for example, if feature>0, then predict + , otherwise - . Currently I'm using a random forest with a metric f1_weighted and 5 fold CV, this does not give good test result compared with brutal force guess. While the training and CV results are close to theoretical maximum sum. What could be the best approach to modify my current model/create a new model if necessary to get the test set result at least better than brutal force guess?
