You can set the root folder with rope-open-project . Once you've set the root project a .ropeproject dir will be created. Inside it, a config.py file has hooks where you can run (python) code once the project is set. The project_opened(project): function is a good place to run code. I usually activate the virtual environment imp.load_source('/path-to-env/activate_this.py') , so that I can get source coverage for other libs in the virtual env.
