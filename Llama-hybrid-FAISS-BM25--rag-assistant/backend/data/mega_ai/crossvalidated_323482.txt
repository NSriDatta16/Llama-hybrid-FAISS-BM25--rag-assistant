Proper statistical procedure for repeated RCTs on the same group (without replacement)

Setting: Longitudinal data on outcome Yi,t of a group of individuals, i={1,...,N}, over time, t={1,...,T} On this group, a sequence of RCTs (r={1,...,R}) staggered over time is applied. Each RCT is measuring the effect of a specific treatment and treats a small percentage of the population. Once an individual is treated in a certain round (r=x) then he is no longer eligible for other future RCTs (rounds). I am trying to measure the specific impact of each treatment (eq 1), as well as the average impact of the treatments (eq 2). Yi,t,r = ALPHAr TREATEDi,r + BETAr (TREATEDi,r*I_POST_TREATMENTt,r) Yi,t = ALPHA*TREATEDi + BETA *(TREATEDi *I_POST_TREATMENTt) The control group of that same round (r=x) on the other hand may be "contaminated" by being treated in a future RCT. Because trials treat a small percentage of the population each round (without replacement), and there aren't that many rounds, a significant proportion of the control group remains untreated over the entire period. What is the correct statistical procedure to adopt here? Is there a technical term for this sort of setting? Any relevant literature I should look at? EDIT: To try to collect me inputs, I cross posted on Stata List here
