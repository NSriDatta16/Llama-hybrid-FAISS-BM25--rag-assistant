To show that such a stationary process does not exist, it suffices to show that $\gamma$ is not non-negative definite (see Definition 1.5.1 and Theorem 1.5.1 of Time Series: Theory and Methods by Brockwell and Davis), which can be shown by demonstrating the covariance matrix $\Gamma$ of $(Y_1, Y_2, Y_{K + 2})$ is not non-negative definite. By assumption, the order $3$ matrix $\Gamma$ equals to \begin{align} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}. \end{align} It is easy to verify that the determinant of this matrix is $-1$ , hence it cannot be non-negative definite (here we used the fact that if a matrix is PSD, then its determinant must be non-negative). To put in a more comprehensible way, consider the linear combination $X = Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_{K + 2}$ . Under the assumption, the variance of $X$ is $1 + 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 = -1 , which is absurd.
