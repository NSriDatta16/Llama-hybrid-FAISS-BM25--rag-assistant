Artificial intelligence in digital marketing Artificial intelligence has transformed the digital marketing landscape by allowing businesses to capture large amounts of consumer data, leading to data-driven marketing strategies. Businesses like Amazon can utilize user's purchase, search, and viewing history on their platforms, to create customized user experiences. For example, relevant products can be advertised to the user to guide their purchasing behavior. AI algorithms are used to analyze all the available user data and ultimately create user personalized recommendations. Virtual influencers on social media Virtual influencers are computer-generated digital characters powered by artificial intelligence that act like human social media influencers. They can post content, interact with followers, and promote brands online. Unlike human influencers, virtual influencers give brands complete creative control and lower the risk of reputational problems. In 2024, global spending on AI-driven virtual influencers reached over USD 4.6 billion and is expected to surpass USD 8 billion by 2025, showing rapid growth in sectors like fashion, beauty, and technology. Virtual influencers work on social media platforms to engage audiences and build relationships similar to human influencers. They are not limited by physical presence or time, which allows for continuous online engagement. Research shows that many people respond to these AI personalities as if they were real, especially Generation Z, showing similar levels of trust, credibility, and emotional connection. Their success often depends on how much they appear like real humans and the way their stories are told to make them feel realistic and relatable. Studies also warn about the uncanny valley effect, where virtual influencers that look too realistic may make some viewers feel uncomfortable. To avoid this, creators often balance realism with cartoonish features. Factors such as reliability, helpfulness, entertainment value, and humanlike traits influence how much followers engage with virtual influencers and how likely they are to buy promoted products. There are also ethical concerns. Some audiences do not realize these virtual influencers are not real, which can lead to concerns about their honesty and transparency. Acceptance can vary by region: East Asian audiences tend to be more comfortable with AI-generated personas, while Western audiences often prefer clear disclosure. Models like the Virtual Influencer Trust and Engagement Model (VITEM) suggest that transparency, disclosure, and cultural context affect how audiences trust and interact with virtual influencers.
