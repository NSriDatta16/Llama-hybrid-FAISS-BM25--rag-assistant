Subset data by month in R

I am working with a time series of meteorological data and want to extract just the summer months. The data frame looks like this: FECHA;H_SOLAR;DIR_M;DIR_S;VEL_M;VEL_S;VEL_X;U;V;TEMP_M;HR;BAT;PRECIP;RAD;UVA;UVB;FOG;GRID; 00/01/01;23:50:00;203.5;6.6;2.0;0.5;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;6.0;-99.9;9.0;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9 00/01/02;23:50:00;235.5;7.5;1.8;0.5;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;6.1;-99.9;8.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9 00/01/03;23:50:00;217.4;6.1;1.4;0.5;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;7.0;-99.9;8.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9 00/01/04;23:50:00;202.5;8.6;1.8;0.5;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;6.4;-99.9;8.8;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9 00/01/05;23:50:00;198.5;7.1;1.8;0.5;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;5.4;-99.9;8.8;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9;-99.9 I have found some examples of time subsetting in R but only between an starting and end date. What I want is to extract all data from a month for all years to create a new data frame to work with. I can create a zoo time series from the data but how do I subset? zoo aggregate? Thanks in advance for your help.
