A single solution with 270 projects sounds like a problem to start with. How long does it take to open VS? :) (Seriously, can you either combine some projects together or split the solution?) Typically I keep the unit tests in their own project, but in the same solution. Within the project, mirror the folder/namespace structure of the production project. Have a look at how Noda Time is organised for an example. I've been at companies where they've been kept in a separate solution, but that was really painful. (They had a good-ish reason: the tests were in VS2005 and the production code was 2003.) Sometimes I've set the default namespace of the test project to be the same as the production project - that's more important in Java than in .NET (as it lets you get at package access members) but it can still be helpful as it means the class you're going to test doesn't need to be imported.
