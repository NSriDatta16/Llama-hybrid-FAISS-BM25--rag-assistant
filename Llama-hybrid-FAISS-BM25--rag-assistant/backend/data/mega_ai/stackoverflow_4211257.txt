Let me segregate first your inquiries per paragraph and give some comments. For your question where to insert or read commands, I would usually call my insert/read commands in another project/class file. However, these commands are triggered in my user interface. That means, if I have to retrieve my records to view them, I would setup my read commands in my Data Access Project/Class then trigger them in my user interface once it loads my page. Or, if I will insert new records, I will set a method to insert up in my class project/class file then call it in my user interface. How often does this happen? I haven't encountered this since. It's usually that once you inserted/updated a data, the datasource refreshes itself.
