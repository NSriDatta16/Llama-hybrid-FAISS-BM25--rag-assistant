You're going to need a GUI framework. Several are listed in this SO question . Don't jump straight for shoes, however: it may not have all the capabilities you need for your second question. Shoes is an excellent lightweight framework but you're probably going to need to go deeper. Take a good long look at the String class, you're going to need it. You're also going to need to respond to events within the text box control of whatever framework you choose, so check that it's able to tell you about things like key-down/up, mouse-down/up/click/drag and so on.
