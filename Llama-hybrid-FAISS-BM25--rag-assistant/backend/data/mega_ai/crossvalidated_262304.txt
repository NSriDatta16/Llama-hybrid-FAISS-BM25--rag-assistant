The currently represented parameter estimates represent the difference with a reference category(the one for which no parameter is shown, since it is evidently 0). This is called treatment-coding, the default in R. For a factor with $n$ levels you only need to estimate $n-1$ parameters. You could also get a representation with all parameter estimates, the reference category being the average of all the categories. This is called sum-coding, for which the contrast matrix can be called with contr.sum() . The parameter estimates are then restricted to sum to 0. See the ?contrasts function for more options.
