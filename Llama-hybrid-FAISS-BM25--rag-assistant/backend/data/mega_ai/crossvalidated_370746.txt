To prove the statement on the slide, we need to combine these points: $X, Y$ , and $Z$ are binary variables. $P(X|Y) = 1$ if $x = y$ , and $0$ otherwise. $P(Z|Y) = 1$ if $z = y$ , and $0$ otherwise. The Bayesian network implies $P(X,Y,Z) = P(Y)P(X|Y)P(Z|Y)$ So now let's see what we know about $P(Z|X)$ . I'll look at the case $P(Z = 1 | X = 1)$ but the same algebra can be used for the other possibilities. Using the definition of conditional probability we see $P(Z = 1|X = 1) = \frac{P(X = 1,Z = 1)}{P(X = 1)} = \frac{\sum_{y = 0}^1 P(X = 1,Y = y, Z = 1)}{P(X = 1)} = $ $\frac{\sum_{y = 0}^1 P(Y = y)P(X = 1|Y = y)P(Z = 1 | Y = y)}{P(X = 1)} = $ $\frac{P(Y = 0) * 0 + P(Y = 1)*1}{P(X = 1)} = \frac{P(Y = 1)}{P(X = 1)}$ . Now we can use $P(X = 1) = \sum_{y = 0}^1 P(X = 1 | Y = y) P(Y = y) = $ $P(Y = 0) * 0 + P(Y = 1) * 1 = P(Y = 1)$ So we end up with the conclusion $P(Z = 1 | X = 1) = \frac{P(Y = 1)}{P(X = 1)} = \frac{P(Y = 1)}{P(X = 1)} = \frac{P(Y = 1)}{P(Y = 1)} = 1$ . Similarly we can show $P(Z = 0|X = 0) = 1$ and as a consequence we get $P(Z = 0 | X = 1) = P(Z = 1 | X = 0) = 0$ . So we see that $X$ and $Z$ are not independent.
