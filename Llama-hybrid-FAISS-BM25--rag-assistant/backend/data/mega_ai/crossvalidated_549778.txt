Yes, you can report both significant and non-significant variables. Your question is not limited to logistic regression, but can be generalized into linear model feature selection. There are many discussions on this topic, people are asking if they should remove non-significant variables and fit the model again. Or how to pick "important variables" only to build the model. You can try some experiments by yourself, by selecting different subset of the variables to fit the model, you will notice the significant variables will change. They are depending on the input variables.
