Browser "drag and drop" events: Can anyone fill in the blanks?

I've never really had the need to use any drag functions until now, so let me fill you in on what I've discovered so far: Drag events are events that take place when the user is dragging an object. This is "proper" OS dragging, eg: hiliting some text and dragging it, or even dragging in something from outside of the browser. While dragging, as far as I can tell, no other browser events will be fired. (onmouseover is ignored, for example). The only events that work are drag events. In all modern browsers, onDragEnter and onDragOver appear to work... but firefox lacks "onDragLeave." For dropping, FF uses "onDragDrop" while IE and others use "onDrop" while Safari doesn't appear to support it. Events only seem to work on "droppable" elements, like textarea and text. On other elements only some events work. Various other quirks for each browser that I don't even want to go over. There is very little documented about these events. Yes, I must use actual drag+drop, and cannot simulate it. My questions: Is there a way to detect "ondragleave" or similar in FF? Is there a way to detect "ondragdrop" or similar in Safari? Do you have anything to add about Drag + Drop? Here's a quick and dirty template demonstrating drag and drop events: addEvent = function(obj, eventname, fn){ if (document.addEventListener) obj.addEventListener(eventname, fn, false); else obj.attachEvent('on'+eventname, fn); } window.onload = function(){ var logger = document.getElementById("logger"); var log = function(str){ logger.value = str + logger.value; } //log a variety of drag events for the textarea var obj = document.getElementById("tarea"); var events = ["dragenter","dragover","dragout","dragleave","dragdrop","drop"]; for (var i=0; i Life's a drag when doing cross browser stuff.
