C: A cure for the warning: integer overflow in expression?

I am trying to organise my UART library and prettify it a little bit by adding some #define s so I can customize it later without having to dig deeply into the code, but I can't seem to get the following bit of code working: #define FOSC 8000000 #define BAUDRATE 9600 #define BRGVAL (FOSC/2)/(16*BAUDRATE)-1 void uart_init(){ U1BRG = BRGVAL; } After the calculation BRGVAL becomes 25.0416667, and because it is not an integer I get the following warning for it when I assign that into U1BRG: UART.c: In function 'uart_init': UART.c:24: warning: integer overflow in expression ...and the code simply does not work on target hardware. (If I manually put in U1BRG = 25 it works like a charm though) Is there any way to typecast that constant into an integer to make the compiler happy? Many Thanks, Hamza.
