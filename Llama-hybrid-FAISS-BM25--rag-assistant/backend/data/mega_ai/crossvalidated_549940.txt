I try to answer your question. From what you done, it is called Johansen procedure to check cointegration of multiple time series and is useful for testing more than 2 time series (i.e. 3, 4, 5 etc). I see that you are using 3 time series since there are three list of rank (r) in the result. The null hypothesis (H0) is r=0 indicate no cointegration exists for all combination of your time series. From your result, it shows that the test statistic for r=0 is more than all critical values (1%, 5% and 10%), hence we can reject H0 meaning your combination of 3 time series is cointegrated. The test result of the highest rank (r The matrix below rank is showing eigenvector component for each time series (variable). For example, for IPFRA.l2, the components are 1.000000, 3.333591, 7.484742. If you multiply the component with its corresponding variable dataset, you can get cointegration value. Visualizing the value you can observe that combination between all your time series is actually resembling a white noise (not significantly different from zero). example image of cointegration value sourced from https://www.quantstart.com I don't see if you can write down model equation from the Johansen procedure result since it is a testing for cointegration not for building a model. If you want to make a model from the result, you need to proceed to modelling process i.e. VECM or dynamic regression model (linear regression model with ARIMA to handle non-stationer). For how to build a dynamic model you can read here dynamic model with R You can read more detail explanation about Johansen procedure here quantstart.com Hope this help you and future reader.
