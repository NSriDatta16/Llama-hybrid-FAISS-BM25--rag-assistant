One straightforward but laborious way would be to form groups based on patterns of treatment, then perform matching or regression on the patterns. For example, one pattern might be "T1, T2, but not T3," and another pattern might be "just T2." In realty, the treatment pattern is the true cause you want to examine, because in a sense there is no "average treatment effect" of any one individual treatment since multiple can be applied. Each treatment pattern can be considered its own treatment with its own treatment effect. For matching, if after matching across the treatment pattern groups the covariates are balanced, you can do a simple ANOVA with contrasts to compare treatment pattern conditions. The twang package in R allows for "multinomial" propensity score matching and balance assessment. If you can't find a large set of individuals across all treatment pattern groups that have the same covariates, you might be able to do pairwise comparisons between groups, but your causal estimand will shift from the ATE to the ATT. I do think a simple regression would work fine in your case as long as you are not making any extreme counterfactuals. Perhaps read the work of McCaffrey on this matter.
