Parameter stability in cross sectional data

Are there established methods to test for parameter stability for cross sectional regression? For time series regression, I am aware that Kalman filter can be used to detect parameter stability. I suppose k-fold cross validation and getting MSE's would one indirect way, but wondering if there are alternatives...
