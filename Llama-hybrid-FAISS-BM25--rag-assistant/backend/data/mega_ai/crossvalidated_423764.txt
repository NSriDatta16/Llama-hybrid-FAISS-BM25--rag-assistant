Variance explained by a set of variables (dimensionality reduction)

I am interested in estimating the amount of variance that can be accounted for by a set of variables. After reading this previous post where a similar question is answered but for only one variable: See post I was wondering if this could be extended to a set of independent variables. For example, if we have a total of 6 variables, where there are two groups of highly correlated variables (lets say 4 in one group and 2 in the other), but the variables in each group are not correlated with the other variables (the 4 variables are not correlated with the other 2, and viceversa). Would it be correct, in that case, to say that the proportion of variance explained by two variables (one from the group of 4 and one from the group of 2) is the sum of their individual variances as suggested in the linked post?
