How to get a Magento product collection as a comma separated list of SKU's

I have a custom module I made for Magento. From the admin, there is a multi-select list of store products. The selected products from this are output in the form of a comma separated list of SKU's - for example: // Get Featured Products from list $configData = Mage::getStoreConfig('featured_products'); $featuredlist = $configData['settings']['featuredlist']; This gives the output in the following format if I : cn,asc,ken,steve,nine,ecco,ana Is it possible to output a collection from a category in the same way, as a comma separated list of SKU's? I currently use the following to get a collection: $_productCollection = Mage::getResourceModel('reports/product_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('visibility', $visibility) ->addCategoryFilter($_category); $_productCollection->load()
