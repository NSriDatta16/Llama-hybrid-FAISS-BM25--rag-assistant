Per a 2005 article, Estimating the mean and variance from the median, range, and the size of a sample , to quote: We also estimated the variance of an unknown sample using the median, low and high end of the range, and the sample size. Our estimate is performing as the best estimate in our simulations for very small samples (n â‰¤ 15). For moderately sized samples (15 70), the formula range/6 gives the best estimator for the standard deviation (variance). So, perhaps if you have (say, from the examination of the output from a single old model, and/or use available prior data to derive several contender models) opinions on the possible range of values, and therefrom, the computed midrange as an estimate of the median, combined with knowledge of the historical implied degrees of freedom, you may be able to produce a good estimate of variance (and sigma, all following the guidance above) for your new Bayesian Poisson Regression model.
