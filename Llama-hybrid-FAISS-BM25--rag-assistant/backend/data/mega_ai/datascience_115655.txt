Feature Extraction using deep learning but classification Using boosting or other ML algorithms

Is it logical to perform feature extraction using deep learning but classification using traditional machine learning or boosting techniques at the same time? Is it okay to use ML algorithms for classification rather than fully connected layers where the feature extraction is already been done using deep learning I am aware that if feature engineering is successful, the model will automatically perform well. For example: If I want to do a text classification problem, can I build such a model as ( Stack of RNN blocks + Adaboost), where RNN blocks perform feature extraction and Adaboost does classification? Does it make sense? I have proposed an architecture using an integrated deep learning framework for feature extraction, however, can I incorporate an integrated framework with traditional ML or boosting algorithm for classification? Will it be a redundant thing?
