64-bit floats compiled with 32-bit compiler on 64-bit OS

I hope this has not been covered before, but if I compile a 32-bit program in C++ that uses 64-bit floating point numbers ( double ), and run it on a 64-bit OS, will it still take as many clock cycles to move the 64-bit float to the CPU and back to RAM as it would on a 32-bit OS because it's compiled for 32-bit. Or would it take less clock cycles to because the OS moves in 64-bit at a time, even though the program is compiled in 32-bit compiler. The reason I ask is because I'm using VS express which has 32-bit only, and I'm wondering if I can use 64-bit floats while maintaining speed or if 32-bit floats will be faster, even though I'm using a 64-bit OS, and trust me, the program that I want to write will use tens of thousand of floating-point numbers that will have many calculations and bitwise operations performed on them (looking into neural networks). Thank you.
