To train a model like RoBERTa on this dataset, you can first preprocess the data by tokenizing the names, types, and signatures using a tokenizer specific to the model architecture you want to use. You can then convert the tokenized data into numerical values that can be input into the model. However, there are several other approaches to training a model to detect possible signatures for product names which may be easier to implement. One approach is to use rule-based systems , which involve creating a set of rules that identify patterns in the text that are likely to correspond to product names. For example, you could define rules that look for common prefixes or suffixes for product names. Another approach is to use unsupervised learning techniques , such as clustering or topic modeling , to group similar text together and identify groups that are likely to correspond to product names. However, these approaches may not be as accurate as supervised learning with labeled examples. Additionally, you could use a combination of these techniques to create a more robust rule-based system for detecting product name signatures. Keep in mind that the quality of the data and choice of model architecture can impact accuracy, so it is important to experiment with different configurations and that having a large dataset is also important for generalization.
