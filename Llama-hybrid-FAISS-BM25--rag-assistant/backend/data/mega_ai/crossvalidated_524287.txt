You are correct that a chi-squared tests strongly rejects the null hypothesis that Yes is equally likely in both columns: A 'causes changes' more readily than B . I get lost in your explanation (in paragraph starting, "I've tried....") why you think something must be wrong. All I see is that the effect is just extremely strong: counts 1470 and 2316 are much smaller than 'expected; according to the null hypothesis. Maybe you can explain in terms of the subject matter (instead of statistical language) why results seem wrong or unexpected. But from what you have shown, I see nothing wrong with your chi-squared test.
