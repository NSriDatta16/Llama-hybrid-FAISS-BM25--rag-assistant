PCA or Drop high correlated variables for clustering

I am performing clustering on mixed data type. I have few features which are high correlated. We generally use PCA before clustering and reduce the feature space, as its a mixed data I have used FAMD to reduce the feature space. I have scaled the principle components and then When I do clustering, My clustering is very poor. I also tried manually removing the features which are highly correlated and applied gower distance and then did clustering. Then I saw a good clustering performance. I am using Hclust() and pam() in R for both the methods. Why is my clustering perfomance not getting better when I use FAMD and why is it better when I remove high correlated variables manually? Can someone please clarify this. Hi All, Sure. @christian Hennig, I am measuring my clustering performance by Average silhouette width, my aim of clustering is to cluster 21 features in which 20 are numerical and 1 is nominal to 3 clusters where each cluster suggests the health of the babies. After applying FAMD, I have tested with 6 components for which eigen value is more than 1 and also tested by taking 15 components which explain 85% of the variance. I removed 4 variables manually when I tried removing them. I decided these numbers based on the correlation matrix where I saw that these 4 variables exhibit high correlation with other 4 variables. @kjetil b halvorsen Hclust is Hirerachial Clustering, PAM, Means partitioning around the mediods, PCA is a principle component analysis, and FAMD is a factor analysis of a mixed data
