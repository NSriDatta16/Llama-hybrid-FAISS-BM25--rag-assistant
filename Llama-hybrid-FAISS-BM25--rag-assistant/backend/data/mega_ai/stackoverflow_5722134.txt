OK, here is my IMHO catch on this: DBCC INDEXDEFRAG is worth trying and is an ONLINE function hence can be used on a live system You could be reaching the maximum capacity of your architectural design. You can scale up which can always help but more likely you have to change the architecture to achieve better scalability sacrificing simplicity A common trick is partitioning . You are writing to a table whose index distribution looks nothing like it was a few hours ago - hence degrading performance. This is a massive write, such a table could be divided to daily write and the rest of the data with nightly batches of moving stuff across. More and more, people are being converting to CQRS . You might be the next. This solves the problem by separating reads from writes (a very simplistic explanation).
