Alternatives to the MEMORY storage engine for MySQL

I'm currently running some intensive SELECT queries against a MyISAM table. The table is around 100 MiB (800,000 rows) and it never changes. I need to increase the performance of my script, so I was thinking on moving the table from MyISAM to the MEMORY storage engine, so I could load it completely into the memory. Besides the MEMORY storage engine, what are my options to load a 100 MiB table into the memory?
