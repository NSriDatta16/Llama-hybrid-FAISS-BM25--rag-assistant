Doubt about comparison of Machine Learning algorithm

I read this article about the comparison of Machine Learning algorithm. According to this article, there is some characteristics that define the ML models performance. I know that there are some models define lazy and some define eager. Looking at the Figure in the article, it is possible to define what characteristics define a models lazy in spite of eager? This characteristic is speed of learning or speed of classification?
