A mail client must know if implicit SSL is in use when it connects, as it is responsible for initiating the SSL handshake with a ClientHello message. How it determines this is up to the client. Port numbers are a great hint, but there could also be a check box in some UI that forces it even when the standard (unprotected) port number is used. There are IANA registered port numbers for secure mail, but some ISPs may use other ports. IMAP/SSL: 993 POP3/SSL: 995 SMTP/SSL is often offered on port 465, but this is not registered, and is less common since support for explicit SSL is widely supported by SMTP agents. Support for explicit SSL can be advertised by a server using a protocol-specific negotiation. For example, when a client connects to an SMTP server, and issues the EHLO command, the server will list its capabilities, which might include support for the STARTTLS command.
