Adding to the queue is straightforward: var queueClient = CloudStorageAccount.FromConfigurationSetting("mystorage").CreateCloudQueueClient(); var myQueue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue"); string myMessageContent = "Some formatted queue message"; // this could be bytes as well var myQueueMessage = new CloudQueueMessage(myMessageContent); myQueue.AddMessage(myQueueMessage); One bit of advice: When creating the queue, do it in your role's OnStart(), not in the Run(). This way, it'll be created before your web app ever shows up in the Azure load balancer.
