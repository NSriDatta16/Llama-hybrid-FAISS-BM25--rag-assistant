You need to look at something like Form and Control Position and Size Utility Save and restore Form position and layout with this component Basically what it boils down to, is that you need a way to store the current control set, and positions (possibly values too) to some sort of storage (XML file, Registry, Database) when the user exits your form/application. Then once they reopen the form/application, you need to retrieve these settings for the given user (if any is available) and restore the form/application to that state.
