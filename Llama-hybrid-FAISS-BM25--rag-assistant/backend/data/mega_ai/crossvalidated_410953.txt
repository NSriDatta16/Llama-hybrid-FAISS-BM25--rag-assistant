There are even worse scenarios: let $X \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$ be a standard normal random variable. Then $\mathbf E X = 0$ and $\mathbf P (X = \mathbf E X) = 0$ ! This will hold for continuous random variables in general, but might also hold for discrete random variables, for example if $X \sim \operatorname{Binom}(\frac 1 2, 1)$ . That the expected value can be seen as the "long-run average value of repetitions" is not the usual characterization of the expected value, this phenomenon is described by the law of large numbers . Another way to think about the expected value is as the center of mass of your probability distribution. The center of mass is determined by the distribution as a whole, so you do not necessarily need a high amount of mass around the center of mass. Think about a seesaw with equal masses on each ends, then the center of mass is in the middle of the seesaw, but there is no mass in the neighborhood of the center of mass.
