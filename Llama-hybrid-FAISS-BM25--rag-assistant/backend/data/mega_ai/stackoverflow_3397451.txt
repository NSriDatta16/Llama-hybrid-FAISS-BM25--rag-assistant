I think depending on platform you can end up with an invalid regular expression on the first argument. Your solution is elegant per design. Nice coding. But remember that directory separators usually are special characters. It may needs some escaping. EDIT #1 I liked the proposed solution $sepPresent = $path{strlen($path) - 1} == DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ? true : false; And to work it out I suggest: $sepPresent = $path{strlen($path) - strlen(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR)} === DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ? true : false;
