A few comments: After checking the normality of the dataset and the homogeneity of the variance You should check normality and homogeneity of the residuals , not the marginal distribution of the response variable ... your model seems correct, except that you should use VARIABLE ~ AREA + (1|ID) : you shouldn't include the same variable as both a fixed and a random effect (except in some special cases); in any cases, three areas would probably not be enough to practically fit a random effect in any case (without regularization/Bayesian priors), and wouldn't allow you test differences among specific areas (as in your post-hoc pairwise comparisons). you might want to move from lsmeans to emmeans (almost identical, but slightly more up-to-date); I'd also recommend Tukey rather than Bonferroni adjustment unless you have particular reasons ...
