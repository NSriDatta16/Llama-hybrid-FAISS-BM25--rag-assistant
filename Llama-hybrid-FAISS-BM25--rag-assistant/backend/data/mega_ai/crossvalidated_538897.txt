CV% with Close-End Formula

I am working with qPCR data, where the quantity of genetic material (in picograms) is the direct output of the machine. The quantity is then entered into a close end formula, which accounts for dilutions and conversion from pg to direct viral copies, to derive the number of viral copies/mL. The quantities (direct output from the qPCR instrument) are around 2.5-3.5x10^-3 pg. The closed-end formula is as follows: (X*50,000*7.56791x10^6)/(20*1x10^-3), where X is the quantity of the genetic material in pg. The number of copies/mL after "transformation" are ~2.2-3.0x10^11). I have been tasked with summarizing the variability of this analysis. I originally summarized the variability using the genetic quantity and then plugged those values into the closed-end formula to "transform" into copies/mL, so the variability is more easily interpretable. I just recently learned that our test method requires the reporting of the average of the copies/mL rather than the average genomic quantity. I am trying to figure out whether the two methods of calculating CV% are the same. Given that the data should maintain the same distance when "moved up" the number line, I don't think there should be any issues. However, I just want to make sure that I am not missing anything. Here is how I had calculated CV%: St. Dev. of Quantity/Arithmetic Mean of Quantity * 100 Here is how the lab analyst calculated CV%: Quantity plugged into close end formula --> copies/mL St. Dev. of Copies/mL/Arithmetic Mean of Copies/mL * 100 Please feel free to comment any additional questions. Thanks! Answered my own question. Got the same CV% when I calculate different ways: https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0WTK.png
