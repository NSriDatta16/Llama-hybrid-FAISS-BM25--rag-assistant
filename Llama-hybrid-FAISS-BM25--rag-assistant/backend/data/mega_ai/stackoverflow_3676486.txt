Is there a tool for Java which finds which lines of code are tested by specific JUnit tests?

Is there a tool for Java which, given a set of JUnit tests, and a class to test, will tell you which lines of the class are tested by the tests? ie. required to be present for the tests to run successfully. I don't mean "code coverage", which only tells you whether a line is executed, but something stronger than that: Is the line required for the test to pass? I often comment out a line of code and run a test to see if the test really is testing that line of code. I reckon this could be done automatically by a semi-smart tool (eg. something like an IDE that can work out what can be removed from a method whilst keeping it compilable).
