If you want a crude representation with a reasonable mean-variance relationship, a quasibinomial model would probably work OK: in R, glm(cbind(score,10-score) ~ ..., family=quasibinomial, ...) cbind(score,10-score) specifies to treat the response as a number of "successes" out of a maximum 10. Specifically, this means you'd be fitting a model with a predicted value of $$ \mu = \textrm{logistic}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ...) $$ where $x_i$ are your predictor variables and $\mu$ is the proportion out of 10. The assumed mean-variance relation is $V \propto \mu(1-\mu)$ , which is reasonable since you expect the variance to decrease when the average score approaches 0 or the maximum value. As pointed out in the comments, this does assume that the levels are in some sense "equally spaced" (although the logistic transformation does mean that it will take (for example) less difference in predictors to go from 4 to 5 or 5 to 6 than from 1 to 2 or from 9 to 10 ...) An ordinal model would add an extra $n-1$ parameters to quantify the distances between levels.
