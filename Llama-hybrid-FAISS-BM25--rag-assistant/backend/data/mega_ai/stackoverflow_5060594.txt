For building a website, you can use Access in one of two ways: as an application builder with A2010, as described by Albert Kallal. This is entirely dependent on Sharepoint (the expensive Enterprise version, though it can also be done with hosted Sharepoint). and requires that you limit your Access app to those things that are supported in web objects. as a data store only (i.e., using Jet/ACE instead of Access), driving an application built in PHP or ASP.NET or whatever. I would not recommend this as Jet/ACE is not well-suited to use with a web server, except for read-only sites, or sites with very, very few users. The dependency on Sharepoint is likely to make that an unacceptable solution, while the limitations of the Jet/ACE database engine make its use as data store only not really a good choice. So, basically, I think you should choose a different database back end (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and build your application with PHP or ASP/ASP.NET or whatever is available. In other words, there's still no magic bullet with converting an Access app to run on the web. However, if the real problem is making the app available to many people in different locations, you might drop the web requirement and simply host it on Windows Terminal Server.
