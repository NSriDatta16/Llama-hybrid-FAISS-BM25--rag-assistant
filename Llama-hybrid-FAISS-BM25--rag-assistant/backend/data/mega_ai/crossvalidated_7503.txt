Lambert et al (2005) raise the question "How Vague is Vague? A simulation study of the impact of the use of vague prior distributions in MCMC using WinBUGS ". They write: "We do not advocate the use of the term non-informative prior distribution as we consider all priors to contribute some information". I tend to agree but I am definitely no expert in Bayesian statistics.
