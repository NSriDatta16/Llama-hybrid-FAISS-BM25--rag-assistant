Consider the following sample of a thousand observations from a gamma distribution with mean $\mu = 15$ and median $\eta \approx 13.37,$ with numerical summaries below. set.seed(2022) x = rgamma(1000, 3, 0.2) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 1.236 8.673 13.495 15.013 19.939 53.914 Important advantages of the ECDF are that it does not depend on arbitrary choices and does not lose information. Often an ECDF of a sample of moderate or large size seems to give a closer approximation to the population CDF, than a histogram approximates the population density. In the figure below, the choice to use ten bins for the histogram is arbitrary. Someone familiar with ECDFs will have no trouble finding the approximate median and quartiles. R code for figure above: set.seed(2022) x = rgamma(1000, 3, 0.2) par(mfrow=c(1,2)) hist(x, prob=T, col="skyblue2", ylim=c(0,.06)) curve(dgamma(x,3,.2), add=T, lwd=3, lty="dotted", col="brown") plot(ecdf(x), col="blue") curve(pgamma(x,3,.2), add=T, lwd=3, lty="dotted", col="brown") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) However, histograms are familiar to many non-statisticians. They clearly show the approximate mode of the sample and show whether the sample is skewed. Also, the balance point of a histogram gives a good intuitive idea of the mean of a sample. Boxplots show skewness clearly and explicitly show the median and quartiles of the sample. They also call attention to outliers. But they do not give an intuitive idea of the location of the mean. Ordinarily, boxplots should not be used for samples with fewer than about ten observations. boxplot(x, horizontal=T, col="skyblue2") Dotplots and stripcharts work well for small samples but can get very cluttered for large sample, such as the one illustrated above. By contrast, histograms and ECDFs can be almost useless for very small datasets. par(mfrow=c(2,1)) stripchart(x, pch="|") stripchart(x, pch=20, meth="jitter") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) This is hardly a complete discussion of graphical descriptions of data. However, just from these few plots, I think it is fair to conclude that each of these graphical summaries of a dataset has advantages and disadvantages. Which one(s) to use depends on the sample size and the properties of a sample that need to be emphasized in a given situation---and for what audience.
