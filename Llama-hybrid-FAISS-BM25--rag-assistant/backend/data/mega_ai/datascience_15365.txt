Overfitting and cross-validation

In machine learning, an overfitted model fits training set very well but cannot generalize to new instances. I evaluated my model using cross-validation and my accuracy drops when setting the maximum number of splits of my decision tree beyond a certain number. Can this be associated with overfitting? UPDATE Here is the result. I am doing Human Activity Recognition in MATLAB with 16 features.
