I agree with Andomar but a further consideration... Have you considered the effects of merging these two data sets? Say I had two identical tables in two databases with this data: Id Name 1 Bill 2 Bob 3 Bert Id Name 3 Jenny 4 Joan 5 Jackie Option 1 of Andomar's would give the girls new IDs. If that ID has been used as a primary key in the table and other tables referenced it as a foreign key then this will break the referential integrity (you will have records pointing to the wrong place). Option 2 would fall over if there is a unique index on the ID column, which quite likely if it is being used as a key. This is because the two ID values for Bert and Jenny are not unique. So while Andomar is right in that it will fix the identity insert problem, it doesn't address the issue of why there were identity columns in the first place. p.s. if this is an issue ask for a solution in a new question.
