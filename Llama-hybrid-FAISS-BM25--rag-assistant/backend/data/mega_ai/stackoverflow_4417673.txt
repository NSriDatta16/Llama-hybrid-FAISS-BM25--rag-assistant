UISegmentedControl embedded in a UINavigationBar/Item

I would like to embed a UISegmentedControl somewhere in my UINavigationController s topbar. It is no problem embedding it in a UIBarButtonItem and setting it as the left or right barButtonItem. I can understand this approach when dealing with the screen real-estate of an iPhone. I am, however, doing this in a Popover on an iPad and there is "lots" of vertical space available in the topbar. If I add the segmentedControl as a left or right barButtonItem it gets scaled down so that I can not see the text on my segment button, it gets to be the width of a "Done" button etc. If I try to add it to the navigationItem TitleView it will show up all the way to the right and still scaled down more than my 3 segment control with text can display. How would I go about adding a UISegmentedControl to the center of the UINavigationController that wraps my popovers content. Hope someone can help me out:) thanks in advance.
