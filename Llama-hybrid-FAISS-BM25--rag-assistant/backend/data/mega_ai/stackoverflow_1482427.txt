I'm building a new service called PageForest that helps developers write totally client-side javascript programs, with PageForest providing storage and user management. Here's a sample page: http://pfsamples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SAMTable/index.html#mckoss_16 This is still a work in progress, but I'd love to get some feedback on the approach. You can find more samples at the pfsamples.googlecode.com site.
