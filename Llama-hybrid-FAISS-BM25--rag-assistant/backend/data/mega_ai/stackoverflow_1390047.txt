Benchmarking: When can I stop making measurements?

I have a series of functions that are all designed to do the same thing. The same inputs produce the same outputs, but the time that it takes to do them varies by function. I want to determine which one is 'fastest', and I want to have some confidence that my measurement is 'statistically significant'. Perusing Wikipedia and the interwebs tells me that statistical significance means that a measurement or group of measurements is different from a null hypothesis by a p-value threshold. How would that apply here? What is the null hypothesis between function A being faster than function B? Once I've got that whole setup defined, how do I figure out when to stop measuring? I'll typically see that a benchmark is run three times, and then the average is reported; why three times and not five or seven? According to this page on Statistical Significance (which I freely admit I do not understand fully), Fisher used 8 as the number of samples that he needed to measure something with 98% confidence; why 8?
