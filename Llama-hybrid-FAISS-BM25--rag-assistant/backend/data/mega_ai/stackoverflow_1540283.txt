How do you setup Codeigniter to handle multiple projects with shared ci base?

I've seen several CI implementation examples that claim you can put project folders under the "applications" folder for Codeigniter. However I've not been able to see this work as promised. Here is what I have done and what I would like to do - maybe you can help out. For the sake of argument my document root is /www/(It's not, but let's use it for for simplicity's sake) I've put the codeigniter core in /www/corelib/codeigniter I've put the codeigniter system folder in /www/ci_system I've put the applications directory in /www/applications I've put my "entry point" in /www/dd Now let's say I have two projects : "dataentry" and "cpanel" The ideas is that I can go to h**p://mydomain/dd/dataentry // for the dataentry application and h**p://mydomain/dd/cpanel // for the cpanel application. IF I organize the dataentry and cpanel directories like this: /www/applications/controllers/dataentry /www/applications/controllers/cpanel /www/applications/models/dataentry /www/applications/models/cpanel /www/applications/views/dataentry /www/applications/views/cpanel I can get this to work fine. However, what I would like to do is keep the model and view at the same level as the controller so that I would have the following: /www/applications/dataentry/controllers /www/applications/dataentry/models /www/applications/dataentry/views /www/applications/cpanel/controllers /www/applications/cpanel/models /www/applications/cpanel/views This does not seem to work. Any suggestions? -CF
