Maybe some additional remarks about the comment of @chl The Spearman correlation can be seen as a Pearson correlation of the ranks. Ranks clearly do not follow a normal distribution, with the consequence that the variance of the Fisher transformation ( $\zeta$ ) is not well approximated by $(n-3)^{-1}$ especially at large absolute values of $\rho_s$ and low number of observations. Various empirically motivated adjustments of the variance have been suggested in literature. They are compared in Bonnett and Wright (2000), including the one with the 1.06 factor also mentioned in Wikipedia . Bonnett and Wright (2000) finally recommended the following variance estimator $$ \sigma^2_\zeta = \frac{1 + r_s^2/2}{n-3} $$ where $r^2_s$ is the sample Spearman correlation and $n$ is the number of observations. This leads to the following $(1-\alpha)$ -CI $$ \tanh\left(\text{atanh}(r_s) \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + r_s^2/2}{n-3}} z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right). $$ where $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ -quantile of the standard normal distribution. In R, this function would calculate the CI spearman_CI Ruscio (2008) further suggests to replace the normal quantile $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ by a $t$ -quantile with $n-2$ degrees of freedom in order to get better coverage. Still, the CI is approximate. Especially in situations where $|\rho_s| > 0.95$ (where $\rho_s$ is the true population Spearman correlation) $n ordinal data a bootstrap CI has clearly better properties (Ruscio 2008, Bishara and Hittner 2017).
