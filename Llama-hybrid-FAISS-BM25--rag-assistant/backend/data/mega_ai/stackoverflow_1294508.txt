A straightforward way to do this without any CSS trickery or extra markup is to modify the image. Center the background image with: background-position: top center; ...and then offset the actual image file in an editor. In Photoshop use Filter >> Other >> Offset and use a horizontal value that is half of the image's width. Likewise, in the Gimp use Layer >> Transform >> Offset . That's not the clean CSS solution you were looking for, but it's a nice pragmatic fix.
