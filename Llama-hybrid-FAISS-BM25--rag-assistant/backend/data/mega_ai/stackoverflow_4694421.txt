I don't know the most elegant way but this is the simplest way you can do it assuming examdate is the datetime col which you store your date and based on I want to select people with an exam date in 2010 - var active = dc.People.Where(x => x.examdate.year == 2010) .Select(x => new {x.ContactID, x.FirstName, x.LastName}) );
