It should either be NCHAR or NVARCHAR... [ Edit ] ... after you convert these to UCS-2 . In both cases this stores Unicode characters (using UCS-2 characterset). Use the NCHAR for fields with a fixed length (fixed number of characters) and NVARCHAR for variable length fields. The advantage of using UCS-2 is that all supporting logic is easier, since the characters all require exactly two bytes for storage. The disadvantage is that a lot of space gets wasted if most of the text uses mostly ASCII characters. Thank you, Remus Rusanu, for pointing out that the Multi-byte strings are NOT directly compatible with Unicode UCS sets. If indeed you have say UTF-8 or UTF-16, it will not be stored or handle properly by SQL server before it is converted to UCS-2. If one is only trying to store this data, without searching by it etc. VARBINARY format is indeed a good thing. Otherwise, one needs to convert as I suggest. (UCS-2 should handle most,but alas, not all, character sets out there).
