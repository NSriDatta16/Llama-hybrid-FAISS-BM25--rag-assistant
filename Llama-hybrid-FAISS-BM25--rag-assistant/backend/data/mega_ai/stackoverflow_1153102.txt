As the others already answered, you need to (declare readCmd) to fix your immediate problem. However, there are still problems with this code, because it actually implements iterative process using mutual recursion (readCmd -> ajout -> readCmd -> imprimer -> readCmd -> ...) which will consume stack and will you'll get (on) stack overflow. A better way to organize this, would be to make readCmd tail recursive, and make it call the actions. When an action returns, readCmd tail recursively calls itself. Also this code snippet: ((println "Ajout 8o") (ajout botin)) probably is not what you want to do: it'll call println and will try to use the result as a function. Use "do" instead: (do (println "Ajout 8o") (ajout botin)) You may also consider reading about case or cond, they will simplify the nested ifs. Another strange thing about your code is (def botin botin) what it is about?
