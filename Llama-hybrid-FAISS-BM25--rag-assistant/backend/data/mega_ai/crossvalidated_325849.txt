In practice, where a large number of probabilities must be estimated from data, I have my doubts, unless the word 'cause' is used loosely. It may help to think through the situation where there are only two variables in the dataset. What would the Bayes-ball algorithm reduce to? To me a more fruitful way of thinking about this is to put a Bayesian prior probability on causation. An excellent example is the cigarette smoking and lung cancer one in Nate Silver's book The Signal and the Noise which I highly recommend.
