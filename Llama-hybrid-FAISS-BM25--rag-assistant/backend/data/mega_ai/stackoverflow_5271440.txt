To expand on what AlBlue and 7KV7 said, normally you'll have some UIView over which the keyboard pops up, and generally it's okay to click in that to "remove focus" from the input field. I.e. it's more elaborate to detect clicks "everywhere outside the field and keyboard popup", such as on the toolbar or navigation bar that has the field, a button in a tableview, etc. So to avoid handling any views that could "eat up" touches that could be on your UIView, the best way could be to add a transparent view vertically above the keyboard popup, to your app's Window. If you have a scrollview, do something like this (pasted working code) since it seems scrollview specifically don't invoke touchesBegan. -(void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { UITextField *tfCount=(UITextField *)[self.view viewWithTag:335]; [tfCount resignFirstResponder]; } It's handy to tag the input field's view unless you keep a reference to it.
