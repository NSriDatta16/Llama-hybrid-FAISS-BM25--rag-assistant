Probability of Equipment Failure

I have a set of 25 equipment. Each equipment fails (and recover) once a month, on average. a) What is the probability that 2 equipment will fail on the same day? What is this probability in terms of once in X years? b) What is the probability that 2 equipment will fail within a 30-minute period? What is this probability in terms of once in X years?
