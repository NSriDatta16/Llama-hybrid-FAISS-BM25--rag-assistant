In django: "models" go in models.py , "controllers" go in views.py and "views" go in templates. Models tend to be classes that subclass django.db.models.Model Controllers (in views.py ) are often functions but you can use classes if you like. Note that if you're just displaying data from the database you can often use generic views so you hardly have to do any coding at all. I can't tell whether there is a question in the last 2 paragraphs of your post. If there is a question there, please edit your post so it's clear.
