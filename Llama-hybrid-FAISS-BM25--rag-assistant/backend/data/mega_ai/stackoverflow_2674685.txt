ssis package from SQL agent failed

I have simple package which reads data from csv file and loads into SQL table. File is located on another server and it is shared. I use UNC path in package. package is scheduled using sql agent job. Job worked fine for 1 week and suddenly started giving error "The file name "\\124.0.48.173\basel2\Commercial\Input\ACBS_GSU.csv" specified in the connection was not valid. End Error Error: 2010-04-20 16:15:07.19 Code: 0xC0202070 Source: ACBS_GSU Connection manager "CSV file conection" Description: Connection "CSV file conection" failed validation." Any help will be appreciated.
