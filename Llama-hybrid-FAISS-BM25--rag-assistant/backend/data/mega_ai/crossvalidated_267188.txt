I suspect flash fill has a hardcoded list of things to try : initial letter matches, etc. Consider the following list: man M woman W man M woman W man man man man woman Flash fill works here and correctly fills in 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'W' for the remaining cells. But try changing the W's to w's (lowercase), and flashfill fails. If it uses any kind of machine learning, the M's and W's would just be arbitrary tokens, and it wouldn't care what they were. But the fact that it doesn't work when some are uppercase and some are lower tells us it manually tries a list of pre-defined transformations.
