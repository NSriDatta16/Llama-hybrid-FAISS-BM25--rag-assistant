Welcome to the site. It isn't clear what you did once you got the variables into a table. However, if you are looking for differences between two groups, I don't see how correlation is going to help. In RQ 7 you seem to have an ordinal dependent variable (going from 1 to 7). The simplest thing would be a t-test, but that is not technically correct since it is really for continuous variables. You could use a test of medians - medians don't depend so much on the data being continuous. Or you could use a test of ordinal differences such as the Jonckheere Terpstra test. Another possibility is ordinal logistic regression with the scale as the dependent variable and "group" as the independent variable. This would allow you to add any other variables you have to the model. For RQ 8, you say you have a nominal variable. I am not sure I understand what that variable is, but, if you are right then two possibilities are chi-square test of independence and multinomial logistic regression.
