Controls on UIView does not work after adding uiview to uiwindow

I am trying to work on a universal app for iOS platform, I created a window based application with core data support. In my AppDelegate_iPhone I added this line in applicationDidFinishLaunching [window addSubview:myiPhoneMainView.view]; of course I have created & synthesized the myiPhoneMainView variable. In my MainWindow_iPhone.xib I added a view controller set its class to MyiPhoneMainView and controlled dragged from app delegate to MyiPhoneMainView. Then I went on & added controls on my MyiPhoneMainView. Everything works fine MyiPhoneMainView gets loaded but the problem is none of the controls are responding to the user events. I have checked user interaction is enabled on all of them. Niether uibotton nor uitextfield nothing seems to respond to anything. Can somebody please point out what am I missing. Thank you .
