When $X$ and $\beta$ are assumed to be fixed, which is probably the case mentioned in the book, $X\beta$ term will be a constant inside the expressions. So, $$\operatorname{var}(\epsilon+c)=\operatorname{\epsilon}, \ \ \ E[\epsilon+c]=E[\epsilon]+c$$ Here, $c=X\beta$ . In a fully bayesian model, $X$ and $\beta$ could have been random as well. In that case, these expressions would have been $\operatorname{var}(y|X,\beta)$ and $E[y|X,\beta]$ .
