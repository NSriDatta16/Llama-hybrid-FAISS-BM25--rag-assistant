To make any application run faster, first find out where it's spending its time, then make it spend less time there. Use a profiler. A profiler simplifies the process of breaking your application into smaller pieces and then speeding up the individual pieces. You can do that on your own if you can't afford a profiler. For instance, you say your average response time is 4-5 seconds. That's a long time. What's going on in those 5 seconds? Is it all waiting for the database? You can try running your queries outside of the application to see how long they take. You can run SQL Server Profiler to record your database transactions during a period of time, then running the result through the Database Tuning Wizard. It may have some recommendations for changes to the indexes of the database. You can use Fiddler, or turn on page tracing to find out whether your pages are too large. Tracing can tell you how long particular phases of page operations are taking. Maybe you're taking to long to render certain pages. Also, you need to look at the performance of your server. Are you using too much CPU? Too much memory? Are you spending your time with page thrashing, knocking the pages of the ASP.NET worker process out of memory in order to bring in the pages of SQL Server, only to have those pages knocked out when the database query completes and the worker process needs to run again? Break the problem down into smaller pieces, then fix the pieces.
