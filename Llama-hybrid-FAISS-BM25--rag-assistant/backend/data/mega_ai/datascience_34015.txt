Churn definition for non-contractual services

I am computing churn definition i.e, the number of days after which we will say a customer has churned in fashion retail, etc. Currently, I am using the transaction dates to get the average days between two purchases of each customer, other stats such as number of days he has been customer. If anyone has any idea on this , kindly give some pointers.
