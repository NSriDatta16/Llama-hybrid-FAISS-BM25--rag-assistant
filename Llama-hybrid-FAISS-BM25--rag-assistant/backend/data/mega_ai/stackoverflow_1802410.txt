How to export a single table from phpmyadmin to a comma delimited text file?

I need to export a table from phpmyadmin to a comma delimited text file. I think there is a code but can't seem to find it. I found one but it doesnt work. I need to export this table because I need to organize it and sort it and add another column so I can add data to this column. How can I do this please?
