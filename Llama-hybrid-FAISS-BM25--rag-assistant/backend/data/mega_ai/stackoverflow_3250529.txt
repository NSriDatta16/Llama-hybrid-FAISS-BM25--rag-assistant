Supercalifragilisticexpialidoceous! As said recently in another question : You should try this CSS instruction: td { break-word: word-wrap; } that works in many browsers (yes, including IE 6, even IE 5.5 but not Fx 3.0. It's only recognized by Fx3.5+. Also good for Saf, Chr and Op but I don't know the exact version for these ones) and don't do any harm in the other ones. If table's width is still messed up, there is also: table { table-layout: fixed; } th, td { width: some_value; } that will force the browser to use the other table algorithm, the one where it doesn't try to adapt many situations including awkward ones but stick to what the stylesheet says.
