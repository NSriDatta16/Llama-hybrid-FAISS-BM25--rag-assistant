At first glance, this is a question about terminology. But after a moment, I realized that perhaps it reflects deeper assumptions. In a strictly Bayesian context, there isn't much difference between inference and prediction. For inference, we might mean conditioning what we know about an unknown with some observations. E.g., parameter inference; inference of a parameter, $\theta$ , given data, $x$ , through the posterior $$ p(\theta | x) \propto p(x | \theta) \, p(\theta) $$ For prediction, we might mean more specifically conditioning what we know about future observations on some observations. E.g., inference of some future data $x^\star$ given data, $x$ , through the posterior predictive $$ p(x^* | x) = \int p(x^* | \theta, x) \, p(\theta | x) \, d\theta $$ You'll notice that this is still inference; were still conditioning on $x$ . In other approaches, prediction isn't done in the same way as inference. In these cases, it may be helpful to use language more carefully.
