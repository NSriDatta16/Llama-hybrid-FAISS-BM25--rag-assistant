I believe the answer isn't from looking at Type I and II errors. It revolves around "rejecting the null hypothesis" and "failure to reject the null hypothesis." "Suppose the investigators had believed a priori that true average escape time would be at most 6 min (360 secs)." Therefore setting up the hypothesis as $$ H_{0}: \mu = 360 $$ $$ H_{a}: \mu > 360 $$ makes our prior belief to be $H_{0}$, and we are trying to "reject the null hypothesis" and see if our evidence can reject it. If we setup the other way $$ H_{0}: \mu = 360 $$ $$ H_{a}: \mu gives an alternative hypothesis that is the prior belief stated. We never "accept the alternative hypothesis" and only "fail to reject the null hypothesis." However, since we are trying to see if our data is enough evidence against our prior belief, we are now trying to reject "reject the alternative hypothesis." It also doesn't make sense to "reject the null hypothesis" in this case since it is somehow saying "reject the evidence" and seeing if our "evidence rejects the evidence"? Here are a few links to other (much better) explanations of how to select $H_{0}$ and $H_{a}$ https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch09-int.html http://faculty.washington.edu/bare/qs381/hypoth.html https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch09-int.html https://liesandstats.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/accept-the-null-hypothesis-or-fail-to-reject-it/ http://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/things-statisticians-say-failure-to-reject-the-null-hypothesis
