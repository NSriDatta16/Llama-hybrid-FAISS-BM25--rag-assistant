Erase/Remove contents from the map (or any other STL container) while iterating it

Allegedly you cannot just erase/remove an element in a container while iterating as iterator becomes invalid. What are the (safe) ways to remove the elements that meet a certain condition? please only stl, no boost or tr1. EDIT Is there a more elegant way if I want to erase a number of elements that meet a certain criteria, perhaps with using functor and for_each or erase algorithm ?
