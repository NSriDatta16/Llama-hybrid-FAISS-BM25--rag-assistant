Interpreting the coefficient of determination in an ANOVA

I have performed a two way anova and had an R squared of 16%. The following is what I said about the result. 16% of the variation in average age can be attributed to weight and height I am not sure if this would be an appropriate statement as this was how I interpreted the R square value in regression and I think it might be different in ANOVA because the model is different. Can I get a confirmation or correction about this?
