Predicting high frequency sparse time series data in python

I have a dataset of a couple of EV charging stations (10 min frequency) over 1 year. This data consists of lots of 0's, since there is no continuous flow of cars coming to charge but rather reoccurring charging events as peaks(for example from 7-9 am seems to be a frequent charging timeframe when people are coming to the office) I have also aggregated weather and weekday/holiday data to be used as features. I now wish to predict the energy demand for a timeframe of 6h in the future. So far I have tried SARIMA with terrible results, since the algorithm seems to be obscured by the sparse data. I have tried different transformations (Box Cox, Normalization, Standardization), differencing, auto-arima for optimal parameters, so far no luck. I am willing to try different machine learning as well as statistical algorithms. Does anyone have some recommendations as of what I can do to generate a moderatly accurate prediction with a sparse dataset? (Python)
