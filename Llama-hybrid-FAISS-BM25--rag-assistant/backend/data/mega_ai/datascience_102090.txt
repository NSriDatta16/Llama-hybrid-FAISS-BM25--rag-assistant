How to get best data split from cross validation

I have trained a Random forest regressor which is giving me a rmse score of 70.72. But when I tried the same model in cross_val_score with a cv of 10, it gave me an array that looks something like this. array([63.96728974, 60.43972474, 63.98455253, 61.69770344, 94.24656396, 59.93552448, 60.77507132, 54.20247545, 59.20367786, 61.59208032]) # min 54.20247545 This shows that the model has model potential to perform even better if the data get splitted in a certain way. So, My question is that is there any way to find the best split which can achieve the optimal loss which we saw in cross-validation. Sometimes I use for loop to find out the best value for random_state for best split, but this is not memory efficient and sometimes also does not work. So it will be great if there is another alternative for this!!
