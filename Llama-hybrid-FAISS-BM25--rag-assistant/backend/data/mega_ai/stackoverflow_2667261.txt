If you have 11g Release 2 you can use Listagg : Select a, Listagg(b, ', ') Within Group ( Order By b ) From t Group By a It allows to sort your values, and it already comes with Oracle: A1 B1, B2, B3 A2 B1, B4 Otherwise you can use the stragg function by Tom Kyte , described in Rows to String . Select a, stragg(b) From t Group By a returns A1 B1,B3,B2 A2 B1,B4
