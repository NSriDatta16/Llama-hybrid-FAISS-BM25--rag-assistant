How would you generate the Magento Layout XML outside of Magento?

I want to be able to provide template, block details from the layout file generated by Magento. the same information which can be seen if you install Alan Storm's excellent layoutviewer and print out the all the xml to screen. (The Package Layout is what I am after, which is a large XML file that contains every possible layout configuration for a particular Magento install.) I have been struggling to get this data from a script which i am running in the application directory alongside the index.php file. How can I get the full layout XML in an xml document without installing any custom module installation?
