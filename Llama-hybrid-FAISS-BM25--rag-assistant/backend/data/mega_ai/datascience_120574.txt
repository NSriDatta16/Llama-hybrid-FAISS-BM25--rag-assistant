Why is UMAP used in combination with other Clustering Algorithm?

I've noticed that UMAP is often used in combination with other clustering algorithms, such as K-means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN. However, from what I've understood, UMAP can be used for clustering tasks. So why I've noticed people using it primarily as a dimensionality reduction technique? Here an example of what I'm talking about: [https://medium.com/grabngoinfo/topic-modeling-with-deep-learning-using-python-bertopic-cf91f5676504][1] Am I getting something wrong? Can UMAP be used for clustering tasks alone? What are the benefits of using it in combination with other clustering algorithms?
