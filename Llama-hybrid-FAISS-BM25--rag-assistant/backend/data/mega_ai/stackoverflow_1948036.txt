Control XML Serialization from DataSet -- Attributes on "TableName element"

Hope I chose the correct forum. I have a dataset object with one table that comes to me from a common custom component's GetDS method. I need to pass XML to another process (chunked as byte array). I have it all working but the XML is missing some attributes that the consuming process expects. I create a dataset object and can control the name of the TableName (root element) and the row like this: da.Fill(ds, "Foo") ds.DataSetName = "FooUpload" I use the GetXML method to serialize to XML that looks like the following: 483 27 ANN 132 2012-12-31 00:00:00 FooServices The calling process expects 483 27 ANN 132 2012-12-31 00:00:00 FooServices Note the attributes on the FooUpload element. This node is the name of the DataTable in the DataSet. I have searched for how to control the XMLSerializer and find lots of examples for custom objects. I even found examples of setting the column mapping to be MappingType.Attribute which is close but I need to do this with the root element which is actually the TableName for the dataset. I feel that I am close and if I do not find a more elegant solution I will have to create a hack like looping and spitting out changed string plus rest of the XML.
