I would build a logistic regression with multiple independent variables. I don't think this is the only possibility, but logistic regression makes sense you are trying to model for the probability of purchase. Obviously, your dependent variable will be whether a product is purchased, so it should be binary. Your independent variables will also be binary. You can also merge the binary variables into smaller number of categorical variables. You should do do at least pairwise correlation (e.g. Phi coefficient). You can use it to merge highly correlated variables, such as, Microsoft Windows Word and Microsoft Windows Excel into Microsoft Office .
