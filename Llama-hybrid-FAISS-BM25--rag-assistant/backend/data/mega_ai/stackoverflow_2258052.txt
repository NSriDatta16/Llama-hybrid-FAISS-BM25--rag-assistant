MySQL: is there something like an internal record identifier for every record in a MySQL table?

I'm building a spreadsheet app using MySQL as storage, I need to identify records that are being updated client-side in order to save the changes. Is there a way, such as some kind of "internal record identifier" (internal as in used by the database engine itself), to uniquely identify records, so that I'll be able to update the correct one? Certainly, a SELECT query can be used to identify the record, including all the fields in the table, but obviously that has the downside of returning multiple records in most situations. IMPORTANT: the spreadsheet app aims to work on ANY table, even ones tremendously poorly designed, without any keys, so solutions such as "define a field with an UNIQUE index and work with that" are not an option, table structure may be extremely variable and must not matter. Many thanks.
