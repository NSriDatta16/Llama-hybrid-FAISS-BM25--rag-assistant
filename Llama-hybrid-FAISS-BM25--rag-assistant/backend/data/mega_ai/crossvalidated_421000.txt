Is the von Mises distribution a good model for wind direction. It has support over 0 to 2\pi (or -pi to +pi) https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/von-mises-distribution/ If so, there are examples ( https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/94147/118553/basile_et_al_icrera_2013.pdf ) who use a von Mises distribution with a time series. It's hooked up to a Hidden Markov Model rather than ARIMA, but I think the key thing is the von Mises (Tikhonov) distribution?
