Mining people’s personal data—at the lowest point in their lives—is disappointing." Leclerc has argued that "In reality, the funeral homes should never be the owner of an obituary," and that "The obituary’s purpose is to share the information with the public." On YouTube There are several YouTube channels that make use of similar tactics in order to turn a profit on the video sharing website. The videos may encourage users to subscribe to their channels before reading out the obituary, and they are often preceded by video advertisements. Some of the channels upload dozens of death notice summaries per hour, while the busiest channels upload new videos every few minutes. The aesthetics of the videos can include men sitting alone and speaking directly to the camera, whereas others narration of the obituaries over slideshows of candles and photos of the deceased sourced from social media. Wired reported that the highest subscriber count it found for one of these channels was slightly over 26,000 and the highest viewer count was 1.7 million, and that on the higher end the channels had a few thousand subscribers and millions of total views. These videos can feature product promotion in their descriptions, as well as lists of keywords for search engine optimization, such as "death," "cause of death," "die," "RIP," and "what happened." Other instances The death of 19-year-old Matteo Sachman on the New York City Subway on New Year's Eve in 2023 led to a significant increase in Google searches for Sachman's name alongside words such as "obituary", "accident", and "death". This uptick was detected on Google Trends by Indian internet marketer Faisal Shah Khan, owner of website FSK Hub, and others. Khan used information such as Sachman's LinkedIn page to construct a biography using a large language model. FSK Hub was the first site identified by The New York Times to have posted material about Sachman's death, and this was followed by numerous unauthorised obituaries, including poorly written news articles, YouTube videos, and incorrect obituaries within 24 hours, many before any official announcements or news stories. Lesser falsities included the claim that he was 29 years old, and that he was from Nantucket despite him being from New York. By 2 January, obituaries began publishing the false claim that he had been stabbed to death in a Bronx subway station, despite the fact that he was actually killed by a train after falling onto the tracks at the East Broadway stop in Manhattan; this false claim was taken from an unrelated CBS News article about an unnamed 29-year-old man who was attacked on a subway platform in the Bronx. YouTube videos about Sachman were filmed on busy streets or inside living rooms, and their narrators spoke in English, Urdu or other languages. The videos and most of the websites used ads from Google. The Sachmans, who had wanted to divulge information slowly, had a paid obituary published in The New York Times on January 5, 2024. Later in 2024, Los Angeles Times journalist Deborah Vankin found that obituary pirates had published an obituary titled "Arts And Culture Writer At Los Angeles Times Sadly Passed Away", despite her still being alive. == References ==
