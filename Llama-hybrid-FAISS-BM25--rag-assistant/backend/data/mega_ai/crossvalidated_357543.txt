Generally speaking, assuming you had a more standard expression of $\frac{\lambda}{2}||w||^2_2 + \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \max(0, 1 - y_i w^T x_i)$ would give a bound on the solution size of $\frac{1}{\sqrt \lambda}$. Your form would actually have $\sqrt{\frac{2n}{\lambda}}$. This statement is almost assuredly false. Let $w^*$ be the solution to the standard way of representing the SVM problem. If we knew that the $||w^*||_2 = S$, for some $S$, then one could bound $||w|||_2 \leq S$ of course and it would be equivalent. One can show that $||w^*||_2 = o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}\right)$. Thus, the space covered by $||w||_2 \leq ||w^*||_2$ becomes infinitely small when compared to $||w||_2 \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$; this makes it almost certain that for many problems there is some solution in the space $||w^*||_2
