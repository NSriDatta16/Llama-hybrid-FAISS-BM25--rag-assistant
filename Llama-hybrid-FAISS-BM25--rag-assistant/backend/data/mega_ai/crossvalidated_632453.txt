Z score comparison in longitudinal studies

I have a longitudinal study with two time points (before/after), whereas a particular score was standardized across all individuals and time points, and thus provided only in terms of z-scores. (Edit: to clarify, "before"-data and "after"-data were pooled before the standardization, not a separate standardization for "before"-data and another for "after"-date ). I read this paper regarding longitudinal standardization ("Don't") , but still - I want to try and see whether the score was (statistically significantly) positively or negatively changed when comparing the "before" and "after" groups. For example, suppose we have the following subset of a table: ID Z-Score Before Z-Score After 1000 +2 +0.1 1001 -1 +1 1002 -0.5 +0.2 My understanding is that z-scores cannot be subtracted and then averaged. Therefore, my thoughts were: Taking all "before" and "after" datapoints, and applying a Mann-Whitney on the two groups. This ignores the "matching" of the data. Converting all z-score to percentiles, then calculating difference and applying a t-test on the difference: ID Percentile Before Percentile After Percentile Diff 1000 0.977249868 0.539827837 -0.437422031 1001 0.158655254 0.841344746 0.682689492 1002 0.308537539 0.579259709 0.270722171 Am I correct in my assumptions? Is this a valid method? Are there any better methods? (Assume that I cannot reproduce the data that was used to calculate the z-score) .
