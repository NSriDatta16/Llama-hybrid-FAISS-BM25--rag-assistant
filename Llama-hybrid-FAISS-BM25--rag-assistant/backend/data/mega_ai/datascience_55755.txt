You could use a collaborative filtering approach, ie. train a network that learns your customer and offer embeddings in a latent space. You could randomly initialize a customer embedding matrix (no_of_customers, dimensions_c) and an offer embedding matrix (no_of_offers, dimensions_o) . Your training data would be each click, a customer index, offer index, and a binary variable (0,1) which would be used to lookup the embedding vectors. Then you could concat these vectors and use them as input to a fully-connected layer, or any other architecture you wish to use.
