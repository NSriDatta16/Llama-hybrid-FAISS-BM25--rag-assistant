iPhone new GUI: Where is the checkbox next to the .a files?

I'm trying to import an .xcodeproj. I dragged-dropped the .xcodeproj into my project and then in the old Xcode GUI if I clicked on it, I would see a list with .a files on the right, which had checkboxes next to them. My problem should be solved, once I click a checkbox next to one of these .a files. Does anyone know how can I do this in the new Xcode GUI ?? Thank you for your time!
