First, you need to determine where the problem is. Run this query (from Glenn Berry) to find out the most expensive cached SPs in terms of logical reads: -- Top Cached SPs By Total Logical Reads (SQL 2008). Logical reads relate to memory pressure SELECT TOP(25) p.name AS [SP Name], qs.total_logical_reads AS [TotalLogicalReads], qs.total_logical_reads/qs.execution_count AS [AvgLogicalReads],qs.execution_count, ISNULL(qs.execution_count/DATEDIFF(Second, qs.cached_time, GETDATE()), 0) AS [Calls/Second], qs.total_elapsed_time, qs.total_elapsed_time/qs.execution_count AS [avg_elapsed_time], qs.cached_time FROM sys.procedures AS p INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats AS qs ON p.[object_id] = qs.[object_id] WHERE qs.database_id = DB_ID() ORDER BY qs.total_logical_reads DESC OPTION (RECOMPILE); What is your Page Life Expectancy (under load): -- Page Life Expectancy (PLE) value for default instance SELECT cntr_value AS [Page Life Expectancy] FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters WHERE [object_name] = N'SQLServer:Buffer Manager' -- Modify this if you have named instances AND counter_name = N'Page life expectancy' OPTION (RECOMPILE); You should post your drive information: SAN or Directly Attached Storage (DAS)? RAID placement (and number of spindles in each group) and type for logs and Data
