Quiz: Tell the classifier by its decision boundary

Given are the 6 decision boundaries below. Decision boundaries is violett lines. Dots and crosses are two different data sets. We have to decide which one is a: Linear SVM Kernelized SVM (Polynomial kernel of order 2) Perceptron Logistic Regression Neural Network (1 hidden layer with 10 rectified linear units) Neural Network (1 hidden layer with 10 tanh units) I would like to have the solutions. But more importantly, understand the differences. For instance I would say c) is a linear SVM. The decision boundary is linear. But also we can homogenize the coordinates of linear SVM decision boundary. d) Kernelized SVM, since it is polynomial order 2. f) rectified Neural Network due to the "rough" edges. Maybe a) logistic regression: It is also linear classifier, but based on probabilities.
