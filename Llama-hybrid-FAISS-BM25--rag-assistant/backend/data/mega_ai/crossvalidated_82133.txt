Dirichlet process mixture model with Bayesian hierarchical clustering

I am doing Bayesian hierarchical clustering. From my understanding, there are three basic points for this algorithm. Use marginal likelihoods to decide which clusters to merge Asks what the probability is that all the data in a potential merge were generated from the same mixture component. Compare to exponentially many hypotheses at lower levels of the tree Generative model used is a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPM) The first two points are easy to understand, but why the generative model is DPM? Are there specific characteristics of DPM make it quite fit for this purpose? Are there any other options?
