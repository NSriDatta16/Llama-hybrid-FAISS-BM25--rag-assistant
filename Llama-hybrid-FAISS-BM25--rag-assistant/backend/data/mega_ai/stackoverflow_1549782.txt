DB_DataObject sanitizes inputs passed on the "->set*" methods, e.g. Assuming User to be a DB_DataObject, the following would all be safe: $user = new User; $user->firstName = $_REQUEST['first']; $user->setFirstName($_REQUEST['first']; $user->setFrom($_REQUEST); Any method that you actually pass in fragments of SQL are not safe, things like: $user->selectAs($_REQUEST['col']. ', first as name'); $user->whereAdd("first=$_REQUEST['first]"); Hope that clarifys things a bit...
