Here's the relevant part of the ES5 specification : All characters may appear literally in a string literal except for the closing quote character, backslash, carriage return, line separator, paragraph separator, and line feed. Any character may appear in the form of an escape sequence. There are backslash escapes for some characters (which you can find a couple of pages down), and any character can be represented in hex as \uXXXX . They're explained (with examples) a couple of pages down in the spec.
