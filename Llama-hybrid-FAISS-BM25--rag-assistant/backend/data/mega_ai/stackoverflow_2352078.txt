The brute-force way would be as you say, to add a parameter with the client culture which you would pass with each call. However, a more elegant solution would be to create a behavior on the client and on the server side. The client-side behavior would add a header to the request in the client, getting the current culture from the CultureInfo class. The server side behavior would look for the header in the message, and add it to a the OperationContext, with a known key, which can be retrieved on the server-side call.
