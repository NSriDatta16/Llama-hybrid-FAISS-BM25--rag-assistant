If you are doing "regular" OLS regression then it's not a percentage increase, but a numeric one. That is 1 point increase in fund allocation is associated with a 0.079 point increase in the infrastructure index. Percent increases would be from a logistic regression. And you can't say "causes" as this is an observational study. You can only say "associated with" or similar, non-causal terms.
