Impose a condition on neural network

I am building a neural network model with TensorFlow and Keras in python. My model is performing well on unseen data in the way I desire and everything is fine. but the problem that I don't have any idea how to implement a solution for it is this: consider my neural network has the input like this Input = [i1, i2, i3, i4, i5] and the output of the network is only single value and we call it Output = O I want that the output of the neural network be greater than specific input value. here for example I want that O > i3 . despite the very good performance of my neural network on Test Data (unseen data) but in some cases the mentioned condition will be violated and this is a problem for me.
