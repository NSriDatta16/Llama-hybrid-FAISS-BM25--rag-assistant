You currently have two files A *.h header file which describes the classes and functions available in your third party library A *.a static library file which holds the pre-compiled code for the functions described by the *.h file. Assuming you've got to the stage where you can #include or #import "xyz.h" and compile your application, the bit which is missing is linking your executable with the *.a file. The symbol not found error message is the linker telling you it knows some of your code is calling a particular function, but it can't currently find another code module that provides an implementation of that function. One thing to check is that your *.a file is correctly configured within your project to be passed to the linker. One way to do this is to expand the "Targets" section of the main XCode window. If you drill down into the section representing your application you should see a subnode labeled "Link Binaries with Libraries". Your *.a file should be listed, if it isn't one way to add it is to simple drag and drop the file into this section.
