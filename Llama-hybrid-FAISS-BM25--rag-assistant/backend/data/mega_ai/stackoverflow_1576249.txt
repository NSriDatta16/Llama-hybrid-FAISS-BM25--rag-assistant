WPF and 3D to create a bowl effect

How would one go about either using the 3D components of WPF or using a pseudo 3D effect to create a "Bowl" effect, where the user is looking down on a bowl and can drag around rectangles and have the rectangles perspective change so that it looks like they move up, down and around the bowl? I'm not after any gravity effects or anything, just when the items move, I need their perspective to be adjusted... EDIT: I have been looking into the actual 3D effects available in WPF which do seem very very powerful, so maybe someone could help in getting a half sphere on my app and then binging some 3D meshes (rectangles) to its surface? Any thoughts? Thanks, Mark
