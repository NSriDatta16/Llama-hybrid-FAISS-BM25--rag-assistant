Two dimensional array/structure question

I need advice in organising flexible data structure in the program. Look, I've to organise data structure which at glance looks like two dimensional array like double[][] arr = new double[10][10]; if you need to set or get some element of this array you'll write something like double x=arr[i,j]; // arr[i,j]=y; where i and j are int numbers But in my program I need something like double k=arr[obj1,obj2] where obj1 and obj2 are objects I've an idea - HashMap could solve my problem So It'll looks like class Coordinates { Object1 obj1; Object2 obj2; //TODO override equals() method Coordinates(Object1 obj1, Object2 obj2) { this.obj1=obj1; this.obj2=obj2; } } ... HashMap semiTwoDimArray=new HashMap (); and setting and getting of elements would looks like semiTwoDimArray.put(new Coordinates(obj1, obj2), 3.14); and getting might be as double pi = semiTwoDimArray.get(new Coordinates(obj1, obj2)); But as for me: 1) Such realisation has problems with iterating through row or column (too many operations) 2) Looks inelegant Could anybody advice me better solution?
