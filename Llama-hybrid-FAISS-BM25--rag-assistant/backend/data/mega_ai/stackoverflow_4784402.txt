I guess you mean the wobbly windows effect ? You first need to replace the MovieClip with a Bitmap (create a Bitmap + BitmapData , then draw() the MovieClip to the newly created BitmapData ). Keep in mind you need some extra padding as the effect will overflow the original bounding-box. * Now, the tricky part which would require a bit of maths (but you can probably find similar algorithms on the web): You need to displace the pixels - one by one - every frame depending on the time,amplitude,angle,...,(and the previous values) of the movement. There are many ways of creating the effect from there, but displacement is probably the first clue for what you are looking for. But, before going there, I would strongly suggest making a prototype with a single object which would act as one of the pixels. e.g. create a basic Shape (e.g. a circle) animating in an elastic fashion when you drag it (only the x/y movement, no shape deformation). * ) Alternatively you could work with a separate displacement map BitmapData and apply it to the original MovieClip through a displacement filter, but it tends to be a bit more hazardous in terms of performance.
