Logistic regression is the classical method used for such situations. Medical journal reviewers as well readers are more familiar with this method. Logistic regression will clearly shows which factors are independently associated with obesity. Odds ratio can also be calculated using logistic regression which will give an idea of the size of effect quantitatively. Most existing studies also would also have used logistic regression so the results can be compared more easily. Methods of Structural Equation Modelling are less well known, varied, with less clear assumptions, often difficult to interpret and generally more complex.
