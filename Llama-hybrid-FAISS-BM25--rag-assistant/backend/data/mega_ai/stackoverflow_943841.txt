Why do I get this strange Memory Leak when I touch my UIImageView?

It's really strange. I have a blank UIImageView subclass that implements the -touchesEnded:, -touchesMoved, and -touchesBegan: methods. The implementations of these methods are empty. They just do nothing. However, when I run Instruments with "Leaks", and I touch the UIImageView and move my finger outside of that UIImageView while still touching the screen, I get an Memory Leak warning from Instruments. In my demo app there's no object allocation happening when doing that. The methods are empty. Everything I read in Instruments is related to Foundation and Run Loop stuff. I've checked my class twice and removed any object allocation. It's just an skelleton that only shows an image, but that image is not changed when touching it or moving the finger on the screen. That makes no sense. Did anyone else encounter problems like this? UPDATE: I testet a little more around and figured out, that memory leaks happen at any spot on the screen when tapping fast around with 5 fingers. Everything I get from Instruments.app is regarding some run and event loops. It seems like if the device can't handle the touches fast enough and then gets stuck at some point with releasing allocated objects. Please try it out and report here if you can see the same problems. UPDATE: I've tested now a few Apple example apps as well. When I hack with 3 - 5 fingers around on the screen, like a normal user does (yes, they will do!), then Instrument shows up memory leaks regarding event and run loops. Definitely there's a big in the framework, or in instruments. Tested with iPhone OS 2.2.1.
