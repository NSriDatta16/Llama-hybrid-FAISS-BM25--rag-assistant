As it often happens, you could be mixing the notions of scope and lifetime, so I'll address both. The scope of a name declared inside a constructor is the same as the scope of any local name (the fact that it is a constructor makes no difference whatsoever): the scope of the name extends to the end of the block in which the name is declared (and it can have "holes" when the name is hidden by a declaration of an even "more local" entify with the same name). The lifetime of am object defined inside a constructor is governed by the same rules as the lifetime of any locally-defined object (the fact that it is a constructor makes no difference whatsoever): an object with automatic storage duration is destroyed at the end of its scope, while an object with static storage duration lives forever.
