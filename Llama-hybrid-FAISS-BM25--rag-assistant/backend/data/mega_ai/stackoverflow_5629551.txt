Since this is a custom GUI, I'm going to make some assumptions and restate your question to make sure I'm answering your question. You have a slider widget that contains a thumb widget. The user can click and drag the thumb to reposition it. Your GUI sends mouse notifications to your widgets in local relative space rather than absolute screen space. Your question is how can the thumb widget respond to the mouse events to move itself around without having to use absolute coordinates? You can do this by changing who's responsibility it is to move the thumb widget. It should be the job of the slider widget to position its thumb widget. By doing it that way, all your coordinates can be in the slider widget's local relative space. Basically it'd be something like (assuming you have some kind of event notification): When created, the slider widget registers for the various mouse events on its child thumb widget. When the thumb receives mouse events, it raises the event passing along its local coordinate. Slider widget receives these events and translates the coordinate from thumb local space to slider local space (i.e., click_x = thumb_x + thumb_mouse_x ). Slider can then use this coordinate, which is in the slider's local relative space, to move the thumb. In general, parents should be responsible for their children's layout.
