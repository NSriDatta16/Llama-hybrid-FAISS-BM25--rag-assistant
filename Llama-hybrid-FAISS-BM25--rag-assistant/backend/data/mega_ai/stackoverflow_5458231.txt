Dynamically add drop-down lists to html form

I have the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/JpYGg/4/ It doesn't seem to work on jsfiddle but it almost works fine on a normal webpage. I found the code online but I have tweaked it a little and I am trying to add a button next to the delete one in order to add a new text box underneath the present one. I am trying to call the addNew() function for this but it seems to just keep going instead of only adding one? The other thing I am looking to tweak is that this obviously adds a new textbox but what I am aiming for is to add 3 drop-downs :/ Specifically, it would be the following: tags agent extension fileversion operands values I'm not sure of the best way to do this - e.g. maybe putting it all into a div and creating a variable based on this div and duplicating that in the addNew function? Any help greatly appreciated. Regards, Martin
