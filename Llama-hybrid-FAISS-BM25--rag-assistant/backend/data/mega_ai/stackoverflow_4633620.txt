Explaining a Ruby code snippet

I'm in that uncomfortable position again, where somebody has left me with a code snippet in a language I don't know and I have to maintain it. While I haven't introduced Ruby to myself some parts of it are quite simple, but I'd like to hear your explanations nonetheless. Here goes: words = File.open("lengths.txt") {|f| f.read }.split # read all lines of a file in 'words'? values = Array.new(0) words.each { |value| values The above script was supposed to figure out the average of the differences between every two successive elements (integers, essentially) in a list. Am I right in saying this is nowhere near what it actually does, or am I missing something fundamental, which is likely considering I have no Ruby knowledge?
