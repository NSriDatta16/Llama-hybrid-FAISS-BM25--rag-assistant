Your approach is correct because your proposal is absolutely continuous wrt the dominating measure, which is the sum of the Dirac mass at zero and of the Lebesgue measure and because it is everywhere positive. Just to make things precise, when $\theta=0$, we have $$f(0) = \frac{[\exp(\gamma + \theta)]^y}{(1 + \exp(\gamma +\theta))^{N_t}}\rho I_{[\theta = 0]}$$and not$$f(0) = \frac{[\exp(\gamma + \theta)]^y}{(1 + \exp(\gamma + \theta))^{N_t}} \left[\rho I_{[\theta = 0]} + (1 - \rho)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_\theta}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2_\theta}\mu_\theta^2 \right]\right]$$since the Lebesgue measure gives no weight to $\theta=0$. The practical difficulty of the proposal is to achieve proper exploration of both sides of the target density, the Dirac mass and the continuous part, which means calibrating properly the weights of those sides in the proposal. This means running preliminary versions with a given weight, 0.5 for instance, and monitor the number of accepted values with $\theta=0$ and with $\theta\ne 0$. If there is a strong disproportion, this may be due to the choice of the weights or to the asymmetry between both sides in the posterior. If one of the two sides is never visited, more asymmetrical weights should be used. An alternative to this global exploration is to use one version or another of reversible jump MCMC introduced by Green (1995). Without getting into the technical details, reversible jump MCMC considers two statistical models, one with $\theta=0$ and one with $\theta\ne 0$. And it proposes reversible switches between both models at each MCMC iteration. In your case, the calibration should be relatively easy. A slightly simpler version is Carlin and Chib (1995) saturation, where $\theta$ is simulated at each step, but either from the prior or from a pseudo-posterior. I do not understand this part. The problem is standard once you realise the dominating measure is the sum of the Dirac mass at zero and of the Lebesgue measure.
