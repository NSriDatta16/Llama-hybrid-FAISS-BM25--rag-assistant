This situation cries out for a Bayesian approach. There are simple approaches for Bayesian rankings of ratings here (pay particular to the comments, which are interesting) and here , and then a further commentary on these here . As one of the comments in the first of these links points out: The Best of BeerAdvocate (BA) ... uses a Bayesian estimate: weighted rank (WR) = (v / (v+m)) × R + (m / (v+m)) × C where: R = review average for the beer v = number of reviews for the beer m = minimum reviews required to be listed (currently 10) C = the mean across the list (currently 2.5)
