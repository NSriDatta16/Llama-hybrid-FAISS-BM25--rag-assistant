What are CRF (Conditional Random Field)

Looking for language modeling, I have been finding CRF in a lot of places which is but looking online for the same isn't actually helping me a lot. I referred Edwin Chen's blog and Ravish Chawala's Medium article but rather than solving my problem, raises more question. Could you please refer some interesting blog posts, Github repo's or research papers that are going to further help me with this?
