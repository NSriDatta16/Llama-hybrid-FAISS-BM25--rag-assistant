Multinomial regression only works when categories are mutually exclusive. For example, that would be appropriate if you cared about disease locations within the kidney and only one location per kidney was possible. That's not your situation. If all you care about is Left versus Right Laterality and all patients only have disease in 1 kidney, then all you need to do is a simple binomial proportion test (e.g., binomial.test() in R). You just note the Left versus Right location for each patient, regardless of how many lesions there were in the kidney or their corresponding locations. The test is whether the fraction of patients with Left-side lesions is significantly different from 1/2. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) would allow more detailed analysis of Laterality and Location . The form of generalized linear model could be a binomial regression for the probability of lesionPresence as a function of both Laterality and Location , with a random effect (leading to a mixed model) to account for differences among individuals in overall probabilities of having lesions. The simplest data setup would be 10 rows for each individual, each row annotated with the Laterality , one of the 5 Location values, SubjectID , and diseasePresence coded as 1/0 for presence/absence at that combination of values. The default in R for binomial modeling is logistic regression. The structure of the model in R with the lme4 package could be: lesionModel The "*" interaction operator allows for differences in Location depending on Laterality . The (1|SubjectID) term specifies a random intercept to allow for overall differences in diseasePresence among patients. Be careful in interpreting the individual coefficients returned by the model. In logistic regression the Intercept will be the estimated log-odds at the reference values of both Laterality and Location . The individual coefficient for Laterality will be for the difference from that in log-odds between the non-reference and reference Laterality at the reference Location . The 4 individual coefficients for Location will be for the differences in log-odds from the reference Location at the reference Laterality , and the 4 interaction coefficients will be the extra differences at those values of Location at the non-reference Laterality . It will probably be simplest and safest to use the default "Type II" analysis of variance provides by the Anova() function in the R car package to summarize the results. That will provide estimates of the significance of overall differences associated with Laterality and Location , and (via the estimate for the interaction terms) of whether Laterality is significantly different depending on Location . You then can use post-modeling tools like those in the emmeans package to evaluate predictions for particular combinations of Laterality and Location , transformed if you wish back to the probability scale that can be easier to think about than log-odds.
