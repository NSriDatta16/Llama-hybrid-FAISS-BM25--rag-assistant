Looking for links for zend framework ajax table refresh

As you maybe aware from the following post I'm new to the Zend framework and web programming so any help is greatly appreciated. What I want to do is have a page that my users can search for clients stored on the database have the results returned via a table. I know how to do this in a traditional form -> post -> results page manner but I would like to implement the following: Have two or more Dojo autocomplete combo boxes that the user can enter search criteria into (I've found examples of this on the web and should be ok implementing this.) Use the text entered into the query the clients table in the DB. Return the results in a table on the same page without having to redirect, and if possible have the table update the results as the user types into the combo boxes. for example if the user types "Fa" for example the table will have "Farrell "Fagan" "Farrelly" As the user continues to type eg "Far" the table will have "Farrell" "Farrelly" As you may have already guessed I need help with parts two and three. I've tried searching using keywords refresh and autocomplete but I've been unable to find anything that comes close to what I need. Can anyone please provide links to tutorials/examples of how to do this in the Zend Framework. I know code is a lot to ask for but if anyone is feeling generous go ahead. Just in case it makes a difference I'm using Doctrine ORM to handle my models. Thanks in advance for any replies. Graham
