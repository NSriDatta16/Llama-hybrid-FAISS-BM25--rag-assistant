Check if MaskedEdit control contains text

Hi I'm working with wix to create an installation. I need a custom dialog to let the user define a port. The dialog have a control that is of type MaskedEdit where he should write the port. The property connected to the control have a default value defined. The problem is that when the user presses the next button, I would like to make sure that the port field have a value or else show him a warning. The code for the control looks like this: 4323 1 and the handling of click on the next button look like this: 1 1 but on the next click I would like to make sure that the property DataStoragePort is not a empty string. Any suggestions? Regards Daniel
