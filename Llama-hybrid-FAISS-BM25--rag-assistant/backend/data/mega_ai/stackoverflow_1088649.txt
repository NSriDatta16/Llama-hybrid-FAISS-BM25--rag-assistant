I don't know about elegant, but one pragmatic way is: import django.db.models.options as options options.DEFAULT_NAMES = options.DEFAULT_NAMES + ('schema',) Obviously, this would break if Django ever added a 'schema' attribute of its own. But hey, it's a thought...you could always pick an attribute name which is less likely to clash.
