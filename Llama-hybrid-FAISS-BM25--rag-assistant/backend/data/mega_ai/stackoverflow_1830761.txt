Binding a DataGridView to multiple Tables in DataViewManager or DataSet

I have created three data tables by pulling data from an sql database. DT1, DT2, DT3. I have added these three tables to a data set, myDS. I have added relations between these three tables. I then dragged a DataGridView onto my form and I want to bind the three tables to the DataGridview. So I added my dataset DS to a dataview manager, myDVM. I bound myDVM to a bindingsource, bindingSource1, and made it the data source for the DataGridView. I am not sure how to bind the tables I want from myDVM / bindingSource1, to appear in the DataGridView. i want to display the child tables related to the parent table using primary key in the same datagridview!! thanks in advance!!! help me plz!!!
