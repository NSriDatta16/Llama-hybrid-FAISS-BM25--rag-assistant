The problem is that there are probably multiple sttable records for each mttable record. So you don't need a DISTINCT but a GROUP BY . I would try something like the following for the inner select: SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY " + orderField + @") AS RowNum, mt.ID AS mt_ID, mt.title AS mt_title, [...] MAX(st.title) AS st_title, -- Other aggregates (MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, ...) for all other columns -- from sttable, whatever is appropriate. [...] FROM mttable AS mt INNER JOIN sttable AS st on mt.ID =st.ID WHERE st.field <> 0 AND mt.title = @title GROUP BY mt.ID, mt.title -- Group by everything else from mttable.
