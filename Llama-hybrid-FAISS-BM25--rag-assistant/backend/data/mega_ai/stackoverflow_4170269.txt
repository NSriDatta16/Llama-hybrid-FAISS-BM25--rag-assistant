Java graphic 2D library to draw ER diagrams?

I'm looking for a Java 2D graphics library to draw a E-R Diagram from a MySQL database, anyone know something like that? With a 2D Java library graphic I need to draw entities, relationships, foreign keys, primary keys, and attributes. Optionally, the entities maybe be dragged in the diagram. I would use Graphics2D for Java? What do you think? Any recommendations? Thanks.
