Yes, it should be responsibility of repository. Storage is cheap nowadays. Maybe doubling that data would solve Your problems? E.g., if customer.firstname comes from data source #1 but customer.lastname comes from data source #2, You could just make sure that on customer registration customer.lastname is stored in data source #1 (+ procedure that would update already registered customers)? Another thing - Your domain model shouldn't know about this problem. You should try to keep it unaware of technical problems. Otherwise - You will eventually lose isolation and end up with artificial domain objects that are coded there just to make it run.
