What situations : Retrieving a view of data 'as was' - this can be very useful for diagnosis (i.e. being able to re-run a process using the same data, without restoring the whole database). See Oracle's Flashback Query for a way to do this over short timescales. We have a situation where business rules are soft-coded on site by the customer, and stored in the database. They may change at any moment, yet are used to calculate stored data. Versioning the configuration gives us a way to 'rollback' the configuration and understand how data was derived. (I can't recall the specific term for Oracle's built-in row versioning, where it effectively stores a history table for each table). Yes, versioning means a lot more storage, but I would say that in the places where it is useful, data is rarely volatile.
