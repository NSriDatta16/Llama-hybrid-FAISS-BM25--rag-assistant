100% code coverage doesn't mean you're done with usnit tests function int divide(int a, int b) { return a/b; } With just 1 unit test, I get 100% code coverage for this function: return divide(4,2) == 2; Now, nobody would argue that this unit code with 100% coverage indicates that he feature works just fine. I think code coverage is a good element to know if you are missing any obvious code path, but I would use it carefully.
