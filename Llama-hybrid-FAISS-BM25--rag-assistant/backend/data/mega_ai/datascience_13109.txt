Adoptive(Machine wise) ML packages

What kind of Machine Learning / Data Mining packages are available that can easily be scaled on a cluster. For instance H2O is one of them because it's running in Java so it can be easily extended to other machines providing parallelism. What other are popular? or even for general Data munging purposes. Language wise preferably Python or R. (if other please don't be discouraged to include)
