Personally, I would be leveraging the database because the alternative is either a configuration headache or is more trouble than it's worth. You could configure each application to point to the same file, but that becomes problematic if you want to move the file. Or you could write a service to manage the file and expose that to clients, but at this point you may as well just use the DB.
