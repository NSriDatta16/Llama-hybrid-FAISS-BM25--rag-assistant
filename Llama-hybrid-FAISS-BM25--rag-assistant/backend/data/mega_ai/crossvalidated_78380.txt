I will not give an overly mathematical answer, but I would like to address your central question about the relationship between CI's and profile likelihood intervals. As the other respondents have pointed out, CI's can be constructed from a profile likelihood by using the $\chi^2$ approximation to the $normalized$ likelihood ratio. The accuracty of this approach depends on one of two things being approximately true: The profile log-likelihood is approximatley quadratic There exists a parameter transform that makes the profile log-likelihood approximately quadratic. The quadratic is important because it defines a normal distribution in log-scale. The more quadratic it is, the better the approximation and the resulting CIs'. Your choice of 1/20th cutoff for the likelihood intervals is equivalent to more than a 95% CI in the asymptotic limit, whcih is why the blue intervals are generally longer than the red ones. Now, there is another issue with profile likelihood that needs some attention. If you have a lot of variables that you are profiling over, then if the number of data points per dimension is low, the profile likelihood can be very biased and optimistic. Marginal, conditional, and modified profile likelihoods are then used to reduce this bias. So, the answer to your question is YES...the connection is the asymptotic normality of most maximum likelihood estimators, as manifested in the chi-squared distribution of the likelihood ratio.
