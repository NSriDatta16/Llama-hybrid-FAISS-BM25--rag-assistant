A more general but less tractable approach is referred to as Vector Arima (VARIMA) which doesn't place restrictions on the model form as Vector Autoregression does (VAR). In both cases , one needs to incorporate exogenous variables and be aware that Pulses, Seasonal Pulses, Local Level Shifts and Local Time trends need to be dealt with via Intervention Detection. As usual with time series care has to be taken to test constany of parameters and error variance over time.
