Although WinBUGS made a monumental contribution and impact, and BUGS is still used by many people, it is IMHO sort of a legacy system, and many people now prefer JAGS. (Or, if you don't mind breaking away from BUGS/JAGS syntax, you can use Stan.) For resources about BUGS, there is, of course, The BUGS Book . Notice it lists a lot of resources and references . Or you could consult the 1st Edition of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, but all of its scripts were converted to JAGS. For JAGS, there's the 2nd Edition of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis .
