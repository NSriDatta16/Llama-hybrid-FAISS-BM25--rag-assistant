In Firefox, Firebug and its console which provides a panel for debugging along with an object for programmatically evaluating inside of a script, eg console.log('test') Safari and the family of Webkit enhanced browsers have built-in inspectors/consoles . Opera has Dragonfly . There are several plugins for Internet Explorer, such as DebugBar and IE8 has a pretty neat built-in Developer Toolbar . If you're on Linux you can even install spidermonkey-bin, which is the interpreter used by Firefox and invoke it with js in the console.
