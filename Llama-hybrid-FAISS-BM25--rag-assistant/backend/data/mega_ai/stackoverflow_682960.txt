Using acts_as_list and in_place_editing at the same time

I have a rails project where the the view displays a list of items. I use acts_as_list to make the list DnD orderable and in_place_editing on each item to, well, edit it. My problem is that when I DnD the items around, the item I drag automagically becomes editable when I drop it. Any tips on how I can avoid that behavior. Ideally, I'd like to make it editable by clicking a small icon next to the item, but I don't know how to make that work with this plugin. Thanks in advance.
