Why isn't ROC maximum for threshold 0.5?

the way I understand logistic regression, threshold = 0.5 basically produces a hyperplane to classify inputs which minimizes log loss (all of which is converted into a 0 to 1 range using sigmoid), so when we use a different threshold it basically shifts the line like a bias would, so why is prediction better when we use a model which is considered sub-optimal by log loss?
