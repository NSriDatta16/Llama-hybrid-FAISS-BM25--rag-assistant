Extracting a given number of the highest values in a List

I'm seeking to display a fixed number of items on a web page according to their respective weight (represented by an Integer ). The List where these items are found can be of virtually any size. The first solution that comes to mind is to do a Collections.sort() and to get the items one by one by going through the List . Is there a more elegant solution though that could be used to prepare, say, the top eight items?
