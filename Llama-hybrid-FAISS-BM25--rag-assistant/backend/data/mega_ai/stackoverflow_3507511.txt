Web browser to WPF image drag and drop

I have a window set to allow drop and my Drop Event Handler is working fine for images dragged in from Windows Explorer. But dragging in pictures from a web browser has some quirks. In Firefox, I am only getting .bmp files with random names. Images from IE 8 (haven't tested others) only show a Not Allowed mouse cursor. I guess this is because IE has a security prompt when dragging images out into the Windows Explorer. Has anyone come across a solution, perhaps browser-agnostic, for dragging images out of a web browser and into a WPF window? Here's the current event handler: private void Window_Drop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { if (e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.FileDrop)) { string[] droppedFilePaths = e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop, true) as string[]; foreach (string droppedFilePath in droppedFilePaths) { Debug.WriteLine(droppedFilePath); } } }
