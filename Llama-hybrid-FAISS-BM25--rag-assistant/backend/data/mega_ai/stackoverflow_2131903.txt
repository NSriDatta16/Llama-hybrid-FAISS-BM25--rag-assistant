how to use JUNG to color & shape vertices and edges

I am facing a problem in using JUNG. I want to draw a network diagram where the vertices will be having different shapes and colors and edges will be dashed or full line in different colors. Since I am a newbie in Java, I am unable to understand the actual architecture of jung. When I use setVertexFillPaintTransformer, it colors all the vertices with the same color. The vertices are stored in an integer array. I am banging my head for past one week now. Plz if someone can help me or has some counter questions, do ask me
