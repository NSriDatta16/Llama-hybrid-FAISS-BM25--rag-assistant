What are the pros and cons to use non-parametric methods to estimate probabilities?

When we have large amount of data, using logistic regression may suffer from high bias, i.e., linear model can underfit/too simple for large amount of data. I am thinking to use some non-parametric methods to estimate the probability. For example, I am building a toy model from diamond data. (see attached code for details) the figure 1 the logistic regression model, and figure 2 is using splines to estimate the probability. The idea is using the nonlinear and non-parametric way, we can see more details on how probability change respect independent variable. Is this approach valid? What are the pros and cons? Here are details for the model # making toy data library(ggplot2) d=subset(diamonds, carat 0.3) d$is_expensive=ifelse(d$price>2500,1,0) # logistic regression p=ggplot(d, aes(carat, is_expensive))+geom_jitter(height = 0.05) p=p+geom_smooth(method='glm', se=F, method.args = list(family = "binomial")) p=p+theme_gray(15) p # spline p=ggplot(d, aes(carat, is_expensive))+geom_jitter(height = 0.05) p=p+geom_smooth(method='gam', se=F, formula = y ~ s(x,k=25))+theme_gray(15) p Thanks for the comments. I am making a toy example on diamond data. What I want to ask is for some general data set, if we have one continuous variable as independent variable and one binary variable as response variable.
