When you calculate by hand you only need to take account of the values in the specific 2 by 2 table you are working with not the whole table. It seems you have an ordered outcome and it might be better to investigate ordinal regression models although that would depend on your underlying scientific question. The term relative risk is often used to include both odds ratios, which is what logistic regression gives you, and risk ratios, which I think is what you are trying to compute by hand.
