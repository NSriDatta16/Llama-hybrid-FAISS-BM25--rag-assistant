Using ProgressBar as a wait bar - how to avoid freezes?

I'm creating a custom charting control and I would like to have the possibility of displaying some sort of wait bar while other commands are running (i.e. chart is being created). I'm using ProgressBar ( System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar in marquee mode) as a part of this control. I do not need to update the state of the progress bar, I just want it to move over and over until the chart is created. Right now I'm using it in following scheme: - Start wait bar ( ProgressBar appears and starts running) - Call charting methods - When the chart is ready, the wait bar will being hidden. The problem is: Some charting methods are really computational demanding and the wait bar freezes in such moments. How can I avoid these freezes? Should I use some kind of threading/background worker? And if yes, then what is the simplest way to do it? Note, that I do not need to change the state of the progress bar while the chart is being prepared. I just need the wait bar to start, run during all computations and stop after that. EDIT OK, as suggested, I created a separate thread for these demanding computations to avoid freezes. But how to wait for a thread to finish and do not freeze the GUI? I tried, as suggested here , something like that: Thread t = new Thread( () => { DoSomeLongAndDemandingTask(withParameters); }); t.Start(); t.Join() // do something that needs to be done after thread finishes InvokeMeAfterThreadFinished(); But it freezes the GUI. Is there any other way to avoid these freezes?
