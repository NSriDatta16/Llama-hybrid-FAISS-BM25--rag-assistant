If you have measured both neurons continuously using some form of EEG then you would want to estimate an ARIMA model for membrane potential in the controlled neuron (as a regressor) against the neuron which it is hypothesized to innervate (as an outcome). If their membrane potentials are independently influenced by other stimuli in the brain, they will show on average no association. You might want to consider adjusting for the lagged effects of the independent neuron's membrane potential as well.
