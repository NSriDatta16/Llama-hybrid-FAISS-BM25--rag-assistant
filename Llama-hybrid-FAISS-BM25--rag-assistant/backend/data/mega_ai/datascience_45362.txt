Automating scoring of answers for a given question

There is a topic 'X' on which students are asked to write an English passage. Given a question, I have multiple solutions with their scorings out of 10. For a given answer by a new candidate, one needs to read the passage and score the answer. The main focus of scoring is vocablury and not grammer. How can I automate this process? What should be the steps? Should I like train a simple model with answers as input and their scores as output. Then for a random answer I can check what is the score given my the model trained. But I feel like this will be very basic and it's accuracy will be very less. I am new to machine learning. Any reading material on this..etc anything would be great help. Thanks.
