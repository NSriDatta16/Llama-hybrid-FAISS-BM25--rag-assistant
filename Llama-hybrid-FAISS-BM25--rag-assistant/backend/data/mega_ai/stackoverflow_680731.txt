Contrary to popular opinion, regular expressions are useful tools to extract data from unstructured text (which HTML is). If you are doing complex HTML data extraction (say, find all paragraphs in a page) then HTML parsing is probably the way to go. But if you just need to get some URLs from HREFs, then a regular expression would work fine and it will be very hard to break it. Try something like this: / ]+href=["']?([^'"> ]+)["']?[^>]*>/i
