You want to look up IPC. As robert showed above, the Process class in .NET will help you. But specifically for your problem (how to know when to write data): You can't. Not generically. If you know the required input (e.g. "yyy"), you can supply it in the STDIN of the created process. You don't have to wait for the program to request this information: It will just read from STDIN when it wants data. If you need to process the programs output to decide what to write to STDIN , try reading the processes STDOUT . You might run into problems with flushing, though...
