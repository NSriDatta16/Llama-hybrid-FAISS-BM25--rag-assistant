Is there any (performance) difference between Debug and Release?

I'm using MySql Connector .NET to load an account and transfer it to the client. This operation is rather intensive, considering the child elements of the account to load. In Debug mode, it takes, at most, 1 second to load the account. The average would be 500ms. In Release mode, it takes from 1 to 4 seconds to load the account. The average would be 1500ms. Since there is no #if DEBUG directive or the like in my code, I'm wondering where the difference is coming from. Is there a project build option I could change? Or does it have to do with MySql Connector .NET that would have different behaviors depending on the build mode? EDIT : Ticks monitoring. Debug (Average: 213000 ticks) 730000 320000 60000 50000 190000 130000 210000 180000 160000 110000 390000 270000 150000 190000 230000 210000 150000 200000 190000 140000 Release (Average: 4404500 ticks) 12940000 170000 180000 80000 80000 130000 120000 5060000 5090000 130000 50000 10430000 25160000 150000 160000 130000 17620000 10160000 100000 150000 Comparison: Release takes 20x the time Debug takes (average comparison). 4,404,500 / 213,000 = 20 Now the first operation is indeed longer, but in general, so are all the other times for release. Any idea? EDIT 2 : I added even a broader tests that calculates the total time. For 50 account loads, it takes an average of 4 seconds in debugs, and 40 seconds in release. I'm starting to get quite desperate over this - it is a serious performance issue for my application. Does anyone have a guess on how to fix this?
