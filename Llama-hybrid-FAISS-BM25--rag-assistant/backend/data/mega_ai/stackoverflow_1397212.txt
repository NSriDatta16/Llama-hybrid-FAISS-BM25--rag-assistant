There is another construct known as a ThreadPool . It might be worth using this as it will manage multiple threads for you and you can control the min/max number of threads. BackgroundWorker is limited one thread and is best used for WinForms apps where you have background I/O and don't want to lock the user interface thread. You will want to keep a queue of pages to scrape and feed these to the thread pool. You may still want to pause or limit the threads to get the intended level of scraping. I would personally separate parsing of retrieved page content from the actual retrieval of the pages over HTTP. This would generally make things easier to maintain and you may not need the local processing to be multi-threaded.
