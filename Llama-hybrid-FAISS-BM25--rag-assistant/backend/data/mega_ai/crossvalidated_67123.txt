Hypothesis test for population rather than for sample

I have a set of data for companies in a certain industry. The data set spans two consecutive years, 2000 and 2001. Let's say I have 100 unique companies in the dataset and I calculate average service time for each company and for each year. How do I test whether the average waiting time for company x in 2001 is less than the average waiting time for company x in 2000? The data set contains all service transactions performed by company x in 2000 and 2001, and this is what confuses me. The way I understand hypothesis test is that you test the null hypothesis using sample mean. However, with this data I have the population mean so what does it mean when your professor ask you to test whether the average service time in 2001 is less than the average service time in 2000 using "simple mean comparison test such as t-statistic"?
