Projects using py.test

I am looking for (list of) projects that use py.test. I am new to testing, and want to use py.test. I need examples from projects, so i can use py.test extensively. The documentation is good for py.test but is too fragmented to get a good grasp. I have a vague idea of how it works. I saw the py.test video(3hrs) from pycon. But need some working examples in projects.
