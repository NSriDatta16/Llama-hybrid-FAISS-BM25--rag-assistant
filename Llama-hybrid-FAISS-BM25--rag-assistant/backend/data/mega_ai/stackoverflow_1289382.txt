If you are just organizing stuff for development, you can symlink you template dir with all template, css and js files to directory you are serving static files too. So from your example: add my_site/widgets to Django TEMPLATE_DIRS config and cp -s my_site/widgets to directory you have your static files in. This is dirty hack and, please, don't use it in production as it is very insecure IMHO. But if you want to have neatly organized project in development stage - then I see this as one possible solution. And also consider that this might give you loads of headache when you move from development to production as stuff WILL fail.
