R logistic regression

I was using the Smarket data in the ISLR package for logistic regression (in R) and find the error below. If I use the following command, I get the error (warning): glm.fit1 = glm(Direction~. - Direction, data=Smarket, family="binomial") Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred However if I run the following command, I do not see any error: glm.fit = glm(Directionâˆ¼Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data=Smarket, family=binomial) Although both the commands looks same to me (excluding the direction), the outputs are different. So, my questions are Why am I getting the warning if both the commands are same? Why is the output also different?
