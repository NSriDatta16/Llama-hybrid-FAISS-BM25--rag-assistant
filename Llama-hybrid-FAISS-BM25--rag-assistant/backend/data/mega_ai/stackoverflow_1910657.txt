Why are you asking? The question seems to come up a lot after I deal with some nasty code hairball. I spend hours picking apart spaghetti logic that trails through about 6 subroutine levels. Finally track down the niggling error. And my first thought is why can't this be easier? Code is written for the computer - not humans. It's optimized for the machine. Machines require exact instructions. At that level of detail, the complexity of any code base goes up fast. And that complexity is what typically drives this question. Programming languages are not intended to control complexity. Programming tools can help you do that. How you write your code matters a lot more than in what language you write your code. Take a look at literate programming . It controls complexity through organization. I personally like the visual structure provided by the Leo editor.
