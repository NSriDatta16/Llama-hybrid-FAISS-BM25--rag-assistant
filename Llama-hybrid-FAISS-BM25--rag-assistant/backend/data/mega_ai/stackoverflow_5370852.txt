Apart from all the other problems that people have pointed out. I absolutely shocked that nobody has mentioned that: (FromBase*)object->find2(7); Is just NOT guaranteed to work. You are depending on a raft of implementation details. object is an array of char ! Not a FromBase thus the compiler has not had the chance to initialize any of its implementation dependent details. Even if we assume that the implementation uses a vtable (and thus a vtable pointer in the class). Does the implementation use a relative pointer or an absolute pointer. Assuming you want to save with one run and then reload the next time? Are you assuming the vtable is actually located in the same location between different runs (what happens when you load this part of the application from a dynamic library)! This is just horrible. You SHOULD NOT DO THIS EVER . If you want to serialize and de-serialize the object from storage. Then the class has to know how to do the serialization itself. Thus all the correct constructors/destructors get called at the correct time.
