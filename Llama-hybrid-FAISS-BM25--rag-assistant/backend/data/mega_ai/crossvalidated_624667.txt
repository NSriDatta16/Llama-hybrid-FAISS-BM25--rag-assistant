Outlier Detection By Dummy Regression Models

The standard procedure for outlier detection in time series implemented in almost all statistical software tools is based on regression the time series to candidate regression variables. These regression variables differs is case of additive outliers (AO) and level shifts which are often named innovational outliers (IO) in this context. An additive outlier concern to a measurement error whereas an innovential outlier represents an extraordinary shock at time point t influencing the values at time points $t + 1, \dots,T$ . The differential model: Despite of the given models in literature, we define a simplified model which are not based on complex model estimation, which is not very applicable when dealing with short time series. We define the model as follows: $$y_{t_d} = \beta \zeta_t + \epsilon_t,$$ where $y_{t_d}$ is the vector of differentiated values $y_{t_d} = \Delta^d y_t = y_{t+1} - y_t$ for $t = 1,\dots,T-1$ . $\beta$ are the regression coefficients and $$\zeta_t = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if}\ t=T \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ How would I implement this in R? Is someone aware of a package where this is implemented?
