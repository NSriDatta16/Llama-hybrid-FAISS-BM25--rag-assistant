As others have pointed out, there are a lot of options you might pursue. The method I recommend is based on average ranks, i.e., the first proposal of Peter. In this case, the statistical importance of the final ranking can be examined by a two-step statistical test. This is a non-parametric procedure consisting of the Friedman test with a corresponding post-hoc test, the Nemenyi test . Both of them are based on average ranks. The purpose of the Friedman test is to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are some differences between the items. If it is so, we proceed with the Nemenyi test to find out which items actually differ. (We don't directly start with the post-hoc test in order to avoid significance found by chance.) More details, such as the critical values for these both tests, can be found in the paper by Demsar .
