Not in the practical sense. Though the set is indeed ordered and has an index set, in practical applications the mechanics of this are already in the methodology. For example you have your time series model which already provides the tools to step through the series by using vector and matrix operations. At times you can see that the order is actually not even relevant. Of course it is possible for some operations to depend on the time but if that happens it turns out to become a separate variable or entity. If you'd ever calculate something with the monthly series of.. months... you'd create probably a new categorical or interpolated set of numbers for this, for example if you'd include a trend variable. Theoretically the answer must be something else: For some or many things the fact that information about time and value are an ordered set may be of relevance. Clearly the time series is not the same without that information. It is missing and wether or not it is of practical use is not relevant to the fact that a) it is missing and b) there are possible uses. Indeed without the second dimension it is no longer ordered. It can be ordered but then only by size or some other parameter. If you order by time, you NEED an association or order between these two dimensions. So I'd say in the context of working with the set, it is one dimensionally but ordered. Theoretically this doesn't exist, it is an ordered set with an index of months or integers or whatever but the data is two dimensional.
