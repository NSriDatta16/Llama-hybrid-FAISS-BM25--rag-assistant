What else does UIView.exclusiveTouch do?

exclusiveTouch property: Setting this property to YES causes the receiver to block the delivery of touch events to other views in the same window. The default value of this property is NO . And in a similar discussion: Why doesn't UIView.exclusiveTouch work? If a finger contacts an exclusive-touch view, then that touch is delivered only if that view is the only view tracking a finger in that window. I tried this: window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds]; aView = [[AView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 480)]; // full screen bView = [[BView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 240)]; // top half // Both A and B are tracing the touch event. (touchesBegan & touchesMove) aView.exclusiveTouch = NO; bView.exclusiveTouch = NO; [window addSubview:aView]; [window addSubview:bView]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; No matter what value the exclusiveTouch is, a) aView always traces the touchesMove event (finger from bottom to top-half) b) only bView traces the touchBegan event. It seems like the quote from another post is false? If so, doesn't it imply exclusiveTouch property is useless at all? Thanks a lot!
