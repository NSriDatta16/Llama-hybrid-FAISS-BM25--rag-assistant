What would be the ideal way to do paging using a Infragistics WebDataGrid and SQL Server 2008

We have an application that is growing in users and the infragistics WebDataGrid and stored procedure are having performance issues. I'm looking into adding the ROW_NUMBER() function in the stored procedure, but I'm concerned with sorting. It looks like I would need to do change the procedure to have a dynamic order by case statement if I used the ROW_NUMBER function. Are there any better options?
