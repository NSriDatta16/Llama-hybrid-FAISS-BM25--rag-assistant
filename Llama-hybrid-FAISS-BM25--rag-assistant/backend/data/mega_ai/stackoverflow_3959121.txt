Data Aggregation in SQL Server 2005

I need a query for SQl server 2005 (SQL server management studio express). I have data stored as 1 minute time frame (1 minute each row), for each table columns are ID, Symbol, DateTime, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume. I need to convert (compress) to every possibile multiple time frame, so let's say 10 minutes, 13, 15, and so on. Provide full details if somebody could help. Thanks Alberto
