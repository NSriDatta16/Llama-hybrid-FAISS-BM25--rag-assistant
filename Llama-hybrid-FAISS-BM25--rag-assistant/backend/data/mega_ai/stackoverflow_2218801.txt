I had the same problem a few months back! On our mobile project (using Spring 2.5.6) we ended up using an interceptor with our SimpleUrlHandler. This caught all incoming requests and add -m.jsp to the end of any mobile requests. It involved two steps: 1) declaring an interceptor to our standard URL Mapper: and 2) implementing the Interceptor, which looked for the word 'Mobile' in the user-agent. public class MultiViewController extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter { I talk about it in more detail on my blog (about the new exciting world of mobile web development) post: http://plumnash.com/it/iphone-web-development-using-spring/
