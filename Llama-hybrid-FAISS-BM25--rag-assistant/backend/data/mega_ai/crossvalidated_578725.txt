As the summary statistics of the between class averages and standard deviations have much less degrees of freedoms than the original distance matrix, there will be many possible point configurations that match the summary statistics. Here is a rough idea how to construct one possible solution: Use classical MDS to reconstruct a configuration of the class centers (i.e. class means) that matches the class mean distances. One possible method is described in J.C. Gower: "Some distance properties of latent root and vector methods used in multivariate analysis." Biometrika 53.3-4, pp. 25-338, 1966 Set all points within each class equal to the mean (center) of the class, except for two points. Chose the remaining two points in each class in opposite directions from the center, such that the given variances per class are met.
