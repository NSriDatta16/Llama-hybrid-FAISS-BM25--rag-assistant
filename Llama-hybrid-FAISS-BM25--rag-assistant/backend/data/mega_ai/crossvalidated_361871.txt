In Ian Goodfellow et al's paper "Generative Adversarial Networks", why do they specify that they do not need a Markov chain or inference network?

In Ian Goodfellow et al's paper Generative Adversarial Networks , they state, "There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples." Why would there be a need for a Markov Chain or unrolled approximate inference network? What would, or traditionally have, each of these approaches offered in statistical analysis and/or machine learning?
