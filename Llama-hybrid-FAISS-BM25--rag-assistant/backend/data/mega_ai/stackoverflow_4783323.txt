Unit testing with complete coverage is really the only way to handle any development work which relies on dynamic languages. Clearly it's very beneficial to have strong coverage tests for statically typed languages but in my experience it's even more important when you have dynamic typing. If you aren't covering all the code that can run in your tests, then really you are asking for trouble. So you want to use a coverage analysis tool in tandem with your unit tests to prove that you are reaching all of your code. Even that won't guard against all pitfalls â€“ your tests really need to exercise all the possibly erroneous input data errors your program may receive.
