Do examples in the training and test sets have to be independent?

I am working on a machine learning problem where there are several data points collected per user. Some of the points are good and some are bad. I want to get a good assessment of the machine learning model I build. Should I choose only 1 point from each user, and either train or test from it? Or can I train/test on points from the same user? I read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set . It says to keep test set instances independent of the train set which makes sense to get a better evaluation of the model. My main question is whether training on several points from the same user is okay i.e., whether training points need to be independent/ Thanks.
