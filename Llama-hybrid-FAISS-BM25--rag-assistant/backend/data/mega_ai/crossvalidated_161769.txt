Watch out: the model.tables() function only works with balanced designs. If you want to have the marginal means for unbalanced design you should use the popMeans() function. Imagine you have the following model: Check.Model If you would want the marginal means for the levels of factor1 (i.e., averaged over the levels of factor2 ) in an unbalanced design, you should use the popMeans() function from the doBy package: popMeans(Check.Model, eff=c("factor1"))
