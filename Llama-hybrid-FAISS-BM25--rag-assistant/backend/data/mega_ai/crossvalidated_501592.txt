Bayesian inference for both mean and variance

Let $x_1,...,x_k$ distributed from $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\ 1/\tau)\ (i.i.d)$ and priors on mean and variance are in form: $$\mu|\tau \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\frac{1}{\tau}) $$ $$\tau \sim Ga(\alpha,\beta) $$ Now how calculate posterior distribution? The formal Bayesian inference says $$P(\mu|x)\propto P(\mu)f_{\mu}(x)$$ but here we have distribution $\mu|\tau$ so I guess the inference should be based on $\mu|\tau$ , i.e. $$P(\mu|x,\tau)\propto P(\mu,\tau)f_{\mu,\tau}(x)$$ but I'm not sure about this and how to continue.
