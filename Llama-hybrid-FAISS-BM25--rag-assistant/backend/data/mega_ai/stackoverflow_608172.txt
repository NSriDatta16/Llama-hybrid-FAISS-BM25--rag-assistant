Block-level elements within display: inline-block

I'm trying to put some (vertically-stacked) display:block elements within a display:inline-block element. According to the CSS specification, the inline-block element should be a containing block, so it can have display:block elements within it and those should not affect the rest of the layout. However, the display:block elements inside the display:inline-block elements disrupt the rest of the page; so does having nothing at all within the inline-block, or even a basic element like a paragraph; only simple text avoids disruption of the rest of the page (by disruption I mean shifting other divs down, e.g. in this case the left red block moves down a line and has a blank white space above it). I'm using Firefox 3.0.6. #left { display: inline-block; background: red; width: 20%; height: 100%; } #right { display: inline-block; background: green; width: 80%; height: 100%; } Left Right The above shows as two panes, left red, right green, as expected. If I change "Right" to Right or remove it entirely, or (as I want to do) replace it with a couple of divs, I get the bad formatting. Is this a Firefox bug, or am I doing something wrong, or are my expectations incorrect? (FWIW, IE 7 mangles them all equally, as if it doesn't understand inline-block; doesn't matter, this is an internal app. and I'm only using Firefox). I may be able to get the layout I want using float/margin, but I'd prefer not to have to do that.
