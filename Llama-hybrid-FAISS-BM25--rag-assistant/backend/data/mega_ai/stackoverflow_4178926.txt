Becuase you've dragged in most of the standard library by using iostreams. It's a one off thing though so as your programs gets larger it will seem less and less of an overhead. However you probably want to compile using a shared library version of the standard library and most compilers / operating systems will let you do this so you'll not have to include all of the standard library in your executable. Which compiler are you using and we can likely advise on how to do that. On windows with VC command line, use the /MD command line option for example.
