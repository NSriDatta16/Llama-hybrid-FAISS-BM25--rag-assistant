Multiple Condition Coverage Testing

When using the White Box method of testing called Multiple Condition Coverage, do we take all conditional statements or just the ones with multiple conditions? Now maybe the clues in the name but I'm not sure. So if I have the following method void someMethod() { if(a && b && (c || (d && e)) ) //Conditional A { } if(z && q) // Conditional B { } } Do I generate the truth table for just "Conditional A", or do I also do Conditional B? Thanks,
