You could also draw a sample of size 2901 from a uniform value taking its values in {1, 2, ... 10} (for 10-CV). This sample determines a random partition of the data, with 10 sub-groups of roughly equal size (each sub-group has equal probability of being drawn for each training observation). For each of these sub-groups you can then compute a sub-group average measure (such as MSE, as opposed to total sub-group squared error) as suggested by Matthew. I wouldn't think small differences in subsamble sizes would matter much if you take sub-group averages, but if you are worried you can always repeat this sampling procedure multiple times to get an average 10-CV estimate.
