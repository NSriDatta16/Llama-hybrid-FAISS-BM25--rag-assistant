Relationship between two continuous variables in time series data

I have a dataset that collects daily data based on transactions between two entities. I wish to find the strength, direction, and kind of relationship between two continuous variables i.e. Number of transactions ( No_of_transactions ) and Error counts ( Error_Counts ) over the period of approximately two years. Error counts are of degree 10²-10⁵ and the number of transactions in 10¹-10³. I'm pretty sure the relationship is nonlinear because when I draw the scatterplot it is more towards inverse relationship (rightly so) and I believe a simple corr() function won't help much.
