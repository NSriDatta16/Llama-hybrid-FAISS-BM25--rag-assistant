Yes, the Von-Mises distribution family is an exponential family, so you can find the maximum likelihood estimate of its parameters as you would for any exponential family: set the expectation parameters to the average of the sufficient statistics $T(x) = x$ whose magnitude we'll call $\bar r$ . You'll have to convert these parameters to your parametrization after to get $\kappa$ . See @mic's answer for the equation. Just in case you're wondering how you implement @mic's solution in Python: I would use scipy.optimize to find the root of your function: the ratio of Bessel functions minus $\bar r$ . Edit: Since this answer was posted, I've written an exponential family library for Python : import jax.numpy as jnp from efax import VonMisesFisherEP mean_r = jnp.asarray([0.2, 0.4, -0.3]) # The mean observation. x = VonMisesFisherEP(mean_r) print(x.to_nat().kappa()) # 2.007
