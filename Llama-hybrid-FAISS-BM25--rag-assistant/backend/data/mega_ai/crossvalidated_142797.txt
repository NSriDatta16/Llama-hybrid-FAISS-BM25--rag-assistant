Cox regression with two dependent expanatory variables

I am doing a Cox regression to model how survival times of sick patients, after taking a certain number of pills. There are in total 10 different pills patients can take. Some patients take one pill, some take two pills, but three pills is the maximum any patient can take. We measure how long each patient survives, and all measurements are right censored at 365 days. I have a big problem choosing two of the covariates. It is a "known fact" that if you take three pills, you are likely two survive longer than those taking two pills, and even longer than those taking only one pill. So I have one covariate called $x_1$, which is the number of pills each patient take. But it has come to our attention, that some combinations of pills are actually decreasing survival time and are "bad" for the patients. Some combinations of pills are more frequent than others, and some combinations are actually non-existent. There are, as you understand, a lot of different combinations of 10 different pills, and also very important - there are different combinations depending on how many pills you take and all the types of combinations are gathered in the coviarate $x_2$, which gives me the model: $h(t)=h_{0}(t)e^{\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2}$ But this gives me a lot of headache. Including the second covariate $x_2$ makes the first covariate $x_1$ redundant, but this covariate is "important" to me. I do not see how I can keep both, because they are obviously very correlated. Is there any way of keeping my first covariate (number of pills), while including the second covariate (combination of pills)? EDIT: To summarize: $x_1$ is number of pills taken, a categorical variable. $x_2$ is combination of the 10 different types of pills taken. If the 10 different pills have different colours, some combinations could be: "red pill", "red pill + blue pill", "red pill + blue pill + orange pill" etc. This is also a categorical variable.
