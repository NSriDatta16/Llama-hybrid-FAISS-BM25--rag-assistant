It's pretty dreadful. It makes it impossible to set the value to null, for one thing. In a language that distinguished undefined from null, then it would be reasonable to do this with that undefined value, rather than null. The mismatch between something being returned or not isn't even valid in many languages. In either case, why not return it anyway, to allow reasonable chaining of x.dir = y.dir = someValue ? But that's a nick-pick, my first paragraph is my main answer.
