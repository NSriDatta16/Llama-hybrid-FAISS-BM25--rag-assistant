In Python if you want to compute some hash (MD5, SHA1) there is hashlib module. To make some operations on filesystem there is os module. In those modules you will find: sha1 object with hexdigest() method and listdir() and rename() functions. Example code: import os import hashlib def sha1_file(fn): f = open(fn, 'rb') r = hashlib.sha1(f.read()).hexdigest() f.close() return r for fn in os.listdir('.'): if fn.endswith('.sha'): hexh = sha1_file(fn) print('%s -> %s' % (fn, hexh)) os.rename(fn, hexh) Attention : sha1_file() function read whole file at once so it will not work very well for huge files. As a homework try to improve it for such files (read file in parts and update hash with those parts). Of course if fn.endswith('.sha'): is used for test purposes only.
