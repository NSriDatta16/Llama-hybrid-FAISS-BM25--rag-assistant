php equilvalant to on duplicate key update?

I find myself using this logic a lot: if (isset($array[$key])) $array[$key] += $num; else $array[$key] = $num; since the keys are dynamically generated I cannot just set them all to zero at the start. I was wondering if there were a more elegant way of doing this, similar to MySQLs ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE logic.
