For simple linear regression, you should use the "lm" (which stands for linear models of which simple linear regression is one type) function rather than the "glm" (which stands for generalized linear models). The way to do this is to 1. Put all your Xs in a matrix and Ys in a vector 2. Combine the X and Y into a Data Frame (this is Rs default way or organizing statistical data. It seems weird and you could think of it as a matrix with some very descriptive labels) 3. run the lm function on the dataframe.
