Generally, if you treat the independent variables as non-random, you don't need the assumption of normality for them. Normality is necessary for the dependent variable in linear regression with hypothesis testing (actually, it's normality of the error terms, not of the variable itself, but in my experience a highly-non-normal dependent variable won't often yield a normal error term). This page gives a pretty layman's description. Without knowing more about your situation, you may not need to create the bins at all. Related to the time trend, year fixed effects will take care of that for you, correct. But they may not be the ideal conception of time. If you have a small number of years in your panel, then fixed effects may be the best. But if the panel is fairly long, you may want to consider treating time as a continuous variable and add in polynomials as appropriate. You can generally explore that by graphing out the time series. Getting to your two models, it makes perfect sense that they would give you different results. You are making a continuous variable ordinal, and the ordering of the observations is different in the two cases. Model 1 makes the ordering across all years, whereas Model 2 makes the ordering within year, and unless the observations are ordered the same each year, the results will be different. I don't intuitively see why you would want to take the Model 1 approach - if you really want an ordinal relationship, I would do it within the panels, not across them, as I think that will give you a cleaner interpretation of the coefficient.
