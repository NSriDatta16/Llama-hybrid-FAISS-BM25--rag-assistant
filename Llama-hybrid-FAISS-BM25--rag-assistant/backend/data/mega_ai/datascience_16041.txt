You could try to apply Principal Component Analysis, a form or ordination in which you linearly transform the vector space to maximize variance over the new dimensions. Consequently you'll end up with a new ordering in which more variance is contained in fewer dimensions, enabling you to consider less dimensions in your analyses. Most, if not all, statistical software packages offer PCA as a component.
