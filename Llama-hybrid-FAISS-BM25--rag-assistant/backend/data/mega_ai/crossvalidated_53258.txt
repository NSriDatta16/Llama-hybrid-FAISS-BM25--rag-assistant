Where can i find a good book that teaches MCMC in R?

I am looking for a good book that will teach me MCMC in R , in particular Block Gibbs and Collapsed MCMC. Preferably with R pseudocode supplemented within the book as well. Does anyone have any good recommendations ? I am looking for a book that teaches solely MCMC. Thanks
