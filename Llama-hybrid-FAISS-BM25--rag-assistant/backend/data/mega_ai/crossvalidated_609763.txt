Thanks for this answer. In the meantime, I also got to understand the issue better. As Dave shows in the regression formula, we are modeling the "expected value of the dependent variable, given fixed covariate values", i.e. in regression we model the conditional mean . The mistake I made was to think that when the independent variable increases with 1 sd, that the dependent variable decreased with 0.8 sd. More correct is to say that the conditional mean of the dependent variable decreases with 0.8 sd. This directly relates to the concept of "regression to the mean" , which says that: if you take an extreme group on one variable, the average of this group on another variable will always be closer to the mean (unless there is perfect correlation). So, if X increases with 1 sd, then the conditional mean of Y decreases with 0.8 sd, and if Y increases with 1 sd, then the conditional mean of X decreases with 0.8 sd. Both statements do not contradict each other. In the former statement, you move up in the distribution of X and model the mean of Y, in the latter statement, you move up in the distribution of Y and model the mean of X.
