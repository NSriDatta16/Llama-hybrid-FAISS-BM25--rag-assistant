Sensitivity analysis of a fuzzy cognitive model

I have a fuzzy cognitive model of inter-organizational collaboration that is represented by a 27x27 matrix. I want to analyze the effects of individual variables. I've read I can do this best with a SOBOL sensitivity analysis. However, I am open to any and all other ways of accomplishing this task. I am a total newb here, do not assume I have prior knowledge. I need simple answers with lots of pictures :) Cheers,
