C# generic "where constraint" with "any generic type" definition?

Let me give example: I have some generic class/interface definition: interface IGenericCar {...} I have another class/interface that I want to relate with class above, for example: interface IGarrage : where TCar: IGenericCar {...} Basically, I want my generic IGarrage to be dependent on IGenericCar , regardless if it's IGenericCar or IGenericCar , because I don't have any dependency to that type.
