Which the best programming language to handle time series?

I work with CSV files containing 10-minute data of temperatures of some years of a station, and I usually perform some calculations: mean, average, correlations between two stations, correlations in different seasons, correlations day/night, ... I program this calculations by using plain Python or Microsoft Excel VBA, by using loops and simple calculations. It's not very hard to code, but I wonder if there is a Python library or any other programming environment which helps me to save time and lines of code. I've heard about ScyPy and R, and I would be very grateful if you could share any experience with these tools.
