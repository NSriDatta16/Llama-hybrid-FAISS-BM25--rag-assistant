Creating an index of quality from multiple variables to enable rank ordering

I have four numeric variables. All of them are measures of soil quality. Higher the variable, higher the quality. The range for all of them is different: Var1 from 1 to 10 Var2 from 1000 to 2000 Var3 from 150 to 300 Var4 from 0 to 5 I need to combine four variables into single soil quality score which will successfully rank order. My idea is very simple. Standardize all four variables, sum them up and whatever you get is the score which should rank-order. Do you see any problem with applying this approach. Is there any other (better) approach that you would recommend? Thanks Edit: Thanks guys. A lot of discussion went into "domain expertise"... Agriculture stuff... Whereas I expected more stats-talk. In terms of technique that I will be using... It will probably be simple z-score summation + logistic regression as an experiment. Because vast majority of samples has poor quality 90% I'm going to combine 3 quality categories into one and basically have binary problem (somequality vs no-quality). I kill two birds with one stone. I increase my sample in terms of event rate and I make a use of experts by getting them to clasify my samples. Expert classified samples will then be used to fit log-reg model to maximize level of concordance / discordance with the experts.... How does that sound to you?
