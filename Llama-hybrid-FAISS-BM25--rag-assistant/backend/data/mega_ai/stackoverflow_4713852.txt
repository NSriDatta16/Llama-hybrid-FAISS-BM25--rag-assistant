reload partial view with jquery

i've created a upload form for 1 image. after the image is stored on the filesystem i want to refresh the partial view (which then should display the image). After uploading a image, jQuery runs the Url.Action but doesn't render the partial view which gets returned from the Action "WebAuftragImageRefresh"... Maybe you have an idea? Regards, float BTW. Why is the code-block not ignoring html tags? View: http://codepaste.net/co1gu9 Partial-View: http://codepaste.net/1rxq2d Controller: http://codepaste.net/j8kugj
