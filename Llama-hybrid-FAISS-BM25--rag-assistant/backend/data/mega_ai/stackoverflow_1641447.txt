Changing the User-Agent string is a good method. I haven't tried it personally, but you should be able to alter the NSURLRequest object and change the user-agent before the request is made. You could also use other custom data in the HTTP request to allow/block visits. You could add a query string to the URL or include some unique POST data. Note this isn't a real security measure as anyone could fake any part of the HTTP request to gain access. Someone could easily read the HTTP traffic generated from your app and use that to figure out how to access the site with any browser.
