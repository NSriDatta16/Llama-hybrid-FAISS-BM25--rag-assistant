I think that most elegant solution would be using some action filter combined with custom ActionInvoker. That way, you could invoke an action that has specific filters applied. Something like ActionName attribute, only capable to accept multiple values (names). Edit: Take a look at ActionMethodSelectorAttribute , meybe you don't need a custom ActionInvoker after all.
