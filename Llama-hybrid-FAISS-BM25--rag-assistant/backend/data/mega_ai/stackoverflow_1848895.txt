DirectShow Editing Services 4GB memory limit under Windows 7 x64

I compiled XTLTest as 64 bit and attempted to test some XTLs under windows 7 x64. All these tests were done using an XTL with one clip from the WMV showcase, with a timeline sized at 1440x1080. buffering set to 300 - plays back fine. buffering set to 600 and got a cant run graph error. Recompiled with large memory aware (which should be set by default on 64 bit apps), same thing. Tested at 310 and worked fine. Tried playing out 2 different instances of 64 bit XTLTest at the same time with 310 buffering, and the second one fails with 'can't run graph'. buffering set to 80, was able to play 4 instances of XTLTest using a combined 4GB of memory. Execute any more instances and can't run graph. Compiled .NET application targeted at any using DirectShowLib, and comfirmed its running as 64 bit native app. I was able to load 4 XTLs at 80 buffering until I got System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8007000E): Not enough storage is available to complete this operation. So I can an only conclude that the DES subsystem has a 4GB memory limit for all applications combined. Is this true? If so is this a DES limit or a DirectShow limit and is there any way to workaround? best, Tuviah Snyder Lead programmer, MediaWan Solid State Logic, Inc
