How do I compare the performance of random forests for regression?

I've trained two random forests for a regression, based on the same data and variables, only with a different number of tree in each one. If I'm not wrong, having more trees is always better in terms of how the model performs. Can you confirm that? However, due to practical considerations, we can't afford to load a random forest of 10Gb, so we need to lower the number of trees in the forest. How can I compare the respective performance of the forests?
