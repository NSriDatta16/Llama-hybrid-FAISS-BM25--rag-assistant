I would have thought that using Rebol's prototypical inheritance is all that you need. It is simpler and more elegant: shape: make object! x: 0 y: 0 draw: func [] [probe self] ] circle: make shape [ radius: 10 ] triangle: make shape [] Which give the following results: >> shape/draw make object! [ x: 0 y: 0 draw: func [][probe self] ] >> circle/draw make object! [ x: 0 y: 0 draw: func [][probe self] radius: 10 ] >> triangle/draw make object! [ x: 0 y: 0 draw: func [][probe self] ]
