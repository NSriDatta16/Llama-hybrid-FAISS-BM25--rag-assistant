The Principal of Least Privilege states that the best practice is to ensure that the default state should be to deny access. The user rights system should be used to to add access rights to groups that need it. Under least privilege it should never be necessary to ever ban access. Of course, while its very difficult to manage, sometimes being able to apply ban permissions as well is pragmatically useful. To be useful, the deny should be stronger than the allow.
