I noticed that the previous answers lack some general HPC considerations. First of all, neither of those packages will enable you to run one SVM in parallel. So what you can speed up is parameter optimization or cross-validation, still you must write your own functions for that. Or of course you may run the job for different datasets in parallel, if it is a case. The second issue is memory; if you want to spread calculation over a few physical computers, there is no free lunch and you must copy the data -- here you must consider if it makes sense to predistribute a copy of data across computers to save some communication. On the other hand if you wish to use multiple cores on one computer, than the multicore is especially appropriate because it enables all child processes to access the memory of the parent process, so you can save some time and a lot of memory space.
