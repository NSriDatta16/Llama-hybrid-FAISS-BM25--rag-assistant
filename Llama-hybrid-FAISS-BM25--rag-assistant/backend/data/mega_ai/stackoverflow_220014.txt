Anything that is outside your core business is a good candidate for third party solutions. You want to spend your development time creating that core functionality that is unique(ish) and can not be purchased and used in a cost effective manor. For example, lets look at web gridview control. Can you develop and extend a gridview yourself? Sure you can, but to develop, code, and test you grid view is going to take X amount of time and resources, which you can translate in to dollars. Now you have factor in reoccurring costs for support, maintenance, and bug fixes. Now lets use the arbitrary amount I remember reading in some mag about the average US developer making $40 per hour including their benefits. There are whole web control suites available for around another approximated $800 per developer license. If your developer spends more than say 25 hours total on this one control, you could have purchased a whole suite and spent 5 hours integrating and testing. Now hopefully I didn't get too confusing there, but the general gist is if you can buy it off the self it will probably save time and money, and instead focus on things you can't get off the self which are usually your money makers.
