The authority here is just "I've been told". Despite that authority, you can think about the evidence you have: the graph itself tells you that lines at +/- 2 SE do not separate outliers from a mass of data points in the middle: they cut through zones with several data points. It appears that your observed average score takes on distinct values 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5. (The extra variation shown on the graph I take to be just graphical jittering.) At a guess each observed average score is just the average of two scores; otherwise the number of distinct values would be greater. If you were to make decisions based on the SD of y alone, you would have to classify e.g. all the 1s in the same way or all the 5s in the same way. It is not clear how that you would help you in any manner whatsoever. The extreme values of 1 and 5 are not outlying in any strong or even weak sense. No value of 1 and no value of 5 is exceptional. This graph alone doesn't suggest strong outliers, but it doesn't help much to identify them either. To check for outliers you would have to look at all the variables, e.g. in a scatter plot matrix. There is perhaps some evidence of asymmetry in that your residuals range (by eye) from almost -4 to less than 2.5, but then again that may be inevitable as it seems that most people get 4 or 5 and the model is predicting close to that for most of them. Rather than worrying about outliers your main concern should be whether a simple linear model is the best you can do and whether there is scope for improving matters through a nonlinear model or a transformation. A specific graphical point is that open symbols tolerate overlap better than the solid or closed symbols you are using.
