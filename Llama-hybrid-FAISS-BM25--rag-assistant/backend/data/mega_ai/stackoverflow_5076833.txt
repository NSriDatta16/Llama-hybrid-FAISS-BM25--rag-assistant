Telerik vs Infragistics vs DevX? WPF 3rd party controls. (Grid)

I have used Telerik WPF Rad controls v10, they are good. But didn't used it's RadGrid. And also I haven't used Infragistics and DevX controls for WPF. Keeping in mind the easy and detailed documentation and easy to implement controls and support, Kindly suggest me WPF 3rd Party controls in terms of Datagrid.
