Personally I don't like letting administrators change ANYTHING on a live site. All configuration changes should go through the same version-controlled, time-stamped, user-attributed, build-system-checked process that source code goes through. Only then can you draw connections "this stopped working at time X because user Y changed configuration A at time B". An extreme view on the topic I know, but given the huge proportion of downtime that can be traced back to operator error I believe is justified, and I honestly can't understand the fascination people have for being able to edit fragile XML files on live servers where a single extra '>' can bring the entire site down.
