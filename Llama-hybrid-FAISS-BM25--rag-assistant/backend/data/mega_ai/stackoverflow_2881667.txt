Hidden fields is just the easiest way, that is why they are used quite a bit. Alternatives: storing data in a session server-side (with sessionid cookie) storing data in a transaction server-side (with transaction id as the single hidden field) using URL path instead of hidden field query parameters where applicable Main concerns: the value of the hidden field cannot be trusted to not be tampered with from page to page (as opposed to server-side storage) big data needs to be posted every time, could be a problem, and is not possible for some data (for example uploaded images) Main advantages: no sticky sessions that spill between pages and multiple browser windows no server-side cleanup necessary (for expired data) accessible to client-side scripts
