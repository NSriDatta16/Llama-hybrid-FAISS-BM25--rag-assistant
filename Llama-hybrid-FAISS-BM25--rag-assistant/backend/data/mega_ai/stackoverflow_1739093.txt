Sounds like a bug to me - you should file one with Infragistics. As to a workaround - this is not a nice solution and I haven't tested it but you could always try saving the sort-by (group) columns to a temp store, RefreshSort() on the band, then re-apply the sort-by (gorup) columns, and sort again? ie. Remove group-by, then re-apply. Nasty, but it might get you out of a bind.
