Organising codes - JavaME

I have written a program that's has two thread. One is to to display the status of the current operation. Another is much more complex. It is used to connect, login, download, unzip files, open images, zip it back then upload back to server. How can I break it down to a more manageable level? Kind of confuse on how to process from here. Should I put every single one in a separate thread? Please give advice. Thank in advance.
