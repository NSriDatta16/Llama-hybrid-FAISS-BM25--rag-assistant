How do you organize code in embedded projects?

Highly embedded (limited code and ram size) projects pose unique challenges for code organization. I have seen quite a few projects with no organization at all. (Mostly by hardware engineers who, in my experience are not typically concerned with non-functional aspects of code.) However, I have been trying to organize my code accordingly: hardware specific (drivers, initialization) application specific (not likely to be reused) reusable, hardware independent For each module I try to keep the purpose to one of these three types. Due to limited size of embedded projects and the emphasis on performance, it is often keep this organization. For some context, my current project is a limited DSP application on a MSP430 with 8k flash and 256 bytes ram.
