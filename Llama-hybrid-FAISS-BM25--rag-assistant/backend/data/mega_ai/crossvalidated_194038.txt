Binary Logistic Regression with multiple binary and ordinal independent variables

In my data set I have one dependent variable (dead or alive) and 37 predictor variables. 35 of my predictor variables are dichotomous (Obese: 1 or 0, Female 1 or 0, etc), however 2 of my variables are coded into ordinal categories (ie, age 79: 4). In order to run a binary logistic regression with all 37 variables, should I split my ordinal variables such as age into 4 different columns (one for each category) and make them binary or is there an easier, better way to accomplish this? I tried leaving the ordinal variables as they are and running the logistic regression, however, for some reason they don't show up in the statistical output...
