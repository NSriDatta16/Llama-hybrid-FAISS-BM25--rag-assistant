The posters above are right. The correct values you are expecting are: Sin(360 degrees) = 0 Sin(180 degrees) = 0 Sin(150 degrees) = .5 Sin(120 degrees) = .866 The code is returning the correct answers. They just need to be rounded. Try this: System.out.printf("%s%.3f","| sin(" + currentPoint + ") = ", (Math.sin(Math.toRadians(currentPoint)))); You can change the .3f value to different numbers if you want to improve or reduce decimal precision. For some reason it displays the sin of 360 to be -0.00. I am sure there is a more elegant solution, but this should work. EDIT: Beaten by seconds. Use the code above mine, it is easier to read.
