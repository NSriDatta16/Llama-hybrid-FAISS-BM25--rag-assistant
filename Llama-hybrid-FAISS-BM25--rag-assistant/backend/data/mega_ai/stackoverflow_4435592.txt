the first you should know is that design patterns are not one-size-fits-all and therefore there is no such thing as a "Way to implement a design pattern". If you only mean the 3 tier model then MVC is good choice because it clearly separates each layer from the other, for Windows forms development look for tutorials on Entity Framework (or just LINQ) which, along the classes that handle the logic of the application, becomes your model layer, all the forms, along the classes used to present the data, are your views and, or course, the user controllers are well... that, your controller. I recommend you take a look at DoFactory website which has a great coverage on many design patterns. Also I should point out that you may not find an implementation in doFactory, that's just a reference for a bunch of design patterns. JIC.
