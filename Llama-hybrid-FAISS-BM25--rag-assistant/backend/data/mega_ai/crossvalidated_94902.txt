how to represent geography or zip code in machine learning model or recommender system?

I am building a model and I think that geographic location is likely to be very good at predicting my target variable. I have the zip code of each of my users. I am not entirely sure about the best way to include zip code as a predictor feature in my model though. Although zip code is a number, it doesn't mean anything if the number goes up or down. I could binarize all 30,000 zip codes and then include them as features or new columns (e.g., {user_1: {61822: 1, 62118: 0, 62444: 0, etc.}}. However, this seems like it would add a ton of features to my model. Any thoughts on the best way to handle this situation?
