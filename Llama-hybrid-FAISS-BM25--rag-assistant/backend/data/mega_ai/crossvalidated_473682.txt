You are not getting the expected orthogonal projection because you are only projecting the first 2 features. In order to see the orthogonality of the projection, you would need to plot also the other 2 features. You can try to run your code with X=iris[, 1:2] . Then, you will see the expected orthogonal projections. You can imagine that the projections on the first loading are orthogonal, but with X=iris[, 1:4] , in a 4-dimensional space. Remember that the PCA scores are the orthogonal projections onto the hyperplane that maximally spans the covariance of the data.
