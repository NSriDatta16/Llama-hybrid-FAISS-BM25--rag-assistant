Hard to say, it is quite a general question. Decision trees (Random forest or Boosted Regression Trees) could be useful in this case if the categories are clearly separated. Yet, these machine learning models are used to predict or as exploratory analysis. For example, how well is do the levels in Column D correlate with (predict) levels in Column J . You would like to see a pairwise comparison for each possible combination? To me it seems that you want to produce something similar as a correlation matrix, but then for categorical variables. However, for this machine learning is not necessary (or perhaps I am too pragmatical). I would not make it too (unnecessary) complex when a simple (or simplistic approach) would suffice. I never performed a pairwise categorical correlation, but a quick search delivered me this Correlations with unordered categorical variables .
