Forcing "Windows XP" style on a c# Form-Based Executable, even in Vista, 7 etc

I've written an Application using Visual Studio 2008, on a Windows XP machine. All the styling of the Form looks perfect there. However, when the Application is run on Windows 7 or Vista, it uses the default style of those OS's instead, and it messes up the way some things look. I read that, at build time, embedding a Manifest in my code might "tell" Windows 7 that I want to use the form style (Classic Style) that I built the thing in no matter what OS I'm on. But, it appears that this embedding is already being done by default (so that's not the solution for me). Thanks for any thoughts!
