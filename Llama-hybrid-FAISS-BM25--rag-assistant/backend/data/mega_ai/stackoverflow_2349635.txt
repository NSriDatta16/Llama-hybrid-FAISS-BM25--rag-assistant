I can think of a couple of solutions. One would be to simply store values in an array with an enum like so: StatisticType = enum('AveragePerDay','MedianPerDay'...) Another would be to use a inheritance like so: class StatisticBase .... class AveragePerDay ( StatisticBase ) ... class MedianPerDay ( StatisticBase ) ... There is no hard and fast rule on "too many", however a guideline is that if the list of fields, properties, and methods when collapsed, is longer than a single screen full, it's probably too big.
