Nuance , the company that makes Dragon Naturally Speaking , has a number of Software Development Kits . The Audio Mining kit seems to match your requirements: Dragon NaturallySpeaking SDK AudioMining is a speaker-independent speech recognition toolkit that enables the indexing of 100% of the speech information within audio files. The technology uses highly accurate speech recognition to turn audio files into XML text with timestamp information. This can be integrated with standard text-search products to enable rapid access to specific audio content. The speech to speech+metadata is far and away the hardest part to get right. Once you have the speech + metadata, extracting the words as individual audio files is much more straightforward .
