Adrian Raftery examined a set of statistics about coal-dust explosions in 19th-century British mines. Frequentist techniques had shown the coal mining accident rates changed over time gradually. Our of curiosity, Raftery experimented with Bayes' Theorem, and discovered that accident rates had plummeted suddenly in the early 1890s. A historian suggested why: in 1889, the miners had formed a safety coalition. from A history of Bayes Theorem . The original paper is here , though I would suggest the example in the PyMC literature for more clarity (i.e. less integrals haha) Also, from another post, there is the Table Game from (the very accessible pdf) The Table Game . The two proposed solutions, Bayesian and frequentist, are very different (and only one is correct!).
