Google Trend in my opinion can't produce a good data set for this case of study. Google trend shows how often a term is searched with Google so there are at least two reasons for raising some doubts about the prevision: We don't know if the user searches on Google Facebook to log in or if he searches information about Facebook Facebook is not only a site is a phenomenon, with many articles, books and a film about it and Facebook Inc. on May 18, 2012 began selling stock to the public and trading on the NASDAQ. Google Trend shows you both: the searches for the site and the searches for the "phenomenon". New things always have a great impact to the mass, TV had a great impact to the mass now no one write articles about it but is still one of the most used appliance. Most users don't search "facebook" on Google to login With mobile applications and Bookmarks a user with a decent knowledge of internet search "facebook" on Google only the first time then he usually saves the page as a bookmark or download the application. The graph below is the Google trend for Wikipedia , it seems that we will not use Wikipedia in the future. Obviously this is not true we simply don't access to wikipedia typing "wikipedia" we simply search and then use the wikipedia page or we use the bookmark to access to it.
