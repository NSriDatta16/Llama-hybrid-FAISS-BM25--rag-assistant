Does sqlite3 text data type supports unicode? Yes and no. Yes in that SQLite lets you store TEXT data in UTF-8 or UTF-16. (Use PRAGMA ENCODING to choose the internal format.) No in that the built-in LOWER and UPPER functions only affect ASCII characters. But you can redefine functions and collations to add this support. There's an ICU extension to SQLite that does this.
