principle? I'd have to say it boils down mostly to not 're-inventing the wheel' and rapid application development(RAD), by creating generic code that can be reused in differect situations just by chnaging the template parameters. a good example of this is std::list or std::vector As for what to use, well that depends on your goals(ie: what sort or pragram are you making, what will it need to do?), generally though you can use either boost and/or the STL libraries that ship with most compilers these days
