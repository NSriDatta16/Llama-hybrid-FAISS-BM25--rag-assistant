Choosing x variables for logit regression model design

I am hoping to create a logistic regression model in R that predicts an individuals probability of having hypertension. Diabetes is closely associated with hypertensive individuals, so I know I need to include that as a predictive factor in my model. I am unsure whether it makes more sense to include a variable that accounts for individuals with both conditions (HYP_AND_DBTS) or just a variable for diabetes. It seems strange to do the former since I am including the outcome (hypertension) as part of the right side of the equation as well. But when I run the model with only the diabetes variable, the p-values of certain variables increase and I lose significance of some variables. I've included both outputs below. Which is more accurate/correct? Or could I do either? Thank you! #this is the model which includes a variable for both people with both conditions (HYP_AND_DBTS) logitmfx(formula = HYPERTEN ~ AGE + BMICALC + IMMIGRANT + FAMSIZE + FEMALE + BELOW_100_POVERTY + EDUC_2 + EDUC_3 + EDUC_4 + EDUC_5 + REGION_1 + REGION_2 + REGION_4 + YEAR_2015 + YEAR_2016 + YEAR_2017 + YEAR_2018 + HLTH_INS + SMOKE + MARRIED + NON_WHITE + HYP_AND_DBTS, data = df, atmean = TRUE, robust = T, clustervar1 = "PSU", clustervar2 = NULL) Marginal Effects: dF/dx Std.
