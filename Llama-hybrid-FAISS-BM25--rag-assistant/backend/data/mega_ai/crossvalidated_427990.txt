On the one hand, the data have panel format. They have two dimensions: company & time. Therefore, the ideas of classic panel data approaches, like mixed effects models , would be helpful here... Stata and R are the best packages for panel data. On the other hand, if the data have 10,000+ companies (better 100,000+ companies) you can employ non-linear and non-parametric methods of machine learning: gradient boosting , random forest , support vector machine , etc. Arguably, R is the best language for that. All in all, you may benefit from combining the panel data and machine learning approaches. So R wins.
