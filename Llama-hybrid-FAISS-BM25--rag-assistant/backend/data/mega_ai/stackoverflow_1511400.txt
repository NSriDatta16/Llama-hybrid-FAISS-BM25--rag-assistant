I've found another great snip of genius i wanted to share: you can do custom code folding (not really related to php, just netbeans) just put this into a code file: // some boring code you don't need to see every time here // That'll behave similar to #region s in visual studio or pragma mark s in xcode. but unlike region s, it doesn't screw up the working of your code, it's really just a comment!
