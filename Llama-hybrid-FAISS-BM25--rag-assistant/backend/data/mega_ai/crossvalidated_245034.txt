Which type of regression to use?

I am still a rookie at statistics. I am writing a report on crimes and how they affect economic prosperity. I have yearly data for 30 years from 1 country, where number of crimes in a year is my independent variable and GDP growrth is my dependent variable. I have 3 other control variables as external invtment, total trade and infrastructure. Now my key question is can I use multivariate time series? if not, which is the best regression in this case?
