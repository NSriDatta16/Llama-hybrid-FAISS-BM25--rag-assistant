You can solve this problem with a hierarchical model where the number of colors in the bag is first drawn from a distribution over integers ranging from 1 to infinity (say, a Poisson distribution), then a subset of colors are drawn at random from the possible colors, and finally a probability vector over these colors is chosen at random. For details, see the paper "Efficient Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Large Discrete Domains" .
