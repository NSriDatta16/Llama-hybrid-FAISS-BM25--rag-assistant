How to forecast a time series which is dependent on different time series?

I have two time series S = s[1], s[2], s[3],..., s[t-1], s[t] R = r[1], r[2], r[3],..., r[t-1], r[t] Such that: r[t] = p[t,1]*s[1] + p[t,2]*s[2] + p[t,3]*s[3] ... + p[t,t-1]*s[t-1] r[t-1] = p[t-1,1]*s[1] + p[t-1,2]*s[2] + p[t-1,3]*s[3] ... + p[t-1,t-2]*s[t-2] etc... Where p[i,j] are unknown percentages. My goal is to forecast the second time series R . I could perform a straightforward forecast of R based on its own historical values: r[t+1] = f(r[1] r[2] r[3] ... r[t]) using ARIMA, Exponential smoothing, etc...but it seems that I would be loosing valuable information by discarding the values from S . I could go the other way and try to forecast R solely based on S : r[t+1] = f(s[1] s[2] s[3] ... s[t]) using some sort of regression or pattern recognition algorithm, but that seems like a bad idea, since it would dismiss any inherent patterns in R that are not dependent on S . What is the best approach to forecast R? How can one 'blend' a straightforward time series forecast of R with information gleaned from S ? Assuming we have a good forecast of S , how can we include them in the forecast for R ?
