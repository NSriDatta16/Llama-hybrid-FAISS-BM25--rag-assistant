You pass parameters to a jinja template as a dictionary d when you call the template.renderfunction(d) function (for example). Thus, you could do: emails = [] for user in db: doc = db[user] emails.append(doc['email']) some_jinja_template.render({'list_of_emails' : emails}) Then in the template, you could do something like: {% for address in list_of_emails %} Send email to {{ address }} {% endfor %} To make a list of emails, for example, or handle them however you'd like. PS - I'm sure the code could be more elegant/more optimized with a list comprehension or whatever, but I figured I should emphasize readability for a so-called "green" programmer.
