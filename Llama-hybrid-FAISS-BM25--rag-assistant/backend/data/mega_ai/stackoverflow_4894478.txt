You would no more use a separate table in a database for each tenant than you would a solr core for each tenant. If you think of a core like a database table and organize your project in such a way that each core represents an object in your problem space then you can better leverage solr. Where solr shines in when you need to index text and then search it quickly. If you are not doing that you might as well use a relational database. Also from your question about securing solr for each tenant , I hope you're not suggesting allowing your logged in users to access the solr output directly? Your users should not be able to directly access your solr instance. Good luck.
