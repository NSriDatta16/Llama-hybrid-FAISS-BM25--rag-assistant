When to use t-test and Chi-squared test

I want to find correlation between win_lose and other columns starting from ID to eki_id . The data has 100k rows. Which test should be used to find correlation between win_lose and other categorical(object) type columns [ID,X_MOD_1,X_MOD_2, X_MOD_3, CONST_ID, eki_id]? Which test should be used to find correlation between win_lose and other continuous numerical columns i.e. X_MOD_var ? I know that chi-squared test is used for categorical to categorical, but in case categorical to continuous which one to use? I could not find a clear answer. This video says use logistic regression. https://youtu.be/E0eFZzI9Epo?t=479
