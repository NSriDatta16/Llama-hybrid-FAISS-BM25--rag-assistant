You have for the number of counts: Counts per year: $$Y \sim Pois(\lambda)$$ Counts per month: $$X \sim Pois(\lambda/12)$$ But... Counts per month (average for 12 months) $$Y/12 \nsim Pois(\lambda/12)$$ or $$\frac{X_1+X_2+...X_{12}}{12} \nsim Pois(\lambda/12) $$ If you divide the counts over a year by twelve then you do not get a variable that corresponds to the counts for a particular individual month, but instead you get an average over twelve months. The Poisson distribution is only to be used for the raw number of counts . It is not true for any derived (scaled) number. So a term like 'counts per T' should be used very carefully. The Poisson distribution describes 'counts' and not 'counts per T'. Bob was right in stating that $\text{Var}(X) = \frac{\lambda}{12}$ . However when you take the mean of twelve of those variables (which is what Alice computed) then you will get: $$\text{Var} \left( \frac{1}{12} (X_1+X_2+...X_{12}) \right) = \frac{1}{12}\frac{\lambda}{12} = \frac{\lambda}{12^2}$$ and the standard deviation, $\sigma = \frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{12}$ , corresponds to Alices number. for some reason we need to report a monthly rate instead of this yearly number and also the (estimated) standard deviation in this monthly rate You can report an estimate for the mean monthly rate and the estimated standard error for that estimate. But note that this will be different from the standard deviation of that monthly rate. The variance of a distribution and the variance of an estimate for the mean of that distribution are not the same . (This occurs very often that some people report figures with very tiny error bars. That makes it appear as if the difference between two cases is very small. But, what those people only did is show that they can estimate the means very precise and show those are different, but this does not mean that the differences between the groups is so large. Often it is also confusing/ambiguous what the reported variation/error bars mean.)
