What to input into machine learning algorithm for image recogniton?

I am working on a project that involves classifying images as either that of a cat or that of a dog, without using CNNs. I used SKImage to convert the images to a matrices and changed it to grayscale to reduce dimensions and complexity. I then flattened the matrices to vectors and input them into an SVC, Logistic Regression and Stochastic GD Classifier, but all of them were very innacurate and had less than 60% accuracy. This leads me to believe that I converted the images to the wrong format, which is why the ML algos are unable to fit the data. So what should I convert them to? Should I use feature extraction?
