If the tray icon appears and has white color then your wamp server has began. can also be checked by going to http://localhost . Anyways i hope you are getting the normal options when you left click on the tray icon. Right clicking the tray icon gives options to change language(which i hope you don't need) , a link to your localhost(can be found at C:\wamp\scripts\refresh.php ) and a link to wamp website .I am sure no functionality is affected by these options.
