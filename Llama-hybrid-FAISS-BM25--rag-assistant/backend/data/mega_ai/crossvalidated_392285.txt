Law of Large Numbers under Transformation

The Law of Large Number, draw i.i.d examples of a random variable y, then with propability of 1 the average of y_1, ... y_n goes to the expected value of y. When i apply a function to the y_i's, does then also hold that the average of f(y_1), ... f(y_n) goes to the expected value of f(y). Does the function f needs to fullfil certain conditions for this to hold?
