Any sensible way to use Hudson with TFS workspaces?

I've been playing with Hudson and got the TFS source control integration running. Problem is: it only allows you to specify a single folder as the source root. We've got a lot of projects that share resources (including standard shared libraries). If I could hard-link a folder like I could in source safe this wouldn't be an issue. I can think of good solutions for other source control systems as well, but sadly I need to work with TFS, and I can't reorganize the folder structure. Declaring things to be built from root would just be too slow. Anyone any good ideas of how to solve this?
