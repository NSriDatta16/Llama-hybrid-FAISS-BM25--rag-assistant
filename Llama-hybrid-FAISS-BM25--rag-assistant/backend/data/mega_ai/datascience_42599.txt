What is the relationship between the accuracy and the loss in deep learning?

I have created three different models using deep learning for multi-class classification and each model gave me a different accuracy and loss value. The results of the testing model as the following: First Model: Accuracy: 98.1% Loss: 0.1882 Second Model: Accuracy: 98.5% Loss: 0.0997 Third Model: Accuracy: 99.1% Loss: 0.2544 My questions are: What is the relationship between the loss and accuracy values? Why the loss of the third model is the higher even though the accuracy is higher?
