Java Network Launching Protocol JNLP stands for Java Network Launch Protocol. It is both the format/file type of the XML based files used to configure the details of apps. launched using Java Web Start , as well as the package name of the API that is provided to JWS apps.

Since Java 1.6.0_10 (the Next Generation Java Plug-In ), JNLP based applets can remain embedded in a web page. The JNLP file specifies the resources required for an app., as well as: Splash image to use Shortcuts for the desktop and start menu Icons for the shortcuts Details of the app. such as title and vendor Download and update behavior The security environment requested by the app. (JWS launched apps. are sand-boxed by default). ..
