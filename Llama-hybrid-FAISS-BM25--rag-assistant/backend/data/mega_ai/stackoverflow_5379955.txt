The event e has built in variables that you can access for checking if control , alt or shift have been pressed. Have a look here . $('#selectableitems p').click(function(e) { if(e.ctrlKey) alert('control pressed'); if(e.altKey) alert('alt pressed'); }); If you know that control is also pressed, you could add a class selectedItem or something like that. On a mouseup event you could check if the key is pressed and delete the selectedItem class if not. Than just add a draggable to the $('.selectedItem') and you're pretty much there.
