I don't have much experience with the iPhone itself, but in general this might be a good application of pairwise testing . In practice, you can get 90% coverage with a small fraction of the testing of an exhaustive test pass. Then later if you find certain configurations have gotchas you can add them to your set of configurations and still not need to do an exhaustive pass.
