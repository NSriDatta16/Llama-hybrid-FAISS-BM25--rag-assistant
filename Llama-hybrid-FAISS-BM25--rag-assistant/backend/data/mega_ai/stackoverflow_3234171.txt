"Ready" queues (those that you call "Input Queues") are for push flow. "Done" queues (output) are for pull flows. Most systems have both push and pull. Push will happen where there are different organizational semantics between work steps. For example, the movement of work items between a product backlog and the input queue for the team is usually a push movement. Work may be then pulled from the input queue. It's rare that you'll have a single work step that will have both an input and an output queue.
