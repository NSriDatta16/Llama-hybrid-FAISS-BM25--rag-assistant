You can define your own rewrite map that does that for you in an simple external program. This teqnique is very efficient because your script will be started only once and kept open. (it changes one line of stdin for one line of stdout). So the interpreter etc has not to be loaded. However imo it would be a lot more elegant to do the logic in your application. In fact this is what almost all frameworks do. Just do a rewrite rule that rewrites everything to your bootstrap fileand there you can deal with the whole thing. It will be a lot easier to maintain.
