From a system-software-writer's pointer of view: This all depends on how the meta-data about the server process is organized within your daemon (lighttpd or fcgi). Some programs are designed for one time only initialization -- MOSTLY this allows a much simpler and better performing internal programming model. Often it is very hard to program a server process reload config data in a easy way. You might have to introduce locks and external event objects (signals in UNIX). When you can synchronize the data structures by design -- i.e., only initializing once .... why complicate things by making the data model modifiable multiple times ?
