I would try to model this using multivariate logistic regression. This can probably be fit in R with lme4::glmer , some information is at Fitting multivariate linear mixed model in R , follow the links and references therein! This would need a random intercept for each respondent, shared among the 12 logistic regression, so would really be a multivariate model.
