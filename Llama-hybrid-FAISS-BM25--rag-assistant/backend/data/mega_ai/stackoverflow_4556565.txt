Both local and non-local global variables are "bad" by the virtue of being global. But initialization and access for those two cases are different, so the answer which one to use depends on your needs regarding those requirements. As a side note, dynamic initialization of local variables with static storage duration may not be thread-safe, depending on your compiler. The good news, in C++0x it's guaranteed to be thread-safe.
