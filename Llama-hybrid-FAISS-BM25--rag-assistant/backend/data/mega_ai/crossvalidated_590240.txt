That depends on where those coefficients come from. If they are from a logistic regression, you can just do $e^\beta$ . In most computer programs (and hand calculators) the function for that would be called exp() . Since you are doing a meta analysis you probably also want the standard error of that odds ratio. For that you would typically use the delta method. In this case it would be $e^\beta \mathrm{se}_\beta$ , so the odds ratio you computed times the standard error of the raw beta coefficient. If those studies used some other model than a logistic regression model, then things will get a lot harder.
