How do you convert a 'System::String ^' to 'TCHAR'?

i asked a question here involving C++ and C# communicating. The problem got solved but led to a new problem. this returns a String (C#) return Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(decryptsn(InpData)); this expects a TCHAR* (C++) lpAlpha2[0] = Company::Pins::Bank::Decryption::Decrypt::Decryption("123456"); i've googled how to solve this problem, but i am not sure why the String has a carrot(^) on it. Would it be best to change the return from String to something else that C++ would accept? or would i need to do a convert before assigning the value?
