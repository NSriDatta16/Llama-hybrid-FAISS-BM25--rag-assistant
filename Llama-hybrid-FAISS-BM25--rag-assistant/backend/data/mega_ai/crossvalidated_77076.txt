I don't know what "non-stationary limited data" means. So I will assume you mean "non-stationary data". Exponential smoothing methods including Holt-Winters methods are appropriate for (some kinds of) non-stationary data. In fact, they are only really appropriate if the data are non-stationary. Using an exponential smoothing method on stationary data is not wrong but is sub-optimal. If by "moving averages", you mean forecasting using a moving average of recent observations, then that is also ok for some kinds of non-stationary data. But it obviously won't work well with trends or seasonality. If by "moving averages", you mean a moving average model (i.e. a model consisting of a linear combination of past error terms), then you do need a stationary time series.
