WinForms: Alternative to SplitContainer?

Are there any alternative controls someone can suggest to replace the WinForms SplitContainer? I don't like how the SplitContainer shows that weird, dotted strip when its selected and when its being dragged. I want to have the panels re-size as the user drags instead of on mouse up and not show any dotted strips when the splitter is being dragged. Basically like how all the re-sizing of panels is done in windows explorer on vista. This is the dotted thing I'm talking about: (source: bhslaughter.com )
