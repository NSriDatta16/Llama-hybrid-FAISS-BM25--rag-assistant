Long story short, BayesA is a mixed model that assumes that each marker is a random effect, whereas snpBLUP assumes that all markers make a single random effect. They call it BayesA because it is solved via MCMC because REML takes too long. Then, BayesB is the same thing but it has a variable selection - which means that the model can assign zero effect to a markers. Since it runs through MCMC, it will never be a true zero but something very close to it. You can check this to get the ABC of how these models are solved http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-016-2750-y
