Testing If Mal-Dosing Exceeds a Certain Threshold

Suppose you have mal-dosing data of some medication (in percent). You want to know if mal-dosing on average exceeds 5% regardless of over- or underdosing. Can I do a simple t-test? (if I assume iid data) The random variable (absolute mal-dosing) lives only on the positive real line. My guess is that the CLT does not require a RV to have support over the entire real line and therefore a simple t-test is valid. Am I right?
