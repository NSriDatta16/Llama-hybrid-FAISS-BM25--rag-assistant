apply running median for non equidistance daily measurements with potentially several KPI measurements per day

Let us say I have daily measurements of a KPI with potential gaps (i.e. no measurements some days) and sometimes several measurements per day. How would one apply the running median (see for example here ) in this situation? The intention is to show a trend of the underlying process's KPI. Should one average the values for days with several measurements (e.g. using the median)? I have used statistical process control charts (SPCCs) and applied box-cox transformations but am not to sure whether the underlying assumption of normality is violated. I read somewhere that one can use (monthly ?) bootstrapping and then apply SPCCs. Pretty sure I could program this but I lack the "statistical confidence" to judge whether it is worthwhile. Thanks!
