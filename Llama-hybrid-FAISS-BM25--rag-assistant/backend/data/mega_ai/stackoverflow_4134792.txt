First I thought aWebView didn't receive touch events and therefor it would not scroll. After approaches as [aWebView becomeFirstResponder]; and [aWebView setUserInteractionEnabled:YES]; I realized that aWebView was responsive. It just didn't scroll in iOS 3.1.3. Adding aWebView to a UIScrollView instance, which was added as a subview to the cell's contentView, made the web view scrollable in both, iOS 3.x and iOS 4.x. [aScrollView addSubview:aWebView]; [aScrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(300, 600)]; [myCell.contentView addSubview:aScrollView]; The above code snippet basically does it. Don't forget to set scrollview's content size again, after the webview finished loading content. OS fragmentation is naughty.
