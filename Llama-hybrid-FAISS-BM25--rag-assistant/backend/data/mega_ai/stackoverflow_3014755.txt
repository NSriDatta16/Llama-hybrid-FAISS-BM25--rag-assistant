I can't reproduce your problem. I copied and pasted your configuration snippet into a random pom.xml and running any phase posterior to process-classes triggers emma:emma and the coverage report is generated as expected: $ mvn clean process-classes [INFO] Scanning for projects... [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [INFO] Building Test Project [INFO] task-segment: [clean, process-classes] [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [INFO] [clean:clean {execution: default-clean}] [INFO] Deleting directory /home/pascal/tmp/test-project/target [INFO] [resources:resources {execution: default-resources}] [INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Do you have unit tests in your project? Is the coverage.em file non empty? What happens if you run emma:emma on the command line? Does running mvn with the -X option give you any hint? Can you post some traces that would be helpful? As a side note, I wouldn't run emma:emma as part of the regular build personally. I would either run the emma:emma goal from the command line or configure the plugin and the reporting section as suggested in the Usage page. But that's another story and doesn't answer the question.
