Converting continuous predictors to binary You already have a combination of genes whose expressions on a continuous scale (apparently log-transformed) are associated with outcome. Trying to convert those continuous predictors to binary predictors, as you propose, runs a serious risk of making things worse. This page is a good introduction to the problems introduced by binning continuous predictors. You are throwing away a lot of information by converting to binary indicators of expression.* That might make sense if the distribution of expression levels among patients clearly showed bimodality indicating two expression groups (for example, estrogen-receptor $\alpha$ expression distinguishes ER-positive from ER-negative breast cancer), but then you would choose a cutoff that distinguished those groups, which would not be the median expression unless the 2 groups were of equal size. Selecting predictors The question you ask still applies to selection of continuous predictors.** What you are proposing is known as best-subset selection, extensively discussed on this site for example on this page and computationally feasible when starting with only 7 predictors. Such attempts at automating model selection can be ill-advised, as discussed on this page . At the minimum, you will not be able to use standard p -values and significance testing as you will have used the outcomes to select predictors at several steps of your modeling,*** and predictions are likely to be biased. You will find that the particular set of genes chosen will depend highly on the particular sample of patients you analyze. You can examine that issue with the gene-selection methods you have already used: try repeating your model-building process thus far on multiple bootstrap samples from your dataset. I suspect that you will not always identify the same 7 candidate genes. That is an inherent problem with any variable-selection method when you have many more predictors than cases and does not necessarily pose problems for properly constructed predictive models. This problem should, however, discourage attempts to rely on the mechanistic importance of any particular set of chosen genes. Cox regression issues You also are faced with issues that affect Cox regressions differently from standard linear regressions, as discussed in this answer . First, in Cox regression the power is provided by the number of cases with events (progression or death in your study), not the overall number of cases. The usual rule of thumb for unpenalized Cox regressions is 10-20 events per predictor that you are considering in a model. With only 133 events your 27-predictor model (only about 5 events per predictor) may be overfit substantially, with results unlikely to generalize well. If you try to work with only 30 cases and only half have events, you are unlikely to get beyond 1 or 2 predictors without overfitting. Second, omitting any predictor related to outcome from a Cox regression model leads to biased coefficient estimates for the included variables. If the omitted predictor is uncorrelated with the included predictors the bias tends to be toward lower-magnitude coefficients, so in practice finding the genes most associated with outcome as individual predictors can still provide a useful screening step. If such an omitted predictor is correlated with an included predictor, however, there is no guarantee about the direction of the bias. Third, related to the previous paragraph, is the omission of clinical data from the survival analysis. It's possible that the genes you identify will be proxies for clinical variables like sex or disease stage already known to be related to outcome. That's still interesting, but the interpretation of results would be quite different from a situation in which the gene expression adds to clinical information, as is the case for the Oncotype DX速 and MammaPrint速 gene panels in breast cancer. This issue is critical if patients received different therapies. A gene whose expression is related to outcome following chemoradiation therapy might have no relation to outcome following surgical excision of a tumor. How to proceed Identifying small sets of genes whose expression is related to outcome can readily be done with LASSO . It would select a subset of genes that together are strongly related to outcome while penalizing their regression coefficients to minimize overfitting. The R glmnet package provides tools for analyzing Cox models, including cross-validation to choose the optimum penalty factor (based on partial likelihood deviance in Cox models) and thus the number of genes chosen. LASSO can't avoid the dependence of the gene set chosen on the particular sample at hand, and you still should consider incorporating standard clinical variables into your model, but it provides a principled and well accepted approach to this type of problem. *Note that gene-expression panels for breast cancer prognostication are based on continuous expression measurements. **The gene expression panels noted above involve 3 to 10 times more than your 7 genes, measured by qPCR (21 genes, Oncotype DX速) or microarray (70 genes, MammaPrint速). The groups behind those tests worked hard to identify small yet useful sets of genes. Thus it is unlikely that restricting yourself to even fewer than 7 genes will provide much prognostic information. There are nevertheless important statistical issues that you raise. ***There is some recent work on correcting for variable selection in standard linear regression (see Chapter 6 of Statistical Learning with Sparsity ) but it's not clear to me how well that work applies to Cox regression.
