What is the maximum number of touch events per second I can receive?

When I drag a finger across the screen, there seems to be a limit to how quickly touchesMoved gets called. It seems that the limit is around 50/second. What controls this limit, and is it possible to change this? I'm guessing this is controlled at a very low level and I'm stuck with it, but perhaps not. I'd love to be able to have a higher resolution time-wise for these touch events.
