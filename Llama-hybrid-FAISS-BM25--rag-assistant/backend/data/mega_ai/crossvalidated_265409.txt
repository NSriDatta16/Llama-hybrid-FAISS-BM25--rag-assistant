A nice question! Here is my idea to solve it: Consider you want to compare speeching habits of a person in the episodes 1-3 with her/his habits in the episodes 4-5. For each speech length, compute the average frequency over different episodes in each category. For example, for your table, you get: Length Episodes1-3 | Episodes4-5 1 31.3 | 9 2 42 | 22.5 .... By normalizing each column (dividing each number by the sum of numbers in that column) you will have a probability distribution for each episode group (one for episodes1-3 and one for episodes4-5). Then, to compare two different distributions, you can use standard methods such as the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence .
