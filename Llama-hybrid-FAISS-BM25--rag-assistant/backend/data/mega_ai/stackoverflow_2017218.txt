If the job requires working with HTML and the applicant lists HTML on their resume, then being able to write a simple HTML document is definitely an appropriate question to ask. Even if they will ultimately be working with higher-level tools and scripting languages to generate the HTML, they need to be able to understand and speak HTML in order to do their job well. Your provided solution uses nothing except the , , , and tags. If I was hiring someone, I would sincerely hope that they would be able to use those without having to consult any reference materials. I would equate that (roughly) to someone listing "C/C++" on their resume and being expected to write a short program that uses basic language features like sizeof , memset , or malloc . I would understand if they couldn't pull the exact DOCTYPE line out of thin air or they didn't try to list the pixel dimensions of the image, but the rest of it is the type of material you would learn in high school and is (IMO) perfectly reasonable to expect someone to be able to do if they are claiming to know HTML well. ... but demonstrates that the applicant does not follow directions, ... and does not produce HTML that I'd consider correct If you are hiring an assistant, these are two qualities that the applicant should not have. Expecting perfection would be asking a bit much (they're probably nervous), but not following simple directions (as given by your second code block) to me shows a lack of attention to detail and hints that the applicant is not the type of person who takes pride in their work. The lack of consistency with indenting and capitalization makes the writer appear unorganized.
