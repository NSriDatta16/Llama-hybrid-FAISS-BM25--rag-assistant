These questions are perfectly suited to Hierarchical Generalized Additive Models (HGAMs). The canonical reference for these types of models is Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R, Second Edition , by Simon Wood (maintainer of the mgcv package in R). However there is also a very useful and detailed 'tutorial' paper that gives examples of how these models can be set up, written by Pedersen et al: Hierarchical generalized additive models in ecology: an introduction with mgcv . In short, once you have narrowed down on an appropriate observation likelihood (you haven't specified how these metabolite observations are distributed), you can use the mgcv package in R to test different hypotheses you might have about how these observations vary over seasons and across participants. An example model may be: gam(y ~ s(month) + s(month, participant, bs = 'fs'), family = ..., data = ...) . This sort of setup allows you to use partial pooling to learn nonlinear relationships between your response variable $y$ (metabolite measurements) and $month$ (included as an variable of class integer ), where each participant's nonlinear smooth function of $month$ is regularized toward a shared (i.e. global ) smooth function of $month$ . This model also incorporates hierarchical ( random ) intercerpts to capture variation in average measurements per participant. If you fit such a model and carry out the usual residual diagnostics, you may find that there is still unmodelled temporal autocorrelation left (particularly if you look at residuals per participant . This autocorrelation can be accomodated in various ways in the mgcv universe, and you can look on this site in particular to find useful guidance (search for autocorrelation mgcv to get started). As for your question about what effects to include, it seems that because your participants submitted samples once per month, both $month$ and $time$ are the same thing here (unless I'm misreading). If you had samples from more than one year, then you would need to make this distinction more clearly. But for now I don't think that is necessary.
