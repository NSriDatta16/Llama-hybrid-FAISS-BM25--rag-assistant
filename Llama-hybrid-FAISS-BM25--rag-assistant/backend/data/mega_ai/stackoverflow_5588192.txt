Spring @Transactional: Rollback information reported but not actually performed

I have annotated my test classes as follows: @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations={"file:WebContent/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml", "file:WebContent/WEB-INF/context-aspects.xml"}) @Transactional public class MyTest { } However, when executing tests, the test database is suddenly filled with values, although @Transactional is enabled and I can read the following in the log: INFO: Began transaction (4): transaction manager [org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager@669aa3f3]; rollback [true] 07.04.2011 23:57:33 org.springframework.test.context.transaction.TransactionalTestExecutionListener endTransaction INFO: Rolled back transaction after test execution for test context ... Any ideas why the actual rollback after the test case is not performed? Update: If I am using HSQLDB, I don't have these problems - so is it a problem of mysql?
