I think there is a confusion between classification (i.e: finding the probability of being in a certain class) and regression (i.e: finding a continuous value as a prediction). For classification, one should use Gini index or cross-entropy. It builds a split by measuring the impurity in the created leaves. For regression, one could use mean squared error. This cost function builds a split by taking the average value of the response in the leaves and comparing it to the individuals that fall into each leaf.
