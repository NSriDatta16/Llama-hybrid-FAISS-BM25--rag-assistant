Hypothesis testing for proportions

In a contact center, the agents reach out to advertisers to offer digital marketing solutions. There are two ways to reach the customer - 1 is cold calling and the second is a scheduled call (resulting from a cold call). I want to test the hypothesis if one of the channels is better than the other in terms of conversion rate. I have daily conversion rate percentage for the last 3 months. which test should I apply? I think z-test for 2 proportions...but do I apply it on the aggregate for the last 3 months or on monthly conversion rate?
