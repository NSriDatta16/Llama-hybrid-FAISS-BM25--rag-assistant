The page most likely uses Ajax to dynamically load content. The content to load is identified by the fragment identifier , which becomes more common practice with Ajax: With the rise of AJAX, some websites use fragment identifiers to emulate the back button behavior of browsers for page changes that do not require a reload, or to emulate subpages. (For example, GMail uses a single URL for almost every interface – mail boxes, individual mails, search results, settings – the fragment is used to make these interfaces directly linkable.)
