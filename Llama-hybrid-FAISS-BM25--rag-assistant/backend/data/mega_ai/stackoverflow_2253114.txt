setBounds only work for containers that have their layout set to null . (Or for moving frames around on the desktop.) JPanel 's default layout manager is FlowLayout which lays out components in order horizontally, and dropping to a new row when the current is full (like text in a page). Using a null layout and setBounds isn't a recommended way to lay out GUIs - it's very fragile - too much depends on the size of the container / frame and the size, resolution and font settings of the desktop can easily break the layout. Read through the Using Layout Managers section of the Swing tutorial to figure out what layout managers can help you accomplish what you want.
