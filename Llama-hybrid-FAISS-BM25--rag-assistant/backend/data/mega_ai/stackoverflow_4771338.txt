Retrieving URL data when Content-Range is sent in PHP

There's many options available for downloading a URL in PHP - but I'm stuck. I've looked through all the ones I know, but none seem to pay attention to partial content headers. I'm trying to retrieve a URL that gives the following header: HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content Content-Range: bytes 0-100000/631723 As you can see it dishes out the file in 100,000 byte chunks. Trouble is, when I use any method in PHP, ie file_get_contents, fopen, or even cURL, none of these continue on after receiving the first 100,000 bytes. End result, I have a 100,000 byte file. What I need is to get the PHP script to grab all the data, in the example above, all 631,723 bytes. How can I do this?
