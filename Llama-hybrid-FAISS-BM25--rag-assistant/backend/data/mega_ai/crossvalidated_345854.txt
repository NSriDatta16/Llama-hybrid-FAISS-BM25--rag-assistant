As pointed out in comments, this is a standard example. The conjugate prior is a gamma distribution on $\theta > 0$, this is given as example on p46 og Gelman et.al.: "Bayesian Data Analysis" (Third edition). You can also find in the table at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior and a lot of other places.
