I am skeptical that such a general kalman filter exists. To derive the classical kalman filter relies heavily on the (closed) formulas for the posterior of the gaussian distribution and the fact that the normal is a conjugate prior for itself. Gamma also has this property so perhaps you can derive a kalman filter for gamma errors, too. That doesn't mean you can't implement a non-gaussian kalman filter. You can do it using MCMC software such as Stan. But without closed formulas you won't be able to integrate out the latent states so you'll need to explicitly estimate many more parameters ( $X_t$ in your notation). It will be many orders of magnitude (computationally-- not necessarily statistically) less efficient.
