How does d-prime calculation relate to binomial mixed models with probit link?

for a study I tested participants in a same-different task (1AFC) about melodies. There were 3 versions of each melody (within-subjects factor "version"). So d-prime seems the natural response/dependent variable. I found a solution by user Mike Lawrence that seems quite elegant: How do I compare d-prime scores for 2 different conditions for the same individual? fit = glm( data = my_data, formula = response ~ reality*condition, family = binomial) So in my case I could do the model: response ~reality * version + (1|participant) + (1|melody) Below in the comments user Mike Lawrence states that with a probit link the estimates for the interactions with reality become d-prime units. I don't quite understand why this is the case and how this relates to the transformation that traditionally is done to calculate the d-prime. What I don't understand is: How is it that the coefficients for the interaction reality * version (but not those for the main effect of reality) represent differences in d-primes? The model takes not only hit rate and false alarm-rate, but by the effect of reality on response all four possibilities (hit, miss, false alarms, correct rejections), doesn't it? Interpretation of the model: If the interaction reality * version corresponds to differences in d-prime, would that mean I basically don't care about the reference category in the factor reality but treat the interaction as if it would be a main effect of version? That is I only look at the reference category of version (say version1) and could then interpret an estimate of 0.3 for reality*version(2) as an increase of sensitivity (d-prime) by 0.3 z-scores? And if I wanted to estimate the bias (c) where would that be represented in the model then? Please excuse if my questions are confusing. Thank you for your help!
