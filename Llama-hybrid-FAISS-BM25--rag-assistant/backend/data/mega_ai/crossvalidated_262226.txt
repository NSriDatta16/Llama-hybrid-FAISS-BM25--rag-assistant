Proving that the product of 2 samples, when sorted in order, converges to the variance of the population

I have a question regarding the average value of the pairwise product of 2 ordered samples that are drawn from a random variable, $X$, which in this case is zero-mean Gaussian ($X \sim N(0,\sigma_x) $). Let $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$ be $n$ samples drawn from the random variable $X$. Let us put these samples in ascending order, and call the result: $x_{(1)}, x_{(2)}, ... x_{(n)}$. Let's go ahead and do the same for a second sample of $n$ elements drawn from $X$. We'll call these $x'_{(1)}, x'_{(2)}, ... x'_{(n)}$ (So the two sets of samples are each, separately, in ascending order) Empirically, I've noticed that: $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n x_{(i)}x'_{(i)} \rightarrow \sigma_x^2$$ I'm trying to prove this result. Does anyone have any suggestions? I've been looking at the literature for order statistics, but I can't seem to come up with an airtight proof. (Note that if I hadn't sorted them in order, the pairwise product between the two samples would obviously converge to zero, since $X$ is zero-mean: $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n x_{i}x'_{i} \rightarrow 0$) (I asked this question math exchange, but I think it is more suited to this stackexchange).
