You don't have to treat the variance structures like you would treat random effects in a non- gls model. With random effects you usually assume that they have zero mean, hence you include the corresponding fixed effect covariate to ensure this zero mean. Working with variances, all you want to achieve is predicting the heteroscedasticity as well a possible, so there's no problem in including a variable in the variance prediction that is not part of your fixed effects structure. However, you should keep an eye on other information criteria like the Bayesian/Schwarz information criterion. They punish the addition of parameters more than the AIC does and hence prevent you from overfitting.
