Is there some sort of assumption in R that the inputs in time-series modelling are arranged in a traditional chronological order, such that the first observation should be the oldest one? I think there is. Some classes such as ts have time series attributes making time indexing explicit, but if you use a simple vector, time series function in R will usually assume its first observation is the oldest one. Is there any way to tell the garch function that the data is arranged in reverse chronological order? I do not think you should attempt making the garch function deal with a reverse-ordered time series; rather, reverse it yourself before inputing into the function. For a vector x , you can use rev to reverse the order: rev(x) .
