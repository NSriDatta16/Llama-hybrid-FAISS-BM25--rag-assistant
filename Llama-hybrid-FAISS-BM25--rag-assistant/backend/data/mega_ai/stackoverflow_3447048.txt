Put files automatically in /scripts folder in Visual Studio 2005

I set up a bunch of filters in my project to help find files. But all my source code files actually just go in two folders, source/headers... the filters are just for Visual Studio organization but I wanted to keep the directory structure simple for building in other compilers. Anyway, whenever I add a new item or class, the files go in my /scripts folder and I have to move them. Is there a project-specific way to change this, I'm sick of having to do it!?
