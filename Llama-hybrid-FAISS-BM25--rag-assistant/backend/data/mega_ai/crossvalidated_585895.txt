I think I understand the distinction now. The issue is how many data points you would have for a random effects model with crossed effects. For the subject level data point, there would only be one per person, effectively meaning one X score but multiple Y scores. For item it would be the same. I tried simulating this idea with a very small dataset to illustrate for myself what this meant, using just the subject level factor of IQ and the outcome of reading the words. set.seed(123) subject Grouping the points by subject yields no logistic regression lines, as each subject has only one measure of IQ. df2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=iq, y=word.read, color=as.factor(subject)))+ geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method="glm", se=F, method.args = list(family=binomial)) Grouping them by item, however, gives per item logistic regression fits, as there are multiple points for each X and Y per item. df2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=iq, y=word.read, color=as.factor(item)))+ geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method="glm", se=F, method.args = list(family=binomial))
