Sequence-to-Sequence Transformer for Neural machine translation

I am using the tutorial in Keras documentation here . I am new to deep learning. On a different dataset Menyo-20k dataset , of about 10071 total pairs, 7051 training pairs,1510 validation pairs,1510 test pairs. The highest validation accuracy and test accuracy I have gotten is approximately 0.26. I tried the list of things below: Using the following optimizers: SGD, Adam, RMSprop Tried different learning rate Tried the dropout rate of 0.4 and 0.1 Tried using different embedding dimensions and feed-forward network dimension Used Early stopping and patience =3 , the model does not go past the 13th epoch . I tried the model itself without changing any parameters, the validation accuracy never got to 0.3 , I tried to change the different parameters in order to know what I am doing wrong and I can't figure it out. Please what am I doing wrong? Thank you in advance for your guidance.
