Put the native in the root of a signed Jar file and add it to a nativelib element in the JNLP. Since it is a DLL, make sure you add it to a Windows specific resources section. Do you have natives for Mac. and *nix? E.G. Our App. our.com In this example, all resources should be located in http://our.com/lib/ . The native (in this case a DLL) should always be in the root of the Jar file. I also offer JaNeLA which checks the validaty of JNLP files & performs sanity checks on many other aspects of JWS based launches.
