Finally, I have resolved it. Follow the guidelines on the gSoap's page. Add the following files to your project: generated *.cpp, *.h, *.nsmap, service definition file - the name of which you type on command line e.g. calc.h in the guideline - and stdsoap2.h/cpp files in the gsoap directory of the downloaded zip file. After including proxy file -e.g. soapcalcProxy.h - and *.nsmap to your main file there remains one thing that I forgot to realize before: add LIBS += C:\MinGW\lib\libws2_32.a to your *.pro file. libws32_a is the current version of the deprecated libwsock32.a file.
