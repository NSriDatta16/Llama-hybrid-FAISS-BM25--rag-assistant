In order to load a file into mysql, you'll want to use the LOAD DATA INFILE mysql command. You want to be careful about what you load into though. A lot of the time, you'll need to specify the columns if your table isn't organized the same way as your text file. To elaborate on ChrisR's answer: LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE test FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' (id, code, name); This would work if your column names were id, code, and name for the three columns you specified. This would allow you to import the file even if the table were laid out with columns: +------+------+----+ | name | code | id | +------+------+----+
