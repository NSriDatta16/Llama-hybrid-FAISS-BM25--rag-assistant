Help interpreting logistic regression

I'm new to R and logistic regression and have to admit that I don't really know how to interpret the result. I'm trying to compute a pretty simple model with 2 predictors (A and B). When I first try to compute models with the predictors one by one they are both significant. When I put them together and add an interaction term they lose their significance (but the interaction term is weakly significant). I interpret this as A and B are overlapping and no longer significant when the oter parameter is hold constant. Right? But now to the part I don't know how to interpret. I make predictions from my models (see code below) and then run t-tests for the predictions vs. the depending variable. I think this should give a hint on how good the model is (is there a better way?). When I do it this way I get a much lower p-value for the model with both A and B. I think this is contradictory. The first part tells me that A doesn't provide any significant information to the model when combined with B, but on the other hand I get much better predictions. I guess something is really wrong, but I can't figure out what. Can you help me? model1=glm(f~A, , family=binomial(link="logit")) model2=glm(f~B, family=binomial(link="logit")) model3=glm(f~A*B, family=binomial(link="logit")) summary(model1) summary(model2) summary(model3) p1=predict(model1, newdata=data, type="response", na.rm=TRUE) p2=predict(model2, newdata=data, type="response", na.rm=TRUE) p3=predict(model3, newdata=data, type="response", na.rm=TRUE) t.test(p1~f) t.test(p2~f) t.test(p3~f) Part of the output: > summary(model1) Estimate Std.
