Java Swing - Problem in JSpinner

I am developing a Java Desktop Application and designing the GUI with the help of Netbeans Swing GUI builder. I want to use a JSpinner in my app. I have dragged and dropped it to a JPanel . Now, I want to set its two properties: First, It should display numbers in the range of 1 to 50. Neither less than 1 nor greater than 50. How can I set that range? Second, when I try to get the value of it by spinner.getValue() it returns an Object . As my spinner's data type is Integer, would it be better to downcast the Object into Integer or Is there any other way to get that numeric value?
