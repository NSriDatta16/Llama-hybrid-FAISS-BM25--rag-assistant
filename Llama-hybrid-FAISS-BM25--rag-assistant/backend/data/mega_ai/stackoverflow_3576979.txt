If you can see logical parts of your script, you should definitely abstract them into functions. Having a single script of over 1000 lines, and not breaking it up into whatever abstraction units your language provides (functions, classes, etc.) is a very bad idea. Maintaining your script, i. e. adding features and fixing bugs, will be a nightmare. I strongly suggest you read the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. It uses Java for examples, but the ideas are applicable to any language. The one that is most relevant here is "Make your functions small. Then make them smaller."
