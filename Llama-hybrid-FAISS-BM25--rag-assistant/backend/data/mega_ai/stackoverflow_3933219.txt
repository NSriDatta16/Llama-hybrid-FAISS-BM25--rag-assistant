I don't know of a stand-alone visualization tool, but Hudson can graph your test and coverage results. If there's a failure, it will list the problems on a web page with hyperlinks to each individual test result. This blog post explains the setup: http://heisel.org/blog/2009/11/21/django-hudson/ . There's a screenshot at the bottom that shows what's possible. It's geared toward django, but the idea is applicable to any python app. A continuous integration server gives you many benefits beyond just graphing your test results. Hudson can automatically checkout your code after a subversion commit, run all your tests, email you if there's a failure, etc.. http://hudson-ci.org/
