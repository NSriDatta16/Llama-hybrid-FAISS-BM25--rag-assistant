Ordinal data cannot be normal. OLS regression does not assume that the variables are normally distributed (it makes assumptions about the errors) but it does assume that teh dependent variable is continuous. When your dependent variable is ordinal, you should not do regular regression, you should do ordinal logistic regression (at least, that's a good starting place).
