Help with derivation of Mean Field Variational Inference

I am studying Variational Inference using Bishop's book: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. At the moment, I am struggling to understand the Lower Bound derivation for the Mean-Field Variational inference at page 465, equation 10.6. Surely I am missing some basic algebraic detail.. but, I can't for the moment see how this $\int \prod_{i}q_{i}\{\ln{p(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{Z})}\}d\boldsymbol{Z}$ turns into $\int q_{j}\{ \int \ln{p(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{Z})} \prod_{i \neq j} q_{i}\,d \boldsymbol{Z_{i}}\} \, d\boldsymbol{Z_{j}}$. From where does the extra integral come from? I have some ideas, but I am not sure of those. So, I want to read some intuitive explanation (with math as well) on the subject. Additionally, can someone gently expose the complete algebraic derivation of equation 10.6 including showing the constant values?
