All machine learning is about minimizing cost of some model. The most elementary thing when you try to find minimum value is ability to compare two values. You can do it only with scalar values. For example, given two vectors [0,2], [2,2] how would you compare those tuples? You have to define some norm function. Euclidean, max, Manhattan, or your own fancy one. Whatever you use it must output scalar values.
