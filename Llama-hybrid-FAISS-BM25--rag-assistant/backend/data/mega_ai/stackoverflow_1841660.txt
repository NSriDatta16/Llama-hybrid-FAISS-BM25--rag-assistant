I have used JQuery Datepicker and some of the other UI modules along with using JQuery for the most parts of my project. It is completely customizable, which makes it easy to modify according to your convenience. Basically jQuery is light weight and is also programmer friendly to write scripts in an elegant way. I tweaked more on the styling part rather than on functionality to achieve the desired look and feel. I didn't find anything negative about it till now, may be in future when I use some more of JQuery UI modules Thanks
