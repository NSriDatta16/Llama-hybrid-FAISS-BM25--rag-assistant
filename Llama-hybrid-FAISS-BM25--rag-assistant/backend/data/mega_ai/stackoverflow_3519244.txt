Emacs command to indent code by 4 spaces to format for paste into stackoverflow posts

There has got to be a better way to indent a block of code for stackoverflow posts using Emacs. My current strategy is to: Select a text region execute M-x indent-code-rigidly run C-x z three times to reindent the region This seems brain-dead. Please enlighten me as to how to make this happen in a clever and elegant manner.
