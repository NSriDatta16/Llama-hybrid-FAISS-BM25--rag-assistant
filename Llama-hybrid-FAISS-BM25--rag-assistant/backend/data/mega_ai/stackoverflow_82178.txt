It is the protocol running over tcp that defines the uniqueness of the payload, not the tcp protocol itself. For example, you might naively think that HTTP requests would all be identical when asking for a server's home page, but the referrer and user agent strings make the payloads different. Similarly, if the response is dynamically generated, it may have a date header: Date: Fri, 12 Sep 2008 10:44:27 GMT So that will render the response payloads different. However, subsequent payloads may be identical, if the content is static. Keep in mind that the actual packets will be different because of differing sequence numbers, which are supposed to be incrementing and pseudorandom.
