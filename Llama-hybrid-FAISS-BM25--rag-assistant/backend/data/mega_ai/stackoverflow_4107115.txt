Sharepoint Calendar: Block a Day Off

Does anyone know of a way to prevent access to, or highlight, a specific day in a Sharepoint calendar? The intent is to show which day(s) are not available for a given task. I have already fashioned a Workflow that would email a user, but it needs to be visual as well - people need to see at a glance what days are avaiable. Any have any ideas? I'm running on SBS 2008 with WSS 3.0 .. I also have Sharepoint Designer 2007 installed, if it can be leveraged.
