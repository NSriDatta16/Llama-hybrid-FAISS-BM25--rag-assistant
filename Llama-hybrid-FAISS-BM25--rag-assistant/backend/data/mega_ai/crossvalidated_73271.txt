Most probably the packages lmerTest and lsmeans provide readily available routines for what you are looking for. Mind you, neither of them uses MCMC methodology. If you want to use something resampling-based , you can use lme4 's native bootMer() function to bootstrap your model and get parametric bootstrap estimates (ver. 1.0-4 or newer).
