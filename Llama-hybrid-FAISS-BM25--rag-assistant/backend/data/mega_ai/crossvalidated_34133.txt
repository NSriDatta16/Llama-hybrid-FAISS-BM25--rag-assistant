I think the main reason is that many financial time series exhibit high volatility and the standard ARIMA models do not fit well to data with high volatility. So special time series models that account for this are important to generate better predictions. The ARIMA models are well established while time series models such as GARCH that model volatility are newer and more open for extensions and theoretical development. These are reasons why this topic would be appealing to academics.
