I'd like to add to joeslice's comment above, another advantage of going with Mercurial (on Bitbucket, say) will be having easy access to clients on Windows/Unix/Mac. Go with different repositories if they don't have dependencies. Mercurial is pretty much init and run, but that's true for all DVCS I think. This also means that you don't have to worry too much about how to organize things perfectly but can instead just hg init in any directory before you start working there. PS: I'd have left this as a comment to the post , but apparently I am not allowed to comment yet.
