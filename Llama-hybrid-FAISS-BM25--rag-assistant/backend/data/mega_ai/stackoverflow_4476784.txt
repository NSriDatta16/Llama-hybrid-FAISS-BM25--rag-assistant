Warning - as I'm sure you know, don't start a project with Magento unless you are willing to put a lot of time into it. That said, to my knowledge the Multistore setup allows one to run multiple stores with the same administration section. You should be able to create multiple admin users - but restricting them to a store isn't available in normal old community edition. It might be available in one of the pay editions. That said, this extension may do the trick for you: http://www.aitoc.com/en/magentomods_advanced_permissions.html . Note: I've never personally tried this extension and so cannot vouch for it. Edit I realized that I never answered your second question. Though Magento is a very powerful platform with a lot of features, I would not recommend using it for a small hosted ecommerce application. For a small hosted ecommerce store I would consider running Wordpress with the WP-E-Commerce plugin. Wordpress is great for managing website content - and WP-E-Commerce has a lot of features and is consistently being developed and improved upon. If you are going to go with Magento then I would reccomend using Nexcess hosting . They specialize in hosting Magento and their Magento plans are already optimized for running Magento websites.
