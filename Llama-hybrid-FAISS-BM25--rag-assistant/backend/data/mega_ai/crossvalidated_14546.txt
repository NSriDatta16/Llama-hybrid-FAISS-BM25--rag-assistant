How to interpret regression coefficients in logistic regression?

I have run the following logistic regression: glm(formula = DecisionasReceiver ~ L1 + L2 + L3, family = binomial("logit"), data = lue) where L1 L2 and L3 code for differences in condition of no.GREEN. L1: 1,-1,0,0 : is there a difference in DecisionasReceiver as no.GREEN changes from 1 to 2? L2: 0,1,-1,0: is there a difference in DecisionasReceiver as no.GREEN changes from 2 to 3? L2: 0,0,1,-1: is there a difference in DecisionasReceiver as no.GREEN changes from 3 to 4? And I'm running this regression both for the cases where MessageReceived is BLUE and for MessageReceived RED. I have the following output: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.9535 0.3659 -2.606 0.00916 ** L1 2.2753 0.5406 4.209 2.56e-05 *** L2 3.1234 0.7318 4.268 1.97e-05 *** L3 1.9369 0.8134 2.381 0.01726 * Looking at my graph it seems strange that the coefficients are positive and that the intercept is -0.953. How exactly should I interpret these results in the light of the graph? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22681355/graph.png
