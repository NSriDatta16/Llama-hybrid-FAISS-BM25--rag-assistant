You have a time series, as you also indicate by contrasting your SVM to ARIMA. There are a number of common accuracy measures for time series forecasts, including the rmse or the mae .

Here is the section on "Evaluating forecast accuracy" from the excellent free online textbook Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman .
