Ideas on building in automation in an application

I am working on a .NET internal test tool at the moment. The tool is GUI based at the moment. One of the things I want the tool to be able to do is to run in command line mode. This way we can run it in an automated fashion and have it crunch on some data every day. We started to put in a Command line mode in it but I am just not happy with it. It feels clumsy-ish and just tacked on. I am looking for a more elegant solution that will scale relatively easily as we provide more functionality to the app. One of the thoughts I had is modeled after PowerShell and Exchange Server. Exchange server apparently built some 800 cmdlets and then used them to build their UI on top of. This way everything their UI can do, you can do via a script using those cmdlets. I really like that to be honest. It's elegant and scales naturally as they add more functionality. What ideas do you guys have for something like this? Anyone out there tried the PowerShell route I mentioned? Share your thoughts. Thanks
