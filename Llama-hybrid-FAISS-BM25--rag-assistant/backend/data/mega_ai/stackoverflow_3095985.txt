Most compact and fastest way to store my string in PostgreSQL

I have a large hexidecimal (16 byte, 32 hex digits) data item that always has the format: 00d980113901429fa6de7fb7e2da705a This is coming in as an ASCII string from my source (i.e., the zero above is character zero 0x30, not 0x00), and I would like to know peoples' opinions on the best way (irt storage and speed) to store this in PostgreSQL. The obvious thing to do is to just store it as a varchar, but storing it in a binary form would definitely save space. Would I see performance gains from select and insert by storing it in a binary form? Would bytea or bit be better? Is there a difference between these two in terms of internal representation? Another idea would be to store it as two bigint/int8 or four integer/int4, split up into multiple columns. Space and time are an issue as I have MANY of these (upwards of a trillion).
