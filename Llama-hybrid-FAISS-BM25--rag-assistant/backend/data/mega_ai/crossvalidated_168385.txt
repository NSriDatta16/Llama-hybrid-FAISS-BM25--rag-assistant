Verbeek (2012). A Guide to Modern Econometrics. Wiley . The practical examples that come with the book are suited for finance/economics, but there are derivations of most statistical theory that is used within this field, such as regression analysis, logistic regression, panel regression, etc. I would not say it constitutes as an undergraduate book, though. You have to be fairly skilled at mathematics to understand this book as it assumes you have some basic prior knowledge about statistics. But I assume you have this as you are interested in the derivations of the theory.
