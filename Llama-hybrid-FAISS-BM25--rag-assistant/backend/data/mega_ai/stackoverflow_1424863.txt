I agree with ChssPly76 wrt manual String manipulation. However, if you are going to go down the BigDecimal / DecimalFormat route, you might want to consider sharing your DecimalFormat s instead of creating a new one with every iteration. Note that these classes are not thread-safe, so if you are using multiple threads to do your processing, you will want to use something like ThreadLocal storage to maintain a formatter per Thread . btw, have you tested this and found the performance not acceptable or are you just looking for the most efficient solution possible? Note what Donald Knuth says on the topic of early optimization .
