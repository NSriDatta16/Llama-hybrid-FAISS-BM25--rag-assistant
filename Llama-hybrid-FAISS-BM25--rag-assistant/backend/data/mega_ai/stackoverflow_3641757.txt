NDepend is a .NET static analyzer that comes with a complete NDepend.API to write your own static analyzer. NDepend.API overview NDepend.API introduction NDepend.API getting started Disclaimer: I am one of the developer of the tool NDepend.API is LINQ friendly. More than 200 code rules are proposed. They are based on LINQ queries over NDepend.API, what we call CQLinq . These code rules cover a wide range of needs (API, evolution/diff, naming, architecture/design, code metric/quality, dead code, code coverage, OOP...) You can adapt them to your own needs and create your own ones. 14 Power Tools open source base on NDepend.API are proposed. Power Tools are actually custom static analyzers . Here also you can adapt them or create your own ones. If you download the NDepend bits, the code source of these Power Tools is in the VisualStudio solution: $NDependInstallPath$\NDepend.PowerTools.SourceCode\NDepend.PowerTools.sln
