While I don't know the modern .NET answer to your question, it's worth noting the historical reason for these bitmaps with magenta backgrounds: Back in the Win32-only days, there were some Common Controls (like the Toolbar, and ListView) that took these bitmaps and a colour to be treated as transparent, and then rendered that colour as transparent. I imagine that, behind the scenes, they used functions like TransparentBtl .
