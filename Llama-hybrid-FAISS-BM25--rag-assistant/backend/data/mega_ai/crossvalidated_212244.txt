With respect to your questions: For the very similar Bayesian problem of Dirichlet Process mixture of gaussians, I understand the answer is yes. Ghosal (2013) . When I attended some talks on this topic, it seemed progress had mainly been made using KL divergence. See Harry van Zanten's slides . I'm not clear. However, this looks like a source separation problem ($P_N, P_S$ unkown). These are generally much more difficult than mixture modelling alone. In particular for the simple case of $P_N = P_S = N(0,1)$ you wouldn't be able to identify the true $X$ and $Y$ due to symmetry of the distributions about zero. See the fourth of the slides linked above, there's a list of Bayesian models for which convergence guarantees hold.
