Moving from Groovy to Java

In my grails project I'm moving all calculations to java classes. Here is the link to source code (i've saved it in Google Docs). Main purpose is to format current time into string(in two languages). Examples: 1 day 2 hours 3 seconds 1 день 2 часа 3 секунды But i have one method: private static boolean endsWith(final long num, final long part) { if (num / 10 It checks if 'num' ends with 'part'. Examples: assert endsWith(128, 1) == false assert endsWith(1, 1) == true assert endsWith(34, 4) == true P.S. num - is standard long (java.lang.Long) value and part - is greater than 0 and less or equals than 9 (1..9). But this code works fine only in groovy classes. In java class i got those results: endsWith(7, 7) == true endsWith(23, 3) == false endsWith(23, 1) == true As i can see from gant log - all code are compiled by groovyc . P.S.2 I'l compile this code with groovyc and javac to compare results. Because if i haven't make any mistake it could be a bug in groovyc . But this is my mistake i hope :)
