This is a typical application of linear mixed models (LMM). For each organism, you could consider applying an LMM with a random intercept for each individual plus the usual error term. In this way, you are decomposing the overall variability in two components, where one of them is due to the variability of the users. Assuming mydata is the dataset for a single organism, in R you could do something like this mylme here resp is the response and user is the user id. Note: you can't estimate variability for the batch material since you don't have replication within each batch material.
