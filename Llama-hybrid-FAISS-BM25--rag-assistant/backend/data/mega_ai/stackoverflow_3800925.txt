Python 2D image generation

What are some of the better libraries for image generation in Python? If I were to implement a GOTCHA (for example's sake), thereby having to manipulate an image on the pixel level, what would my options be? Ideally I would like to save resulting image as a low-resolution jpeg, but this is mere wishing, I'll settle for any common image format. Thank you for your attention.
