Are you creating a bridge between the other web site and your users? The other website has published it's API and you have no choice if that is RESTful or not. You are forced to consume there web services as they are. You can consume those (possibly non-RESTful) services and then expose RESTful services to your clients. If you are asking are RESTful services good...that is a design dependent decision. Some will say that is how the web was meant to be and yes you should absolutely expose RESTful services. Most will be a bit more pragmatic and will say it depends. Can you provide any more information?
