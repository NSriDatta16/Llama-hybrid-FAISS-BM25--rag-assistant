jQuery hierarchy issue with next()

Seems like $("img").next().hide(); is not working when both the image and div tag are a child of a paragraph. text // this div is set to 'display: none' by default in css Yet, if I substitute with text or if I omit the tags text the jQuery selector does work properly. Any ideas why this is the case? Is it related to inline and block display? How can I make it work as described in the top code example? This is the jQuery code I am using: $(document).ready(function(){ $("img").hover( function() { $(this).next().show(); }, function() { $(this).next().hide(); } ); }); Thanks for your help!
