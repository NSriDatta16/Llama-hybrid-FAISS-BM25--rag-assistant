error: no include path in which to search for stdio.h

I used to be able to compile C programs, but now I can't: $ cat helloworld.c #include int main(void) { printf("Hello, world!\n"); return 0; } $ gcc helloworld.c helloworld.c:1:19: error: no include path in which to search for stdio.h Yes, I do have /usr/include/stdio.h . Yes, build-essentials is installed. This problem began after I modified my ~/.bashrc to run a program installed in my user directory. I know this is what's wrong because if I remove ~/.bashrc , it works. What environment variable would be shadowing /usr/include as an include path?
