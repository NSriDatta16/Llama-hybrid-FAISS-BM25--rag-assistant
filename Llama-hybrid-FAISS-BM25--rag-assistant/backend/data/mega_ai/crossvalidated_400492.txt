Are median values numeric or ordinal?

I'm trying to set up the input data that I'd feed into my DL model and for the simplicity, I'm thinking of plugging in only the min/max/average values of the original data. (This is necessary for my purpose) But my coworker told me that I'd be better to plug the median value of the original data, which I think is a little bit doubtful as it doesn't seem like an ordinary numeric data. I thought it's more like an ordinal data (where the rank matters), but I'm not quite sure about it. Is there any consensus about how the median value should be deemed as?
