There are some details you've left out, and I am not sure what sort of answer you are looking for, but here goes... Assuming you are performing something along the lines of a t-test, you are not looking for the probability of "mu = 25," but instead answering the question "is it reasonable to conclude that mu is some number other than (!=) 25?" So the idea that mu equals exactly 25 is not problematic in the sense that you were referring to in your question. If you conduct the test, you will either conclude that you can reject the null assumption as unreasonable or not, or you will calculate a p-value which answers a different, conditional, question ("what is the probability of seeing data as extreme as mine, in terms of its sample mean, if the data actually came from a distribution centered at 25?") which will allow you to draw a similar conclusion regarding the reasonableness of the assumed mu. If you are asking the different question: "what is the true mean of this (given) data?" then you could build a confidence interval. There your concerns would be a consideration and handled in the interval's construction. In classical/frequentist statistics, parameters like mu are treated as fixed, exact numbers; so asking "what is the probability of mu being 25?" is a sort of "nonsense" question in that philosophical context. A Bayesian approach would allow you to formulate the question in that way, but given the context of the question I don't think that is what you are working on. In that approach, there are ways to fix up a tiny interval around mu to get a probability. You sound as though you are coming to an introductory stats book with a little extra background in probability already under your belt. Sometimes that makes the overly simple books harder to follow.
