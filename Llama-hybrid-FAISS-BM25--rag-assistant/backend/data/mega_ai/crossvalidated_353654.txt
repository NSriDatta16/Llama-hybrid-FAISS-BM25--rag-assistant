Interpreting coefficients in logistic regression after standardizing independent variables

I am working with a dataset where the continuous independent variables are on different scales and I plan on standardizing them before running a binary logistic regression. However, I am not sure on how to explain the co-efficients from the model after standardizing the variables. For example, without standardizing my variables I get Exp(B) value of 1.111 for Average Rate of Return (independent variable) and I would explain it as -> For every one percent increase in average rate of return, the odds of being Retirement Ready (dependent variable) is higher by 11%. How do i interpret the model output in a similar format after using standardized variables?
