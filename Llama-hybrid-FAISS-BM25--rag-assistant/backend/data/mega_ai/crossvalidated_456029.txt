Right way to perform Log transformation without data leakage

i am transforming my data like this import numpy as np X_train = np.log(X_train) X_test = np.log(X_test) but someone told me that this wrong way to do that, you should save the mean of train set & then perform it on test_set. I tried this but my result is same as if directly Log-tranform my dataset from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer transformer = FunctionTransformer(np.log1p) transformer.fit(train_x) train_x_scaled = transformer.fit_transform(train_x) test_x_scaled = transformer.fit_transform(test_x) What is the correct way to do this task? My dataset is skewed on 1 side. Therefore i am performing Log-Transformation.
