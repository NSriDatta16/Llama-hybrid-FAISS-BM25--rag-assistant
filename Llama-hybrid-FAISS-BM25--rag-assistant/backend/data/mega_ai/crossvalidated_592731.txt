How to interpret the predicted probabilities of a logistic regression model

I ran a logistic regression model in R and then wanted to calculate the predicted probability for my two independent variables. My dependent variable (DV) is binary (0,1). I used the effects package to calculate them. Here's the predicted probabilities: I am not sure how to interpret these figures since they do not provide all the information. For instance, I don't know what is the predicted probability of my dependent variable when my first IV is 0? Is it negative or it is near 0? I understand that my DV is binary but I am not sure if it automatically is turned into a linear prediction because the starting point of the predicted probability line is way below 0.01. The same goes for my second IV. I also don't understand the distance between predicted probabilities on the y-axis. Why the distance between 0.01 to 0.02 is different from the distance between 0.02 to 0.03?
