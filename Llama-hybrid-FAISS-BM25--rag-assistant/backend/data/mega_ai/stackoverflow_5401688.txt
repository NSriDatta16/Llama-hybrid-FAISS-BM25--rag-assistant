I got where the problem was. The solution is at this link http://samsami2u.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/add-categories-with-images-on-homepage-magento/ and I was trying to add this line {{block type="catalog/navigation" name="catalog.category" template="catalog/category/list.phtml"}} to home page from back end in layout update xml under design tab but the correct way was to place it in content tab.
