I have been working on a similar kind of problem and below is my methodology. Hope it is of help: Classify and analyze your time series problem. This will help narrowing down the domain of your problem and selection of technique. It can be done on the basis of factors including but not limited to: Multivariate on univariate? Regression or Classification? Size of inputs (labels), outputs (features)? Total number of examples? Read up on different statistical techniques for analyzing/forecasting time series data with a special focus on which problem could be solved by the factors you determined in previous step. Some techniques are ARIMA,Smoothing Average etc. If you feel that performance could be increased further, start experimenting with classical machine learning models. Some examples are Logistic Regression, SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forests. You will have to read up on each for its pros and cons. If you still do not feel satisfied with the performance, you can try with deep learning and neural networks. Its better that you read up on a comprehensive resource like an online deep learning course etc. A comprehensive resource I have found on time series and sequences is : Coursera course on Time Series by deeplearning.ai .
