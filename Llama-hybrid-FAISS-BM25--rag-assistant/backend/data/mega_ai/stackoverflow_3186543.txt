problem with "Button" and ":button" selectors

I am new to Jquery and in learning phase. I have written a test program in it. $(document).ready(function(){ $("Button").click(function(){ $(this).parents(".ex").hide(); }); $(":button").click(function(){ $(this).parents(".ex").hide("slow"); }); }); .ex{ background-color: #e5eecc; padding: 7px; border: solid 1px #c3c3c3; } Island Trading Contact: Helen Bennett Garden House Crowther Way London Paris spécialités Hide Me Quick Contact: Marie Bertrand 265, Boulevard Charonne Paris This is working as expected. Whenever i click Hide me slowly , it is hidden slowly. As the event with the selector ":button" asks to do so. and similarly for Hide me Quick -- the selector is "Button", it is hidden quickly. But once i change the order of the event handling functions in the script, both of them are hidden slowly. Change in code in $(document).ready(function(){ $(":button").click(function(){ $(this).parents(".ex").hide("slow"); }); $("Button").click(function(){ $(this).parents(".ex").hide(); }); }); My question is, i did not changed the selectors only the order is modified. For the selector "Button" i have written event handling function to only hide and did not specified "slow". But then it is hiding slowly. can you please look into it and let me know why?
