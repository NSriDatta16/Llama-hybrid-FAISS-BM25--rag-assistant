Is it possible to build an MsTest project into a self-contained executable? How?

I can do so using MbUnit framework, but I cannot force everyone to install it (please do not ask); everybody already has mstest.exe as well as the library. http://www.gallio.org/oldwiki/MbUnit/TestExecutionUsingSelfExecutableTestAssemblies.html We do not even run unit tests yet, so the easiest way to cram it in is to reuse an existing project. If it gets harder than that, then we will likely not have a test coverage for a while. Looking forward to gaining some faith in MS Test.
