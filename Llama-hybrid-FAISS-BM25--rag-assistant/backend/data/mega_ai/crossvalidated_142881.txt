This question has several right answers. Here are three: Unit test your code. Rather than testing the entire algorithm, test each step separately to make sure it gives the right result. The test cases only need to be as complicated as the individual step. This will enforce good coding habits anyway. Use toy data. If you are fitting a SVM, you should be able to find the correct support vector on a linearly separable data set. Replicate an existing result. Many, if not most, stats and ML method papers include a demonstration or experiments section. Replicate their demo and make sure your results match. And of course don't forget the obvious: if the results don't make any sense, re-check your code before you re-check your model.
