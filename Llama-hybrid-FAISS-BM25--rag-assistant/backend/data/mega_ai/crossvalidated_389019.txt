The strangest thing I uncovered when reading up on chaos theory in order to answer this question was an astonishing dearth of published research in which data mining and its relatives leverage chaos theory. This was despite a concerted effort to find them, by consulting such sources as A.B. Ҫambel’s Applied Chaos Theory: A Paradigm for Complexity and Alligood, et al.'s Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems (the latter is incredibly useful as a sourcebook for this topic) and raiding their bibliographies. After all that, I was only to come up with a single study that might qualify and I had to stretch the bounds of “data mining” just to include this edge case: a team at the University of Texas performing research on Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions (which were already known to be prone to aperiodicity) accidentally discovered discrepancies in the malonic acid used in their experiments due to chaotic patterns, prompting them to seek a new supplier.[1] There are probably others - I am not a specialist in chaos theory and can hardly give an exhaustive evaluation of the literature – but the stark disproportion with ordinary scientific uses like the Three-Body Problem from physics would not change much if we enumerated them all. In fact, in the interim when this question was closed, I considered rewriting it under the title “Why are there so Few Implementations of Chaos Theory in Data Mining and Related Fields?” This is incongruent with the ill-defined yet widespread sentiment that there ought to be a multitude of applications in data mining and related fields, like neural nets, pattern recognition, uncertainty management, fuzzy sets, etc.; after all, chaos theory is also a cutting edge topic with many useful applications. I had to think long and hard about exactly where the boundaries between these fields lay in order to understand why my search was fruitless and my impression wrong. The ;tldr Answer The short explanation for this stark imbalance in the number of studies and deviation from expectations can be ascribed to the fact that chaos theory and data mining etc. answer two neatly separated classes of questions; the sharp dichotomy between them is obvious once pointed out, yet so fundamental as to go unnoticed, much like looking at one’s own nose. There might be some justification for the belief that the relative newness of chaos theory and fields like data mining explains some of the dearth of implementations, but we can expect the relative imbalance to persist even as these fields mature because they simply address distinctly different sides of the same coin. Almost all of the implementations to date have been in studies of known functions with well-defined outputs that happened to exhibit a few puzzling chaotic aberrations, whereas data mining and individual techniques like neural nets and decision trees all involve the determination of an unknown or poorly defined function. Related fields like pattern recognition and fuzzy sets likewise can be viewed as the organization of the results of functions that are also often unknown or poorly defined, when the means of that organization aren’t readily apparent either. This creates a practically insurmountable chasm that can only be crossed in certain rare circumstances – but even these can be grouped together under the rubric of a single use case: preventing aperiodic interference with data mining algorithms. Incompatibility with the Chaos Science Workflow The typical workflow in “chaos science” is to perform a computational analysis of the outputs of a known function, often alongside visual aids of the phase space, like bifurcation diagrams, Hénon maps, Poincaré sections, phase diagrams and phase trajectories. The fact that researchers rely on computational experimentation illustrates just how hard chaotic effects are to find; it’s not something you can ordinarily determine with pen and paper. They also occur exclusively in nonlinear functions. This workflow isn’t feasible unless we have a known function to work with. Data mining might yield regression equations, fuzzy functions and the like, but they all share the same limitation: they’re just general approximations, with a much wider window for error. In contrast, the known functions subject to chaos are relatively rare, as are the ranges of inputs that yield chaotic patterns, so a high degree of specificity is required even to test for chaotic effects. Any strange attractors present in the phase space of unknown functions would certainly shift or vanish altogether as their definitions and inputs changed, greatly complicating the detection procedures outlined by authors like Alligood, et al. Chaos as a Contaminant in Data Mining Results In fact, the relationship of data mining and its relatives to chaos theory is practically adversarial. This is literally true if we view cryptanalysis broadly as a specific form of data mining, given that I’ve run across at least one research paper on leveraging chaos in encryption schemes (I can’t find the citation at the moment, but can hunt it down on request). To a data miner, the presence of chaos is normally a bad thing, since the seemingly nonsensical value ranges it outputs can greatly complicate the already arduous process of approximating an unknown function. The most common use for chaos in data mining and related fields is to rule it out, which is no mean feat. If chaotic effects are present but undetected, their effects upon a data mining venture might be difficult to surmount. Just think of how easily an ordinary neural net or decision tree might overfit the seemingly nonsensical outputs of a chaotic attractor, or how sudden spikes in input values could certainly confound regression analysis and might be ascribed to bad samples or other sources of error. The rarity of chaotic effects among all functions and input ranges means investigation into them would be severely deprioritized by experimenters. Methods of Detecting Chaos in Data Mining Results Certain measures associated with chaos theory are useful in identifying aperiodic effects, such as the Kolmogorov Entropy and requirement that the phase space exhibit a positive Lyapunov exponent. These are both on the checklist for chaos detection[2] provided in A.B. Ҫambel’s Applied Chaos Theory, but most aren’t useful for approximated functions, such as the Lyapunov exponent, which requires definite functions with known limits. The general procedure he outlines might nonetheless be useful in data mining situations; Ҫambel’s aim is ultimately a program of “chaos control,” i.e. elimination of the interfering aperiodic effects.[3] Other methods like calculating box-counting and correlation dimensions for detecting the fractional dimensions that lead to chaos might be more practical in data mining applications than the Lyapunov and others on his list. Another telltale sign of chaotic effects is the presence of period doubling (or tripling and beyond) patterns in function outputs, which often precedes aperiodic (i.e. “chaotic”) behavior in phase diagrams. Differentiating Tangential Applications This primary use case must be differentiated from a separate class of applications that are only tangentially related to chaos theory. On closer inspection, the list of “potential applications” I provided in my question actually consisted almost entirely of ideas for leveraging concepts that chaos theory depends upon, but which can be applied independently in the absence of aperiodic behavior (period doubling excepted). I recently thought of a novel potenital niche use, generating aperiodic behavior to pop neural nets out of local minima, but this too would belong on the list of tangential applications. Many of them were discovered or fleshed out as a result of research into chaos science, but can be applied to other fields. These “tangential applications” have only fuzzy connections to each other yet form a distinct class, separated by a hard boundary from the main use case of chaos theory in data mining; the first leverages certain aspects of chaos theory without the aperiodic patterns, while the latter is devoted solely to ruling out chaos as a complicating factor in data mining results, perhaps with the use of prerequisites like the positivity of the Lyapunov exponent and detection of period doubling. If we differentiate between chaos theory and other concepts it makes use of correctly, it is easy to see that the applications of the former are inherently restricted to known functions in ordinary scientific study. There really is good reason to be excited about the potential applications of these secondary concepts in the absence of chaos, but also reason to worry about the contaminating effects of unexpected aperiodic behavior on data mining endeavors when it is present. Such occasions will be rare, but that rarity is also likely to mean that they will go undetected. Ҫambel’s method might be of use in staving off such problems though.
