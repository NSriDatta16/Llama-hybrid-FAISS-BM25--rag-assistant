Every time you have to deal with some "distribution" issue, you could be better off considering a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). With Git, for instance, you could organize your packages as submodules within a main emacs configuration project, itself referenced as a submodule within your own project. That way, you only need to git submodule update --recursive once in a while to be sure getting the latest packages referenced by your central configuration project. Note: the recursive initialization of those submodules is a bit tricky: see this SO question for more .
