Multivariate Time series analysis: When is a CNN vs. LSTM appropriate?

I have multiple features in a time series and want to predict the values of the same features for the next time step. I have already trained an LSTM which is working okay, but takes a bit long to train. So now my question: is it reasonable to use a CNN instead of an LSTM, even though it is a time series? Are there any indicators for when you should never switch to a CNN?
