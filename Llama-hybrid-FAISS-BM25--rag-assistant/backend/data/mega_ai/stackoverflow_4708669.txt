Note: I've never answered my own question before so i hope this is appropriate. Feel free to comment or disagree, but it is looking like this isn't getting answered by anyone else. So, the problem causing our performance issues was something completely unrelated and is now solved. After this was resolved, the web services began responding in a timely manner again. This leads me to conclude that you can have quite a lot of TPL Tasks running concurrently (like the hundreds in my example) and, even with their heavy usage of Thread Pool worker threads, WCF will still be able to use the Thread Pool's managed I/O threads efficiently to handle your web service requests.
