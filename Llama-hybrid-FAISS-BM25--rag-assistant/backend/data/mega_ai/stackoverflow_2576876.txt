Converting a ts (Time Series) object to a Vector in R

I need to use a function on a vector that does not take a ts object. I'm trying to convert it to a plain old vector but I just can't seem to figure it out. I googled around but mostly people are trying to convert data types into ts object. I want to go the other way. Any help would be appreciated.
