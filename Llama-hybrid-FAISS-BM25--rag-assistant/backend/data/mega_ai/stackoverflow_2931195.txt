Magento: Add Login/MyAccount Widget in Sidebar

Want to add a Login/MyAccount widget to the sidebar in Magento. Is there an easy helper method I can call to do that? Basically, want users to be able to login from the sidebar. And if they are logged in that widget space should be taken up by a My Account widget. thanks
