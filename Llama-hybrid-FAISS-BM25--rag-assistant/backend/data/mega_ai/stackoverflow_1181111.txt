have you seen this in your source-code? i doubt it has anything to do w/IE8 and more to do w/your HTML... EDIT I think your error is here: #FeedList>div>a.item>img { maybe try: #FeedList div a.item img { border:0; width:140px; height:140px; } to see what it does... also, please post the generated HTML... you may be having problems with malformed HTML also. PS: I also get the following JS error: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; GTB6; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; InfoPath.2; Zune 3.0; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30618; Tablet PC 2.0) Timestamp: Sat, 25 Jul 2009 04:13:00 UTC Message: 'console' is undefined Line: 21 Char: 41 Code: 0 URI: http://www.twitpeek.net/js/twitpeek.js
