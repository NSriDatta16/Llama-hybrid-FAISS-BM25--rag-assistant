20 minutes is outrageous! I'm working with a million+ line source code base these days and grepping takes a few seconds at most (I use ack ). Our home directories are stored on a file server and mounted over NFS, and to speed up grepping we do that while logged in to the file server. I'm not sure how long it takes over NFS, but it's certainly longer. We also do source control operations while logged in to the file server, for the same performance reasons.
