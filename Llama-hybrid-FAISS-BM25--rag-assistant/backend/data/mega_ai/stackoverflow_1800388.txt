Yes. This clearly reduces readability. What's wrong with the following code? int skipFooBarIndex(String[] list){ if(list.length >= 1 && list[0].equals(SKIP_FIRST)) return 1; if(list.length >= 2 && (list[0] + "/" + list[1]).equals(SKIP_SECOND)) return 2; return 0; } It's much easier to understand. In general, having side effects in expressions is discouraged as you'll be relying on the order of evaluation of subexpressions. Assuming you count it as "clever" code, it's good to always remember Brian Kernighan's quote: Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
