Elegant way to do Dictionary >

What is the best way to store a map of key object to a collection of value objects? I could use Dictionary > but that approach tends to involve a lot of housekeeping, and clutters up the code. The Lookup type is almost the result I'm looking for, but it's immutable and has no constructor. I could create my own custom class, but it seems like it should exist in the framework somewhere .
