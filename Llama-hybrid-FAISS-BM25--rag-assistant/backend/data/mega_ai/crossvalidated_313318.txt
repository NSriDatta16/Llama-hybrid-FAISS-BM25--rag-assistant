Is the mean (Bayesian) posterior estimate of $\theta$ a (Frequentist) unbiased estimator of $\theta$?

I am wondering about the different ways that Bayesian and Frequentist statistic connect with each other. I recalled that the Maximum Likelihood estimate of a parameter $\theta$ is not necessarily an unbiased estimator of that parameter. That made me wonder: Is the Mean Posterior estimate of $\theta$ an unbiased estimator? That is, Does $\phi(x)=E(\theta\mid x)$ , imply $E(\phi(x)\mid\theta)=\theta$ ? Note that this is indeed a meaningful question, since $\phi(x)$ , while it is a Bayesian estimator, is simply a function from the data to the real line and so can also be seen as a classical frequentist estimator. If this question cannot be answered in general, please assume the prior is uniform. If not, is there some other Bayesian estimator (i.e. a function from the posterior to $\mathbb R$ ) that is always an unbiased estimator in the frequentist sense?
