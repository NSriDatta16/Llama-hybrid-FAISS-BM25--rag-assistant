Why do tau2 and I2 estimations differ between frequentists and Bayesian models

I was conducting a network metanalysis of treatments and found out that I2 and tau2 esitmates are widely different between the models (as an example, for the same outcome, I have a tau2= 0.0078 and I2= 12.2% [0.0 - 46.6%] with the frequentist model and tau2= 87.4 and I2= 99.8 [98.9 - 99.9]). How can this be possible? Am I calcualting it wrong? Thanks in advance for the answers. Edit: Here is the code for the Bayesian imputation: model{ for(i in 1:ns){ h[i,1] And the R code to calculate I2 from the posterior distribution: tau2 $BUGSoutput$ sims.matrix[,"tau.d"] I2.cons
