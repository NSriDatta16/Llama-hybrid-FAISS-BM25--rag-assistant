Yes , you can do it! What you're looking for is machine learning , a set of test data and a good enough algorithm . Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. source If you have some programming expertise then I recommend you start here . These tutorials are very easy to follow along and you'll get a basic idea about ML itself.
