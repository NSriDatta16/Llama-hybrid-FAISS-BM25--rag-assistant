While 96MB is rediculous for an average site, it is not unseen when running many modules in Drupal. However, the error states that it went over 16M, so obviously the value as stated in your phpinfo() is not loaded correctly. Best place to set values such as memory-limits are in the vhost configuraiton itself. Second best place is the .htaccess Third best place is in settings.php. I assume you have either a low value (16M) in your settings.php /or/ in .htaccess. Best is to set them in the vhost config and remove them from other places. You can see the actual values available in Drupal with devel.module, which has a simple php-info() page. Alternatively, you can create a node with PHP-parsing as filter and insert a phpinfo() there. That will show you the actual values as available in Drupal.
