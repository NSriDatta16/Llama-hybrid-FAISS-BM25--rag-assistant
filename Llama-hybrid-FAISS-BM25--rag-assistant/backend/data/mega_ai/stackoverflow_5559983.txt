Disable SUBMIT button until select box choices

I have a small form. Two select box elements and a submit button. The select box elements collectively when selections are chosen, fire off an ajax request. What I want to do is, disable the submit button UNTIL user has made selections from the select drop downs. They must make a selection from BOTH select drop downs, before the Submit button is enabled. I dont mind if the submit button is hidden until selections made.
