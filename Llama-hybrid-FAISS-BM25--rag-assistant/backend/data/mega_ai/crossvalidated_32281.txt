The NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods , also known as the Engineering Statistics Handbook is a great, and authoritative, reference. It is continuously supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S. tax dollars at work!) It is available in pdf at http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/toolaids/pff/index.htm The organization is a bit unusual, but there is a good search function.
