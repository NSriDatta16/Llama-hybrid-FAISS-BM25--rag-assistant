Problem in mapping fragments in EF4

I have the following model: But when i compile with VS2010, i get the following error: Error 2 Error 3007: Problem in mapping fragments starting at lines 1784, 2018:Column(s) [createdby] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties. What do i want ? Actually i want the Note entity to have FK to User entity. When does the error appear ? When i add the FK User to Note i have the error. If i remove the link, no problem. What is the problem ? Thanks John
