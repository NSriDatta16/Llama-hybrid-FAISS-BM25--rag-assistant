How do I determine the high and low values in a series of cyclic data?

I've got some data that represents periodic motion. So, it goes from a high to a low and back again; if you were to plot it, it would like a sine wave. However, the amplitude varies slightly in each cycle. I would like to make a list of each maximum and minimum in the entire sequence. If there were 10 complete cycles, I would end up with 20 numbers, 10 positive (high) and 10 negative (low). It seems like this is a job for time series analysis, but I'm not familiar with statistics enough to know for sure. I'm working in python. Can anybody give me some guidance as far as possible code libraries and terminology?
