Data Sets For Data Mining Tasks

I am relatively new in the field of Data Mining. I am currently doing Some Data preprocessing algorithms such as PCA and min max Normalization . Our professor said we could download the data sets available over the web. But at initial level I want a simple data set with relatively small number of attributes for my algorithm, and would then switch to various complex data sets. Can anyone provide a link for simple data sets which you must have used in your data mining algorithms? e.g. something pertaining to marks of students, age, height etc or employee data of a company. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
