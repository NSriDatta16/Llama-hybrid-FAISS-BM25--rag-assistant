What test to use to find the probability of highest value?

If I have a vector of around 40 values each with a normally distributed error, is there an easy way to figure out the probability of each element being the element with maximal true value? For context, this is coming from an idea to combine a min-max search with monte-carlo-tree search for use in the Leela Chess project.The idea would be to replace the average of nodes used in a plain mcts with a weighted average where the weights are the probability a given move is the best one. It is probably worth noting that the method I need does not need to be accurate (within 1% should be fine), but needs to be very efficient as it will be run up to 100,000x per second. Bonus points for methods that can be updated on the fly, as that will make it much faster for the application.
