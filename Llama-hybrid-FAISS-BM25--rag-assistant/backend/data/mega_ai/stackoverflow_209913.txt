In terms of programming domains, amongst other things, we deal with: Graphics programming (including shader development) Animation Physics simulation AI and gameplay Audio Networking (typically fairly low-level stuff) Some of these involve pretty serious maths and algorithms knowledge. On top of all that, we face extremely tough speed constraints, and typically have to be very careful with memory usage too. We face constantly changing hardware, and since we're trying to push hardware to the limit, this can be pretty tough - you can't just abstract it away. Most game development is still quite low-level C++ work. We probably deal with databases less than most other programmers nowadays (although online games are changing this)! Programmers are often the minority on modern game projects: it's all about content creation (animation, modelling, texturing, audio and design). This means many game programmers are dedicated to making the content creation process efficient, rather than working on the game code itself. This work may have more relaxed speed and memory constraints, although it does have to deal with massive data sets. Making the game 'fun' is one of the hardest things to do - in business terminology, it "means extremely unstable requirements" as the designers constantly change their mind about how things should work, to chase down that elusive fun factor. Finally, games are generally a ship-once, no chance to fix stuff kind of deal. This actually means there's very little code maintenance involved, so traditionally there may have been less attention paid to code quality issues. This is changing now with the growth in post-launch content addition, online gaming and the sheer size of modern projects. Overall it's an incredibly exciting field to be in, the downside is that it's often less well paid (because it's a very tough business financially for developers, and because it's popular, there's always a fresh supply of people looking for jobs).
