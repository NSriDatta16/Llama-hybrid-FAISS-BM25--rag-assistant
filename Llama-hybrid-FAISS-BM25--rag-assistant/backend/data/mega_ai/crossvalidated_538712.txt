Proper method and code in R to complete PCA to determine if I can reduce variables prior to doing k-means cluster

I apologize in advance for the question here as it is rather vague. What I have been searching for is the proper way to complete PCA on a data set with 300k records and 30+ variables. My ultimate goal is to do cluster analysis. I have done this with relatively good outcome. I would like to complete PCA to determine if I can reduced the number of variables. I've been searching the internet for some time now and not finding 100% of the answer - some great information but not getting me there. What I would like to do is use PCA to determine the most important variables to use to support streamlining my cluster analysis. I would also like to determine if there is any multicollinearity in the variables I could avoid. I completed PCA but struggling to tie this back to the actual variables in the data. Any help or suggestions on a resource by link would be awesome!! Thank you!!
