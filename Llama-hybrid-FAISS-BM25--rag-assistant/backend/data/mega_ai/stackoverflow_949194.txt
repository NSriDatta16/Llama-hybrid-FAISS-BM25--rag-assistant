Actually in Windows too there are a lot of different tools for the same task. Just look at the plethora of editors and IDEs that are available. The reason why open source has so many has much to do with the open source model itself. IF I don't like the way you have implemented something in your open source software, I can branch out. Each time I branch I create a new version of the software. Github takes this to a new level by encouraging developers to branch. Sometimes the hope is that the branched software will have innovations that can be integrated back into the original software. Sometimes it happens that the branched software takes a life of it's own.
