Cocoa Touch: are dynamically XML-defined views possible?

first post. Been an iPhone developer intern for about five weeks now. I've read a lot of introductory Apress material, but please take it easy if I make some vocabulary violations. So far I've been able to find answers by searching and lurking. However I now have a task for which I can find little relevant information. My iPhone application currently uses a rigid view hierarchy for selection of items. The MainViewController links to (err, Subviews?) a TableView for selecting any from a list of factories. Selecting a factory then loads a TableView for various statistics about that factory. The data to populate these tables loads from a remote JSON server by http. I would like to have an XML definition of the view hierarchy on the remote server from which the application dynamically constructs the view structure. In this way the view structure is not hard-coded into the client (the iPhone ViewControllers/nibs) and offers more flexibility for reorganizing the content server-side. Is this possible, and has anybody accomplished this? Most relevant answer was Dynamic UI in iphone , however upon reading I feel Apple's guide to Serializing/Archiving departs quickly from what I am trying to do. Can somebody explain its relevance or point to another resource?
