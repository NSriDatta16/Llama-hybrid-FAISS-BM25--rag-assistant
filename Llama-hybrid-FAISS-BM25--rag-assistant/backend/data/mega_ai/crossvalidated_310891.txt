You are correct that sctest() from the R package strucchange does not implement tests for the $k$ vs. $k+1$ break problem. It only implements tests for the null hypothesis of structural stability (= no breaks) against various patterns of structural change (e.g., one break, more breaks, fluctuation, random walk, ...). The sup$F$ test performs well in a wide range of these situations. The breakpoints() function always runs a dynamic programming algorithm from which the optimal $m$-break solution can be found with $m = 0, 1, 2, \dots$. So it is not necessary/possible to run the breakpoint estimation for just a single $m$. For choosing the number of breakpoints, Bai & Perron argue that BIC works reasonably in several situations but that sequential testing may work better. Also, they found the the modified BIC by Liu, Wu, and Zidak (LWZ) often works better than the usual BIC. Instead of $\log(n)$ the penalty term is set to $0.299 \cdot \log(n)^2.1$. This imposes a higher penalty and thus selects fewer breakpoints. As for choosing the bandwidth $h$: This should be set to a value that is small but large enough enough to allow reasonable estimation of the model in every segment. Thus, if you just fit a model with time-varying intercepts, a minimal segment size of $h = 10$ would probably be enough to compute the average of the observations. However, if you fit an autoregressive model within each segment, many more observations will be necessary. For more details see the references in ?breakpoints .
