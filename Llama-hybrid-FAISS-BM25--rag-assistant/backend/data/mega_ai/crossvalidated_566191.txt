Are Hidden Markov Models the right tool for signal segmentation task?

I have a particular problem, and I would like to know if using a HMM is the correct tool for it. Apologies for the poor wording of the problem, HMMs are definitely not my specialty. I have the following data: Several sequences of continuous values Each sequence can be of a different length All sequences come from the same underlying Markov chain The number of states (N) is known The structure of the Markov chain is known: a state always stays as the same state ( $N_i$ ) or transitions to the next state ( $N_{i+1}$ ) I would like to segment a sequence into the underlying states to be able to calculate the mean value of each state. For example: # observable values x = [0.80, 0.75, 0.85, 1.20, 1.15, 1.20, 1.15, 2.10, 2.05, 2.10] # label states (we do not know) y = [ A, A, A, B, B, B, B, C, C, C] # what I would like to learn in the end state_means = {'A': 0.80, 'B': 1.175, 'C: 2.075} I have the feeling that it might be possible to train a HMM with the objective function to minimize the mean squared error between the estimated state_means and the observed values.
