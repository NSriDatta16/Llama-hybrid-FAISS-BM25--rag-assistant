How you want to deal with this depends somewhat on why the data are missing. If the data are missing completely at random (e.g., there was a bug in the programming during data collection that affected some people at random), you're fine using listwise deletion as you've done. If the data are missing for some more meaningful reason, using listwise deletion could lead to erroneous results. Logistic regression will produce unbiased parameter estimates when you use listwise deletion even if data aren't missing at random on the IV or DV, but estimates may be biased if they're missing not at random on both the IV and the DV. A good first step to explore whether your data are missing at random would be to create variables representing missingness for each variable you're concerned about, which is 0 if the case isn't missing data on that variable and 1 if it is. Then test whether other variables in the model differ as a function of the missingness variable. If these tests are significant for both the IV and DV, your data might not be missing at random and you should be very concerned about using listwise deletion (and really, if you get significant results for both you should be concerned about your results regardless of the method of handling missing data you use). The simplest way to handle this would be add the rows you deleted back in and run the model in MPlus, which easily handles maximum likelihood for logistic regression and will retain cases even if they have missing data. You just have to specify CATEGORICAL = [name of your DV]; ANALYSIS: ESTIMATOR=ML; INTEGRATION=MONTECARLO;, and then list your variables with missing data in the IV in square brackets at the end of the model code section as explained here . You can then further reduce bias by including additional variables in your model that are associated with your missingness variables or the variables with missing data themselves. These are called "auxiliary variables" and you want to regress them on all other variables in the model. Last time I checked, there isn't a way to use maximum likelihood for logistic regression models in R, but that might have changed.
