Extending @Cristoph Hanck's answer a little, & adapting his code … Suppose Mr A is ignorant of the true mean, or of statistics, & Mr B is ignorant of neither. It might seem odd, unfair even, that Mr A can obtain a shorter confidence interval for the variance using the pivot $T$ than Mr B using the pivot $T'$. But in the long run Mr B wins in rather a strong sense: his confidence intervals are stochastically narrower—for any width $w$ you care to specify, the proportion of Mr B's CIs narrower than $w$ is greater than the proportion of Mr A's. Collecting together the subset of cases where Mr A's CI comes out narrower shows that in these he's got lower coverage (about 91%); but he pays for it with higher coverage (about 96%) in the subset of cases where his interval comes out wider, getting the correct (95%) coverage overall. Of course Mr A doesn't know when his CI's in which subset. And a sly Mr C who knows the true mean & picks $T$ or $T'$ according to which results in the narrowest CI will eventually be exposed when his intervals fail to maintain their supposed 95% coverage.
