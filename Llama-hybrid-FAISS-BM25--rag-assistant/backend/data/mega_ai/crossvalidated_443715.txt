Binomial & numerical variables as dependent and independent + random variable

I am new to statistics and trying to figure out how to analyze my data correctly. I completed a biological study with the following variables: (I have converted my binary variables to 1 and 0) -Type of food (1/0) -Starvation (1/0) -Days to hatch (numerical) -Days to adulthood (numerical) -Infection (1/0) -Sex (1/0) -Production of silk (1/0) -Weight (numerical) -Weight silk (numerical) I proceeded by creating a binary logistic regression model to test for cocoon presence as such: model1 I also have a random variable but I was not sure how to add it to the model (see below how I used 'provenience'). Is this correct? Correct me if I am wrong but I used a Shapiro-Wilk normality test on the model and obtained the following: data: model1.res W = 0.69624, p-value Does that mean my model doesn't fit the data? Lastly, how would I graphically represent the data? For the numerical data I used the following model: model2 and obtained: fixed-effect model matrix is rank deficient so dropping 4 columns / coefficients
