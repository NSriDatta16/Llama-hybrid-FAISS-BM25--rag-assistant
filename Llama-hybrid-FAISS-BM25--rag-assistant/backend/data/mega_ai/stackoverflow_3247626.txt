Having thought about this for a little more, I think I do have a solution, though not necessarily one you will like: From what I understand of your question, you are giving out email accounts to people who don't pay you money; you don't know personally; and you have no contract with. It could be argued that organizations doing what you are doing are part of the problem. Unless your primary business is being a provider of free email (and that's surely a thankless business), I don't see a need to hand out email accounts to people. If you want them to be able to communicate with you or with other of your users, let them use their own, already owned private email accounts. If you only need communication with you, a Web feedback form will do. If you want them to communicate among each other and it's some kind of social site, provide messaging capability between accounts. But don't give strangers access to your worldwide-connected email server! This is the equivalent of operating an open relay. Anybody can get an email account from Google (or Yahoo, or...) for free. Let those companies worry about spammers, they make more money than you do.
