http-agent creates threads so that might be why it does not work. From the API documentation : Creates (and immediately returns) an Agent representing an HTTP request running in a new thread. You could try http-connection , which is a wrapper around HttpURLConnection, so this should work. Another alternative is to try clj-http . The API seems to be a bit more high-level, but it uses Apache HttpComponents which might be blacklisted. I am guessing http.async.client is a definite no-go due to its strong asynchronous approach.
