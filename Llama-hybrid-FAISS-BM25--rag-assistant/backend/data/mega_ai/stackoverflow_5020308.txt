Do you use a single project for client and server side for GWT based apps or separate project?

How do you have your GWT project setup? Do you have a single project for the client side and separate project for the server side? Can you share your experience with organizing projects for a GWT front end, spring backend system? I am looking to use Spring + GWT + Tomcat + Hibernate for this project.
