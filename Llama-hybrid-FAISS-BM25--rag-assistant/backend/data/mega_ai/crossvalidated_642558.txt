One premise of your question (the thing you describe as your understanding) is incorrect. Even with $k it's perfectly possible for the columns of X (plus constant) to have some linear combination that's zero, whence $X'X$ will not be invertible. is it then true that $Ïƒ(u)=0$ No, the population variance of the error will not be zero. If you are asking about some estimate of it (which we might call $s$ , say), what's the form of your estimator? (Pay particular attention to the denominator)
