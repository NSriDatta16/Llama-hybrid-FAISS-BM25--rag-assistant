R- Non-informative vs Informative Prior for Bayesian Logistic Regression

I'm kinda new to Bayesian Statistics and I'd like to try to fit Bayesian Logistic Regression but I don't have prior knowledge about my dataset. So, I guess I have to use non-informative prior for fitting the model, correct? If so, what would be considered to be a non-informative prior distribution for logistic regression and also what would be considered to be informative prior distribution? If you could also point to more useful resources, that will be appreciated.
