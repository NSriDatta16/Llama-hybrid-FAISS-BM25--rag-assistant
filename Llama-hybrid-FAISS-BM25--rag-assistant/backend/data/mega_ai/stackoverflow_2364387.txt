The notebook / whiteboard approach works quite well for medium-sized applications. I would be careful about requiring people to sketch out their classes first like that. What you should make sure is that the requirements are all understood, and the core parts are designed logically - the goal is to try to answer the "how" question without going into specific implementation details. The problem with sketching out classes first is that it's the next stage after the above. There are exceptions to this of course, but for an average application I would be wary of someone asking me which classes I will use with which exact methods, even if the bodies can be blank initially.
