In Rails, when running in development mode, classes are not cached. MyController, and all other classes are reloaded on each request. When running in production, this is not the case - classes are cached. However, even in production, this variable will be local to a particular application instance - if you're running with two Mongrels, for example, each will have a different version of this variable. If you want state to be set across multiple requests, consider either using the session, or storing values in your database. Class variables are really not appropriate for cross-request storage.
