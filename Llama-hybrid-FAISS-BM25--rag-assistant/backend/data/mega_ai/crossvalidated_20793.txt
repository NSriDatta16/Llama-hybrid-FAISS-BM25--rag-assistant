What is "gaussianity", and how do you perform gaussianity testing in macroeconomic time-series?

I have several questions regarding the usual gaussianity ( broad normality ) assumptions in econometrics. Though people often check for normality (with apparently weak tests), I've seen just one example of "gaussianity" testing. 1.Is the "finite variance" assumption the same as a gaussianity assumption? Ie., is it the same to assume that the variable follows any distribution in the family of Elliptically Symmetric distributions? 2.If gaussianity is a requirement, how do you test for it? The one example I know of doing some informal testing for gaussianity is NN Taleb's Errors, Robustness, and The Fourth Quadrant . Here's SSRN PDF version http://maint.ssrn.com/?abstract_id=1343042 and here the technical part of the paper in a friendly html format http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/EDGE/index.html . It that paper Taleb uses some measurements in a big number of financial time series trying to show that gaussianity is implausible. He does so by: Trying to see if the data is consistent with the central limit theorem seeing if kurtosis converges when increasing data aggregation. Trying to see if the data is consistent with either a gaussian decay in the conditional expectations of the variable or a power law (I think, page 8 of the PDF). Trying to see a non gaussian incidence of rare events. Finally, questions #3 and #4: 3.Taleb performs his tests on data of a much higher frequency than what is commonly found in macroeconomics. What would the appropriate tests be for monthly data? 4.Are there other necessary conditions for the usual econometric models besides finiteness of variance not typically tested for? Please bear in mind that I'm a graduate student taking a fairly basic time series course, this is just for intellectual curiosity.
