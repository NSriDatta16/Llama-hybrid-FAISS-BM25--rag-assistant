Understanding Bernoulli Trials, Bayesian Setting

I am required to complete a project on ML applications. I guess there is a lot of statistics in ML, not helpful for a non-maths background. I am getting too bogged down by notations. There are too many notations. I am trying to read about what Bernoulli trials are and I can't relate to it. What is a Bayesian setting and why is Bayesian thing everywhere? What makes it such an omnipotent distribution? Are there any theorems/theories that I must know ? Any book/notes/resources where I could learn about these stuff in a relatable way (I have very little maths background, but I can learn)?
