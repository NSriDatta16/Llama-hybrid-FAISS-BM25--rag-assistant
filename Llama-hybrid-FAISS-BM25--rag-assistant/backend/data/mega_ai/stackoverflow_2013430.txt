set browser locale in Internet Explorer programmatically

Is there a way to set the Internet Explorer locale (accepted languages) programmatically. I have a small application which is embedding Internet Explorer and I would like to give the use the possibility to change the locale when clicking a simple button. Is there a way besides tweaking registry and calling SendMessageTimeout(HWND_BROADCAST,WM_SETTINGCHANGE , 0, ...);
