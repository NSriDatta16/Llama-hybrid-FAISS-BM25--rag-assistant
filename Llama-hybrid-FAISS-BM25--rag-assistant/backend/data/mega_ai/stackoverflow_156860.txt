How to communicate between CE 6.0 device (as server) and PC (as client)

We're in the process of developing a measurement device that will be running CE 6.0 with CF 3.5 on x86 embedded hardware, a PC is used to control the device and is connected with it using ethernet. We would like to communicate using interfaces (using DCOM (we know it is not supported by default on CE6), .NET Remoting or Web services) instead of using some sort of (custom) protocol. Calling methods defined in an interface is so much easier and elegant then parsing raw data. What would be the best solution in this case?
