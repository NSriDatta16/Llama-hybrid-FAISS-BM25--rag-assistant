What is the minimum historical data/sample data required for a time series forecasting analysis?

Are there any statistical power analysis/sample size deteminations methods for time series data analysis/forecasting? For example if I have time series of 30 data points, how can I with confidence use a particular statistical methods like exponential smoothing or arima for predict the future ? I have seen in some textbooks that have a cursary mention on historical data points required for ARIMA would be 50 or 60. But I have not encountered a formal approach on how much history is required for a a particular time series forecasting method. I did a thorough search on major time series textbooks and the internet, I'm unable to find any literature on this topic. Any guidance would be helpful.
