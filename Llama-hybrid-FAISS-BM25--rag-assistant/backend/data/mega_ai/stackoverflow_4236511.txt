Algorithm for detecting combinations

I am creating a simple intrusion detection system for an Information Security course using jpcap. One of the features will be remote OS detection, in which I must implement an algorithm that detects when a host sends 5 packets within 20 seconds that have different ACK, SYN, and FIN combinations. What would be a good method of detecting these different "combinations"? A brute-force algorithm would be time-consuming to implement, but I can't think of a better method. Notes: jpcap's API allows one to know if the packet is ACK, SYN, and/or FIN. Also note that one doesn't need to know what ACK, SYN, and FIN are in order to understand the problem. Thanks!
