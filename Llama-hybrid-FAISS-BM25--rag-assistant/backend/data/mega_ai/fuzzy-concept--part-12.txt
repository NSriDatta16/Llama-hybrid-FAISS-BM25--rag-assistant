t "During the period in which I served in the target room [between 2010 and 2015], you needed a team of around 20 intelligence officers to work for around 250 days to gather something between 200 to 250 targets. Today, the AI will do that in a week.” Although no comprehensive overviews appear to be publicly available, a large amount of scientific research on fuzzy systems was funded or sponsored by the military. However, military uses of fuzzy systems research can also have spin-offs for medical applications. Academic debates There have been many academic debates about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts, as well as their appropriate use. Rudolf E. Kálmán stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts". The suggestion is that to qualify as a concept, the concept must always be clear and precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept. In 2011, three Chinese engineers alleged that "Fuzzy set, its t-norm, s-norm and fuzzy supplement theories have already become the academic virus in the world". "Fuzzy" label Lotfi A. Zadeh himself confessed that: "I knew that just by choosing the label fuzzy I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called fuzzy logic, there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the New York Times. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the New York Times, it doesn't sit well with them." However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order." Frege and Wittgenstein According to The Foundations of Arithmetic by the logician Gottlob Frege, "A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The law of the excluded middle is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary." In his notes on language games, Ludwig Wittgenstein replied to Frege's argument as follows: "One can say that the concept of a game is a concept with blurred edges. “But is a blurred concept a concept at all?” Is a photograph that is not sharp a picture of a person at all? Is it even always an advantage to replace a picture that is not sharp by one that is? Isn’t one that isn’t sharp often just what we need? Frege compares a concept to a region, and says that a region without clear boundaries can’t be called a region at all. This presumably means that we can’t do anything with it. But is it senseless to say “Stay roughly here”? Imagine that I were standing with someone in a city square and said that. As I say it, I do not bother drawing any boundary, but just make a pointing gesture as if I were indicating a particular spot. And this is just how one might explain what a game is." The categorical status of concepts There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "concept" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined. A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, as a cluster of linked phenomena etc. Edward E. Smith & Douglas L. Medin stated that "there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably." Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their mod
