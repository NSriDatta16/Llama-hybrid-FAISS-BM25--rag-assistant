How to do unit testing in Visual Studio 2005?

Is there any support for unit testing in Visual Studio 2005? After googling for some time, I found out that we can do unit testing with Visual Studio Team System, but I do not have it. I cannot install NUnit also because of some stupid rules of my organization. Does anyone knows how to do unit testing in Visual Studio? Many Thanks
