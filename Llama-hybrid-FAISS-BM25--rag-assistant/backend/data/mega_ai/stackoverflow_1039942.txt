"OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them." - Alan Kay, creator of Smalltalk. C++, Java, and most other languages are all pretty far from classical OOP. That said, arguing for ideologies is not terribly productive. C++ is not pure in any sense, so it implements functionality that seems to make pragmatic sense at the time.
