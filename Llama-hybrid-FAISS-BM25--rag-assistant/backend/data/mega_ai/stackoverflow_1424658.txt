Can you leverage Site.Master for this purpose, or at least another Master of your own creation? All of your views can then reference this Master and gain the benefit of initialized JavaScript and layout elements. To me, this makes sense if the content is static in nature. If not, I'd go with a custom Html.Init helper method. I'm envisioning something like the following: global.js function doSomething() { } //more code here master page
