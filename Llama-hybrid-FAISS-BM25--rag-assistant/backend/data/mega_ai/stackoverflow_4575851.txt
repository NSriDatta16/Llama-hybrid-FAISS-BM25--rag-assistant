this is a regex way. its fine if the only requirement is to strip the exact wrapping strings and if you need a generic solution which is robust for html you should use DOM . (for example if you want to acceppt classes, ids and variaous attributes in your wrapping paragraph tags.) but be aware that loading a domdocument will normalize your html. Here ", " Test Nested Outside " ); foreach($str as $st) { echo $st." ---> "; if(preg_match('# (.+) #',$st,$match) === 1) { // 1 if matched, 0 if not matched $st = $match[1]; // if matched, replace our string by the match } echo $st."\n"; } this will generate this output: Simple Test ---> Simple Test Here ---> Here Test Nested Outside ---> Test Nested Outside you could easily make thie a one liner. for example with preg_replace and regex backreferences you could replace the string which the match... but i hope in this form its more understandable to you.
