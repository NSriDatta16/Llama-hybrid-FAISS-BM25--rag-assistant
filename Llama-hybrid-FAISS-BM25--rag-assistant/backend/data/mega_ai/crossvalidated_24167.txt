I think if you do PCA on all the variables, the first PC is very likely to be a "general size measure" so the idea of doing PCA on residuals may be to get rid of that. But, as far as I can see, the 2nd, 3rd etc. PCs on the original variables will be very similar to the 1st, 2nd, etc PCs on the residuals.
