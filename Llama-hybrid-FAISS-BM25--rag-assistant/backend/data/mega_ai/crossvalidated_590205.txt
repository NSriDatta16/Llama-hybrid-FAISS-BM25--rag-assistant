I assume that retention left-truncates the severity distribution and deductible does so for both the frequency and severity distributions (even in a less predictable way that the former). If an insurance company doesn't keep (and then provides to its quants) its historical data in a form that retains the non-covered claims, or buys such truncated data, it will be in a weaker position to predict its exposure to the risk than its competitors, will more severely misprice its insurance products and be less profitable on average.
