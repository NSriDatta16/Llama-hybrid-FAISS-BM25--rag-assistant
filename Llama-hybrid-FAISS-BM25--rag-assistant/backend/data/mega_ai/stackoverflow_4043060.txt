js file is loading from cached temporary internet files instead of redownloading from server

I have used a external js file for a upload operation in my page.. once the file get loaded in temporary folder, it gets loaded from there even if new changes are made the old version that exist in temp folder gets loaded... i have written Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); on my page But it still loads the js file in cache. When i cleared the temporary files manually it works fine...But i cannot ask my client to clear temp folder,,, Is there any solution to load js file not from the cache, ie reload every time page is loaded...
