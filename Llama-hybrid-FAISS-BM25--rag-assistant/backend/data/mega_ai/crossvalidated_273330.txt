First, you can find a really good explanation http://www.appstate.edu/~whiteheadjc/service/logit/intro.htm On general matters. Logistic regression models assign a weight to each variable. This weight has a real value, positive, zero or negative. Since the model is linear - of the form $$ \alpha_{0}*1 + \alpha_{1}*\beta_{1} + \alpha_{2}*\beta_{2} + .. $$ each variable affect on the end result can be calculated independently of others. How can you compare variables weights? and decide which one has the strongest effect on outcome probability? To answer this question there are three things you need to consider: 1) Base model odds ratio. 2) Variable weight. 3) Variable distribution. Based model odds ratio: When you train a model with a slope(intercept) you basically assume the starting point is not necessary 0. In your case the probability of an employee to leave, might be positive regardless of all variables. This has other importance in the case of categorical variables. The intercept factor ($\alpha_{0}$) states what is the odds ratio of sample having all variables equal to zero. In your case an employee living in the one city you didnt represent in its own variable. By agreeing on the fact that the intercept value is actually a weight of the default-state variable its fair comparing it to other variables. The variable weight Assuming weight $\alpha_{i}$, taking its exponent $e^{\alpha_{i}}$ we get the numerical effect of one unit change in the corresponding variable $\beta_{i}$ on the odds ratio (P(1)\(1-P(1))). Be aware that some weights might be negative and an increase in their corresponding variable will result in lower odds ratio. Lets assume that we $e^{\alpha_{1}}=2$ and that $e^{\alpha_{2}}=0.5$. For this case, an increase in one unit in $\beta_{1}$ will increase the odds ratio by 2 and an increase in one unit in $\beta_{2}$ will reduce the odds ratio by 2. So we might say both variables have the same effect strength, only in a different direction. Now you can compare each variable effect strength. Variable Distribution There is a lot of math behind this part, but asking this two step question might help avoiding assuming importance where there is none. For each variable, how many times do i expect to see it change in more than one unit? and how much more? If some of the employees are paid extremely high than other and they quit their job more often than other than looking at the weight of variable salary might be deceiving. Reason being that for all the salary values between normal employees salaries and extremely high salary employees we have no data(and our model assumes continuity). There are statistic tests for getting a technical measure of the weight reliability(Wald test for example).
