The render transform occurs much later in the UI rendering process. It ultimately performs a matrix transform on controls rendering. The scroll viewer will be completely unware of this transform, its scrollbars will be based on the un-transformed size of the original Canvas. The silverlight toolkit contains a LayoutTransformer control. This control applies a transform to its content as part of the layout process and reports the post-transform size as its desired size. Consider this:- Whilst the Canvas has a size (150) smaller than the containing scroll viewer (200), it is scaled so that it would be larger (300). The LayoutTransformer reports its desired size as 300, the post-transform size of the canvas. Hence the ScrollViewer displays scroll bars to accomodate it. Without the benefit of the LayoutTransformer the ScrollViewer would only see the Canvas as having a size 150 despite any applied RenderTransform.
