Logistic Regression is great for CTR and spam filtering (text data in general) thanks to the use of the hashing trick. Vowpal Wabbit has an optimized implementation of it in case you have GB of data. I guess neural networks will perform well too in these kind of tasks. https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit One recommendation that applies to every other data science problem; the biggest improvements you can get come from creating new features. In your case: TF-IDF, n-grams, POS Tagging can be used to improve the classifier more than just choosing A or B algorithm. Note: Vowpal Wabbit can create n-grams and interactions automatically. Other types of pre-processing should be coded separately.
