What is the "right" way to bring a Windows Forms Application to the foreground?

I am writing a Windows Forms Application in C#. I need to be able to bring it to the foreground. After some Googling and experimentation, I have a working solution that looks pretty hacky. I would like to know the elegant way to do this, if there is one. I need the app to restore and come to the foreground whether it was minimized, or not minimized but in background. Current code looks like this: WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized; WindowState = FormWindowState.Normal; BringToFront(); Focus();
