“Disc”, “line”, “above”, “below” are abstract categories, making rules of them needs logical reasoning, so creating such abstract rules would be a task that is too hard for a human child up to some age, so it seems like artificial general intelligence problem, as noticed by Stephen Kolassa . It is possible to have question-answering algorithm that would be able to answer simple questions about the image, like “is there a circle”, but not being able to make any logical conclusions about it. Traditional machine learning would be able to fit patterns like the example that was shown in the question. Moreover, notice that apparently the data didn’t have “no points” class, so classifier didn’t consider it, otherwise image partitioning algorithm should manage to mark background as well.
