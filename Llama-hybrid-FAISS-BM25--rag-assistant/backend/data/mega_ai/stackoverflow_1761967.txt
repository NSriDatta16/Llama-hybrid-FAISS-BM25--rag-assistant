Guidelines/principles for package and component design

Alright, our visual studio solution grows big in terms of the number of projects in it. Except for things that are obvious, I want to check whether the way it is now is what it has to be or we can better reorganize/package it. Do you know of any good text on guidelines, principles of package and component design that I can reference? Something in depth, with good analysis, not just tier a, b,c or layer 1, 2, 3, etc. Thanks.
