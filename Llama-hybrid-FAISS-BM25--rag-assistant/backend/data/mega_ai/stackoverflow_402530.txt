I have had to deal with arbitrary-depth categories on SQL and it seems not well suited for storing data of this type in a normal form, as nested queries and/or multiple JOINs tend to get ugly extremely quickly. This is almost the only case where I would go with a sort of improper solution, namely to store categories in string form, subcategories separated by a delimiter. It makes both database queries and other operations much more trivial. Categories table would look something like this: id name 1 Internet 2 Internet/Google 3 Internet/Yahoo 4 Offline 5 Offline/MS Office/MS Excel 6 Offline/Openoffice Another solution is, that depending on your expected usage, you can maybe implement binary tree in the category list. That allows to select category trees and parent/child relationships elegantly. It has the limitation, however, that upon inserting new categories the whole tree may have to be recalculated, and that knowing the approximate size of tree in advance is useful. At any rate, hierarchical data in SQL is not trivial by itself, so, whatever you do, you will probably have to do quite some custom coding.
