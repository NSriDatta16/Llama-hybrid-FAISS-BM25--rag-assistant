Logistic regression with same response?

For binary logistic regression, the responses are either 0 or 1. But what if I only want to predicate the probability of response 1? Let's say I want to predicate how likely it will rain. I recorded in the past some features like temperature, air pressure when it rains. But I never record anything when it doesn't rain. So I only have response 1 in my data, there is no 0, how I can train the model with logistic regression?
