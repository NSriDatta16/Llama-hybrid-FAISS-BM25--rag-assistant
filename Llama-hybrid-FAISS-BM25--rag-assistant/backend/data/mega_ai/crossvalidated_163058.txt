Interpreting a longitudinal generalized estimating equations beta cofficients

I've been struggling with wrapping my head around the GEE beta coefficients and I don't think I fully get it. There are other questions on CrossValidated that ask about GEE in the binary context ( Generalized estimating equations output in SPSS and Interpretation of GEE coefficients ) and while helpful do not help me understand continuous variables in a longitudinal setting. Here is an example longitudinal analysis: geeglm(BloodPressure ~ CortisolStress + Time + Sex + Age + Weight, id = SubjectID, family = gaussian, corstr = 'ar1', data = dataset1) The data are sorted as: > Time, SubjectID, ... > 1, 100, ... > 2, 100, ... > 3, 100, ... > 1, 101, ... > 2, 101, ... > ... The beta coefficient for the CortisolStress is, e.g., 9.50 (SE = 2.3). From what I understand, that means for individuals with a one unit increase in CortisolStress have at any given timepoint a 9.50 unit increase in BloodPressure and that there is a 9.50 unit increase in BloodPressure averaged over time (longitudinal interpretation). Or said another way, as time increases there is a 9.50 unit increase in BloodPressure as CortisolStress increases. This second part, the longitudinal part, is where I'm getting tripped up. Am I understanding this correctly?
