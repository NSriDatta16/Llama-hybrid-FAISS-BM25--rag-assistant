I think some best practices for unit tests are: They must be self-contained, i.e. not require too much configuration and external dependencies to run. Let tests build their own dependencies like files and Web sites required for the tests to run. Use unit tests to reproduce bugs before fixing them. This helps prevent the bugs from surfacing again in the future. Use a code coverage tool to spot critical code that is not exercised by any unit tests. Integrate unit tests with nightly builds and release builds. Publish test result reports and code coverage reports to a Web site where everyone in the team can browse them. The publishing should ideally be automated and integrated into the build system. Do not expect to reach 100% code coverage unless you develop mission critical software. It can be very costly to reach this level and will for most projects not be worth the effort.
