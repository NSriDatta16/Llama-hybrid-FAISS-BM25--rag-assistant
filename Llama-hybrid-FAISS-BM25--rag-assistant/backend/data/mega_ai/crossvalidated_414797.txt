Was my way to find seasonality within my data right? So I should exclude it? Both using frequency to make your time series seasonal (and trusting auto.arima() to detect any actually relevant seasonality) and including Fourier terms are defensible. (They model different kinds of seasonality, though. Experiment with series simulated using both approaches if you are interested. See below on why I won't go into this further.) Since I only got results for “no seasonality” I think I can exclude msts, right? No. You might have seasonality on different frequencies, which your current approaches do not pick up, but methods for multiple-seasonalities might, if specified correctly. See below on why I won't go into this further. Am I using auto.arima in a wrong way since my forecast results are that bad? No, you are using auto.arima() correctly. See below (again). How can I improve my results for arima for better forecasts if seasoanliyt or trend is not a factor? Short answer: you can't. Somewhat longer answer: How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Even longer answer: there is serious money to be had in forecasting financial returns. If it were as easy as setting up a good ARIMA model, many people would already be doing it, and any profits would already have been gone (the Efficient Markets Hypothesis in a very weak form). Also, anyone who already had such a magic bullet would almost certainly not tell you on CrossValidated. There is a reason why ARIMA is not used seriously in financial forecasting.
