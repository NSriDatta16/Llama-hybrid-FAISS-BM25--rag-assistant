Relation between the tuning parameter $\lambda$, parameter estimates $\beta_i$ and constraint $s$ in LASSO logistic regression

In the context of LASSO logistic regression, I understand that $\lambda$ is the tuning parameter obtained by cross validation. There is also the constraint parameter $s$ ($\sum_{i=1}^p|\hat\beta_i|\le s $). How this constraining parameter $s$ is chosen? How are $\lambda$, $s$ and $\beta_i$ shrinking to zero related to each other? What is the decision process or how are some $\hat\beta_i$ shrunk to zero and some are not?
