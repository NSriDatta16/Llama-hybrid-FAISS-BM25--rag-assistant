Using regression tree on time series data

I have been looking around for resources on applying a regression tree in an attempt to understanding how various spend variables impact a companies revenue overtime. Is this type of analysis something that a regression tree can do? I'm not aware of the assumption that one would be making by applying a regression tree to time series data, are there any?
