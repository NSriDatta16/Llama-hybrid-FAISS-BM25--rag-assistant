It depends on the data that's being returned, in most of the situations I find myself in. If the server is replying with a form, or general content, I prefer the straight XHTML as you do. In the event I need to receive actual data , however, I prefer the JSON format. Yes, I have to generate the markup on the client side, but since everything is nicely organized in the JSON array I can pick and choose and filter as needed. This also lets me easily change the view of the data later on, without having to get our back-end guy involved (his to-do list is always 4-5 days long!)
