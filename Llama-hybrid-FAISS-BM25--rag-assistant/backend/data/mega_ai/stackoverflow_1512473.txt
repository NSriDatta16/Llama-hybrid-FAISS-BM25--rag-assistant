If at all possible, the best way to speed up a deeply nested set of calls like this is to not have a deeply nested set of calls. You can often re-organize your data or the links inside your data to have references that might save you a level of looping, or you can sometimes find a way to line up the loops one after the other, storing the intermediate information. Sometimes it even takes creating a different object structure. I'm not saying this always works, but removing even one level will be a MUCH more significant reduction in time than anything else you might try. If I could understand your psuedocode I might give it a try, but I'm guessing you've abstracted out most of the structure that would be required for an insightful design anyway.
