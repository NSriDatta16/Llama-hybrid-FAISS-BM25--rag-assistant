Is there an analytical solution for cumulative probability for a distribution generated via a set of parameters? (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis)

I am trying to build a model that creates probabilistic estimates of the next location of an event, given a series of previous events (and other data). I want to maximize the likelihood that the next event occurs in some correct location $L$. The problem (as I understand it) can be expressed as: $$ \mathcal{L}(Location_{t+1} = L | X_{0:t}) = \Pr(X_{0:t} | location_{t+1} = L) = 1 - \Pr(X_{0:t} | location_{t+1} L) $$ If I was to generate the probability distribution using mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis as parameters, how would I calculate the cumulative density of the generated distribution? Edit: The idea was to use this approach: ragulpr.github.io/2016/12/22/WTTE-RNN-Hackless-churn-modeling/, but instead of a weibull, use a normal distribution (parameterized by mean, variance, skew, kurtosis) so that instead of point estimates for location, I have a distribution about each latitude/longitude value. Unfortunately in this case,
