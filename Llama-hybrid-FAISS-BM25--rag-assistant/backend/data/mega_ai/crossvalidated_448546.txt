Can you use neural networks with limited data?

I was recommended to use neural networks on a dataset with 55 observations and about 15 variables of interest. When I read about neural networks it seems it's a learning algorithm that needs a lot of input to be efficient. Can neural networks be of use with small data sets in ways that machine learning cannot? If so, what advantages/different perspectives would I gain from using neural networks instead of machine learning?
