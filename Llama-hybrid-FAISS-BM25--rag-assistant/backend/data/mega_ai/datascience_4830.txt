I think one has to be very careful when storing textual data. If they are user comments then, for security concerns it's better if it is encoded in some format before storage. A protobuf object can then be defined to resolve the encoding. Depending on the query pattern, and accepted latency in retrieval of the data, DB should be decided. Just a recommendation, if the idea is to store comments over a period of time for each user, consider HBase or Cassandra. They are optimized for time range queries.
