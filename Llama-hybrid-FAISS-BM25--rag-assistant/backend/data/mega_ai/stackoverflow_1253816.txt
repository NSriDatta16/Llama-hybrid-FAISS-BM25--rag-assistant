find string inside a gzipped file in a folder

My current problem is that I have around 10 folders, which contain gzipped files (around on an average 5 each). This makes it 50 files to open and look at. Is there a simpler method to find out if a gzipped file inside a folder has a particular pattern or not? zcat ABC/myzippedfile1.txt.gz | grep "pattern match" zcat ABC/myzippedfile2.txt.gz | grep "pattern match" Instead of writing a script, can I do the same in a single line, for all the folders and sub folders? for f in `ls *.gz`; do echo $f; zcat $f | grep ; done;
