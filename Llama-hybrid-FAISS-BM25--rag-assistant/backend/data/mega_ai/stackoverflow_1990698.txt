WPF FlowDocumentReader and FlowDocument Screen Reader (NVDA) Acccessibility

I am using a FlowDocumentReader to display FlowDocuments in a .NET 3.5 WPF application (the FlowDocuments have help/info/notes that are displayed based on user choices in the UI). I assumed that the FlowDocumentReader contents would be read/recognized by a Screen Reader (I am testing with NVDA on Windows 7) - but when the reader gets focus NVDA says "Document" and when mousing over or selecting FlowDocument text nothing other than the first paragraph is ever read. Are there settings/approaches/code (maybe something like the AutomationProperties) that can be used to get the FlowDocumentReader/FlowDocuments to be ScreenReader friendly? Did I miss something simple? I did not find any reference to this in the NVDA issue tracker - is it possible this is an NVDA specific issue? Settings in NVDA I might not be aware of? (NVDA version 2009.1)
