What are common ways to identify subject and object from a question?

I am looking for a way to extract the potential subject and object from a question in French . For the moment, I am building some handmade rules. Alternatively, I started to think of using an already trained model for the task. I wanted to use StanfordNLP parser but unfortunately it is not free for commercial use. So, here comes the questions: Are they ML models used for this task? Are they labeled data sets (in french) which can help create ML models used for this task? [Edit] I am looking mainly for open source tools/ libraries.
