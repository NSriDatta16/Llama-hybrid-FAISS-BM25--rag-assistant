How to use a regular expression (glob) to search a file tree

How do I adapt a search tree to handle limited regular expressions? Given a file name, I need to find all nodes matching that file name. Nodes may contain usual file name globs (* and ?). Since this is a search tree, speed is of the essence. I should add that the most important case for speed is the average time to rule out a match. In most cases matching will fail. If the tree contained the following nodes: foo, bar, foo*, *bar, foo?bar Searching for "foo" would return nodes 1 and 3. Searching for "bar" would return nodes 2 and 4. Searching for "fob" would return no nodes. Searching for "fooxbar" would return node 5. Searching for "foobar" would return nodes 3 and 4.
