In theory an svg image should be more accessible than a raster image with an alt-tag. For one thing text can be kept as text in an svg, whole fragments of text not just a short sentence. It's sad if screenreaders ignore that extra information. However not all text content may be visible at any given time, same as for html. Many svg images are static images, but a growing trend (based on actual use on the open web) seems to be to use more dynamic svgs, e.g for displaying graphs or diagrams that can be edited, or folded out. Another thing to be aware of is that elements will be shown as tooltips (for sighted users) in all svg-capable browsers AFAIK (at least the latest generation), and that you can put them inside other svg elements too (the title applies to the element to which it is a direct child).
