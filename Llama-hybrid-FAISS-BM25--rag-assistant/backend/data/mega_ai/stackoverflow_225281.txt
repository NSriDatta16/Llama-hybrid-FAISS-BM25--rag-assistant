As Aaron Fischer suggests, try recompiling your C++ application with the /clr option turned on and then start leveraging the .Net platform. CLI/C++ is pretty easy to pick up if you know C# and C++ already and it provides the bridge between the .Net world and native C++. If your current C++ code can't compile cleanly with /clr turned on then I'd suggest trying to build your application as a static lib (without /clr enabled) and then have your main() be in a CLI/C++ project that calls your legacy app entry point. That way you can at least start leveraging .Net for new functionality. For examples of "legacy" C/C++ apps that have been "ported" to .Net CLI/C++ check out the .Net ports of Quake 2 and Quake 3: Arena .
