List items into a Grid (not GridView)

In my WPF application, I have a collection to which I would like to bind a grid of controls. An example of the desired layout ( TL;DR I want this from an ItemsSource ): Desired layout http://imagebin.ca/img/27UTke FileUploader Edit TextUploader Edit UrlShortener Edit ImageUploader Edit This example is has hardcoded values; I want to bind the collection dynamically, like using a ListView. However, using a ListView with a GridView isn't what I want; I don't need selection, headers, sorting, etc. To the user, the layout is a neatly organized set of options, not a data set in a grid. I haven't been able to do this binding properly. I've tried using an ItemsControl with a Grid on the outside, but the Grid is ignored: Failed attempt 1 http://imagebin.ca/img/kTUordk Text here Edit I've also used an ItemsControl with a Grid in the panel, but this creates one Grid per item, which is ugly: Failed attempt 2 http://imagebin.ca/img/xHo__-JD Edit After some research, I discovered the SharedSizeGroup property of column and row grid definitions. I have tried this with the previous attempt; however, the middle column (with width * ) does not seem to resize itself to fill the full width of the window: Failed attempt 3 http://imagebin.ca/img/nEoMJmy Edit What is the best way to accomplish the first layout ?
