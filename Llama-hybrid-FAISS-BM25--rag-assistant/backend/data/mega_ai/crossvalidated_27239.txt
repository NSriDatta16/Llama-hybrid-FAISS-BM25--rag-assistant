The World Bank data API is particularly good and I wish that more global and state-level organisations would release this much. Here are a few more to complement @check123: UK government data project ; US government data project ; Infochimps - massive resource of a wide variety of public and private (commercial) datasources - plus their API ; Freebase (now owned by Google) - open data resource; DBpedia - an approach to using the Wikipedia API; Wikipedia API - or go direct and access Wikipedia direct; And the lazy person's choice, there is the CIA World Factbook . I find that the data is sometimes a bit wrong, but it is a useful place to get a rather plentiful overview. This is an exciting area of development so expect many more data resources to come. Follow the Open Data page at Wikipedia for regular updates.
