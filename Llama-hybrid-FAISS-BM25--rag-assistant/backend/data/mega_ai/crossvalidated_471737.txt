Difference between W_T*X of Logistic regression and Linear regression

We used W T *X to calculate the distance of a point in logistic regression from the equation of a hyperplane to the point and then tried to minimize the distance but in linear regression, we are taking W T *X as the equation of a line and then take its y ^ (i.e y_predicted value) by putting the X value in the equation of the line. So my question is that how is W T *X different in both logistic and linear regression?
