Q: what book on Bayesian statistics, preferably with R?

I am frequentist by training and practice, but I'd like to learn more about Bayesian statistics. I know the basics, but I would be at a loss if I had to, for example, replace my normal ANOVA hypothesis testing approach with a Bayesian alternative. What book would you recommend to learn practical Bayesian approaches? Preferably using R.
