How to solve MNP (minimum norm) problem in SVM?

I'm reading an article, which says that MNP (minimum norm problem) can be solved as SVM . In the minimum norm problem, we're given a set of points in $R^d$ and need to find a point in convex hull of our points closest to the origin. In SVM method we're minimizing the lagrangian $$\mathcal{L}(w, b, \alpha) = \dfrac{1}{2}||w||^2 + \sum_{i = 1}^m \alpha_i [y_i(w^Tx - b) - 1].$$ i.e.in dual-form maximizing the function $W(\alpha):$ $$\max_\alpha W(\alpha) = \sum_{i = 1}^m \alpha_i - \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i, j = 1}^m y^{(i)}y^{(j)}\alpha^{(i)}\alpha^{(j)} .$$ 1) How we can apply it for MNP-problem? Probably, 0 (origin) would stand for one support vector and the closest-point from the convex hull is for another. 2) But how will it look like a dual-form of the problem? 3) Will be $y_i$ labels $y_i = 1$ for any point of convex hull and $y_i = -1$ for origin? 4) And how can i find(if i can) $\alpha_i$ (Lagrange multipliers)?
