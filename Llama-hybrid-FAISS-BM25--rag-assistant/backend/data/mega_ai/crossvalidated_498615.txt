Why having a 3rd level nested design, requires the 2nd level random-effects to be shown as a combination 2nd:3rd levels (data provided)

Why when we have a 3-level nested design, the 2nd level is shown as a combination or interaction with the 3rd level i.e., 2nd:3rd? For example, below I have 10 schools ( schoolid ) within which there are different number of students ( childid ). On average, each student has been measured 6 times. If we plot each student's growth trajectory over time ( year ), we get a plot like shown. Using this plot, what is the meaning of childid:schoolid which is the random variation in intercepts among children nested in schools? Can we possibly see childid:schoolid or describe childid:schoolid in the plot? library(lme4) dd
