A random walk + noise model can be shown to be equivalent to a EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average). The kalman gain ends up being the same as the EWMA weighting. This is shown to some details in Time Series Analysis by State Space , if you Google Kalman Filter and EWMA you will find a number of resources that discuss the equivalence. In fact you can use the state space equivalence to build confidence intervals for EWMA estimates, etc.
