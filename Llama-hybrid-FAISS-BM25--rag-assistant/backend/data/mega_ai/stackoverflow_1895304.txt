How do I include full PartCover results with TeamCity 5?

I'm trying to get PartCover reports to generate correctly in TeamCity 5.0. When I click the Code Coverage tab in the build details, the reports are empty. I'm using the sln2008 build agent and my PartCoverage settings are as follows: Include Patterns: [*]* Report XSLT: C:\Program Files\PartCover .NET 2.3\xslt\Report By Assembly.xslt=>ByAssembly.html C:\Program Files\PartCover .NET 2.3\xslt\Report By Class.xslt=>ByClass.html Bonus points if you can describe how to include those reports (or just the important parts) with the email that TeamCity sends for successful/failed builds. I would like to continue using the sln2008 build agent, if possible, and not a different build agent.
