An alternate approach is to use a linked structure (very efficient if the matrix very sparse, not so good as it gets more filled). I hinted at the implementation in a earlier answer . I you are going to go with the continuous run implementation, I'm not sure that you really want/need to use equal lengths rows. Why not use a ragged array?
