I think other answers are great, but I didn't see any Bayesian ways of estimating your probability. The answer doesn't have an explicit form, but the probability can be simulated using R. Here is the attempt: $$ X_i | p_i \sim Ber(p_i)$$ $$ p_i \sim Beta(\alpha, \beta) $$ Using wikipedia we can get estimates of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ (see parameter estimation section). Now you can generate draws for the $i^{th}$ step, generate $p_i$ from $Beta(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ and then generate $ X_i$ from $Ber(p_i)$. After you have done this $N$ times you can get $Y = \sum X_i$. This is a single cycle for generation of Y, do this $M$(large) number of times and the histogram for $M$ Ys will be the estimate of density of Y. $$Prob[Y \leq y] = \frac {\#Y \leq y} {M}$$ This analysis is valid only when $p_i$ are not fixed. This is not the case here. But I will leave it here, in case someone has a similar question.
