One option is collaborative filtering (CF) which recommends items based on similar interactions across different users. The first step is to reorganize your data into a user-by-item (i.e., app) matrix with cell values representing if the user has used the app or not. Then build a model by finding the similarity between all pairs of items. Since your data is binary, hamming distance can be used. Different distance metrics can be used for different cell values. For example, you may have more success with time-spent-in-app for cell values. Lastly, most similar items can be predicted - "People who have used similar apps, have also used this app."
