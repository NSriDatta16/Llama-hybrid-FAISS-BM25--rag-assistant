How to handle too many categorical features with too many categories for XGBoost?

In my data I have 35 features and 14 of them are categorical. Half of them have 3 to 4 categories but others have 14 to 28 categories. One Hot Encoding them would only lead to a sparse matrix with too many features correlated between them. Do you know how can I handle this problem ?
