Why doesn't Visual Studio want me to add a new window to my WPF project?

Maybe a stupid question, but when I add item to a WPF project, Visual Studio only offers me UserControl, and not Window. Is this trying to encourage me to do MVVM, is my setup broken, or is there some other reason I haven't thought of?
