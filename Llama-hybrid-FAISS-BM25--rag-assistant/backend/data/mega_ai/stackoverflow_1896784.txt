Edit: I just saw that you pointed out one of your dimensions is a date. In that case, have a look at Jeff Ryan's chartSeries3d which is designed to chart 3-dimensional time series. Here he shows the yield curve over time: Original Answer: As I understand it, you want a countour map to be the projection on the plane beneath the 3D surface plot. I don't believe that there's an easy way to do this other than creating the two plots and then combining them. You may find the spatial view helpful for this . There are two primary R packages for 3D plotting: rgl (or you can use the related misc3d package) and scatterplot3d . rgl The rgl package uses OpenGL to create interactive 3D plots ( read more on the rgl website ). Here's an example using the surface3d function: library(rgl) data(volcano) z The alpha parameter makes this surface partly transparent. Now you have an interactive 3D plot of a surface and you want to create a countour map underneath. rgl allows you add more plots to an existing image: colorlut In this surface I set the heights=1 so that we have a plane underneath the other surface. This ends up looking like this, and can be rotated with a mouse: scatterplot3d scatterplot3d is a little more like other plotting functions in R ( read the vignette ). Here's a simple example: temp In this case, you will need to overlay the images. The R-Wiki has a nice post on creating a tanslucent background image .
