upcast from List to List via List

I have a class A and a class B extends A In another class C I have a field private List listB; Now, for some unusual reason, I have to implement this method in C public List getList(); I tried to do so by forcing an upcast of listB field to List via a List cast: public List getList(){ return (List )(List )listB; } Clients should do List list = getList(); for(A a:list){ //do something with a } I did some test and it seems work correctly, but honestly I am not sure of the all possible implications. Is this solution correct? And Is it the best solution? Thanks for your answers.
