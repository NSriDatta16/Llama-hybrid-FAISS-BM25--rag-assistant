There is a basic introduction to the Bayesian method for spam detection in the book "Doing Data Science - Straight Talk from the Frontline" by Cathy O'Neil, Rachel Schutt. The chapter is good, because it explains why other common data science models don't work for spam classifiers. The whole book uses R throughout, so only pick it up if you are interested in working with R. It uses the Enron email set as training data, since it has emails divided into spam/not spam already.
