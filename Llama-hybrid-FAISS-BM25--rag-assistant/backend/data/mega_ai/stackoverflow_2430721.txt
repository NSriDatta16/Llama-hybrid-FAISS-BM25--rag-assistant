I have been working with Magento for the last two months and all i can say is that the system is the most advanced one from all and you can extend it as much as you want once you get a full grasp of the system. When you want to extend Magento, the best bet is to stay away from modifying core classes, instead, just try to override them. For example when you want to change the design you just create new theme or new package and you copy only the files from the default theme that you want to change. If you need some additional functionality you can override core block's classes or models with creating your own module. The most powerful way to extend Magento is Event Observer pattern. Magento fires up many events like before saving a row in the database, or after saving, so when you want to insert your functionality you can just choose the appropriate event to listen for and create your own Observer class to listen for the event. Here is some helpful link to get you going with the Observers: http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/extending-order-object-and-hooking-on-event-in-magento/ From my point of view, i can simply say that Magento is the most advanced and the most professional PHP application i have ever seen.
