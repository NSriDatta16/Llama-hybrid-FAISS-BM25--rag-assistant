Selecting a suitable model for time-series prediction problem

I'm relatively new to machine learning and data science so please be understanding :) I'm building a simple model for time-series prediction using feedworward neural network, my data is continous. What I did until now is: built and trained few neural networks (differing in number of hidden layers and neurons) and compared their accuracy in predicting the values for my test set. I'm wondering if there is any better way to determine the size of my neural network, instead of building so many models and simply comparing their MSE over the test set. How is it typically done?
