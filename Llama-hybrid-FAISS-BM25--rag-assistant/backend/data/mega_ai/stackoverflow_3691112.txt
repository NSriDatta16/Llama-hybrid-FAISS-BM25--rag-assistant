Hibernate Criteria Projection

Well as the question title says, I am trying to make a projection criteria querying only couple of the table attributes. So I have a Person Table/class and it has about 40 attributes. I want my criteria to get dynamical number of attributes, lets say 10, 11 or 12 (SQL terms select firstname, lastname from person ) and I was doing it like this: Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction(); Criteria crit = session.createCriteria(Person.class); crit.setCacheable(true); ProjectionList projList = Projections.projectionList(); projList.add(Projections.property("id")); Criterias c = null; for (int i = 0; i and it gives back that the retList elements are not from the Person.class : INFO [AWT-EventQueue-0] (UserGroupManagerApp.java127) - [Ljava.lang.Object;@14b9b80 FATAL [AWT-EventQueue-0] (Login.java78) - java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to usergroupmanager.model.db.Person java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to usergroupmanager.model.db.Person Please help, for now I am listing all the 40+ attr, and it takes up querying time and I do not like it. I am looking also an alternative solution which will help me solve this. I read about ResultTransformer but havent found how to use it in my case.
