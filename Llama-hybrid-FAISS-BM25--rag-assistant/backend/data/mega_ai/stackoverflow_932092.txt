Default HTML style for controls in the Qt library

This is a question about Qt library, not about Web design. For QLabel and other controls I can set HTML text, for example " Some Text ". The question is: where is the default HTML style is defined? How can I find out what a font would be used for tag? The next question: can I change the default HTML style? Edit: I want to specify in one place in my code how my controls would be displayed. To specify css style in all the labels doesn't seem to be an elegant solution to me. Edit2: It seems people don't get the question. I'll try again. Suppose I do the following: QLabel* label = ... label->setText("This is a Header "); The question: what fonts will be used for label text rendering? How can I control them? Is there a way to specify, say, default font size for headers? Edit3: Thomi have suggested to use QTextDocument::setDefaultStyleSheet. But this is just a workaround. I have to manually apply css style to all the QTextEdits (and not QLabels) in the interface. And the question was: how to find out the default style sheet? QTextDocument::setDefaultStyleSheet just overrides it for a single QTextDocument object. Maybe QTextDocument::defaultStyleSheet returns it? I don't have a computer with Qt insatlled right now so I can't check it.
