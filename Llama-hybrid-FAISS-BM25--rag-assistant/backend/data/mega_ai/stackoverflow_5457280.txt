The tutorial cleary states: First, we need the image that we'll use for our map overlay. Here, we'll use the Android on the right as our marker. Drag this image (or your own) to the res/drawable/ directory of your project workspace. So if you are really searching for this specific androidmarker, use the one from the tutorial. You can use any other marker if you like.
