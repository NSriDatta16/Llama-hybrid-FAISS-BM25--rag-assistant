Logistic regression: Confounding factor and Missing or not applicable data

I am looking at confounding factors for relation 'reporting type' (NR or SR) --> Completeness of a colorectal report (Yes (1) or No (0)) I have a possible confounding factor (CRM) that is only applicable for rectal cancer and not for colon cancer. How do I test this confounding factor? It is a categorical factor, so CRM is free (1) or not free (0). I usually use bivariable analysis to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel Odds Ratio to look for differences in the Odds Ratio compared to the crude Odds ratio. So I would like to do look at the relation: complete report = constant + type of report X + CRM X2 Normally this would work, however CRM is only applicable in 30% of my cases (i.e. the rectal tumors). So if I adjust for CRM I will loose the colon cancer cases. Do I re-code the colon cancer cases as not applicable or do I just leave them as being missing? Or do I split my dataset in colon and rectum cases? Or is there another option?
