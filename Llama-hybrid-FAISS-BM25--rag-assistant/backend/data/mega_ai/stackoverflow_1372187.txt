SSIS - Process failing with message : "Not enough storage is available to complete this operation"

We have been running an SSIS package successfully in production now for 3 weeks, after 2 months of extensive testing. Last night the package failed repeatedly with the error message : "Not enough storage is available to complete this operation" On one occasion it failed with message : "A buffer failed while allocating 10483456 bytes." Any ideas would be welcome!
