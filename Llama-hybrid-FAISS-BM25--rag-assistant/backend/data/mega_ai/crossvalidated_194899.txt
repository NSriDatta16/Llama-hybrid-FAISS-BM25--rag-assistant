Poisson process for queuing problem

I posted it incorrectly on a different thread so I'm reposting it here. I'm working on a problem and would love to get any advice - patients come into a clinic according to a Poisson process with time parameter 10 minutes starting from 9 am until 4pm when the clinic stops admitting new patients. There are 3 doctors each of whose time spent with each patient in uniformly distributed between 5 and 20 minutes. I'm running simulation for answering: how many patients came, how many had to wait for a doctor, their average waiting time, time the office closed. For question 1 I did the following: > theta theta [1] 0.08533904 > patients patients [1] 43 Where I am stuck is the rest of the problem. I am simulating a doctor's time spent with each patient as the following: > theta.doc theta.doc [1] 6.474338 I am unclear how to proceed from here to answer questions 2, 3, and 4. As I understand, my simulation shows that each doctor spends about 6.5 minutes with each patient. How do I link the number of patients who come into clinic (43) and each doctor's time with each patient (6.5 min) to simulate answers for 2, 3, and 4?
