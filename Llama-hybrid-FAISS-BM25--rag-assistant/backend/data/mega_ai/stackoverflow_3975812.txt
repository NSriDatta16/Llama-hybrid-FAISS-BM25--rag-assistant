It is still possible for the Department to fault, it will just fault properties you have described in your model. Typically the situation you are describing is covered by "transient" properties, which are properties that are not stored in CoreData, however the object model is aware of them. When you implement a transient property you provide the storage (or computation) required for providing the value for that property. In your case it is perfectly legitimate to assume that your "location" value will not be there in the future, as it will only survive so long as the actual managed object remains in memory. In other words, any action which causes the managed object to be released such as a context reset, save or update from a save notification may cause the value to be lost (as the managed object it is tied to is turned into a fault or invalidated).
