After giving it some thought, I think the straight forward answer is that VAR does not resolve the circular function situation as framed in my question. And, frankly I don't think any other methodology can. You can't use A to forecast B at the same time as you use B to forecast A once you go beyond any related lagged variables. The key is "at the same time" and "once you go beyond any related lagged variables." Practitioners often think they can by relying on forecasts once you go beyond the lags. But, that is not the same thing. You very soon are relying on the forecast of a forecast to forecast the next period. You end up with some mean-reverting process whereby you probably would be better off to simply use a simple average as your long term forecast.
