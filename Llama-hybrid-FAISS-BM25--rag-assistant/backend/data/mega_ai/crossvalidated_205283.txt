Inference is choosing a configuration based on a single input. Learning is choosing parameters based on some training examples. In the energy-based model framework (a way of looking at nearly all machine learning architectures), inference chooses a configuration to minimize an energy function while holding the parameters fixed; learning chooses the parameters to minimize the loss function . As conjugateprior points out, other people use different terminology for the same thing. For example Bishop, uses "inference" and "decision" to mean learning and inference respectively. Causal inference means learning. But whichever terms you decide on, these two concepts are distinct. The neurological analogy is a pattern of firing neurons is a configuration; a set of link strengths are the parameters.
