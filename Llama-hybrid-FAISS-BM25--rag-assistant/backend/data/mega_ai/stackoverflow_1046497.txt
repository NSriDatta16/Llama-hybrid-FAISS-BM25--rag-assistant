Class size is not as much of an issue as method size. Classes are a means of organization and while there are good and bad ways to organize your code, it is not tied directly to class size. Method size is different since a method is doing the actual work. Methods should have very specific jobs which will inevitably limit their size. I find that the best way to determine method size is through the writing of unit tests. If you are writing unit tests with sufficient code coverage then it becomes apparent when a method is too big. Unit test methods need to be simple or else you will end up needing tests to test your unit tests to know they are working properly. If your unit test methods are becoming complicated, it is likely due to the fact that a method is trying to do too much and should be broken into smaller methods with clear responsibilities.
