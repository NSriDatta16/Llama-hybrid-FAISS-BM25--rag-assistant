The Galton Height dataset seems to be exactly what you're looking for. There are a ton of repositories of open datasets online. For beginners, I often see the UCI Machine Learning Repository . It has quite a few datasets which are easy to work with. Some other resources for datasets: Kaggle - hosts data science competitions, but you can download all the datasets without participating in a competition. Data.gov - You can freely download data from US govt agencies AWS Open Data - You need a AWS account, but these datasets are free-to-download
