No events passed to WPF adorner layer

I am trying to make a nice "drag and drop zone" in WPF that is displayed in the adorner layer when something is being dragged into the main application. The problem is that I do not get any events from my adorner, even though it according to documentation should receive all input events since it is in a higher z-order. To debug my problem I created a really simple example where I have a user control with only a button in it. This user control is displayed in the adorner layer, but I cannot click the button. Why? What have I done wrong? My adorner class is constructed like this: public ShellOverlayAdorner(UIElement element, AdornerLayer adornerLayer) :base(element) { _adornerLayer = adornerLayer; _overlayView = new AdornedElement(); _overlayView.AllowDrop = true; _adornerLayer.Add(this); } and is created in the main window by private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { adornerLayer = AdornerLayer.GetAdornerLayer(MyTopGridWithButtonInIt); ShellOverlayAdorner shell = new ShellOverlayAdorner(MyTopGridWithButtonInIt, adornerLayer); } I do not get any events at all from my control, i.e. no mouse clicks, mouse over, button clicks. I cannot even click the button in the adorner layer. What have I done wrong?
