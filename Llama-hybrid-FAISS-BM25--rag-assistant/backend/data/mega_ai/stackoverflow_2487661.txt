What's the fastest way to determine if a file adheres to a particular class's NSCoding implementation?

Given: An application that accesses a directory of files: some plain text, some binary files that adhere to a particular NSCoding implementation, and perhaps other binary files it simply doesn't understand how to process. I want to: Be able to figure out which of the files in that directory adhere to my NSCoding class, and I'd prefer not to have to fall back on the na√Øve approach of loading the entirety of each file into memory, attempting to unarchive each. Anyone have an elegant approach or pattern to this problem?
