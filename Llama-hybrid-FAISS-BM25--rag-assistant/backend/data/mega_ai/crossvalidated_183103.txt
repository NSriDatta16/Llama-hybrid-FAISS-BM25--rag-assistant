You can use pretty much any discriminant analysis approach that lets you change a 'cutoff' value to control the false positive vs false negative rate. So, at least linear, quadratic, nearest neighbors, logistic regression. Depending on the software, even neural nets, CART, etc. You have to be able to set a LOSS function. You can either look at the costs of the two types of errors and use the corresponding loss function, or else you can try lots of cutoff values and see what error rates you get (this is what you do when you derive an ROC curve). Then look for the model that gives you the correct balance of false negative and false positive rates. This is usually the best approach, because the error of calling a positive group member a negative group member might be very different from the cost of the error of calling a negative group member a positive group member.
