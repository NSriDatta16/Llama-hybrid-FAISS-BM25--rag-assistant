The core principles would include understanding of RDF, RDFS, OWL and how arbitrary knowledge can be represented using these specs. Understanding of what reasoners can do with semantic data is essential. Then comes the idea of intelligent agents. Then comes understanding of why this is all needed and why it was designed that way. This would give you the clue about how promising (or not) is this technology. For the software architect it would be good to know how OWL data can be efficiently stored(in RDBMS or in any other way for example). As for myself I find this interesting but in reality it is yet very far from the point where average users can benefit from it on the regular Web.
