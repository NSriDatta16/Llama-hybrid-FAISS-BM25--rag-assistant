Are principal components reflective, formative, both, or neither?

In reading various summaries on the similarities and differences between principal components and common factor models, I have noticed that there seems to be conflicting information about whether PCA models are reflective (e.g., a special case of traditional EFA models, as Fabrigar & Wegener's 2011 book seems to imply), formative (e.g., as this blog suggests), or neither (the impression I get from ttnphns's answer to this CV post , who describes components as linear functions of variables AND variables as linear functions of components), or both (as amoeba's comment on this thread suggests). To be clear, I mean formative and reflective in the way described by LauraCS in the aforementioned blog, with formative meaning variation in the measured variables causing the variation in the principal component, in contrast to reflective meaning variation in the principal component causing variation in the measured variables Can someone provide an accessible explanation of which is the case (reflective, formative, both, or neither) and why?
