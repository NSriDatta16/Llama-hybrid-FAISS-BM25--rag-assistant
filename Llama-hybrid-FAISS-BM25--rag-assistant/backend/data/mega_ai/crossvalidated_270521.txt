Normalizing the measurements is a good thing to do. You can normalize the weight, and therefore the ratio of these two quantities will then be free of the bias of having used different machines, as well as will be easily interpretable since both the denominator and the numerator are on the same scale and have the same units. Another thing that could have been possible is to consider one of these machines as the gold standard, and evaluate the remaining machines in an independent run of the experiment, where you run the same person through different machines, so as to obtain a correction factor for the other machines to render their values comparable. Assuming you do not have the liberty to run an independent experiment to obtain such a data, you can also try to develop a correction factor from this data, by trying to fit the curve obtained by the other machine to the curve of the gold standard. Either way, you need to have a subjectively ascertained gold standard.
