Does a solution for the stationary distribution of a Markov chain guarantee the distribution exists?

Say we have a Markov chain with a countably infinite state space, e.g. the non-negative integers. If we can form and solve equations for the stationary distribution {$\pi_i$}, that satisfies: $\pi_i = \sum_{j} P_{ji}\pi_j , \ \ \ \ \ i \in \{0,1,2,...\}$ $\sum_{j} \pi_j = 1$ Is it guaranteed that the stationary distribution we've solved for exists? Or could we solve these equations even if the chain were null recurrent?
