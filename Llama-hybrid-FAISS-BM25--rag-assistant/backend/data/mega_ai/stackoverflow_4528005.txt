Well, I did manage to solve it in the end. The method I used was to check whether there are any columns/rows with only one zero. In such case, that agent must use that job, and that column and row have to be ignored in the future. Then, do it again so as to get a job for every agent. In my example, (b, 0) would be the first choice. After that we have: a b c d 0 x x x x 1 0 x 5 0 2 60 x 0 0 3 0 x 35 40 Using the method again, we can do (a, 3), etc. I'm not sure whether it has been proven that this is always correct, but it seems it is.
