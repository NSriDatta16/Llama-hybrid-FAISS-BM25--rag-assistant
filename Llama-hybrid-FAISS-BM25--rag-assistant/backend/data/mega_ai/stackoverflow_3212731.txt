poppack.h wrong?

i got a Project to go on coding, so its not my code till now and i can´t explain the following warning message in VS2008 compiling my code: Warnung 2 warning C4161: #pragma pack(pop...): Mehr pop- als push-Vorgänge c:\programme\microsoft sdks\windows\v6.0a\include\poppack.h 29 /*++ Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Module Name: poppack.h Abstract: This file turns packing of structures off. (That is, it enables automatic alignment of structure fields.) An include file is needed because various compilers do this in different ways. poppack.h is the complement to pshpack?.h. An inclusion of poppack.h MUST ALWAYS be preceded by an inclusion of one of pshpack?.h, in one-to-one correspondence. For Microsoft compatible compilers, this file uses the pop option to the pack pragma so that it can restore the previous saved by the pshpack?.h include file. --*/ #if ! (defined(lint) || defined(RC_INVOKED)) #if ( _MSC_VER >= 800 && !defined(_M_I86)) || defined(_PUSHPOP_SUPPORTED) #pragma warning(disable:4103) #if !(defined( MIDL_PASS )) || defined( __midl ) #pragma pack(pop) #else #pragma pack() #endif #else #pragma pack() #endif #endif // ! (defined(lint) || defined(RC_INVOKED)) Can you explain why? Isnt this a Microsoft File?
