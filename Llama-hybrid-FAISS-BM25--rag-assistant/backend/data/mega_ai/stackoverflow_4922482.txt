This is hard to answer because you have asked many questions with varying complexity. Users may have rights to do anything you want to allow them to do. read only is an option - like on static web pages. if it is a database question, then table visibility comes next, then rows within that table, then finally attributes on those rows. each layer can get a variety of privilege: DELETE INSERT UPDATE SELECT or ALTER. You are then free to think up additional functionality for your site, like the UI, and assign whatever privieges you want to that layer. like pick my layout preferences, all the way down to drag and drop my own widget set. totally up to you.
