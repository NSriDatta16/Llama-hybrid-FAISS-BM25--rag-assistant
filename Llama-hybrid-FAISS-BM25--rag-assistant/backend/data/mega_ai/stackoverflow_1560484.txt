Is your friend experienced at all with running a business? If not, he may not realize the basic truth: If something is your core competence, strategically, do it in-house. E.g. you posess the staff who can do it better AND cheaper (however you mesh the two) than competing solutions. E.g. if your friend has extensive experience developing such types of software, or has a working prototype already that fits your needs, or is Jon Skeet and can develop a CRM application fully born from his head between lunch and dinner. If something is your marginal advantage, do it in-house. E.g. if your friend has ideas on features that would give you a leg up on competition AND can not be easily replicated by competitors . If he merely has a brilliant new widget for a web site that any half-competent developer can clone in 3 weeks, it's not worth it. Otherwise, do NOT do it in-house. You will waste your businesses' resources on something that gives you no advantage over competitors. This is not related, in any way shape or form, to PHP and open source. If you can't develop a qualitatively better solution that will strategically (long term) outperform the opensource solution your competitors use, your software will be a marginal cost to the business, not marginal benefit. Sadly, the only one who can answer the last question is the technical guy, and he may be, like all techies, biased towards homegrown stuff. So as someone in the other response said, you need to trust his judgement or get someone whose judgement you trust, friend or not. Nut be sure the question he is answering is the right question -- the one in bold 2 paragraphs above Hope this clarifies somewhat.
