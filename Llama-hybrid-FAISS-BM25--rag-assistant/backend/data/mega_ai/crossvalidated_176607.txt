Likelihood overflow in Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability

Consider a Bayesian framework where we have priors for some parameters and a likelihood based on the data. Consider the likelihood (and its parametric format) to be very sensitive to the choice of the parameters in a sense that for some not-so-proper parameter proposals, likelihood may overflow and become infinity. This is particularly a problem as in Metropolis-Hastings, you fail to compute the acceptance rate where you have likelihood overflow. So, I wanted to ask if someone has a solution to deal with this situation. I'm looking for solutions on: Avoiding likelihood overflow If likelihood overflow happens, properly calculating acceptance probability
