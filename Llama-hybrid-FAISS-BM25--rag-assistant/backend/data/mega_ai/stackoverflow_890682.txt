I find when comparing two languages popularity using google trends is very interesting. It lets you see what kind of trends over time have show on google key words and plot multiple keywords. With some interesting results like... Sqeak Vs. Smalltalk (It appears smalltalk was in the lead but got passed up in 2004) Cobol Vs. Fortran - Both are trending down pretty fast... Python Vs. Perl - Search two different ways using programming or script as a keyword along with python or perl to prevent false positives for the word python not related to the language. Autoit Vs. AutoHotKey - Interestingly both trending up slowly. If you come up with some good ones please post a comment with them. I used google trends to accurately predict the last two presidential elections so its likely to be a pretty good metric of actual attention given (if keywords are not ambiguous).
