How to distribute a .NET Windows Forms application that talks to Oracle?

I'm building a small .NET Windows Forms application that talks to an Oracle database. I understand that I can use System.Data.OracleClient.dll to talk to Oracle, but it won't work without the Oracle Client installed. The Oracle Client is huge, is there any way I distribute my app (say in a zip file) without it being gigantic? i.e. for System.Data.SqlClient.dll - distribution is easy, the dll is all you need. Does something that easy exist for Oracle too? Additionally, I'm hoping to find an option that doesn't cost $$$ to redistribute. Thanks!
