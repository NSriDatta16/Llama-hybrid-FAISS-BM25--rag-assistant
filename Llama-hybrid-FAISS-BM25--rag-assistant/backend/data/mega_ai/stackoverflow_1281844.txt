Unfortunately there is a problem with the iframeFix in that it is difficult to release the transparent divs once being draggable. I had written another stronger version before but Unfortunately I lost the code... If I manage to resolve the prob I will repost my code. EDIT: OK I worked out a manual but better way of doing it... at least in my case You still create a transparent div over the top of the iframe's container when the containing div is clicked (onmousedown). This transparent div is positioned top:-90%, which should bring it over the iframe (depnding on your styling it may be more like top:-100%;). On the onmouseupEvent of the transparent div, you add the code to remove the transparent divs. JSFUNCTIONS function coverIframes() { $(".normalWindow").append(""); } function uncoverIframes() { $(".cover").remove(); } CSS Styling for transparent div div.cover { width:100%; height:100%; top:-90%; position:relative; } Example HTML
