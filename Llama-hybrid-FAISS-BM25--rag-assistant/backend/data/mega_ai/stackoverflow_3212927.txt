x=(d2.Ticks-x)/10000000 is where the problem lies. F3 runs for less than a second and you are doing integer divisions: remember that 900/1000 == 0 . A simple (rather unelegant) fix is to do a floating point division: x=(d2.Ticks-x)/10000000.0 You might want to use TimeSpan s intead, which are made to measure elapsed time: DateTime start = DateTime.Now; // Do stuff DateTime end = DateTime.Now; TimeSpan elapsed = end - start; double secondsElapsed = elapsed.TotalSeconds;
