This comment is for the future, not for your immediate frequentist statistics-laden question. To obtain direct evidence for fairness of a coin you need to define the state of prior knowledge and to define fairness, e.g, the probability of heads $\theta$ being between 0.49 and 0.51. Then acquire a lot of data and compute the Bayesian posterior probability that $\theta \in [0.49, 0.51]$ . The state of prior knowledge considers such things as the following: Was the coin selected at random from a bag of coins? If so how was the bag selected? If the coin was intentionally made to be unfair, would the person who did this be crafty enough to avoid detection by not making $\theta$ to be outside the interval $[0.4, 0.6]$ ? If so the prior distribution might be uniform on $[0.4, 0.6]$ .
