I discovered that since the app doesn't have a Titlebar, win7 doesn't handle the window drag and therefore doesn't send the WM_SYSCOMMAND at all. In other words, the application was blocking the Titlebar drag because there was no Titlebar to drag. The solution is in part to detect a drag on our mocked up titlebar. After that the window must be restored in SIZE only, not in position. The position needs to be dynamic to the cursor, just like Win7 does it. Thoughts, people?
