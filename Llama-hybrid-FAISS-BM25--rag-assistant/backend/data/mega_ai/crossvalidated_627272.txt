How to interpret survey data with demographic information?

I have little statistical experience, but am helping to run a community needs survey for my organization. Many of the questions have a yes/no or multiple choice answer format. For example, "Do you have health insurance?" and if they aren't yes no, they are multiple choice "Why don't you have health insurance?" "1) Can't afford it 2) Don't know how to sign up 3) Not eligible due to immigration status" We also collect demographic information: income, race, gender, county of residence, etc. I am compiling a report on this data. I was initially planning to just present the responses to each question- 45% of people surveyed don't have health insurance. But of course- there is large and meaningful variability by demographics. I.e., 16/187 (8.5%) participants with household incomes greater than 60k don't have health insurance, while 48/223 (21.5%) participants with household incomes lower than 60k don't have health insurance. Is there anything I can do to further analyze this? Or do I report it just as I stated above? All help is greatly appreciated. We are an underfunded nonprofit and hoping to use our data to write grants and develop new programs to help folks in the community!
