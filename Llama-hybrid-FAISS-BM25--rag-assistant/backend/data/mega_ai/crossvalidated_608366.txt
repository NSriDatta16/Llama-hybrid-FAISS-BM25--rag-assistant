I believe I was correct in that assuming that I can marginalize out the noise from the joint-density of $Q_t$ and $\hat{Q}_t$ $$p\left(Q_t \middle| Y_t, \theta\right) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} p\left(Q_t, \hat{Q}_t\left(Y_t,\theta\right) = X \middle| Y_t,\theta\right)dX$$ . While it wasn't explicitly stated previously, $$p\left(Q_t, \hat{Q}_t\left(Y_t,\theta\right) \middle| Y_t,\theta\right) = p\left(Q_t \middle| \hat{Q}_t\left(Y_t, \theta\right), Y_t , \theta\right) \times p\left(\hat{Q}_t\left(Y_t,\theta\right) \middle| Y_t, \theta\right)$$ follows from Bayes' Law. It should be noted sometimes these integrals have closed-form solutions. For example when $p\left(Q_t \middle| \hat{Q}_t\left(Y_t, \theta\right), Y_t , \theta\right)$ is also Gaussian. Which is the case encountered many times where a Gaussian prior is assumed in Bayesian statistics. In my specific example the conditional density is log-Gaussian, numerical integration techniques such as Gaussian quadrature must be used.
