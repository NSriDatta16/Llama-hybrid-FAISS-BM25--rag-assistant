GZipping is handled by the webserver and browser. So you should check your webserver and webservers configuration, that it gzips the response. For the minification: JSON is already a pretty minimal protocol. For still shortening it and its indices you probably won’t find something, as you’ll also have to map it on both sides, server in PHP and client in JavaScript. Adapting existing minifiers also requires attention, as it has to be consistent and map, not only minify, as you’ll have to decode it on the other side again.
