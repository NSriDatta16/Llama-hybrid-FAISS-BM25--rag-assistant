Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Random Walk for Forecasting

I would like to confirm my understanding. Is it true that a (simple) exponential smoothing model with alpha (smoothing constant) = 1 is the same as MA(1), which is in turn the same as a random walk model? (i.e. using only the most recent observation as the forecast for all future periods)?
