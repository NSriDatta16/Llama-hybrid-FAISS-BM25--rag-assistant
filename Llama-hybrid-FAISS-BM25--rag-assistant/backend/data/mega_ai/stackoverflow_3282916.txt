Class Weight Syntax in Kernlab?

Hi I am trying out classification for imbalanced dataset in R using kernlab package, as the class distribution is not 1:1 I am using the option of class.weights in the ksvm() function call however I do not get any difference in the classification scenario when I add weights or remove weights? So the question is what is the correct syntax for declaring the class weights? I am using the following function calls: model = ksvm(dummy[1:466], lab_tr,type='C-svc',kernel=pre,cross=10,C=10,prob.model=F,class.weights=c("Negative"=0.7,"Positive"=0.3)) #this is the function call with class weights model = ksvm(dummy[1:466], lab_tr,type='C-svc',kernel=pre,cross=10,C=10,prob.model=F) Can anyone please comment on this, am I following the right syntax of adding weights? Also I discovered that if we use the weights with prob.model=T the ksvm function returns a error!
