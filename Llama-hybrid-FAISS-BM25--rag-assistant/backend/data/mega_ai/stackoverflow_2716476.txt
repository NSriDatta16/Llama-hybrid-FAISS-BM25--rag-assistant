I've never seen GUIDs being used for sessions, but there are a couple of additional methods I have seen that do add a little more security. Storing the user's IP - if you need to force a session change based on locations (sometimes geoIP stuff will do this) Storing the user's HTTP_USER_AGENT header string. Can provide a bit of security against hijacking if the hijacker happens to be using a different browser. There's a great article on session hijacking countermeasures on Wikipedia, actually. That being said, I would imagine that anyone storing a GUID as part of a session to use in session security might be failing to see a better solution (such as session regeneration). I can see other uses for a GUID to be stored (maybe it's part of a random generator for a game), but not for use with session security.
