the sample variance of the measurements A1, A2, A3, for a person X is: \begin{equation} \sigma_X(A) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{3} (A_{i,X} - \bar{A}_X)^2 \end{equation} where $\bar{A}_X$ is the arithmetic mean of the measurement A for person X. Now you can look at the $\sigma_X(A)$ values across all samples (people) in your study, and for example consider mean value $\bar{\sigma}(A)$ to quantify the reliability of measurements A. \begin{equation} \bar{\sigma}(A) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_X \sigma_X(A) \end{equation} Another way of looking at it is if you consider each $A_i$, for $i=1,2,3$, across all samples. Define $\bar{A}_i$ as the mean value of the $A_i$ measurements across samples. This allows us to characterize the standard deviation $\sigma_i(A)$ of a particular measurement $A_i$ across samples. \begin{equation} \sigma_i(A) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{X} (A_{i,X} - \bar{A}_i)^2 \end{equation} The average $\sigma_i(A)$ for all $i=1,2,3$ indicates the average variability of the measurement A. Hope it was helpful!
