Multinomial logistic regression with "constant variable"

I am encountering some problems with setting up a multinomial logistics regression (stepwise). My data/model is the following: Dependent variable: strategy1/strategy2/no preference "Indenpendent" variable: risk perception value (prob*impact in percentage) Moderator: risk profile (likert scale) +some other control variables (demogrpahics etc.) Since the risk perception value is given, there is no variance in the values. I basically have two scenarios, each with different risk peception values (high_prob*high_impact and low_prob*high_impact) and these values are the same for all respondents. This is because the choice/preference for a certain strategy is supposed to be dependent on the (given) risk perception). However, when I run the regression for ONE of the scenarios with only this variable it gives me the following output: No significance level for the varaible but only for the intercept. For the significance level of the variable it only shows a "." (dot). So, SPSS does not give me a significance level for the variable (probably because of no variance), only for the intercept. Do I just have to accept it or is there any way to tackle this problem? Is this output even useful? Would it be better to generate a random perceived value in the range of 0.9 to 0.99 for e.g. high probability to get some variance? And then cluster them in two categories, thereby obtaining two perceived values for each scenario? Thank you very much in advance.
