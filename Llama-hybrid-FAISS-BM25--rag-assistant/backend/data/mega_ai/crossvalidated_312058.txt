I think you are doing it right. If CPPI goes up 0.10% monthly, then it is about 1.2% annually (actually $(1+.001)^{12}-100$%)...what happens, along the way, is irrelevant if you don't have monthly sales data. Of course, it could be that there were big spikes in monthly CPPI (followed by zero or even negative values), and monthly sales may be profoundly affected by that. But you don't have that data, so it will all get averaged out. In reality, it is unlikely to come out much different. But you only know if you have the data.
