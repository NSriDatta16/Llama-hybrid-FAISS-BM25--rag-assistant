cart page is not showing in magento

hi i have made the some changes in checkout.xml and after this cart page stop showing so i have again revert all the changes. but still cart page is not showing. then i download the theme folder and place it in default magento and everything looking as it appear before. so i think there might be some wrong entry in database. can anyone tell the table name so i can modify that. thanks
