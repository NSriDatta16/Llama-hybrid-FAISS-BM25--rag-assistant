Howe can I retrieve the correct image with correct alpha channel from QMimeData

If we drag or copy an image with alpha channel to a application / clipboard it lose the alpha channel using Qt. Using: QImage clipImage = pMimeData->imageData().value(); gives us 32 bit image with black background where it suppose to be transparent. The format of an image is always QImage::Format_RGB32. I tried to convert it to QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied and to extract the alpha channel but I received for alpha channel only black background which covers the whole portion of image. Howe can I retrieve the correct image with correct alpha channel from QMimeData. Cheers Dejan
