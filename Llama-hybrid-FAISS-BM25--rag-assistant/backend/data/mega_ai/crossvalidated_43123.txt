Actually in PCA, there is no order on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues . They are just eigenvectors and their associated eigenvalues. It is a best practise to sort them bei their eigenvalues, as experience shows the eigenvectors associated with strong eigenvalues are more important and/or significant. However, this is just a rule of thumb. Fact s that the Eigenvalues measure the variance in the one-dimensional subspace. If you find a good other measure, you can sort them differently. For example, you might want to compute the variance only on the .10-.90 quantile to avoid outliers from influencing the result too much. And if you get vectors out of something else, you can compute the variance of the projection to this 1d space, and you get a value comparable to the eigenvalues in the PCA case.
