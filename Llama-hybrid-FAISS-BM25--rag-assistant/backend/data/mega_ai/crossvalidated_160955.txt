weighted glm model selection

Can AIC values between different weighed models be compared to select the best model (ie the model with the lowest weighted AIC)? For example, if my response variable is the 'Average Sales Per Person' where this equals to (Sum of Sales / Number of People), so naturally I would like to assign more weight to groups with higher number of people. I run the following two models: Gamma glm(formula = AvrSales ~ x + y, family = Gamma(link = "identity"),weights=NumPeople) Null deviance: 692476 on 2181 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 574155 on 2171 degrees of freedom AIC: 28802851 Normal glm(formula = AvrSales ~ x + y, family = gaussian(link = "identity"), weights = NumPeople) Null deviance: 5.1948e+10 on 2181 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 4.4921e+10 on 2171 degrees of freedom AIC: 33158 Using AIC as a model selection criteria, would the Normal model then be selected since it has a lower AIC? Or are both models bad at explaining the response since the Residual Deviance is so high? If I remove the weights, then the opposite conclusion can be reached. Gamma (with out weights) glm(formula = AvrSales ~ x + y, family = Gamma(link = "identity")) Null deviance: 10903 on 2181 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 10685 on 2171 degrees of freedom AIC: 25738 Normal (with out weights) glm(formula = AvrSales ~ x + y, family = gaussian(link = "identity")) Null deviance: 847754154 on 2181 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 824882849 on 2171 degrees of freedom AIC: 34239 What makes sense here? If I must use weights inside my model, how is then possible to compare different models subjectively? Any advice, or references to literature would be greatly appreciated.
