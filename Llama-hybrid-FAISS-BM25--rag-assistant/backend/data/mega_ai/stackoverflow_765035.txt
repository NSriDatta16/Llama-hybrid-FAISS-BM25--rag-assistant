In SQL , a cluster can also refer to a specific physical ordering of rows. For example, consider a database with two tables: INVOICES and INVOICE_ITEMS. If many INVOICE_ITEMs are inserted concurrently, chances are that items of the same invoice end up on multiple physical blocks of the underlying storage. When reading such an invoice, unneeded data will be read together with the interesting rows. Clustering INVOICE_ITEMS over the foreign key to INVOICES groups rows of items the same invoice together in the same block, thus reducing the amount of necessary read operations when accessing the invoice.

This can be done for performance reasons (two servers can answer more requests than a single one) or redundancy (if one server crashes, the others still work). Such configurations often need special software or setup to work. Some services, like serving static web content, can be clustered very easily. Others, like RDBMS, need complicated replication schemes to coordinate. Read about computer clusters on wikipedia. In statistics , a cluster is a "group of items so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different clusters." Read about Cluster analysis on wikipedia.
