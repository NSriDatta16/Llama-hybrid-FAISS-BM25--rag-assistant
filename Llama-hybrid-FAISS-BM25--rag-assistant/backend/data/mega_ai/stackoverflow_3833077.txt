Why is a variable length array not declared not as a pointer sometimes?

I see this in code sometimes: struct S { int count; // length of array in data int data[1]; }; Where the storage for S is allocated bigger than sizeof(S) so that data can have more space for its array. It is then used like: S *s; // allocation s->data[3] = 1337; My question is, why is data not a pointer? Why the length-1 array?
