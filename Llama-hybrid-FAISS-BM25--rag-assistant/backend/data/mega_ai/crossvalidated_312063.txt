estimation of standard errors after logistic regression

i have following data Pass Hours 0 0.5 0 0.75 0 1 0 1.25 0 1.5 0 1.75 1 1.75 0 2 1 2.25 0 2.5 1 2.75 0 3 1 3.25 0 3.5 1 4 1 4.25 1 4.5 1 4.75 1 5 1 5.5 and i want to test whether number of hours of studying can help me to predict passing in subject, i have estimated everything in excel, here is my calculations in wikipedia, there is also such kind of information about coefficients i would like to know step by step how to calculate 1. standard errors 2.Z value 3. P value for standard errors i found following formulas i have calculated predicted values for estimated coefficients predicted 0.034711145 0.049773969 0.070893216 0.100030106 0.139346146 0.190838272 0.190838272 0.255704879 0.33353166 0.421627469 0.515011185 0.607358348 0.692616526 0.766479707 0.87444625 0.910276501 0.936622684 0.955609901 0.969096422 0.985194054 and i have calculated errors residual -0.034711145 -0.049773969 -0.070893216 -0.100030106 -0.139346146 -0.190838272 0.809161728 -0.255704879 0.66646834 -0.421627469 0.484988815 -0.607358348 0.307383474 -0.766479707 0.12555375 0.089723499 0.063377316 0.044390099 0.030903578 0.014805946 but now how to calculate? pleas help me to continue, thanks in advance EDITED : on the based on this tutorial How to compute the standard errors of a logistic regression's coefficients i have estimated standard errors and z values in matlab and excel, how let p values(Wald test), how can i do it?
