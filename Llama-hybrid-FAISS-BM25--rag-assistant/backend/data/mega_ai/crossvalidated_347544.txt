First, $R^2$ is valid regardless. The question is whether it tells you what you want to know. $R^2$ here is a measure of the linear relationship between week and number of apples. But that's not what you want to know. Trees don't give fruit in a way that grows steadily over time. They give fruit in certain seasons. Apple trees in the northern hemisphere usually give fruit in the late summer or early fall. So, while you have 100 weeks of data, you really only have 2 repeats - year 1 and year 2. That's not enough data to tell you anything about change in harvest from year to year. Now, let's suppose that was a fake example and you really have something that works week-by-week - let's say it was number of light bulbs produced in a factory. Then you have a more reasonable amount of data, but you still may have problems. This is time series data, which has its own set of procedures. There may be seasonality (even if it won't be as extreme as with apples).
