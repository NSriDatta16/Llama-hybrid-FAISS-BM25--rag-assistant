The best way to do a live stream update with AJAX is with polling. Set a timer, make an AJAX request to the page you just posted, add the response to the page with javascript :) Here are a few pages to make the ajax polling, even tho it is pretty simple in nature, and a setTimeout() would be good enough for the job http://www.nickriggs.com/posts/simple-ajax-polling-plugin-for-jquery/ https://github.com/RobertFischer/JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater/ Good luck !
