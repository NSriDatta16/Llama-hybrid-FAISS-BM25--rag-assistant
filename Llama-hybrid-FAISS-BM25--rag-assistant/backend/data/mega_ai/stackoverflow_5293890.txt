I had the same issue. Take a look at this link: Android Fragment Duplication I wonder if the fact that you're passing the container into the inflater.inflate() method causes it to create the new fragment inside of the old one instead of a wholesale replace. I've been providing 'null' to my inflaters in the working version. Here's the essentials from the version I have working... @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState){ View newFrag = new View(getActivity().getApplicationContext()); newFrag = inflater.inflate(R.id.frag, null); return newFrag; }
