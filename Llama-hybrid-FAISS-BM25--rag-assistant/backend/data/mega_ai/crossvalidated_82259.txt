Is is valid to calculate the mean of multiple neural networks results?

Recently I've been playing around with Artificial Neural Networks models and I came across a problem that I can't figure out. Essentially, I'm playing around with a model trained on a relatively small sample from which the forecast performance of the trained neural networks model is limited. However, I noticed that if I run the model multiple times, the average of the sample forecast tends to be more satisfying. My question is, is this a valid way to utilize the forecast results? Is there some other way around that I should seek to achieve a similar goal?
