Large Analytics Database Responsive Retrieval (MYSQL)

I want to create a 'google analytics' type application for the web - i.e. a web-based tool to do some reporting and graphing for my database. The problem is that the database is HUGE, so I can't do the queries in real time because they will take too long and the tool will be unresponsive. How can I use a cron job to help me? What is the best way to be able to make my graphs responsive? I think I will need to denomalize some of my database tables, but how do I make these queries faster? What intermediate values can I store in another database table to make it quicker? Thanks!
