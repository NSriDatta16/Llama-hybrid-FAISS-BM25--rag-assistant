OpenCV 2.2 python bindings for machine learning part

I'm interesting in getting the connection from Python to machine learning part of OpenCV 2.2. OpenCV 2.2 already includes python bindings but only to the computer vision (cv) part of it and not to the machine learning (ml) part. Where could I get some third party bindings to also have access to the machine learning part
