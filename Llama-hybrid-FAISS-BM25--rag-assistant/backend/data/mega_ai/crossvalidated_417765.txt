Calling them all 0 so their distribution is a degenerate normal with mean 0 and variance 0 (point mass at 0) makes sense to me. As the comments note, however, a constant variable gives no separation in your regression, so you can discard that variable. Do note why youâ€™ve excluded the variable so you have a rebuttal when your reviewer, professor, or boss critiques your model that has omitted data, however. EDIT If you elect to run PCA on variables that are not centered, your results will be different with the constant variables included and when they are excluded.
