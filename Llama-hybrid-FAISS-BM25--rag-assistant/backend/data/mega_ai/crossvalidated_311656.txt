Regression is a particular case of a multivariate ARIMA (also known more widely as a Transfer Function ; 1 endogenous and 1 or more exogenous ). Model identification of a TF model is discussed here http://www.math.cts.nthu.edu.tw/download.php?filename=569_fe0ff1a2.pdf&dir=publish&title=Ruey+S.+Tsay-Lec1 and here https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75/ . Automatic identification of a TF model is available and discussed here How to include control variables in an Intervention analysis with ARIMA? AND http://autobox.com/pdfs/ForecastingSeminar.pdf It is exactly what you asked for ... a combination of regression and time series while taking into account "unusual activity" such as pulses, level shifts, seasonal pulses,time trends ... Since your data set is daily the seasonal pulses would reflect day-of-the-week activity.
