As you have already said, if $\tilde p$ is the empirical distribution of the data then by definition $\tilde p(x,y)=\frac{n(x,y)}{N}$ where $N$ is the total sample size and $n(x,y)$ is the number of times $(x,y)$ occurs in the sample. Thus : $$\log\prod p(x,y)^{\tilde p(x,y)}=\log\left(\prod p(x,y)^{n(x,y)}\right)^{1/N}=\frac{1}{N}\log\prod p(x,y)^{n(x,y)}$$ The quantity on the left is thus proportional to the log likelihood. Since the main goal is maximizing it, the proportionality constant can be skipped. I guess the authors mistakenly call it "log likelihood" which is a minor misnomer. This quantity is the average log likelihood per observation , that is easier to use because somehow independent of the sample size and easier to compare across datasets of different sizes. Personally I always work with this quantity for this reason and also call it "log likelihood" informally.
