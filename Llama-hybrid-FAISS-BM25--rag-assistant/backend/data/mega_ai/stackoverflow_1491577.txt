itextsharp pdfpcell header

I'd like to have a table of cells of class PdfPCell each with a tiny header, main string and tiny footer. I can't find a way to insert them since HeaderandFooter is not allowed element to add to the cell, one paragraph overwrites another and so on. Any ideas? Thanks in advance
