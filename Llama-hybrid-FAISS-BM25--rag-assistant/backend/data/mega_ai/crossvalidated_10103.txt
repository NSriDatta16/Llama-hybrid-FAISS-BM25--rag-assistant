If a potential outcome has never been observed, then you have no information about the effect of covariates on it. So any outcome-specific covariate effects are unidentifiable. If you assume constant covariate effects, then this outcome has no effect on their estimation, so you might as well omit it from the data. More generally, you do have some information about the frequency of that outcome, but logistic regression (multinomial or otherwise) cannot handle this at all, because if you insist on having this outcome, the corresponding intercept has to be $-\infty$.
