I can assure you that the Dictionary works fine in .Net :) I think you need to be pragmatic when writing your tests and not try to mock everything. Because how far can you go? How would you mock an int? Obviously it is discussable where is the border line, but I usually don't mock: .Net framework as long as it doesn't connect to some external resources my own trivial classes (i.e. ones that only store data) static helper methods (these should be really simple though), including extension methods
