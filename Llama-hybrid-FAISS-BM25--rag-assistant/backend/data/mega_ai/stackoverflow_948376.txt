Replacing repeated words within a string with integers

I have problem in string maniputation with C++. The Rule: if the same 'word' is repeated from sentences or paragraph I want it to become an integer. Example: input: we prefer questions that can be answered, not just we discussed that. output: 1 prefer questions 2 can be answered, not just 1 discussed 2. 1 we 2 that
