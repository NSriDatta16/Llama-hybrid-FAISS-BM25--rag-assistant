The term channels refers to communication science . It is not a specifc term from data science or artifical intelligence. In general a channel is transmitting information using signals (A channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information) For an image these are usually colors (rgb-codes) arranged by pixels, that transmit the actual infromation to the receiver. In the simplest way (digital) colors are created using 3 information (or so called channels --> a mix of Red, Green & Blue). However, images can involve opacity (rgba - here "a" stands for alpha and is the corresponding channel for opacity), or 3D layering (beta channel). The amount of channels can vary for your image. However, for most images a 3-Channel (rgb) is used. So when the author of the book writes: The filter must have the same number of channels as the input image so that the element-wise multiplication can take place. she means, that mathematical operations (kernel filter) may can not be applied if you pass a 3-Channel to your CNN, whereas you may deal with images that make use of higher channels.
