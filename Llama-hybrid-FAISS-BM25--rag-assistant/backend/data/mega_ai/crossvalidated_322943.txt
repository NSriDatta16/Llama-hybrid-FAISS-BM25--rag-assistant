How to predict employee's attendance based on previous attendance

I am using this website to learn Machine Learning. I am working on a simple project to learn it. I want to predict employee's attendance. This is the data in the file: 1,0,1,0,1,0,John The index of the columns is the day number. John is the name of the employee. 1 means that he came to work, and 0 means he didn't. So according to these data: Day 1: 1 Day 2: 0 Day 3: 1 Day 4: 0 Day 5: 1 Day 6: 0 I want to predict day number 7 based on the previous days. I am expecting that there is a chance that 100% John will come in day number 7. Because it seems to be a pattern that every day he comes on the odd days. I want to be able to tell the probability he will come. The above example is easy for learning, but it can be more complex: Day 1: 1 Day 2: 0 Day 3: 1 Day 4: 1 Day 5: 1 Day 6: 0 ... Day 49: 1 Day 50: 1 Back to the first example, I added the information to a dataset: import pandas url = r'C:\Users\myUser\Desktop\employee.txt' names = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'class'] dataset = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names) dataset This the result: But I don't know how to get the prediction. I want it to tell me "the chance that John will come on day 7 based on his previous attendance".
