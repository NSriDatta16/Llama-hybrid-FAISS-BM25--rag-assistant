Cannot run VSTS LoadTest at a time

I have a VSTS project with a list of 30 LoadTest tests that I want to run sequentially. All tests are independent from each other. When I try to run all the tests, it starts with the first test and it executes it perfectly, but once the first test is finished, it automatically starts to mark the rest of the tests as completed, but without executing them. Do I have to configure any option to run all of them together? Am I missing something? Note: when the first test is finished it also asks me if I want to view the "detailed results from the load test". Any advice/comment is welcomed... Thanks, albert UPDATE (16/07/2010) More info... I'm trying to run the load tests as in the image that you can see at freeimagehosting.net/image.php?69cc93fa7b.gif. After the first loadtest is finished the rest of them are just marked as completed.
