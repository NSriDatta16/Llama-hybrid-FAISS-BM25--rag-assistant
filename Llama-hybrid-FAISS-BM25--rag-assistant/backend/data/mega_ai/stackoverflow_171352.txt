c# store user settings in database

Is there an easy method to store a person's user settings in a sql 2000 database. Ideally all settings in one field so I don't keep having to edit the table every time I add a setting. I am thinking along the lines of serialize a settings class if anyone has an example. The reason I don't want to use the built in .NET user settings stored in persistent storage is work uses super mandatory profiles so upon a users log off the settings are cleared which is a pain. I posted asking for any solutions to this previously but didn't get much of a response.
