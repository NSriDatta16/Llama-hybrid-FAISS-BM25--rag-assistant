How can I practice my SQL Server, Sybase, and Oracle skills on a linux box?

I have a linux box. When I had a Windows box, I was able to download the free non-commericial use MS SQL Server. How can I run free personal copies of SQL Server, Sybase, or Oracle on my linux box? I don't need to to have any permanent databases or any great amount of storage. I just want to (re-)familiarize myself with these different SQL dialects, and compare techniques and timing to the MySQL and postgresql I do have installed. Thanks.
