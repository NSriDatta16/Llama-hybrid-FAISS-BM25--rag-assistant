Embedding the Java h2 database programmatically

At the moment we use HSQLDB as an embedded database, but we search for a database with less memory footprint as the data volume grows. Derby / JavaDB is not an option at the moment because it stores properties globally in the system properties. So we thought of h2 . While we used HSQLDB we created a Server-object, set the parameters and started it. This is described here (and given as example in the class org.hsqldb.test.TestBase). The question is: Can this be done analogous with the h2 database, too? Do you have any code samples for that? Scanning the h2-page, I did not find an example.
