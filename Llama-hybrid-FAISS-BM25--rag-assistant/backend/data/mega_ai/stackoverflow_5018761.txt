WPF Drag and Drop blocking operations

I am working with a WPF application that is using Drag and Drop functionality. The Drag and Drop operation is a blocking operation and is having some negative side effects in my application. I have recently added the use of an adorner to show the item dragging. The problem with this is that in order to do this, I need to track the current position of the mouse. When a Drag and Drop operation is initiated, it blocks further execution until the item is dropped. I have read that a fix for this is to execute the drag and drop in its own thread, and then update the UI. I read this article here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741870.aspx I am not sure if this is what I am looking to do, but It sounds like what I need. Is there another fix around this? Here is the code that I need to execute. private void FieldItemGrid_PreviewMouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (_isDown) { if ((_isDragging == false)) { /*Add Adorner to Item that is being dragged*/ DragStarted(e.GetPosition(this)); } if (_selectedElement != null) { /*Begin Drag Operation*/ DragDrop.DoDragDrop(_selectedElement, _selectedElement, DragDropEffects.Move); } /*The following code is not executed until the dragged item is released*/ if (_isDragging) { /*Update Current Position of Mouse to update adorner position*/ DragMoved(e.GetPosition(this)); } } }
