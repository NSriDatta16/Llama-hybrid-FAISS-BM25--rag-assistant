JavaFX in the wild?

Does anybody know of any real-world web applications based on JavaFX? I'm an experienced Java programmer considering starting a website while I'm not at my day job. I don't have a lot of expertise on the UI side, so I'm looking for the best way to leverage my existing skills to create something that can provide an awesome RIA experience. Only trouble is, I don't know of any sites that are implemented using JavaFX, since it's so new. I'd like to see what it's capable of.
