Extracting data, sorting and removing duplicates from an array using python 2.7

I have a text file data set in the form of [['09', '07', '02', '11'], ['04', '09', '11', '04'], ['06', '07', '02', '02'], ['06', '06', '09', '09'], ['04', '11', '04', '09'], ['09', '04', '11', '04'], ['06', '09', '09', '04'] .....] I want to extract the complete data from it, sort it and remove duplicates of the same (i.e., the same row should not appear again). The output should look like (in rows): 11090702 11090404 07060202 09090606 09090604 I want this data for machine learning algorithm implementation.
