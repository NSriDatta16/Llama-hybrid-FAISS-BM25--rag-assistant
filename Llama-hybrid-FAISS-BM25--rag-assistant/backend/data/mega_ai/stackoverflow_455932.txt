A/B testing and stats solutions

I've been looking for a good testing framework for months, not finding anything, so I've just been building my own. This is what I want to do: - track arbitrary behaviors (e.g. # of photos viewed, # of comments posted) - track correlation between arbitrary variables and those behaviors (e.g, how do different versions of this prompt affect average # of photos viewed?) This kind of thing should be a core part of agile development. What's out there? I know Google Website Optimizer is one of the answers, but you can only track behaviors that end in a single "success" page. It'd be great to have a plugin that can work within your code (Rails in my case) and feed into a nice hosted service with pretty graphs...
