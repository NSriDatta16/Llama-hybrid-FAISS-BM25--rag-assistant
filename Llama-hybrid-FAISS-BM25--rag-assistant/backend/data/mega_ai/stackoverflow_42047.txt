I would suggest using Metaphone , not Soundex. As noted, Soundex was developed in the 19th century for American names. Metaphone will give you some results when checking the work of poor spellers who are "sounding it out", and spelling phonetically. Edit distance is good at catching typos such as repeated letters, transposed letters, or hitting the wrong key. Consider the application to decide which will fit your users bestâ€”or use both together, with Metaphone complementing the suggestions produced by Levenshtein. With regard to the original question, I've used n-grams successfully in information retrieval applications.
