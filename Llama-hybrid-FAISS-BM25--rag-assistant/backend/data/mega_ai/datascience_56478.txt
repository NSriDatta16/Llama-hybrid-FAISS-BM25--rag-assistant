"train models with all historical data just one time, and then update the model just with new data (each day I have new samples" Seems you are referring to incremental ML algorithm - beyond "experimental data science" mindset. See "Incremental principal component analysis (IPCA)" at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_incremental_pca.html for an example of algorithm design and use. If that helps then you might want to look into #ConceptDrift .
