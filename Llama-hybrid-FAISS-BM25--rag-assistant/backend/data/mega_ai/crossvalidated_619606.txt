Are the weights of a linear combination of identifiable Bayesian parameters predicting another variable also identifiable?

Suppose I have a statistical model with observed random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_m$ and Bayesian parameters $\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n$ that are identifiable. Now I want to extend my model by including an observed and non-degenerate random variable $Y$ and parameters $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ in the form $$Y = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \theta_j.$$ Are the parameters $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ necessarily identifiable?
