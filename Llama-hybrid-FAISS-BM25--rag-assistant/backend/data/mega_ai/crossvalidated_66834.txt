I am trying to think through a few issues about time series modeling. Are univariate time series methods enough? Do they extract all the relevant information from the particular time series? If they do not, then how you can continue your analysis? There are of course well-known methods for univariate time series analysis but perhaps you have to account also some other information in other time series. Suppose that the expenditure for beer $y(t)$ is effected by many things like season, holidays, advertisiment etc. Your model might have to account these issues. So in the end it could be that you have a model like this: $$y(t)=A(L)y(t)+\mathrm{Seasonal\_deterministic\_effects}+\mathrm{various\_pulses}+B(L)x(t)+\varepsilon(t)$$
