Your first approach will be fine; see for example here for more background. The KS test works for unbalanced data sets. (And yes, you ought never to average p -values, at least not by taking an arithmetic mean. If you do decide to run multiple draws, consider Fisher's method. But you don't need the sampling approach.)
