"What would be the pros and cons to using a tool like this as opposed to a requirements management tool?" While it seems like a great idea, what you run into are people who can't and won't write. People who can't write -- well -- can't write. They can't communicate with an email or a wiki or any medium outside voice. Some people are "disorganized". Actually, writing is too linear and they don't think linearly. Some people don't get the "write to your audience" and write stuff that's incomprehensible. Sometimes you can't even figure out what they're talking about, much less what they're writing about. They talk in jargon or code. They don't know much but insist on being heard. Some people won't write. Some people refuse to make commitments. Even in a wiki where it can be retracted. They feel they must pre-discuss everything. Some people are in the habit of doing everything by giving direction to someone else. They either don't write for themselves, or, they make people stand around in their office and listen to them talk and type. Some people are generally toxic on any kind of project. They spring new requirements at the last minute. Their first response is "that will never work". They don't brainstorm well. When they say it work work, and you beg them for an improvement, they don't have one. They just know it won't work. My experience is that only programmers can use a Wiki successfully. And only senior-level programmers. N00bz don't have enough experience to sort out requirements from design from rumors and management fluff. N00bz don't always have the language skills to write clearly. They may eventually, but one look at their Javadoc comments indicates that they're struggling with the "clarity" part of writing. It's very appealing. I'm hoping for people to get better at using wiki's because I think it could have a lot of advantages over more traditional approaches where one person interviews everyone and writes things down. But it requires a level of confidence and skill in communication that few people seem to have.
