It looks to be that your AJAX requests are returning entire HTML pages, and that's no good. Try returning just the data you need in JSON. Also, unless you're data is going to be getting a lot bigger, I would suggest not worrying about using AJAX. You've got about two paragraphs and a url or two for each to load for each image, making about 32 paragraphs, which isn't much. Having an animation wait for an AJAX call to complete is going to make things chopy and cause delays. I would suggest embedding the data you need as a JSON data island into the page before it is sent to the client.
