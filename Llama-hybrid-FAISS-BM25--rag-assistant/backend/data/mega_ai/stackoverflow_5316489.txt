Here's the query I ended up with: SELECT _id, category FROM table_name GROUP BY category; I used the rawQuery() function on an SQLiteDatabase object to carry this out. The "GROUP BY" piece was the key towards getting the right results, so thanks to user Sagar for pointing me in the right direction. Do consider user Al Sutton's answer to this question as well, as it may be a more elegant solution to this problem. Thanks everyone!
