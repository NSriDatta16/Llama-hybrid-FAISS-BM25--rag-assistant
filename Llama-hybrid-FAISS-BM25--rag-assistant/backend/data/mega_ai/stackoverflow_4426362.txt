C++ time series library (analysis and processing)

I'm looking to get Stack Overflowers' advice and suggestion on time-series libraries written in C++, some of the constraints and requirements for the library: Performance is very critical Capable of handling very large data sets (1 MB - 100 TB range) Various kind of discretization/grouping methodologies Basic functionality (n-avg, EMA, smoothing, forecasting, normalization) Suitable for use in a multi-threaded environments Free or open source preferred, however commercial libraries are welcome Libraries capable of delegating to GPU -based calculations are welcome
