Bayesian optimizations of hyper-parameters - magical curve based on two data points?

I am trying to understand how Bayesian optimizations of hyper-parameters works in practice. Question 1: How shape of this curve (solid blue line in the middle) is calculated given Gaussian kernel. I understand that the kernel is a way to measure distance between points on $x$-axis. I read there is an underlying Gaussian process etc, but what are the formulas to get this shape? How come that after just 2 iterations I have this non-trivial curves with multiple extrema? Question 2: How does it work with different kernels? How measuring distance on $x$-axis implies shape of the curve in this post ?
