C++/CLI delivers very effectively on the promise of uniting Managed and Unmanaged code. It lets you expose what feels like a perfectly native C# library with 100% access to native C++/libraries "on the inside". It's not an exercise in elegance but in the history of practical programming tools what compares? If you need LINQ and WPF, just use C#. That's the beauty of C++/CLI: write your Managed wrapper and then go back to C#. I don't see C++/CLI intending to replace C# for day to day use.
