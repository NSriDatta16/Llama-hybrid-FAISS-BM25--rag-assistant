It's wrong to state the question the way you worded it. For instance, a significant chunk of machine learning can be called statistical learning . So, your comparison is like apples vs. fruit tarts. However, I'll go with the way you framed it, and claim the following: when it comes to prediction nothing can be done without some form of statistics because prediction inherently has randomness (uncertainty) in it. Consider this: despite huge success of machine learning in some applications it has absolutely nothing to show off in asset price prediction. Nothing at all. Why? Because in most developed liquid markets asset prices are inherently stochastic. You can run machine learning all day long to observe and learn about radioactive decay of atoms, and it will never be able to predict the next atom's decay time, simply because it is random. As an aspiring statistician it would be foolish on your side to not master machine learning, because it's one of the hottest applications of statistics, unless, of course, you know for sure that you are going to academia. Anyone who's likely to go work in the industry needs to master ML. There is no animosity or competition between statistics and ML crowds at all. In fact, if you like programming you'll feel at home in ML field
