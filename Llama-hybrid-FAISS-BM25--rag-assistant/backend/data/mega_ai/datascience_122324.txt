Sometimes these values are not used anymore, they are just used to calculate the best model for each fold and its prediction error (on the validation folds). And if the error satisfies you, at each fold or on average then the model is fitted again (both the parameters and the hyperparameters) with all the (test+validation) data and tested again with the test data. Sometimes it's used taking the average of the hyperparameters on all partitions, or even better we can create an ensemble model averaging all models. In fact the hyperparameters are not important in the final model, they are used just during the fitting process.
