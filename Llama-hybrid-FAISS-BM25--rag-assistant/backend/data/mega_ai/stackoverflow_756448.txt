How do I test my email settings without sending a message?

As part of my app's config process, I have a sanity checker that validates all user-supplied data. This includes email server settings that the app uses to send email. I'd like a simple sanity check on those settings without actually sending any email. It'd be great if this could support all standard flavors of SMTP setups including those with authentication/ssl/etc. It doesn't need to be exhaustive but the more coverage, the better. Currently all I do is verify I can open a connection to the given server on the given port. Something a little deeper would be nice. Note: I'm not trying to validate email addresses--that's not relevant to this question.
