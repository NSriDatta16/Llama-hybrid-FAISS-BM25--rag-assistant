I don't know about after as you may have very few non-representative points, especially if your optimizer solved your problem quickly (which one would expect from a heuristic algorithm), and these points may be highly correlated. You will probably have to solve this separately from your optimization, good news is such algorithms already exist, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is used in Bayesian statistics to sample from a posterior distribution - or in your case given an objective function. The algorithm itself is not very complicated, you can write it in a couple lines of code, see Implementing a Metropolis Hastings Algorithm in R for some references.
