Simple question related to an ANN diagram showing all of the matrices' dimensions: inputs, weights and output

I've been reading a few Neural Networks articles for the past week and one thing that I am still trying to grasp is the dimensioning of the matrices on an ANN training. I have created a diagram (based on the example given by the same article) to try to figure it out. I have inserted the weights related to the neurons that are painted on the diagram. I am hoping that someone can validate my reasoning, as it is one of my pain points right now. I appreciate any help. PS: Was this post supposed to be created on this forum or on Cross Validated ? I can see that this topic appears on both.
