NLP conversation data - Pre-processing steps

I have text data, so data that has been transcribed from conversations from employees to customers. So each call has a recording that has been transcribed to text. I am looking to do some analytics with the text data. My main question, which I think is the most important, what would be the first pre-processing step to use with the text data in order to make it usable from an analytics perspective, possibly using supervised machine learning. Do you use word to vector, sentence to vector, paragraph to vector etc? Possible to provide links to examples etc. Thank you in advance.
