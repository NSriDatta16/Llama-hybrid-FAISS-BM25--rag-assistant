It would depend upon how your data series was organized. Using the canonical AirPassengers dataset, which is a time series by month , the acf() function produces a plot with the axis in yearly units. Below is a quick demonstration of how the plot defaults to labeling from 0 to 1. On the other hand, ggAcf() labels the lags from 0 to 12. In general, your two plots agree, but you need to rescale your x-axis. It appears you're partial to the default scaling produced by the acf() function. I tried to reverse engineer how acf() is denominating your intervals, but I have no idea if you're working in minutes or hours. If you want to work with ggplot() , then I recommend modifying the plot to your precise specification. To do this, try extracting the elements you need then execute the plot manually. Once you reproduce the figure, which I recommend doing using geom_segment() , try rescaling the axes to suit your needs. acf() acf(AirPassengers, lag.max = 12) ggAcf() ggAcf(AirPassengers, lag.max = 12) Reproducing it manually using ggplot() pull
