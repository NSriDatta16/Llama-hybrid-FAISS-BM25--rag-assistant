What is a test that I can use to determine if a time series is first-order stationary?

I need to test that one of the time series in my analysis has a constant mean over time. Is there a standard test I can use to help me determine this? I know that I can use a nonparametric procedure where I test for equality of means across subsamples of the original sample, but I was hoping to use an alternative procedure if possible. As far as I can tell, all of standard tests for (non)stationarity are for the second-order case (constancy of mean and variance with respect to time).
