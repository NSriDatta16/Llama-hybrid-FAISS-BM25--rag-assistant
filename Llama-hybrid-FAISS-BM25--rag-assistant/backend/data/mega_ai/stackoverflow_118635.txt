What are the "must have" features for a XML based GUI language

Summary for the impatient: What I want to know is what you want to have in a new gui language. About the short answers mentioning $your_favorite_one ; I assume you mean that, such a language should look like $your_favorite_one . These are not helpful. Resist the temptation. I'm thinking on the user friendliness of XML based languages such as XHTML (or HTML, although not XML they are very similar), XUL, MXML and others ("others" in this context means that, I am aware of the existence of other languages and their implementations alternative to their original ones, and the purpose of the mentioning only these languages by name is, to give an idea of what I am talking about and I don't feel like mentioning any others and also, I see no point in trying to make a comprehensive list anyway.). I have some opinions about what features should such a language have; The language should be "human writable" such that, an average developer should be able to code a good amount without constantly referring which tags have which properties, what is allowed inside what. XHTML/HTML is the best one in this regard. There should be good collection of controls built-in for common tasks. XHTML/HTML just sucks here. It should be able to be styled with css-like language (with respect to functionality). It should be easy to separate concerns about the structure and eye-candy. Layout algorithm of this combined whole should be simple and intuitive. Why the hell float removes the element from the layout? Why there is not a layout:not-included or something similar instead? I know that I don't even mention very important design considerations like interaction with rendering engine and other general purpose languages, data binding, strict XML compliance (ability to define new tags? without namespaces?) but these are the points that I would like to ask what you consider important for such a language?
