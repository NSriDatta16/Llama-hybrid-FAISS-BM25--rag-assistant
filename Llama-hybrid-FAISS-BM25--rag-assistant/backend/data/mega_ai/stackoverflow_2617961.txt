After trying to get a depth texture to work, I then tried the ARB_fragment_program extension to see if I could write a very simple (and therefore widely compatible with old hardware) GPU assembly fragment shader to do the trick, but I eventually just decided to use GLSL as the ARB_fragment_program extensions seem to be deprecated or at least their usage is frowned upon nowadays.
