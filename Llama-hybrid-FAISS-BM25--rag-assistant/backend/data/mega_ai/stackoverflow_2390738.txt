Bash, argument list segment

If you have a list in python, and you want the elements from 2 to n can do something nice like list[2:] I'd like to something similar with argv in Bash. I want to pass all the elements from $2 to argc to a command. I currently have command $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9 but this is less than elegant. Would would be the "proper" way?
