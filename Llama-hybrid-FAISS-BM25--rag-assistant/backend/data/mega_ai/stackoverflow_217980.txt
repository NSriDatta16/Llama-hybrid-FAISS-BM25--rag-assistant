C# little endian or big endian?

In the documentation of hardware that allows us to control it via UDP/IP, I found the following fragment: In this communication protocol, DWORD is a 4 bytes data, WORD is a 2 bytes data, BYTE is a single byte data. The storage format is little endian, namely 4 bytes (32bits) data is stored as: d7-d0, d15-d8, d23-d16, d31-d24; double bytes (16bits) data is stored as: d7-d0 , d15-d8. I am wondering how this translates to C#? Do I have to convert stuff before sending it over? For example, if I want to send over a 32 bit integer, or a 4 character string?
