If you only want to move the data from one activity to another I would attach it to the Intent. Writing it to shared memory means accessing the phone storage and that is really slow. You could it do in this way: Intent intent = new Intent(HangmanGameActivity.this, HangmanEndActivity.class); intent.putExtra(GAME_LOGIC_SCORE_STRING, tries + " of " + numberOfLives + " used"): intent.putExtra("GAME_LOGIC_WIN_LOOSE", true); startActivity(intent); In the EndActivity you would do: Intent intent = getIntent(); String gameString = intent.getStringExtra(GAME_LOGIC_SCORE_STRING, "default value"); boolean win = intent.getBooleanExtra(GAME_LOGIC_WIN_LOOSE, false);
