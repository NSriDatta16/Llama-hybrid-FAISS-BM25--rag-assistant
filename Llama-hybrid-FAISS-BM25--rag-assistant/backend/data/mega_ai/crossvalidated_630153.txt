Suggest a reasonable approach to combine the following variables into a single vector

I have 9 variables, namely BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), healthy-diet (HD: a score of 0 to 4, close to 4 indicates healthy), waist circumference (WC), neuroticism score (NS), body fat percentage (BF), physical activity (PA: total MET score data obtained from uk biobank), pack years of smoking (SMK) and alcohol intake frequency (ALC: a score from 0 to 5 where 5 indicates highest intake). I want to meaningfully combine these vectors of variables in one vector. I tried standardising and getting the simple addition. I need to know whether the scaled sum approach is valid, and if yes, some references I need to know a few other options to make an all-in-one variable, since these 9 variables are particularly not falling under one category. It's very difficult to give a common name to the newly composite variable, but I have no choice. I'm looking for a valid approach to combine them (with references). I do not want to go for a variable reduction technique such as PCA or factor analysis, but I need an all-in-one variable. More details: After producing this all-in-one variable, I would fit this as a single covariate in genome-wide-environment-interaction-study (GWEIS) with a binary scale phenotype using the R package "GxEprs", and then use the same variable in predicting the genomic risk scores in the target (independent) sample, using Model 5 given in GxEprs package.
