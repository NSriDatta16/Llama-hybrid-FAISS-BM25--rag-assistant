Is the Wikipedia article on circulant matrices clear? This is something that in a time series context is discussed, for instance, in the first pages of Hannan's Time Series book. The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix are given by the Fourier transform of what (again in a time series context) would be the autocovariances. So to invert the matrix you have to take the reciprocals of the eigenvalues and pre- and post-multiply by the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors.
