Is this data from machine votes or human votes? Opinions appreciated!

A friend recently entered (but lost) an online competition where the winner was chosen based on total votes. Only one vote would register per IP address so as to discourage multiple votes coming from one person. The only contest rule was that "machine or automated voting" was not allowed. The following data is a small snapshot of the vote activity for the eventual winner: Time Total Votes 11:22 3765 11:24 3770 11:26 3773 11:28 3775 11:30 3780 11:32 3781 11:34 3784 11:36 3787 11:38 3791 11:40 3799 11:42 3803 11:44 3805 11:46 3808 11:48 3810 11:50 3813 11:52 3817 11:54 3819 11:58 3827 12:00 3829 12:02 3834 12:14 3852 12:56 3990 13:06 4014 13:08 4022 13:12 4029 16:00 4341 Final vote count Note that the beginning data was collected at 2 minute intervals, but later there are gaps before a large gap when the final vote count is presented. When I put the contiguous data (11:22 - 11:54) into excel and then "fill down" for a prediction, I get a predicted final vote count = 4246... less than 100 votes from the actual count. In addition, the arrival of votes just doesn't look as random as I'd expect if independent human voting was happening. I'm pretty sure there is some degree of human voting, but I'm speculating that there is a strong machine element at play as well. I'd sure appreciate any opinions / analysis / advice that the community can offer. Do you believe there is machine voting going on here? How strongly do you believe this?
