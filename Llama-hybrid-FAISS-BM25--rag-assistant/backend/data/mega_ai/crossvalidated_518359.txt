I am a bit confused because the true error(generalization error) is based on the whole input space X,where as the empirical error is based on a sample drawn from X Intuitively, if you were to draw numerous sample sets of size $m$ (i.e. $\mathcal S$ ), from $\mathcal D^m$ , the average of the the empirical errors estimated from each of them will be close to the true mean, and it'll be even closer if you have more and more sets. So, it's not a statistic calculated from a single sample but a collection of samples. This is quite similar with the simple fact that the expected value of the sample mean is equal to true mean of the distribution (when it's defined), i.e. $E[\bar X]=\mu$ . also here in the above image,it is written "for any x in sample S" and in the immediate next line they have taken the whole input space into consideration(x belongs to D and not D^m). $x\sim \mathcal D$ because $\mathcal D$ is the input space, but $\mathcal D^m$ is the space of sample sets, e.g. $(x_1,x_2...x_m)$ is a sample set.
