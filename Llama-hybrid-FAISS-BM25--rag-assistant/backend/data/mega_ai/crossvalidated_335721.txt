One way of doing so is through the theory of ELO scores . For team $i$ playing against team $j$, we model the probability of team $i$ beating $j$ as: $P_{ij}=\sigma(c(R_i-R_j))$, where $\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$. Here $R_i,R_j$ are the ratings of team $i,j$ respectively. Thus you can train a logistic regression model to estimate $c,R_i,R_j$, since you know the given $P_{ij}$s. This will allow you to compare any pair of teams.
