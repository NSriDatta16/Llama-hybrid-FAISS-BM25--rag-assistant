How to interpret output from forecast package

The forecast package has the function auto.arima and forecast to model time-series. Understanding the output is proving difficult for me. Particularly, the model selection nomenclature. What does ARIMA(2,0,2)(1,0,0)[12] with zero mean stand for? Let's be clear, I understand the ARIMA(p,d,q) format. p is the autoregressive component, d is the degree of difference, i.e. integration component, and q stands for the moving-average component. So I understand the basics of what makes up an autoregressive integrated moving-average model. I am asking specifically about the use of two arima models side by side, [12] , and with zero mean . Did auto.arima have a tie with the best models and used both? First a lag of 2 then a lag of one? Then use 12 as the season frequency for annual seasonality and change a regular mean to zero? Reproducible example: ts.count
