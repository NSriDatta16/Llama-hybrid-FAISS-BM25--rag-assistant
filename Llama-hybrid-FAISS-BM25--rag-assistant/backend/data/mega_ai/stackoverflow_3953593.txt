Perhaps your cache entries expire too quickly and thus create the fragmentation. Your current stats show: "Fragmentation: 0.33% ( 1.2 MBytes out of 349.3 MBytes in 4594 fragments) " so it seems there's no reason to worry about anything. You might wanna change apc.stat=0 to increase performance but read about it carefully in the documentation before making the change http://php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php
