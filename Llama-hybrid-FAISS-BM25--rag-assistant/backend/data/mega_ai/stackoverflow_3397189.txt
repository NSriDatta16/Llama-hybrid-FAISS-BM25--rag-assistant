Regarding Mobile Device Browser File : Quote: "Due to the organizational restructuring of the team that developed and supported the Mobile Device Browser file, we will no longer have the resources to support and update this CodePlex project. The team will be providing two more releases â€“ one on the 27th July 2010 and the final release on the 24th August 2010." So that I am not just the bearer of bad news... We are planning on using: Mobile Device Detection and Redirection by 51 Degrees Which has a really good example of: How to Add the .NET Mobile API to an Existing Web Site Hope this helps.
