I don't know of any specific modules for Yahoo! Finance options, but if you want to roll your own you can usw LWP::UserAgent to download the page in question and something like HTML::TreeBuilder to parse it. If a specific option is the one you need data for, Yahoo! may even offer an RSS feed of its data in which case it's probably more robust to use something like XML::RSS to parse the feed. Do you have a link to a page of the kind of data you'd like to get?
