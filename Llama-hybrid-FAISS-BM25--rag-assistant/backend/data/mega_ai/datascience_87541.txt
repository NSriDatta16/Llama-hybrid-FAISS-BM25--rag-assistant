What is the best approach for detecting the defect?

Assuming that we have 10 same objects, they are lined up and equidistant. If any of them is rotated a very small angle(5 - 10deg), what is best method to detect them? I am using a camera to capture the image. I want to divide the image into 10 parts and then feed each part into CNN model to classify the defect. Is that a possible way? What is the recommendation for this problem?
