Passing POST data from one web page to another with PHP

Searching did not find a similar question, so: How can POST data used by PHP to generate one page be passed from that page to another PHP generated page? I have: A form on page 1 which sends data to a PHP script via POST. Page 2 is generated by that script and shows one or more graphs generated by an external program using the entries on page 1 and the back end database. This page also has another form with options to re-generate the graphs with new options (e.g. zoom in on or truncate the graph(s)). If requested, page 3 will be generated with the same PHP script using POST data glued together from pages 1 and 2. Except for the graphs, its basic appearance will be the same as page 2. Pages 4, 5, 6 ... should be generated in the same manner as page 3. So, how can I put the POST data used to generate page 2 into the POST data for page 3? EDIT: Due to organizational policy, cookies can't be used (so sessions are not feasible). GET is undesirable because we don't want the input to show in the URL.
