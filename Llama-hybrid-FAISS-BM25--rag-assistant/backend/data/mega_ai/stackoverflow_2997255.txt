How to tell Java SAX Parser to ignore invalid character references?

When trying to parse incorrect XML with a character reference such as &#x1 , Java's SAX Parser dies a horrible death with a fatal error such as org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Character reference "&#x1" is an invalid XML character. Is there any way around this? Will I have to clean up the XML file before I hand it off to the SAX Parser? If so, is there an elegant way of going about this?
