What method/classifier should I use for a training set with lots of attributes but few examples

Each training example has 100 numeric attributes plus one output class and about 80% of the attributes are 'zero' (means no data collected). The value of attributes varies in a small range, like $(-20,20)$. I have 100 examples like this. What method/classifier should I use? I tried KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, random forest/tree, none of these methods give me accuracy above 50% (I used 10-fold cross validation). What should I do?
