HEAD request receives "403 forbidden" while GET "200 ok"?

after several months having the site disappear from search results in every major search engine, I finally found out a possible reason. I used WebBug to investigate server header. See the difference if the request is HEAD or GET. HEAD Sent data: HEAD / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.attu.it Connection: close Accept: */* User-Agent: WebBug/5.0 HEAD Received data: HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden Date: Tue, 10 Aug 2010 23:01:00 GMT Server: Apache/2.2 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 GET Sent data: GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.attu.it Connection: close Accept: */* User-Agent: WebBug/5.0 GET Received data: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 10 Aug 2010 23:06:15 GMT Server: Apache/2.2 Last-Modified: Fri, 08 Jan 2010 08:58:01 GMT ETag: "671f91b-2d2-47ca362815840" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 722 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html // HTML code here Now, browsers by default send a GET request (at least this is what firebug says). Is it possible that crawlers send a HEAD request instead? If so, why only this server responds with a 403, while other servers from other sites I'm mantaining do not? In case it's important, the only line present in .htaccess is (unless my client changed it, as they don't want to give me access to their server) AddType text/x-component .htc UPDATE Thanks @Ryk. FireBug and Fiddler both send GET requests, which get 200 (or 300) responses. As expected. So I guess it's either a server bad setting (even though it's strange as the hosting is from a major company with millions of clients) or something they put in the .htaccess. They will have to let me look into their account. The second part of my question was if that could be the cause of the website not appearing in any search engine ( site:www.attu.it gives no results). Any thought? UPDATE 2 After some fiddling around, it turns out there was the phpMyAdmin robots-blocking .htaccess in the root directory, that caused any request from robots to be sent back with a 403 Forbidden
