Image classification convolutional neural networks

I am trying to solve this problem by using a convolutional NN to classify an image data set to check the type of disease it is. I have reached task 1b and trying to implement the training loop. However, I am getting an error and can't understand how to implement the training loop. I am sharing the google drive link. The code in task 1b where I am getting an error: # news headlines text and its corresponding label. # - sentence_len the maximum sentence length you want the # tokenized to return. Any sentence longer than that should # be truncated by the tokenizer. Any shorter sentence should # padded by the tokenizer. # We will be using the pretrained 'distilbert-base-uncased' transform, # so please use the appropriate tokenizer for it. NOTE: You will need # to include the relevant import statement. I am stuck at this part. Can anyone suggest how to implement it?
