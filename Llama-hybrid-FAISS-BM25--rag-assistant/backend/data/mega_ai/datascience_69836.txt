Coming to your questions: I am thinking about filling it with some constant term 0 or -999. Is there any difference when fill it with 0 or -999. The reason values are imputed with their mean is that in this way inputed data won't alter the regression slopes. You shouldn't use constant terms such as -999, otherwise the regression parameters would result completely messed up. Random Forests would suffer too, since the model would then learn to partition the variables space in a strange way, trying to chase outliers that don't make sense. What is the right way to fill when you have too many missing values? Drop these data if possible. If it's not the case, try inputing the mean. If you have outlier problems (and the mean suffers from them), substitute it with the median. This is the simplest thing you can do. An alternative is to fit a preliminary model on the available, complete data, then use it to predict missing values, then retrain the final model on the bigger imputed dataset. This would introduce a more "flexible" imputation than just a constant number, at your own risk of course.
