You can't simply set the mysql system variable to YES to convert the table from MyISAM to InnoDB. ALTER TABLE t1 ENGINE=InnoDB; When InnoDB support is turned off even is you use ENGINE=InnoDB in your create table statements, the table will use the default storage engine for MySQL which is normally MyISAM.
