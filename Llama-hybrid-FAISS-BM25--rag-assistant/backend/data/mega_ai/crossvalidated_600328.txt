Is it a good idea to have a category and its subcategories in the training set of an object segmentation model?

I hope you are doing great! I am currently training an object segmentation model (detectron2 : mask rcnn) The objective is to detect materials like wood , plastic , glass etc... wood is one of the categories in my training set. Is it a good idea to add other labels that are subcategories of wood ? Like table , desk etc ... to my training set? and if so, how should I label them? I tried adding table , I noticed that the model detects the table as an object table and then adds some small detections of wood on top of it. so when labeling the images, should I label the table as table and then label all its parts as wood ? or should I just label the whole thing as wood and avoid adding subcategories to my dataset? Thank you in advance, Have a good one.
