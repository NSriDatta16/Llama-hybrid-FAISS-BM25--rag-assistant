Automapper: Ignore exact match and use postfix match instead

I am trying to work out how to populate Foo from FooConfig : class Bar { int A; int B; } class Foo { Bar BarValues; Bar BarErrorValues; } class FooConfig { int A; int B; int AError; int BError; } FooConfig is essentially a flattened version of Foo . I can populate the BarValues easily with AutoMapper (by having a map defined for FooConfig to Bar ), but I am having trouble getting the BarErrorValues populated - everything I try it ends up with the A and B values in it instead of the AError and BError values. I suspect I need to use a "transformer" or RecognizePostfixes (although this does not seem to work as I tried it).
