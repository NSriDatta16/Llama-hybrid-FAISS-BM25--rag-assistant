How to change an item in a databound ListView from another class?

I have a ListView set up to view a number of records from a database, and therefore it is bound to an ObservableCollection of SongData : public class SongData { Id { get; set; } Title { get; set; } Artist { get; set; } } Now, I have an EventHandler set up with an EventSetter in order to display a new Window with some sort of edit form when the user doubleclicks on one of the ListViewItems . When the user changes the data in the new window, it is saved to the database. I'm trying to figure out a way to change the data in the ListView . I've encountered a few problems. First of all, since the ObservableCollection is a private property, so I can't acces it from another class/window. I can think of a few ways to get this part to work, but they're not very elegant. Any suggestions? Secondly, I have no idea how I can get the correct SongData object from the ObservableCollection , as I only have the Id available to look it up. I have tried to pass the entire SongData object instead of just the Id, but that didn't seem to be working. I think there should be a simple anwser to this question, but I can't find it... The main question is how I can change an item from a ListView databound to an ObservableCollection from another class, when I only have the Id of the SongData object available.
