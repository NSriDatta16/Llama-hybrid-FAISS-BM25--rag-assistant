Apache and Wolfram divide by N-1 rather than N. This is a degrees of freedom adjustment, since you estimate Î¼. By dividing by N-1 you obtain an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation. You can change NumPy's behavior using the ddof option. This is described in the NumPy documentation: The average squared deviation is normally calculated as x.sum() / N, where N = len(x). If, however, ddof is specified, the divisor N - ddof is used instead. In standard statistical practice, ddof=1 provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite population. ddof=0 provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables. The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of the estimated variance, so even with ddof=1, it will not be an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.
