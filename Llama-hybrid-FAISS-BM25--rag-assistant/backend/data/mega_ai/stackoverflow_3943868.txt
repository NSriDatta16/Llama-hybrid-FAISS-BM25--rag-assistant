jQuery : drag and drop : find the id of the target

I am developing a drag and drop app. I have a DIV that is draggable along the document and there are some other divs in the document, I can drag one div to other divs, but how can I find the id of the div to which I dropped the dragging DIV, I just want to know the id of the target DIV after placing another DIV over it. Thanks
