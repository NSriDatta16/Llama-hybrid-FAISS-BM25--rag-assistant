How to compute Deviance Statistic for a simple Logistic Regression Model in the case that any $n_i = y_i$?

I am working on example 7.3.1 from the Second Edition of the book An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models in section 7.3 Dose response models . This example fits a simple logistic regression model on the following data: This seems easy enough. However, I am having an issue with the Deviance Statistic calculated for this example. The following is my R code that will reproduce a Deviance Statistic $D=11.23$ just like this example in the book has. #original data #copied in by row ( df Section 5.6.1 of this same book derives the Deviance Statistic for the Binomial Model to be: $D = 2\sum^{N}_{i=1}y_{i}[ log_{e}(\frac{y_i}{\hat{y_i}})+(n_i - y_i)log_{e}(\frac{n_i - y_i}{n_i - \hat{y_i}}) ]$ However, looking closely at the given data, it can be seen that for the last row, the number of beetles killed is the same as the total number of beetles ( $n_{8}=y_{8}$ ). This means that the very last part in the sum for D is: $ y_{8}log_{e}(\frac{y_8}{\hat{y_8}})+(n_8 - y_8)log_{e}(\frac{n_8 - y_8}{n_8 - \hat{y_8}}) = 60log_{e}(\frac{60}{\hat{y_8}})+(0)log_{e}(\frac{0}{n_8 - \hat{y_8}})$ In particular, this value contains: $0log_{e}(0)=0(-\infty)=$ undefined Here is the R code that agrees with this: sum( 2*(df$Yes*(log(df$Yes/(mle_beet$fitted.values*df$Total))) + (df$Total-df$Yes)* log((df$Total-df$Yes)/(df$Total-mle_beet$fitted.values*df$Total) ) ) ) My question is: What is the mathematical reasoning for computing the Deviance Statistic when $n_i=y_i$? What do the book and R do in the background to obtain $D=11.23$? (Note that the book likely didn't use R to get this value, but the two agree) Thank you! EDIT: See the accepted answer and its comments for a great explanation. If you happen to be computing the Deviance through the formula in R (you likely shouldn't since mle_beet$deviance shows this for you), you can replace -Inf or Nan in each vector that results from an individual operation. The following works for this example: x
