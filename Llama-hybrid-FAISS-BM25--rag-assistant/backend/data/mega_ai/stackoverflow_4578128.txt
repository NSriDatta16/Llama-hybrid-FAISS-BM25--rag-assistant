you can open a webpage and hold down your mouse to save it the path in which all the photos saved is: /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.1/Media 4.1 or which sdk you are using //EDIT: I tested it with the first option and it saves all the pictures in DCIM/100APPLE/ but it also create the folder PhotoData/100APPLE/ where for each picture a .BTH and .THM is saved. So the easiest way is to drag and drop a image on the simulator. The Simulator will open a webpage to your local file ( "file://â€¦" ) and then you can save it but holding your mouse key for 3 seconds or so. Then click "save image" and it should appear in your Photo Library.
