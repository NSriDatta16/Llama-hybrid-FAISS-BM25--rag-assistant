If you're just averaging model fits/predictions, it won't matter, but when you say " the quadratic term " it implies you're interested in averaging parameter estimates, in which case you should be dealing with the actual term with an $x^2$ in it, rather than the combination of linear and quadratic. However , in that case, it would be best to work with orthogonal polynomials, because then the presence of higher order terms doesn't impact the lower order estimates; you can average over the parameter estimates without their meaning changing. Compare what happens without and then with orthogonal polynomials: First, fitting linear and then linear+quadratic: > lm(dist~speed,cars) Coefficients: (Intercept) speed -17.579 3.932 > lm(dist~speed+I(speed^2),cars) Coefficients: (Intercept) speed I(speed^2) 2.47014 0.91329 0.09996 As you see, the coefficient of speed is substantively affected by the presence of the speed^2 term. By comparison, when we use orthogonal polynomials, the fit is the same in both cases, but the coefficient of the linear term is the same in both models: > lm(dist~poly(speed,1),cars) Coefficients: (Intercept) poly(speed, 1) 42.98 145.55 > lm(dist~poly(speed,2),cars) Coefficients: (Intercept) poly(speed, 2)1 poly(speed, 2)2 42.98 145.55 23.00 In this situation, when a term is present in the model, its meaning is the same whether there are higher order terms or not; model averaging over parameters can be explicitly seen as shrinkage toward zero (since the averaged estimate will be a weighted average of 0, when it's absent, and the estimate, when it's in the model).
