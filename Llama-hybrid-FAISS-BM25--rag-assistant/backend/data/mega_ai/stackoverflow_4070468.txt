If you really want to store a simple file to the SD card, you can do it like so: File sdCard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); // get a handle to the SD card File myFile = new File(sdCard, "test"); // get a file handle so a single file Now you can use a BufferedWriter , for example, or any other Java method of writing to that new file. Your app should have the permission to write to the SD card, of course, by adding WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE . By convention, all your application data should be stored in the following directory on the SD card: Android/data/your.package.name/files/ Also note that you should explicitly check whether a SD card actually exists or if its writable, and so on. See here for a documentation.
