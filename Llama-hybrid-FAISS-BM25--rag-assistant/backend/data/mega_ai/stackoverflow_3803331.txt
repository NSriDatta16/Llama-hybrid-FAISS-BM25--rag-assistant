How can I modulo when my numbers start from 1, not zero?

I guess the solution for this is quite simple, but I've been thinking about it for a while and couldn't come up with an elegant solution. I have a range of numbers, e.g. 1..10 = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) , which is circular, meaning the number after the last one is again the first one ( next(10)=1 ). For a given number i>0 in the range, I would like to calculate the next m -th, and previous m -th number. e.g. next(5,1)=6 next(10,1)=1 next(10,2)=2 prev(5,2)=3 prev(1,1)=10 prev(1,2)=9 . For next I can just take (i+m)%n where n is the length of the range ( n=10 in the example). But for prev I couldn't find an elegant solution.
