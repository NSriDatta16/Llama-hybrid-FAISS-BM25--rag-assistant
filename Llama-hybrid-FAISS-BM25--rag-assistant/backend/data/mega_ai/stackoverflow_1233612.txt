Comparing 2 graphs created by Boost Graph Library

This may be a rather novice or even wrong question so please be forgiving. Is there a way to compare 2 graphs created using the Boost Graph Library => with 1 graph created in memory and the 2nd loaded from an archive (i.e. 2nd was serialized out previously)? I don't see an operator== provided in BGL's documentation, but not sure if that means that I have to write both traversal and comparison. Any pointers to tutorials, reference pages or samples would be most helpful Thanks in advance Ganesh
