Magento - Javascript: update form from user's choice

I'm writing a form for a custom module and I want to show/hide some fields according to which radio is checked, kind of like what happens when you select a payment method in the onepage checkout and a description appears. Before I start writing the js code, I took a look at js/varien/form.js to see if I could use an already existing function, but the truth is my js skills aren't enough to really understand what I'm looking at. So my question is, is there something I can use? Which method and how can I trigger it? I'm gonna review onepage checkout's code in order to see if it makes things clearer, but if you know another form that has this behaviour please let me know. Also, I know how I could write such code in plain javascript, but I'd rather use the magento way, in order to learn. Cheers
