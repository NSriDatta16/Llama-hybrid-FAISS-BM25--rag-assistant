Dragging a widget down a long list so that scrolling is necessary with gwt-dnd

I'm investigating using gwt-dnd to implement drag-and-drop reordering of a list of widgets. The list might be longer than its visible area, and so I'd like the user to be able to do that drag-the-widget-near-the-bottom-and-the-list-auto-scrolls behavior that's pretty much standard. Does gwt-dnd have this support built in anywhere? If not, any ideas on implementing it?
