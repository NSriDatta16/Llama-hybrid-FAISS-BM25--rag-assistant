why the sexp has array in the end

RubyParser.new.parse "1+1" s(:call, s(:lit, 1), :+, s(:array, s(:lit, 1))) Above code is from this link Why there is array after + in the Sexp. I am just trying to learn ruby parser and the whole AST thing. I have been programming for a while but have no formal education in computer science. So do point to good article which explains AST etc. Please no dragon book. I tried couple of times but couldn't understand much of that book
