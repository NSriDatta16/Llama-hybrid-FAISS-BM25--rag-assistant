XGBoost non-linear regression

Is it possible to use XGBoost regressor to do non-linear regressions? I know of the objectives linear and logistic . The linear objective works very good with the gblinear booster. This made me wonder if it is possible to use XGBoost for non-linear regressions like logarithmic or polynomial regression. a) Is it generally possible to make polynomial regression like in CNN where XGBoost approximates the data by generating n-polynomial function? b) If a) is generally not possible, would it be possible to declare a curve with its parameters and let XGBoost figure out the values of the parameters? (To give an example) Assume we guess that the curve can be approximated with: $$ 10^{a\log_{k}({x})-b} $$ XGBoost would have to figure out $a$ , $k$ , and $b$ . $x$ would be a given feature.
