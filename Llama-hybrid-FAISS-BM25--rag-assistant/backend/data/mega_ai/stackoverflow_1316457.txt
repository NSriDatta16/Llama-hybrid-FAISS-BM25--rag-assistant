Im not sure how your BLL looks like and i have no experience with entity framework, but ive experienced multiple times that linq-to-sql works much better with sql-server as with any other database. So unless you have a good reason not to use sql express, i'd advice to stick to sql express. After all, you should always install something when deploying (unless you use xml as storage, which is quite well possible with linq-to-xml).
