This happens because there is a path in your program for which the compiler cannot guarantee that amount is assigned an initial value: when the first TryParse() fails. That's why you get the error on the line where you try to use amount . From MSDN: A variable passed as an out argument need not be initialized. However, the out parameter must be assigned a value before the method returns. You can work around it by assigning default values to your local variables: decimal amount = 0; Else you have to ensure that both TryParse() calls are made in any case, e.g (not really nice code): bool b1 = Byte.TryParse("string1", out currency); bool b2 = Decimal.TryParse("string2", out amount); if (b1 && b2) {...} BTW: this code fragment will also produce the same compiler error, because a is not assigned a value: int a, b=1; int c = a+b;
