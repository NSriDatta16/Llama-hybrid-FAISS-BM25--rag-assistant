Suppress indentation after environment in LaTeX

I'm trying to create a new environment in my LaTeX document where indentation in the next paragraph following the environment is suppressed. I have been told (TeXbook and LaTeX source) that by setting \everypar to {\setbox0\lastbox} , the TeX typesetter will execute this at the beginning of the next paragraph and thus remove the indentation: \everypar{\setbox0\lastbox} So this is what I do, but to no effect (following paragraph is still indented): \newenvironment{example} {\begin{list} {} {\setlength\leftmargin{2em}}} {\end{list}\everypar{\setbox0\lastbox}} I have studied LaTeX's internals as well as I could manage. It seems that the \end routine says \endgroup and \par at some point, which may be the reason LaTeX ignores my \everypar setting. \global doesn't help either. I know about \noindent but want to do this automatically. Example document fragment: This is paragraph text. This is paragraph text, too. \begin{example} \item This is the first item in the list. \item This is the second item in the list. \end{example} This is more paragraph text. I don't want this indented, please. Internal routines and switches of interest seem to be \@endpetrue , \@endparenv and others. Thanks for your help.
