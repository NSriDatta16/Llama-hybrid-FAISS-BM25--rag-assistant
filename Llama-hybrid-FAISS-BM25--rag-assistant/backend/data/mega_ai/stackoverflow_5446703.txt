I've been reading about Mysql stored procedures lately. and... after awhile I see very little use for them personally. ...well...Maybe for security reasons if you only want to give access to part of your data. I believe you're incorrect. Stored procedures are a good way to provide an abstraction layer between applications and the table structure. Also - I've never seen them being used in the wild. AFAIK - I checked magento, wordpress, joomla, drupal - non of them used stored procs, functions or views. They aren't required, as your citations prove, but people who like that style would swear by them. People like objects tend to frown on stored procedures; DBAs like them. One argument against them is that stored procedure languages are generally proprietary. Procedures written for one RDBMS don't port to others without a rewrite. So unless your system is willing to mandate a particular RDBMS, you'll have to steer clear of them.
