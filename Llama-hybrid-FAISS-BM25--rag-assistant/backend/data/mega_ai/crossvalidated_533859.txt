For the sake of notation, I am using the model with only one independent variable $X$ . All of the results hold true with more independent variables as well. In logistic regression, we use the logistic function $$ p(X) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}$$ to model the relationship between $p(X) = \mathbb{P}(Y = 1|X)$ and $X$ . In your case, $p(X)$ denotes the probability of the default conditional on $X$ . For the predictions, for an individual with the value of the independent variable $x_0$ , we predict the probability of default by just plugging it in the estimated function: $$ \hat{p}(x_0) = \frac{e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_0}}{1 + e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_0}}.$$ If you get $\hat{p}(x_0) = 0.8$ , then you predict the probability of default for this individual to be $0.8$ .
