The proper solution depends on the nature of your dependent variable: donation amount. If this takes on a small number of integer values (in number of dollars or Euros or whatever) and those integers are all small (or adjacent) then some sort of count model is appropriate (as @Tomas notes). This could be Poisson or negative binomial regression, or perhaps a zero-inflated version of these, if you are interested in who gave nothing. If donation amount takes on a small number of levels, but those values are widely dispersed (as might be if people were responding to a request that had a number of donation levels and check boxes) then an ordinal logistic regression might be correct. However, if donation amount takes on a large number of levels and they are widely dispersed and there are no zeroes (e.g. some people give \$10, some give $10,000, most give somewhere in between) then it might be that a log transformation is correct or it might be that you need some form of robust regression. It depends partly on substantive questions: Are differences in amount given better looked at on arithmetic or multiplicative scale? That is, which of these two differences are equivalent? 1) The difference between \$10 and \$20 is the same as the difference between \$1000 and $1010? 2) The difference between \$10 and \$20 is the same as the difference between \$1000 and $2000? If 1) then some robust regression is probably better; if 2) then a log transform. One thing that seems very unlikely to me is that the regular (OLS) regression on the untransformed donation amount could be correct. But you'd have to examine residual plots to be sure.
