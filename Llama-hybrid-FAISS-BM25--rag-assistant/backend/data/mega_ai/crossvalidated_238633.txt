Wilcoxon Rank Sum (Mann Whitney) test-SAS Results Interpretation

I need a clarification on interpreting Wilcoxon Rank Sum (Mann Whitney) test results using SAS. Here is a sample results look like. I am trying to form a hypothesis and interpret the results. In this case, is this the test for average or medians, since the results display the mean score. Also should I use the normal approximation or t approximation for the p-value.
