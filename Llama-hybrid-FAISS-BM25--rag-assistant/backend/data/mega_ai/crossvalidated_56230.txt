Modelling two correlated variables

I wish to simultaneously predict two correlated time series. Here is a plot of one time series against the other: At the moment I have separate linear regressions for both of them which rely on some IVs and while performance is acceptable I'd like to find some way to take account of the relationship between them when making forecasts. Can anyone suggest strategies that do this? I'm working in python mostly so anything that is already implemented in python is a bonus!
