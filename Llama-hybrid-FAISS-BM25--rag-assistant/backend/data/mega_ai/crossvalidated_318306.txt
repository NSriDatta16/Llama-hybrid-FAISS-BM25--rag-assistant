1) There is no single answer to this question. A good metric for linear dependence is a correlation matrix. i.e. cor(x) in R. If the features are linearly independent, they are uncorrelated, hence the non-diagonal entries of the correlation matrix should be close to zero. See here for a discussion of why naive bayes does well even when its assumptions are violated. 2) Again, there is no single answer to this question. The most common way to compare machine learning models is to see how well they do on held out data and the most common metric is AUC.
