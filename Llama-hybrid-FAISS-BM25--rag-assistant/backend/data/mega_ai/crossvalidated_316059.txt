As this is a self-study question, it's best to provide some guidance which will help lead to the solution: In your question, two models are essentially being compared $$y=\alpha+bx+e$$ $$y=\alpha+\beta x+\gamma z+\epsilon$$ Recall that in a multiple linear regression we estimate $\beta$ as: $$\hat{\beta}=\frac{\Sigma\hat{r}_{1}y_i}{\Sigma\hat{r}_{1}^2}$$ where $\hat{r}_{i1}$ are the OLS residuals from a simple regression of $x$ on $z$ and can be thought of as the part of $x$ that is uncorrelated with $z$. We can then perform an OLS regression of $y$ on $\hat{r_1}$. As the residuals will have a sample average of 0, the slope of the regression will be equal to $\beta$. When the model is underspecified, important variables are not included in the model and can lead to biased estimates. Assume that the second model (containing $z$) is the true population model, and that the model satisfies the assumptions of multiple linear regression. To get an unbiased estimate of the effect of $x$ on $y$, we should include $z$. We can derive the expected value of $b$ conditional on the sample values of $x$ and $z$, as $b$ is just the slope from the first model: $$\hat{b}=\frac{\Sigma(x_i-\bar{x})y_i}{\Sigma(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$ If the $b$ and $\beta$ differ between the two models, we can express this difference algebraically as $$b=\hat{\beta}+\hat{\gamma}\tilde{\delta}_1$$ where $\tilde{\delta}_1$ is the slope from a simple regression of $z$ on $x$. Essentially, the confounding term is the partial effect of $z$ on $y$ times the slope in the regression of $z$ on $x$ (it can almost be thought of as the shared effect of $z$ and $x$ on $y$). Note that $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ are the estimated slope parameters from the correctly specified model. If the multiple linear regression assumptions hold, both $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ are unbiased estimators of $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Therefore as $\tilde{\delta}_1$ only relies on independent variables in the sample (i.e. it can be considered nonrandom): $$E(b)=E(\hat{\beta}+\hat{\gamma}\tilde{\delta}_1)=E(\hat{\beta})+E(\hat{\gamma})\tilde{\delta}_1=\beta+\gamma\tilde{\delta}_1$$ And the bias can be written as: $$Bias(b)=E(b)-\beta=\gamma\tilde{\delta}_1$$ For further reading and more information I suggest: Wooldridge, J.
