Ordinal Logistic Regression is not giving reasonable results

I am quite new to this kind of statistics, so please be kind to me! I am currently trying to use statsmodels to run an ordinal logistic regression( https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/ordinal_regression.html ). My dependant variable has three categories (ordered, "proximal" The problem is, I am getting results which don't seem reasonable to me. (Either that, or I am misunderstanding the model I am using). One potential problem is that my samples (~900) are not evenly distributed between the categories of the dependent variable: proximal - 700 transitional - 180 distal - 44 As a test, I am just showing two models with 1 independent variable (called "SAT1") that should be highly predictive and one variable that should not be predictive (called "HSPA1B"). I am saying this because one of the variable has a clear trend between the categories that follows the order, and the other doesn't. The first set of plots is for the variable I expect to be more predictive, and the bottom is for the variable that I do not expect to be predictive. (Maybe predictive is not the right word). I am fitting the models as follows: model = OrderedModel(independent, dependent, distr='logit') res = model.fit(method='bfgs', disp=False) res.summary() The independent variable is a pandas series with dtype categorical and is ordered as required by statsmodels. Here is the output for the first variable that trends with the categories: Here is the output for the 2nd variable, which does not trend with the data: Why are they both significant?
