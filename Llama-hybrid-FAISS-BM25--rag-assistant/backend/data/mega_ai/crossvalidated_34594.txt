I am not sure whether you are interested in estimating the temperature or whether you want to know what the value of sensor 2 would be for a given value of sensor 1. Still, I think that the tool you need is total least squares (TLS), also known as orthogonal regression . Contrary to normal linear regression, where you assume that all the error is the $Y$ variable, in orthogonal regression, you assume there is an error on both variables. This picture from the Wikipedia link above shows the difference: the error is assumed to be orthogonal to the regression line (and not vertical). If you are familiar with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the orthogonal regression line is the first principal component of your dataset. There seems to be no TLS function in R, so the easiest is actually to do it by PCA. It can go like this. X This means that you can model your system as $(Y - \bar{Y}) = 1.116 \cdot (X - \bar{X})$ or $Y = 1.116 \cdot X + (\bar{Y} - 1.116 \cdot \bar{X})$ if you need $Y$ as a function of $X$.
