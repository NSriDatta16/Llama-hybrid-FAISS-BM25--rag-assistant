Multicollinearity has no effect on the raw performance of linear regression. It only inflates the standard errors on the coefficients. Therefore, you shouldn't expect RSME to be smaller after performing PCA. PCA necessarily removes information from the input data, so in fact you should expect the RSME to increase as a result.
