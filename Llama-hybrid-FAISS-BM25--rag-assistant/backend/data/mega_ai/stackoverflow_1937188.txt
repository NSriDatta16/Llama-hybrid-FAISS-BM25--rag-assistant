cURL really slow

Does anybody know why could cURL under php5 be so damn slow to fail even at 45s timeout, downloading a few kb file on a speedO'light server? The code is here as requested (although I upped the timeouts even more for the script not to fail during execution and changed useragent to Mozilla/4.0 from initial Chrome): $ch = curl_init('http://www.somesite.com/' . $key); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, 'http://www.somesite.com/somereferer/'); // curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.39 Safari/530.5'); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/4.0'); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 120); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT, 600);
