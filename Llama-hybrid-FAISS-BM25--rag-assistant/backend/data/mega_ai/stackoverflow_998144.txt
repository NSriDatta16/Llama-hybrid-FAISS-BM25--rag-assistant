If you had a macro language, you could write a function like "open a popup that allows me to type in some text, then generates the getter and setter, including its javadoc, based on templates". Eclipse has actually no real support for such a macro language, but maybe you could anyway have a look at : Is there a Macro Recorder for Eclipse? If you're not reluctant to switch between eclipse and another tool, then you could try JEdit (jedit.org) that includes powerful beanshell macro language. In such a way, you can have eclipse & jedit opened, you drag&drop the file you want to process from eclipse to jedit, you use jedit macro power, then save the file and finally refresh file within eclipse. It's a bit annoying, but for some processings that's the way I have successfully adopted.
