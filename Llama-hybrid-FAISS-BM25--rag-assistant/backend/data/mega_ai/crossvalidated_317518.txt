Sure, k-NN can be ensembled. You could, for example, use resampling to generate different models (like with a Random Forest), or you could vary N, or you could use different functions for computing the distance. But, my experience is that k-NN rarely does well in high dimensional problems, so it would just be an ensemble of bad models, which isn't going to do well relative to an ensemble of good models.
