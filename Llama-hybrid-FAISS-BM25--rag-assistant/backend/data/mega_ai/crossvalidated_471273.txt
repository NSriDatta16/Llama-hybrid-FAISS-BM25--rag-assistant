A lot depends on the precise formulation of the null hypothesis you would like to test. You could formulate a hypothesis such as $H_0\colon$ model $A$ and model $B$ have equal expected forecast loss for each of the 10 time series against an alternative $H_1\colon$ $H_0$ is not true and test $H_0$ using a series of vanilla Diebold-Mariano tests with a correction of each test's significance level to account for multiple testing. I suppose this is not the only formulation of a reasonably interesting/relevant null hypothesis that has a feasible solution. Also, note that the Diebold-Mariano test is intended for accuracy of predictions, not the underlying models. There are some subtle differences between these concepts and there is an entire strand of literature focusing on them and the different variations of tests. See e.g. Diebold "Comparing predictive accuracy, twenty years later: A personal perspective on the use and abuse of Dieboldâ€“Mariano tests" (2015).
