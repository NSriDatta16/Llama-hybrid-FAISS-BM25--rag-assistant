Because a comment of mine about obtaining a simple answer seems to have generated interest, here are the details. Restatement of the question The question asks whether the product of two Normal density functions determines a Normally distributed variable. In the notation of the question, these functions have the form $$f(x; \mu, \sigma) = C(\mu,\sigma)\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)= C(\mu,\sigma)\exp\left(-\tau(\sigma)^2\left(x-\mu\right)^2\right)$$ where $C(\mu,\sigma)$ is the normalizing constant (a number determined by the need to make $f(x;\mu,\sigma)\,\mathrm{d}x$ integrate to unity) and $$\tau(\sigma)^2 = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}.$$ $2\tau(\sigma)^2$ (the reciprocal of the variance) is known as the precision . Use of the logarithm to simplify the analysis Because $f$ is always positive, we may work with its logarithm, which is a quadratic function of $x:$ $$\log f(x;\mu,\sigma) = A(\mu,\sigma) - \tau(\sigma)^2(x-\mu)^2\tag{*}$$ (where, evidently, $A(\mu,\sigma) = \log(C(\mu,\sigma))$ ). Notice that this expression describes all nondegenerate quadratic functions of $x$ with negative leading coefficient. That is, given any quadratic $Q(x) = -ax^2 + 2bx + c,$ we may find $\mu,$ $\sigma,$ and a constant (to play the role of $A(\mu,\sigma)$ ) in which $Q$ is expressed in the form $(*).$ Finding $\mu$ and $\sigma$ given $a,b,c$ is called completing the square. However, the details will not matter here, so I leave it to the interested reader to work out the formulas (which is a straightforward exercise in elementary algebra). Conversely (by definition of Normal distributions), any distribution with a log density function that can be written in this form (and is defined for all real numbers) is a Normal distribution. Let's memorialize this characterization by highlighting it: Any density function $f$ that is (a) defined for all real numbers and (b) whose logarithm is a quadratic function of its argument describes a Normal distribution. Solution Recall that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms. Thus, the question comes down to this: Is the sum of two quadratic functions quadratic? Trivially, yes, because by the rules of polynomial addition, $$(-a_1 x^2 + 2b_1 x + c_1) + (-a_2 x^2 + 2b_2 x + c_2) = -(a_1+a_2)x^2 + 2(b_1+b_2)x + (c_1+c_2),$$ QED. We can go further, though: it is of interest to identify which Normal distribution occurs. For this, the notation of the question will be convenient. The preceding calculation is now written $$\begin{aligned} \left(A(\mu_x,\sigma_x)-\tau(\sigma_x)^2 (x-\mu_x)^2\right) + \left(A(\mu_y,\sigma_y)-\tau(\sigma_y)^2 (x-\mu_y)^2\right) \\ = A(\mu,\sigma)-\tau(\sigma)^2 (x-\mu)^2 \end{aligned}$$ where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the result, $\mu$ is its mean, and $A(\mu,\sigma)$ is the logarithm of its normalizing constant. My point is that we can solve this problem by inspection. This is a math-speak term for saying you don't have to write anything down because you can pick out appropriate polynomial coefficients just by looking. To wit, The coefficient of $x^2$ must be the sum of its coefficients on the left hand side, giving $$\tau(\sigma)^2 = \tau(\sigma_x)^2 + \tau(\sigma_y)^2.\tag{1}$$ The coefficient of $x$ must be the sum of its coefficients on the left hand side. This requires slightly greater perception: namely, recognizing that the coefficient of $x$ in the square $(x-\mu)^2$ is $-2\mu.$ Thus, $$2\tau(\sigma)^2 \mu = 2\tau(\sigma_x)^2\mu_x +2\tau(\sigma_y)^2\mu_y.$$ Here, then, is the second place where we actually have to do some algebra: solve this equation for $\mu.$ Again, the solution is by inspection (because the equation is so simple), and we can simplify it using $(1)$ above: $$\mu = \frac{2\tau(\sigma_x)^2\mu_x + 2\tau(\sigma_y)^2\mu_y}{2\tau(\sigma)^2} = \frac{2\tau(\sigma_x)^2\mu_x + 2\tau(\sigma_y)^2\mu_y}{2\tau(\sigma_x)^2 + 2\tau(\sigma_y)^2}.\tag{2}$$ The factors of $2\tau(\ )^2$ are the precisions of the distributions ( q.v. ), enabling us to characterize the results $(1)$ and $(2)$ in a simple, memorable fashion: When multiplying two Normal densities, precisions add (just double both sides of equation $(1)$ ) and the mean is the precision-weighted average of the means (equation $(2)$ ). The two highlighted equations--the first simplifying the sum of quadratics and the second solving a simple linear equation in one unknown--constitute the "two lines of algebra" I mentioned in my comment.
