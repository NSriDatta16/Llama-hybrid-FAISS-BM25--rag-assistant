My personal opinion is that there are NO acceptable uses of the goto statement in a modern programming language. "GOTO Statement Considered Harmful", by the late Edsger W. Dijkstra, does a good job of covering the issue. That paper should be required reading for every software developer on the planet. It is worth noting that the Gypsy language, from Don Good's group at UT Austin in the late 1970s, did not have a goto. It is worth noting that Ichbiah et al only included a goto in Ada because the DoD required it, explicitly, in so many words in the requirements specification. I remember reading that Ichbiah and his team deliberately made the goto target label syntax as ugly as they could, to make the labels stick out like sore thumbs, and discourage use of the goto.
