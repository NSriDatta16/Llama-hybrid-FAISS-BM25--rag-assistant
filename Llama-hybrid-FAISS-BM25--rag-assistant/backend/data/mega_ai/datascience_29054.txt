In a multi-class setting micro-averaged precision and recall are always the same. $$ P = \frac{\sum_c TP_c}{\sum_c TP_c + \sum_c FP_c}\\ R = \frac{\sum_c TP_c}{\sum_c TP_c + \sum_c FN_c} $$ where c is the class label. Since in a multi-class setting you count all false instances it turns out that $$ \sum_c FP_c = \sum_c FN_c $$ Hence P = R. In other words, every single False Prediction will be a False Positive for a class, and every Single Negative will be a False Negative for a class. If you treat a binary classification case as a bi-class classification and compute the micro-averaged precision and recall they will be same. The answer given by Rahul is in the case of averaging binary precision and recall from multiple dataset. In which case the micro-averaged precision and recall are different.
