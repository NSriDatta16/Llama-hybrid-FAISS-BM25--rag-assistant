Ironically, the prototypical two box logon form is much more complicated than a 2 box CRUD form because the logon form needs to be secure and the CRUD form only needs to save to a database table (and read and update and delete). A logon form needs to decide if where to redirect to, how to cryptographically secure an authentication token, if and how to cache roles, how to or if to deal with dictionary attacks. I don't know what this converts to in UCP points, I just know that the logon screen in my app has consumed much more time a form with a similar number of buttons and boxes. Last time I was encouraged to count function points, it was a farce because no one had the time to set up a "function points court" to get rulings on hard to measure things, especially ones that didn't fall neatly into the model that function point counting assumes.
