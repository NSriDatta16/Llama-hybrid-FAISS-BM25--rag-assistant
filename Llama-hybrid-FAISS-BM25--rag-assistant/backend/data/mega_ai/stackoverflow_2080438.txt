problems with sending non-english text over mail

I am trying to send non-english text over mail. The non-english text is on the "from" field of the mail (the text that appears beside the email address). In the recipient's mailbox, the non-english text is seen as a series of question marks. What could be wrong? Previously, I was having problems with printing non-english text from a simple java program. The problem was with encoding used for the source file. I changed it to UTF-8 and could then print unicode text by embedding them into the program. Now all my source files are encoded using UTF-8. Could this be related to the above mentioned problem in any way? By any chance, do I have to mention the encoding to be used for the message to be sent? If so, how do I do this? Just to put in more context, this is observed in a web application that is hosted over google app engine and the program is written in java.
