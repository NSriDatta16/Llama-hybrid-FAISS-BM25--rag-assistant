I'd recommend starting off using a Poisson regression model, which is well suited for count models. Since you seem to have multiple counts at different locations, you will need to use a method that takes into account the correlation of these observations within their clusters? I would suggest using a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach or a mixed model approach. If you aren't interested in examining differences between measurement sites, then I'd recommend going with GEE since it offers population average estimates. There are plenty of posts on Cross-Validated that describe GEE and mixed models.
