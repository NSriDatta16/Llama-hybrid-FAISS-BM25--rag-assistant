How can I use Machine learning for inter-relationship between Features?

Machine learning is used mostly for prediction and there are numerous algorithms and packages for this. How can I use machine learning for studying inter-relationships between features? What are major packages and functions for this? Are there any packages for graphics in this area? Can artificial neural networks also be used for this purpose? If so, any particular type is specifically suited for this? I do not want to limit to any particular language like Python or R.
