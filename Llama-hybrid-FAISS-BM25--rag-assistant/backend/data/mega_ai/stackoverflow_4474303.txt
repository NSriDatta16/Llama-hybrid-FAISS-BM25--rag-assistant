I found a post on the internet that allowed me to get past this issue. After doing a Build and Archive, go to Organizer and view the build entry under Archived Applications. Right click on the build and select "Show in Finder". You will see a file called "ArchiveInfo.plist". Open this file using the Property List Editor app. Find the entry in the plist called XCApplicationName and edit the entry to remove spaces. Save and Close the file and try to Validate/Submit the app. The error should not show up. I am not sure what the ramifications of doing it this way, but it did resolve the error.
