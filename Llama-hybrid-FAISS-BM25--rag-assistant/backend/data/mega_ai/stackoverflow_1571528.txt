Force a mouse event in Silverlight 3

I have 2 UserControls: uc1 and uc2 On uc1.MouseOver, uc2 increases in size. On uc1.MouseLeave, uc2 returns to the original size. On uc1.MouseLeftButtonUp, a popup is opened. However, when the popup is then closed, uc1.MouseLeave is not triggered, so uc2 doesn't return to it's original size. A solution would be to have uc2 also subscribe to uc1.MouseLeftButtonUp, and execute the same code as on uc1.MouseLeave, but this is not a very elegant solution, as I have to repeat this for everything that subscribes to uc1.MouseLeave. Is there a way to force the MouseLeave event programmatically?
