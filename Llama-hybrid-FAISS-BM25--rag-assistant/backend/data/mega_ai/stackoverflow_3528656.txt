My suggestion for a "solution" can be found here . It's not elegant, but in the browser (IE/FF quick test) it looks like what I think you were looking for. What I did was add a new div.front-wrapper with desired border-bottom and width of 25% and a negative margin-top. I removed the border-bottom from div.front-description. Then I placed an empty div with the class front-wrapper after the "wrapping" -div is closed. The front-wrapper of course now has a misleading class name as it's not wrapping anything, but that's what I started to use it for, but couldn't get it working as desired. So do rename it.
