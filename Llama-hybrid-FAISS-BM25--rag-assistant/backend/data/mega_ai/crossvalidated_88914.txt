when you "sudden" you imply that there's a notion of what is not sudden, i.e. you seem to have some idea of what is a big change. on the other hand you don't want to use threshold, which tells me that you don't want to rely entirely on your preconceived notion of what is a big change. so it seems that you want to combine your current understanding of the big change with incoming data. you could do this in Bayesian style. for instance you come up a prior for a variance, then while the data is incoming you keep updating the variance of the series. then you detect sudden change by evaluating the deviation of each jump against the variance. maybe you set 1% confidence.
