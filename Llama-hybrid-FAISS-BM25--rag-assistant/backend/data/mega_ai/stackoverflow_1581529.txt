Jquery -How to do to combined image drag-drop and image zoom?

For my jquery web-application I have a gallery of thumbnails on my page and i would like to be able to: Drag drop any image into a target div When single click on any image the image would expand and show the larger version of the image on the screen. I have tried to do this my self but it fails as when I drag it it also starts to zoom the image. Any ideas on how to do this? I have tried with http://andreaslagerkvist.com/jquery/image-zoom/ and the Jquery UI library. What i have done so far is: jQuery(document.body).imageZoom(); $(function() { $("#draggable").draggable(); $("#droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { $(this).addClass('ui-state-highlight').find('p').html('Dropped!'); } }); }); any ideas?
