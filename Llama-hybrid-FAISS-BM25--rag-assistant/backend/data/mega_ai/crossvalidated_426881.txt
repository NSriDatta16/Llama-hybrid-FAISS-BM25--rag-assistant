How to improve logistic regression in R

I'm trying to improve the performance of a logistic regression in R to a dataset similar to this one but with more columns and rows : df = data.frame(c('1','1','0','1','0'), c('5','4','1','4','2'), c('11,3','4.1','6.0','7.4','4.9'), c('0','1','1','0','0')) names(df) (I want to predict if the person is dead or not) For the moment i used the significance of the variables provided by the glm model and test different combinations with them : model How could i improve the performande of this logistic regression ? Maybe by creating combinations of one variable like that ? glm.fit or combinationts of different variables: glm.fit The number of possibilities is huge, therefore how can I find the most suitable combinations according to the type of variable or its distribution ? Thanks in advance !
