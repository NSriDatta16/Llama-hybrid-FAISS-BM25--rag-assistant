You don't have to do PCA over the correlation matrix; you can decompose the covariance matrix as well. Note that these will typically yield different solutions. (For more on this, see: PCA on correlation or covariance? ) In your second figure, the correlations are the same, but the groups look different. They look different because they have different covariances. However, the variances are also different (e.g., the red group varies over a wider range of X1), and the correlation is the covariance divided by the standard deviations (${\rm Cov}_{xy} / {\rm SD}_x{\rm SD}_y$). As a result, the correlations can be the same. Again, if you perform PCA with these groups using the covariance matrices, you will get a different result than if you use the correlation matrices.
