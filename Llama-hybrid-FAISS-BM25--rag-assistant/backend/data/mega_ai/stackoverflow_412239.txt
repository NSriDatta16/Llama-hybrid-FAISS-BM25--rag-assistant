If you've written the code and are only now thinking about the tests, you've already strayed from the True Path of test-driven development :-) That said, if it were my code, I'd write the UserService tests first, then check my code coverage. Edit in response to comment: If you haven't actually written the code yet, I'd write the tests for UserService first, because that's the ultimate goal of your app. Then as I wrote the code to make the UserService tests pass, I'd spawn off tests of the repository. Those tests eventually become the specification of the repository in case you want to reuse it later.
