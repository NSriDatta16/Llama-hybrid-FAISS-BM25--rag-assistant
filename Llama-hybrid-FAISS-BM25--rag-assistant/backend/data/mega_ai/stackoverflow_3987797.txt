In this case, you can use t.contents[1].contents[0] to get FOO and BAR. The thing is that contents returns a list with all elements (Tags and NavigableStrings), if you print contents, you can see it's something like [u'\n', FOO , u'\n'] So, to get to the actual tag you need to access contents[1] (if you have the exact same contents, this can vary depending on the source HTML), after you've find the proper index you can use contents[0] afterwards to get the string inside the a tag. Now, as this depends on the exact contents of the HTML source, it's very fragile. A more generic and robust solution would be to use find() again to find the 'a' tag, via t.find('a') and then use the contents list to get the values in it t.find('a').contents[0] or just t.find('a').contents to get the whole list.
