Read xts from CSV file in R

I'm trying to read time series from CSV file and save them as xts to be able to process them with quantmod. The problem is that numeric values are not parsed. CSV file: name;amount;datetime test1;3;2010-09-23 19:00:00.057 test2;9;2010-09-23 19:00:00.073 R code: library(xts) ColClasses = c("character", "numeric", "character") Data Result: name amount 2010-09-23 19:00:00 "test1" "3" 2010-09-23 19:00:00 "test2" "9" See amount column contains character data but expected to be numeric. What's wrong with my code?
