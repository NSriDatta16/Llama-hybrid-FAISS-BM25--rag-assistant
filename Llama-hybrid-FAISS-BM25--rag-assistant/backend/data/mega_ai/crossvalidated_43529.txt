Using PCA to reduce the number of variables split into groups

First of all, sorry for the strange title, I had no idea how to describe my problem better. My issue is the following, I think it is pretty much limited to geosciences. I have several properties for every sample, which are divided by depth. For instance: $ \qquad \displaystyle \small \begin{array} {r|rrr} \hline ID & 1 & 2 &3 & ...\\ \hline \text{var1}_{0-20cm} & 2.3 &2.0 &1.0& ...\\ \text{var1}_{20-50cm} & 2.1 &1.1 &0.0& ...\\ \text{var1}_{50-100cm}& 2.6 &1.1 &0.0& ...\\ \hline \text{var2}_{0-20cm} & 10.5 &5.5 &3.5& ...\\ \text{var2}_{20-50cm} & 10.9 &5.9 &1.9& ...\\ \text{var2}_{50-100cm}& 15.0 &5.0 &1.0& ...\\ \hline \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\ \hline \end{array} $ Basically these are geological layers going from surface down to 100 cm depth. I am trying to decrease the number of variables, either with PCA or factor analysis. The issue is, that I would like to handle properties together, no matter what the depth is. (For instance I do not want to get rid of a layer in between the surface and the bottom layer.) Is there any way to handle them together, or group them for PCA or whatever. I tried to find some relevant information, but I think the problem is limited to a small portion of the science (maybe I am wrong), so I could not find anything useful.
