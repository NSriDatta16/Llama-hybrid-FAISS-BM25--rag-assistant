Calculate the Hilbert value of a point for use in a Hilbert R-Tree?

I have an application where a Hilbert R-Tree (wikipedia) (citeseer) would seem to be an appropriate data structure. Specifically, it requires reasonably fast spatial queries over a data set that will experience a lot of updates. However, as far as I can see, none of the descriptions of the algorithms for this data structure even mention how to actually calculate the requisite Hilbert Value ; which is the distance along a Hilbert Curve to the point. So any suggestions for how to go about calculating this?
