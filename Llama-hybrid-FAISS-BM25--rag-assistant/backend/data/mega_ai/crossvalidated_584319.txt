Theory of 'Runs' and probability

I want to know how did author compute the probability of eleven runs if all arrangements are equally probable. My attempt to answer my own question: This example indicates wide applicability of the probability model of placing randomly r balls into n cells. Here n cells = 16 seats and r balls = 5 persons. Such an event is completely described by its occupancy numbers $ r_1,r_2,..., r_n$ where $r_k$ stands for the number of persons in the kth seat. Every n-tuple of integers satisfying $r_1 + r_2 + ...+ r_n= r, r_k \geq 0 $ desribes the possible configuration of occupancy numbers. With indistinguishable persons, two distributions are distinguishable only if the corresponding n-tuples $(r_1, r_2, ..., r_n)$ are not identical. The number of distinguishable distributions is $$Arrangement_{r,n} =\binom{n + r -1}{r} =\binom{n + r -1}{n-1}$$ So, in this case, the total sample space is $\binom{16 + 5 -1}{5} = \binom{20}{5} = \binom{16 + 5 -1 = 20}{ 16 - 1 =15}= 15504.$ Now, we can choose 5 seats to occupy from 11 runs in $\binom{11}{5}=462$ ways. We can choose 5 seats from 10 runs in $ \binom{10}{5}= 252$ ways. We can choose from 5 seats from 9 runs in $ \binom{9}{5}=126$ ways. And lastly we can choose 5 seats from 8 runs in $ \binom{8}{5}= 56$ ways. So, the total number of ways of selecting 11 runs are 462 + 252 + 126 + 56 = 896 . The total sample space is 15504. Hence the probability of eleven runs if all arrangements are equally probable is $\frac{896}{15504} = 0.0578 $ which matches with author's answer as well. Is this answer computed by me and its method of computation correct?
