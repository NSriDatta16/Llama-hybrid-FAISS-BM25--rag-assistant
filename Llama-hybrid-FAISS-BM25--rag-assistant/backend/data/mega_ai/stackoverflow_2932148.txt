C# Array Maximum

I have 2 arrays named Arr1 and Arr2 in C#. They are of the exact same dimensions... I need to get the element of Arr1 corresponding to maximum of elements in Arr2 beginning with given indices ... e.g Get indices of the max of Arr2 [ 1 , 10 , 3 , i , j ] for all i , j Return Arr1 [ 1 , 10 , 3 , i , j ] Of course I need the elegant solution (not the "loop for them" one...) Please Note: I do not want to loop through the arrays, because it is 11 dimensional!!.. the code will be ugly and error prone.. and I may run out of variable names :) EDIT: The normal solution would be: for(int i=0;i But I need to do it in less and more beautiful code.. may be using querys or linq..
