Linear Regression with Time Series Data

I am in the process of completing an applied econometrics project and want to find the effects of my chosen independent variables (fertility, gender wage gap, years of schooling, etc) on my dependent variable (female labour participation rate). I have 30 annual observations for each variable. At first, I tried to find if a cointegrating relationship existed but there is none. Would it be suitable to continue my project using OLS regression? In addition to checking for autocorrelation, what else should I look out for?
