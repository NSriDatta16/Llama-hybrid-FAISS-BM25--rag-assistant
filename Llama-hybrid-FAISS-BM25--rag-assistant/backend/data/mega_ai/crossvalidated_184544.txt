The simple way to compute it is to pair up all observations at the same time and compute the sample Pearson's correlation (this is what Google Correlate does) For example, Let's say you want to correlate the time series $S_1$ and $S_2$: time S_1 S_2 t_1 20.4400 19.7450 t_2 19.0750 20.3300 t_3 20.0650 20.1700 .. .. .. Which might look like this when plotted: You just have to use this formula: $$ r(S_1,S_2) \triangleq \frac{ \sum_{k=1}^n (S_1(t_k) - \bar{S_1})(S_2(t_k) - \bar{S_2}) }{ \sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^n (S_1(t_k)- \bar{S_1})^2 \sum_{k=1}^n (S_2(t_k) - \bar{S_2})^2 }} $$ where $S_1(t_k)$ is a particular value of the time series $S_1$ at time $t_k$, and $\bar{S_1}$ is the average value of $S_1$. (Just look at the formula of the sample Pearson's correlation between two variables $X$ and $Y$, from wikipedia ) As Gung said, there are different approaches to tackle this problem. Pearson's correlation is good if you are interested in linear correlations, which are very intuitive. There are other measures of dependencies which identify non-linear relationships. I can point you out to a presentation I prepared (hope it is not too shameful to add something of mine here)
