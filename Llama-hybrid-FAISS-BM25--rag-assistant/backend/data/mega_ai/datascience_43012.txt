Unbalanced multi-label multi-class classification

What are common approaches in order to deal with unbalanced multi-label multi-class classification problems in deep learning? Furthermore there is correlation between the labels. I tried two approaches. Using weights for the loss function. I used a sperate weight for each class and label. The weight was indirectly proportional to the frequency of the target class given a label. Training $q$ classifiers for $q$ labels. There I sampled the target label with an equally distributed class distributions. I used weights as weighting between different labels. The target label got a weight higher compared to other labels. In the beginning I thought that these two approaches should result in similar results. But Approach $2$ performed much better. It would be nice to see either it was just a random result in my experiment or there is more systematic in this kind of problems. Is there any literature for this problem or does anybody have some experience?
