How to deal with failing the proportional odds assumption in ordinal logistic regression

I am attempting to do ordinal logistic regression but I keep failing to pass the proportional odds assumption. Almost all of my features are shown to have high significance, but the only model that I can fit that passes the Chi-Squared test for proportional odds is rather trivial. What is the typical way of rectifying this? Is it like linear regression where I can add more interactions or higher order terms to rectify this? If so, how do I go about finding (visually) the ideal adjustments to make to my model? (Like I could plot the residuals against a predictor in linear regression to determine where linearity fails. Is there an equivalent for ORL?)
