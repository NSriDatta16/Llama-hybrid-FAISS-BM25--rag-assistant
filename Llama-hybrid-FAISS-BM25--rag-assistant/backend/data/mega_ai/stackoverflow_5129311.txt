You could also use the clients IP address as a token, giving different IP addresses access to different (parts / instances) of the system. But gain, this is not very secure, as you have no way of knowing who is behind the client PC and IP addresses can be spoofed. Perhaps you could develop additional specs; giving IP addresses only access during office hours, or check the clients browser (user agent) and check it against the user agent officially being used at the client.
