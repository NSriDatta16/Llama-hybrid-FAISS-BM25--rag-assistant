Changing contact us to secured in magento

I know in order to do this I need to add to the config file located in app/code/core/Mage/Contacts/etc/config.xml the following /contacts/ below the tag but if I wanted to create a module that depends on Mage_Contacts can I just create basically an etc/config.xml file that mimics the one in Mage_Contacts_Etc? Additionally it seems like overkill just to do that for such a small little change.
