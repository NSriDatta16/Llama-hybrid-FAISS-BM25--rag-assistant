I just consider this: instanceVar.staticMethod(); to be shorthand for this: instanceVar.getClass().staticMethod(); If you always had to do this: SomeClass.staticMethod(); then you wouldn't be able to leverage inheritance for static methods. That is, by calling the static method via the instance you don't need to know what concrete class the instance is at compile time, only that it implements staticMethod() somewhere along the inheritance chain. EDIT: This answer is wrong. See comments for details.
