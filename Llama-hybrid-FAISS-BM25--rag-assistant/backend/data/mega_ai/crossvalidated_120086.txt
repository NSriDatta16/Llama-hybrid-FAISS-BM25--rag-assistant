Well, I don't know what significance level you are using with your student's test. Let's say you are using 5%. In this case, the interpretation is easier if you don't use the "equals" sign, as the result of the test is not really a relation of equality. The test says to you that you can be 95% sure (100% - 5%) that the samples 1 and 2 have the same mean. It also says that you can 95% sure that the samples 2 and 3 have the same mean. They may have an empirical average slightly different, but it is not enough to make you less than 95%. But, if you compare samples 1 and 3 you will be less than 95% sure that they have the same mean. Probably the differences from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3 have summed up to the point that you have more "suspicion" that 1 and 3 come from random variables with different means. But I think it will help to look at the p-values of your tests. They are probably very close to the significance level of your tests.
