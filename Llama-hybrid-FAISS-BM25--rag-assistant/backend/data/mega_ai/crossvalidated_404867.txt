Odds ratio not between the two odds ratio of a stratified analysis

This is not the first time I have performed stratified analyses based on logistic regressions, but I have never before been confronted with this situation. When I test my relationship in the overall population, my OR is 3.98 (3.60-4.40). When I stratify my population according to their obesity, I have these two ORs: 2.05 (1.75-2.41) and 3.52 (3.08-4.04). I wonder how it is possible that the OR in the overall population is larger than either of the two and whether this could indicate a problem in the model (e. g. too high collinearity between obesity and my outcome).
