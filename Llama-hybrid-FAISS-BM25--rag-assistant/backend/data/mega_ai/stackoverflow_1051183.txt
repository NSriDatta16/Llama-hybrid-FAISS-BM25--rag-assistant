After 10.5 NSCalendarDate will be deprecated. Thus it likely just doesn't exist in iPhone SDK: Important: Use of NSCalendarDate strongly discouraged. It is not deprecated yet, however it may be in the next major OS release after Mac OS X v10.5. For calendrical calculations, you should use suitable combinations of NSCalendar, NSDate, and NSDateComponents, as described in Calendars in Date and Time Programming Guide for Cocoa . Look for the iPhone versions of NSCalendar , NSDate and NSDateComponents
