Finding the point of a set most close to the other set of points

I've dataset that looks something like this: Let us call this data "df" ID var1 var2 var3 ... varn val 1 v11 v12 v13 ... v1n v1 2 v21 v22 v23 ... v2n v2 .......... m vm1 vm2 vm3 ... vmn vm This data is divided into two parts based on "val" variable. That is if it's greater than threshold, it's "good", if it's less than that, "bad". Note that column "val" is only to identify the row as good or bad, and is removed from df.good and df.bad. To use R notation: df.good threshold,] df.bad Now, my goal is to find data points in df.bad that are close/similar to df.good. This is how I'm doing right now. 1. Take a point in bad.df. Calculate distance between that point and all the points in good.df 2. Take the average of those distances. 3. Repeat for all the points in bad.df. 4. Sort average distance. Identify the ones with smallest distance as closest. Now the problem with above approach is it's lot of time to get result. My question is how do I get points that are close/similar to "good.df" in "bad.df" efficiently..
