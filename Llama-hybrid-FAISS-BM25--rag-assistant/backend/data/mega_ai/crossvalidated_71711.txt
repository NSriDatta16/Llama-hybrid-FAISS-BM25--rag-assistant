Let me explain what odds mean in general. Odds are the ratio between the probability of success over the probability of failure, that is, $\displaystyle \frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}$. Let's say $p_{i}$ for a given event is 0.6, then the odds for that event is $0.6/0.4=1.5$. 1- As you said, since the logistic regression outputs probabilities based on the following equation: $$\text{logit}(p_{i}) = \log{\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + ... + \beta_{k}x_{k}$$ the coefficients refer to each $\beta_{i}$. 2- Odds ratios are simply the exponential of the weights you found before. For example, the first coefficient you have is outlook=sunny: -6.4257 . If you calculate $\exp(-6.4257)$ you get 0.0016 that is the corresponding value in the odds ratio table. The relation between the coefficient for outlook=sunny and its odds ratio is, in this case, the logarithm of the odds of outlook=sunny over the odds of outlook=¬sunny : $$\displaystyle \log{\frac{Odds(outlook=sunny)}{Odds(outlook=¬sunny)}}$$ For instance, the odds of outlook=sunny is the probability of a sunny day in which you can play over the probability of having a sunny day in which you can't play. Similarly, you can calculate the odds for outlook=¬sunny . The log of this ratio is the value of the coefficient attached to the variable outlook=sunny in the logistic regression. However, in this particular example, since you have more than one variable as predictors, it's necessary to fix the value of the other variables. Now you can see why outlook=overcast has such a value. The odds for outlook=overcast are extremely favorable to the yes outcome, producing a high positive value. A simpler example of this can be found here . 3.- The confusion matrix is very simple. In the first row, for example, it tells you the number of instances classified in your training data as yes that you classified as yes (that is, 7) and the number that are classified as yes that you classified as no (2). The second row is equivalent for instances classified as no .
