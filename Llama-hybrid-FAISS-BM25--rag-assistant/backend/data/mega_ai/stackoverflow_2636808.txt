Python file - Want to change it to a function or a class

I have a python program/file that I want to run repeatedly and calculate the averages of some variables over these runs. To do so, I thought it might be convenient to convert this program into a function or a class. One way I can think of is to add a def Main(): line at the top and indent every line manually within it. Is there an easier way? I am using pydev on eclipse. Thanks.
