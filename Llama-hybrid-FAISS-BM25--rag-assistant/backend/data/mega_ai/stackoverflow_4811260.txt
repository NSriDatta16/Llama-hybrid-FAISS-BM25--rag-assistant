Why would an XML-RPC API endpoint randomly throw a ProtocolError -1?

We have built an extensive middleware system around Magento's XML-RPC API. We've wrapped the endpoint with Python and are doing a lot of multicalls. At a seemingly random interval, the API responds with ProtocolError for www.mydomain.com/api/xmlrpc/: -1 Is this Apache's funny way of saying "503 Service Unavailable" and if so, why might that be? What's the ideal way of handling this exception? A retry on exception seems like it'd make the problem worse. The web server is Ubuntu 10.04.1 PHP 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.5 with Suhosin-Patch & Zend Engine v2.3.0 The API is being called with Python's xmlrpclib.
