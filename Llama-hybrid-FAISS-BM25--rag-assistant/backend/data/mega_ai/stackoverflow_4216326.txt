Changing a form layout in C#

I am working on a program which requires a user to select the file that he/she wishes to open. There are about 3 different files they can choose from, and each of those files affect the layout of the buttons, and some of their attributes also. The problem is, at the moment I have this huge list with: label1.Visible = false; label2.Visible = false; form.size = etc. Each file affects about 16 different controls, so that's a total of 48 possible changes. Is there a faster/better way to organize the layout of your program? Thank you in advance. Framework: 3.5 Language: C# Windows Forms Application
