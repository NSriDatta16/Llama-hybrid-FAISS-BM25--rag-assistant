@Mattthew has answered your question: Spearman's $\rho$ will give you a measure of monotonic association between your variables. You can also perform inference on whether this correlation is, for example, different than zero using a straightforward t test. To calculate $\boldsymbol{r}_{\textbf{S}}$ (assuming no ties): Rank each of your variables independently. Calculate the difference, $d_{i}$ , between ranks for each observation/text (I am assuming from your question, that the measures are paired : so there's a count from text $A$ and a different count from text $B$ , across n texts). $r_{\text{S}} = 1 - \frac{6\sum_{i=1}^{n}{d_{i}^{2}}}{n\left(n^{2}-1\right)}$ The calculation for $\mathbf{r}_{\textbf{S}}$ (regardless of ties): Rank each of your variables independently. Calculations proceed as for Pearson's $r$ but using the ranked values ( $r_A$ and $r_B$ ) of the before and after (or matched) observations: $r_{\text{S}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{r_{A,i} - \overline{r}_{A}}{s_{r_A}} \times \frac{r_{A,i} - \overline{r}_{A}}{s_{r_B}}}}{n-1}$ To test for evidence $\mathbf{r_{\textbf{S}} \ne 0}$ : $\text{H}_{0}\text{: }r_{\text{S}} = 0$ , $\text{H}_{\text{A}}\text{: }r_{\text{S}} \ne 0$ $t = r_{\text{S}}\sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^{2}_{\text{S}}}}$ Base your rejection decision for $\text{H}_{0}$ on the t distribution, with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.
