Would you remove the old Code, or hope that it may awake some time ... zombie - like I'd definitely remove it. I hate having to work out if functions ever get called. Do you think that it is worth the Effort to remove the Code (less work to find stuff in the clutter, better test coverage, easier for other people to find their way) Yes, definitely worth the effort. Should we keep the Code somewhere, as a reference? Um, you are using version control softwarev, aren't you?
