Theory: Logistic Regression MLE does not exist when data are perfectly separable?

I realize that this is a relatively well published/understood concept, but I'm unfamiliar with how the conclusion is derived. Could someone ELI5 why when the data are perfectly separable, the MLE for a logistic regression $\hat{\beta} = \infty$?
