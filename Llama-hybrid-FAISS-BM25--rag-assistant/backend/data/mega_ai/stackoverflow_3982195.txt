When is it more appropriate to use DIV instead of TABLE, and vice-versa?

I've noticed a variation of convention when it comes to using DIV tags instead of TABLE to separate/organize content on a web-page. In what situation is one more appropriate to use than the other? Clarification: This question is both general, and specific in that I'm mainly looking for which would be more ideal for page layout.
