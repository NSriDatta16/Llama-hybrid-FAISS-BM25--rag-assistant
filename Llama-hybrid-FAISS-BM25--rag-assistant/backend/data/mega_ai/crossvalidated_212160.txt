If we have a good expectation of the parametric form of the distribution, then it is often the case that we can get a better estimate of the distribution by parameter-fitting than by smoothing. But if we aren't confident of the form of the distribution--i.e. we are worried that we will misspecify the parametric form--then smoothing is often an attractive alternative, particularly in scenarios where it is cheap to collect a very large number of measurements, yielding arbitrarily good empirical nonparametric approximations to the distribution. One very common case is summarizing the posterior distributions from MCMC output in Bayesian statistical applications. A nonparametric empirical approximation to the distribution is all that is typically desired.
