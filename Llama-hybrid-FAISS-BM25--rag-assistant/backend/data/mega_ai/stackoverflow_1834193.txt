You need to set a header that identifies your program. As you can see in the php manual for mail the fourth paramter allows you to include headers. The RFC identifies both "Mailer", "X-Mailer" and "Sender" as the agents, so which one to use I will leave up to you ( wikipedia notes that X-Mailer is ofte used by clients). An example: $headers = "X-Mailer: MyApp\r\n"; $succcess = mail(â‚¬to, $subject, $message, $headers);
