For each of your products compute the frequency of sales conditional on whether it was in the warehouse or not. For this you need to compute the time that the product has been in stock and the time that it has not been in stock and the number of sales during each of those time periods. Potentially, if you have a lot of data, you could also compute this per hour of the day, or day of the week, if you have a lot of hourly variations in your availability of the product. Then you have a list of products and frequencies like Product ID Sales in stock Sales not in stock [amount per day] [amount per day] 1 3 2 2. 0.3 0.32 .. etc I would plot these as a scatter plot to inspect visually whether there are deviations from a straight line. You could add lines that indicate a p-value for deviating from the line (e.g. based on any procedure for an AB testing ). But this is not so easy because both groups may not have been equally exposed, but for the lines you could assume the average exposure among all groups, or you divide the scatter plot into multiple groups depending on the relative exposure. In addition, you can compute for each point individually whether some boundary is passed and use colour or grayscale to plot to indicate those points. The scatter plot might also be augmented with contour lines indicating the number of sales lost. There are several interesting complex analysises that you can do. But this becomes very broad. An example, your orders have multiple products and you could analyse whether there are interactions. Possibly the availability of some key product increases the sales of other products?
