Error with dijit.form.NumberTextBox

Despite many trials and errors, I cannot get the NumberTextBox widget to work. I keep receiving this error message: Catchable fatal error: Argument 4 passed to Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_NumberTextBox::numberTextBox() must be an array, null given The odd thing is: I event tried this example straight from the ZF examples page and it failed with the same error ->addElement( 'NumberTextBox', 'numberbox', array( 'label' => 'NumberTextBox', 'required' => true, 'invalidMessage' => 'Invalid elevation.', 'constraints' => array( 'min' => -20000, 'max' => 20000, 'places' => 0, ) ) ) So, I'm at a loss now. If someone has the time to look at the code found here , your help would be greatly appreciated. I know it's something that I'm overlooking. It always is.
