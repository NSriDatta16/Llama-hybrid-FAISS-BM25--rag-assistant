Changing dev iPhone app's bundle identifier - retain core data store?

I need to change the bundle identifier of my iPhone app before I can upload it to the app store. However, I also have data in my Core Data store which want to continue using even after I change the bundle identifier. However, it seems that the bundle identifier is how the iPhone knows whether apps are identical with one another, so I end up with two distinct copies of the app -- with two distinct core data stores -- on my phone! I know that I can download the sqlite data store through the Xcode organizer, how can I make sure that my data transfers to the new app package with the new bundle identifier?
