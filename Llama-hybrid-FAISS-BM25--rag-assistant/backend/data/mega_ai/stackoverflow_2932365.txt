Why Is my UISlider Thumb Image Being Shown Multiple Times and Not Disappearing As They Should?

This slider is possessed: Slider http://gorgando.com/possessedSlider.jpg Whenever I enter "editing mode" for the tableview or leave "editing mode" a duplicate thumb image will appear where the thumb is. It is now behaving consistently in this way. If I switch back and forth from editing mode I'll get lots of thumb images like the screenshot shows. This is the code that I use to create the slider (in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method): CGRect frame = CGRectMake(20, 42.0, 280.0, 22); self.slider = [[UISlider alloc] initWithFrame:frame]; [self.slider addTarget:self action:@selector(sliderAction:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged]; self.slider.continuous = YES; self.slider.minimumValue = 0.0; self.slider.maximumValue = 5.0; self.slider.value = 0.0; [[interestCell contentView] addSubview:self.slider]; Appreciate any thoughts you might have! [I just edited/updated this to reflect the questions/suggestions I received but it's still having problems].
