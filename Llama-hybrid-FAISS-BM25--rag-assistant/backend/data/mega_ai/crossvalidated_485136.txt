evaluating linear assumption of logistic regression model

I am trying to evaluate the assumption of linearity of the log odds of an outcome in relation to continuous predictors by using the boxTidwell function in R. When i try to run these analyses, I am getting en error message (see below), which I believe is due to the fact that there are 0's in my continuous predictors. x1 Error in boxTidwell.default(y, X1, X2, max.iter = max.iter, tol = tol, : the variables to be transformed must have only positive values I have 2 questions. Is there anyway I can get this test to work? One of the things that I did was plot the relationship between each continuous predictor and the log odds of the outcome and it looked like there was a quadratic relationship between the variable and the log odds of the outcome. In this case, what would one recommend doing?
