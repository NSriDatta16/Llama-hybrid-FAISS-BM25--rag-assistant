Windows API reserved parameters

I was wondering why some functions have some parameters that must be set to NULL because of "reserved parameters". For example: LONG WINAPI RegQueryValueEx( __in HKEY hKey, __in_opt LPCTSTR lpValueName, __reserved LPDWORD lpReserved, __out_opt LPDWORD lpType, __out_opt LPBYTE lpData, __inout_opt LPDWORD lpcbData ); I can't understand why lpReserved exists? I mean, if it's reserved why put it, wouldn't be simpler to directly omit it? Thanks! :) (pay no attention to my English please..)
