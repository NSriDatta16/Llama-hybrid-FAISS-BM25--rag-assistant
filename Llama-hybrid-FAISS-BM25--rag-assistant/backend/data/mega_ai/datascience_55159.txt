Machine learning for object states

I have the objects pool with histories of their states, where each transition from one state to another takes some time, ex: $$ object\ 1: A \overset{1s}{\rightarrow} B \overset{2s}{\rightarrow} C \\ object\ 2: D \overset{3s}{\rightarrow} E \overset{4s}{\rightarrow} F $$ The pool consists of many objects with right histories, where sequence of states and transition duration follows some unknown rules. Also the pool consists a small amount of object with wrong history. But which objects are right or wrong is unknown. It needs to found mistakes in the pool. Ex, "the transition from X to Y is not allowed" or "the transition is too long for such type". What machine learning models are more suitable for this problem?
