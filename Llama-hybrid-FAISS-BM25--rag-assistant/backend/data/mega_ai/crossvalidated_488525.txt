Presumably, it is the average improvement made by each group that matters. So, you can find the post-test minus pre-test differences $D_i$ for each student. Then do a 2-sample t test on the two groups of $D_i$ s. Because the two groups differed on average as to pre-test scores, it seems possible that the pre-test scores for one group may also have had a higher variability than the other. So it seems best to use Welch t tests which would not be invalidated by any difference in variabilities of post minus pre $D_i$ s between groups. Note: It is unusual for two randomized groups to differ significantly at the 5% level, but that happens (by definition) 5% of the time, as shown in the simulation below, and if you look at $D_i$ s this should be no problem. set.seed(921) m = 10^5; pv = numeric(m) for (i in 1:m) { x = rnorm(70, 100, 15); xr = sample(x) pv[i] = t.test(xr[1:35], xr[36:70])$p.val } mean(pv
