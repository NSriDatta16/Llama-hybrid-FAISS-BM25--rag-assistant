First you need to distinguish private and public addresses (check wikipedia IP_address#Private_addresses). Private IPs: the best you can do is compute if 2 addresses COULD be on the same network or not, then you need clues from other features to KNOW if it is the case or no. Public IPs: For geographic distance, you may want to check web services/API that try to map IP and geographical locations (one google search turned this one for instance enter link description here ). Another point which could be interesting is the "organisational distance", from the IP address you can try to identify the owner of the address (the ISP), check ARIN for instance http://whois.arin.net/rest/net/NET-8-8-8-0-1/pft?s=8.8.8.8 . From there you can try to figure out if two addresses belong to the same organisation or not. You will have to find some way to tell if the organisation is an ISP with private customers or a company with their own network. Please be also aware that some organisations have started to resell blocks from their IPV4 addresses to other companies for money with the effect that addresses that used to be in the same organisation/location can now be thousands of miles away in different companies. I think it would be wise to consider these informations as probabilities only.
