Calculating posterior of difference given posterior of two means

I am using R and MCMCpack to do a Bayesian analysis of some data that I have. I have generated posterior distributions ( postDist ) on the means of some parameters ( y1,y2,y3 ) using MCMCregress ( postDist ). Now, I would like to take those posterior distributions on the means and generate a posterior distribution on the difference between the means. Is that a reasonable thing to do in a Bayesian analysis, and if so, how do you do it (either in theory or in R)?
