Set up staging and production environmets and minimizing downtime on simple hosting

I have an ASP.NET MVC 3 application, WouldBeBetter.com , currently hosted on Windows Azure. I have an Introductory Special subscription package that was free for several months but was surprised at how expensive it has turned out to be (â‚¬150 p/m on average!) now that I have started paying for it. That is just way too much money for a site that is not going to generate money any time soon so I've decided to move to a regular hosting provider (DiscountASP.Net). One of the things I'll truly miss though, is the separated Staging and Production environments Azure provides, along with the zero-downtime environment swap. My question is, how could I go about "simulating" a staging environment while hosting on a traditional provider? And what is my best shot at minimizing downtime on new deployments? Thanks. UPDATE: I chose the answer I chose not because I consider it the best method, but because it is what makes the most sense for me at this point.
