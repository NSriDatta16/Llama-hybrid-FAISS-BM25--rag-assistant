How to hide/show cmd window?

I created a Win32 Console application, and hide the cmd window. So if my application is running, it can be seen only by the running processes. If there is a way, i want to modify my applicaition in the following way: If i define a parameter it should show the cmd window, but if i don't use this parameter then it should running without showing the cmd window. I have disabled showing the cmd window the following way: #pragma comment( linker, "/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS" ) int WINAPI WinMain( HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow ) { ... ... ... } Has anyone an idea how to do this? kampi
