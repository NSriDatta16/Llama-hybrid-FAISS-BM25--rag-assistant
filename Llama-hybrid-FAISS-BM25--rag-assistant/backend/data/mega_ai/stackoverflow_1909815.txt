Regex to compare strings with Umlaut and non-Umlaut variations

Can anyone help me with a javascript regular expression that I can use to compare strings that are the same, taking into acccount their non-Umlaut-ed versions. for example, in German the word Grüße can also be written Gruesse . These two strings are to be considered identical. The mappings (ignoring casings for the moment) are: ä = ae ü = ue ö = oe ß = ss As there are not many "couplets" to consider I could do a replace for each variation, but I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way, especially as this use case might need to be extended in future to include e.g. Scandanavian characters...
