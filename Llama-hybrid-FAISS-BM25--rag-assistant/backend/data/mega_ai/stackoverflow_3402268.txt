Opening a resource outside an activity in Android

I am trying to open a Resource by passing the result of context.getResources().getString(R.drawable.myimage) to another class that is not an activity. context.getResources().getString(R.drawable.myimage) returns res/drawable-mdpi/myimage.png However, when I try and open this file, it throws a FileNotFoundException. What is the proper way to open a resource outside an activity?
