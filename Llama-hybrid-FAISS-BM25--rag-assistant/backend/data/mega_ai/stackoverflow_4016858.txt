Using @SessionAttributes this objects will be stored in your HttpSession with the same name and they will be accessible (shared) from different controllers. So, Spring is acting correctly. I think the best approach in your scenario is rename this attribute in every subclass ("BookQuery", "AutorQuery", ...). Not very elegant at all :(
