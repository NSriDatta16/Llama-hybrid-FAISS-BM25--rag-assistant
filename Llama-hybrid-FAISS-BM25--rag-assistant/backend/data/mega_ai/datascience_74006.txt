Context capturing in a Structured PDF?

I'm trying to extract resume (PDF) data. resumes always tend to follow a structure. so if you see some numbers in a cv; according to the context, we could tell whether its a telephone number, a birthday, or a date period. if I can classify/identify one entity then that would increase my ability to classify an entity near to it. I'm still a newbie and appreciate if anyone could give me any thoughts on approaching this problem. what kind of machine learning models should i focus on?
