MAP v.s. Sampling in Bayesian Problem

I've got a high dimensional Bayesian inversion problem. I've managed to solve the MAP with gradient descent method. I'm struggling to use sampling method to solve the same problem. I wonder does the bayesian model (priors and likelihood) works for MAP solver should always work for sampling method such as MCMC? I could not prove that, but in this particular problem, I found MCMC is not able to converging or very difficult to converge while gradient descent works well finding the MAP.
