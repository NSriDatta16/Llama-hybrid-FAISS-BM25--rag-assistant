I don't see an automagic way to do this. What you need to do is: Create a physical folder. Create the filter in the C++ project. Add files from the physical folder to the solution. Drag the added files into the filter folder. Because c/c++ are so path dependant I found it was easier to keep the project in one folder, rather than create sub-project folders. Most C++ projects that I worked with a like that, unlike C# projects where its beneficial to organise the project into subnamespaces.
