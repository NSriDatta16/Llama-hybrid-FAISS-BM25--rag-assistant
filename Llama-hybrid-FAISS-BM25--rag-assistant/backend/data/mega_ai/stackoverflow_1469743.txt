Standard Library Containers with additional optional template parameters?

Having read the claim multiple times in articles - I want to add this question to Stackoverflow, and ask the community - is the following code portable? template class C> void f() { /* some code goes here ... */ } int main() { f (); } Is the implementation that supplies std::vector really allowed to have additional, defaulted template parameters beyond the two well known ones? This would render the above code ill-formed, as it assumes two template parameters. See the last paragraph in this article for an example of such a claim.
