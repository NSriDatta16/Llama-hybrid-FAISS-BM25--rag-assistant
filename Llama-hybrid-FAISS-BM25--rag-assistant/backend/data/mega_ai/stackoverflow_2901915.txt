To explain what's wrong with your tagging approach, I'm going to show you a similarly flawed database: table Students -------------------- Id grade names -- ----- ----- 1 Kindergarden timmy, james, sarah, suzie, etc... 2 1st annie, chris, laura, etc... 3 2nd robert, kimmy, sarah, jason, etc... This is wrong for all of the same reasons. You can't do anything with the names. You can't count them, filter by them, or even return just one of them. What if you want to cool stuff with your tags later that you're not thinking of right now?
