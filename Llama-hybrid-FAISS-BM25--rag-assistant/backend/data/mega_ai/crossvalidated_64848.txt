Reference on how to choose models

I wonder if there is any good and easy to understand book on reviewing on when should a particular statistical model (binomial, logistic regression, etc) be used? My background is in statistics, but most of my work is developing MLE estimation algorithm using matrix calculus. I am now starting to focus more on data analysis, which comes in many different ways, and I don't have a good understanding which models are most proper. For example, I know for binary observations I should use logistic regression, but I don't know under which situations I should use a non informative prior (e.g. Jeffreys' prior). Also, since there are so many choice of models, I don't know in a broad way which one to pick. Thanks.
