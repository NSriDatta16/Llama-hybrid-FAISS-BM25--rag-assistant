Independence of time intervals in ANOVA?

I am not sure how the independence assumption in ANOVA applies in this scenario... We have observational data on the foraging depth of whales across the summer separated into time intervals. We want to see if the depth is consistent over the summer, so would it be appropriate to use ANOVA with the time intervals as the grouping category? Would they be considered independent? Is there a better method to analyze this? also, does it matter that we can't identify whether the same whales are being counted in multiple time intervals?
