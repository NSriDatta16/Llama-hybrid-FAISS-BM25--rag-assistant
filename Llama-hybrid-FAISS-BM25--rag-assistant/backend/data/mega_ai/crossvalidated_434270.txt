Choosing among recent references on Machine Learning

For personal reasons, I need a recent reference book on ML which is not mainly focused on programming, such as for example https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ but which is also not overly theoretical, such as https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Theory-Algorithms/dp/1107057132/ I discarded Bishop's PRML because it's 10 years old now. I was thinking to choose among: https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/ https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576/ https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262028182/ I value clarity of exposition and notational consistency over completeness. Price is not an issue. I'm open to other suggestions, if you think there are better options than the three I listed. PS this one looks very nice too https://mml-book.github.io/ but it hasn't still been published. Also, even though I'm not looking for the most complete treatise, this does seem a little short.
