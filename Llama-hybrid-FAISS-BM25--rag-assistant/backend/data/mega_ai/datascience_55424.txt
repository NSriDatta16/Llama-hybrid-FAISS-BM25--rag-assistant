Extract segment from document scan

I need to extract some "valuable" information from document scan. For example, document's number, incoming date, organizations, persons, etc. Example document: I'm trying to extract highlighted segment of the document. Original scan doesn't have that highlighting. And value can be handwritten or typewritten. I tried U-Net and Mask RCNN for my dataset (~100 examples). Without any success. Any ideas?
