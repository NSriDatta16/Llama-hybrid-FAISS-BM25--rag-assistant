Rails I18n multiple files aliasing

I was wondering if it's possible to have multiple files of a locale, maybe organized in directories and still use the YAML aliases, for example: in a common file: # config/locales/common/en.yml en: first_name: &first_name "First name" last_name: &last_name "Last name" and in a more specific file: # config/locales/models/user/en.yml en: helpers: label: user: first_name: *first_name last_name: *last_name This will help minimize translations and change in translations. in my rails config, i set it to load all locale file in subdirectories. This setup does not work for me, i get a bad alias error when i load a page. I tried having an init script that compiles all the en.yml into one and just use that one file, and the alias works and all, but i cant have the keys merging. For example, the if i have another "helpers" in some other file, it just uses whatever was specified last (in fact, the "en" keeps getting overridden, too) instead of merging the keys. Or is there a better pattern to all of this? Thank you very much!
