jQuery UI draggable/droppable not working in Firefox 3.6.13

I'm using .draggable and .droppable in a project and they work fine in Chrome and IE, but in Firefox 3.6.13 (Windows... I haven't tested this with FF on linux), they don't. I was about to post my code but I decided I'd try the draggable/droppable demos on the jQuery UI website before subjecting anyone to that :-) Sure enough, the following demos do not work (for me at least) in Firefox 3.6.13: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ Can anyone reproduce this? Does anyone know why and/or if there's a solution to this? Thanks in advance!
