Property setter not called for databound property

I got a Combobox bound to a custom object. Most of the time the following code does not set the custom object (but from times to times it does). Do you have any clue on the issue? // In the main form _person = new Person(); _citySelector.DataBindings.Add("SelectedCity", _person, "Adress.City"); //Adress is an object, city too // A property of _citySelector (city selector derives from UserControl and implements INotifyPropertyChanged ) public City SelectedCity { get { return ultraComboCities.SelectedRow.ListObject as City;} set { // Horrible but there is no selector.SelectedValue = foreach (UltraGridRow row in ultraComboCities.Rows) { if(row.ListObject as City == value) { ultraComboTiers.SelectedRow = row; RaisePropertyChanged("SelectedCity"); return; } } } } // I call the following code on my city select object // (1) SelectedTier = City.Get("London"); //ultraComboCities was first populated with cities object including London After the call of (1), _person.Adress.City is (most of the time) not refreshed.
