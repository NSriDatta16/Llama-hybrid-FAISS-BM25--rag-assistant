I don't believe you are looking at the problem the right way. The most important property of a neural network (or any predictive model) is it's accuracy. I would rather spend 10 times longer building the model, if it were significantly more accurate (and predictive). There are many standard techniques for assessing the predictive power of your model, such as * leave-one-out cross validation * leave-many-out cross validation * Fisher randomization (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) There are also many guiding principles for building a predictive model, such as * occam's razor * avoid overfitting (http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/classes/534/slides/part10.pdf) * penalties for overfitting (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) Here are a few places to look for more information http://predictivemodelingblog.blogspot.com/ http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/data-mining-techniques/ Bottom line: go for the simplest model that can explain your data
