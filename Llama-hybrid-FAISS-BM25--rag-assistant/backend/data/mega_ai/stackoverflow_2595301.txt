A tool that can parse C#, pick out attributes, and transform that code any way you'd like, is the DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit and its C# Front End . DMS parses your files, builds full abstact syntax trees, and allows you to write custom transformations that can expand a point in the text (what most code generators like T4 do) or more importantly replace any construct (both local and/or distributed across the set of files that make up the application) with any other code you might like to generate. You appear to have some idea about the metalanguage for producing code fragments, e.g., From operation In metaObject.operations _ Select (MethodTemplate.Create(operation).GetSourceCode) That metalanguage AFAIK isn't C#. With DMS, you can define a parser for the metalanguage, and process the meta langauge into trees as the code generator encounters the constructs. With a small interpreter over such trees, you can convert metalnguage text into generator actions producing the text of interest. [I'm the CTO behind DMS].
