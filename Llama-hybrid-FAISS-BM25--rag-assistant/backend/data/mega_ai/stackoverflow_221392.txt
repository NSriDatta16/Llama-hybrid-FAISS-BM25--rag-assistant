I mapped some global hotkeys: In Winamp I use Ctrl + Alt + Backspace (same as AltGr + Backspace for me) to Pause. If someone wants my attention while I've got headphones on, far easier to press a couple of buttons than click the mouse on a button that's about five pixels wide. I use Ctrl + Alt + C to run calc.
