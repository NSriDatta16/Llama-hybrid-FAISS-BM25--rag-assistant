Without access to the xp_ stored procedures, no. The other way would be to create a COM object using sp_OACreate that creates a COM Scripting.FileSystemObject , but again access to this may well be restricted as it's a security issue. As your describing this as an MSSQL job , I'm assuming this is going to be a scheduled task of some description? If so, your best option is probably going to be creating a standard Windows batch file (.BAT) that's scheduled in SQL Server agent that does the existential checking and passes whatever files are found in to your SQL script via sqlcmd/osql.
