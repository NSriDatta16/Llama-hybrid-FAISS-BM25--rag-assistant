Your approach is parsimonious and would be accurate under the assumption that the daily price range is normally distributed. A permutation test would allow you to make an inference without assuming the normality of the daily price range. At its simplest, the idea is to rank the price ranges in order from highest to lowest, and look into what percentile the event day price range falls. One minus this percentile is a comparable statistic to the p-value associated with the z score you are thinking of calculating. If you think the moving averages are meaningful, then instead of using price ranges, you could use deviation from the 50-day moving average of the price range as your statistic. You could also control for the price range of the market as a whole, say by regressing daily price range on the market's daily price range and running the permutation test on the residuals from this regression. Why are you interested in the range, rather than the daily change, i.e. closing minus opening price? Your approach implies that you think your event predominantly affects intraday variance rather than change in price. If you were thinking of some kind of event (like earnings announcements), I would think daily price change would be a better statistic to examine. In the latter case, there are standard methodologies to control for movement of the market on event days. MacKinlay (1997), "Event Studies in Economics and Finance" is a good reference.
