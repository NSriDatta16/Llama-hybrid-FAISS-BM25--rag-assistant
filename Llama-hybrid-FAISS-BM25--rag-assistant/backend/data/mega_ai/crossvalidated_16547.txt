Without multi-level modeling, how to handle within-study replication in a meta-analysis, where the study is the unit of replication?

Description of the study: I have observed a common error among meta-analyses, with regard to handling of within-study replication. It is not clear to me if the error invalidates the studies when assumptions are stated. However, as I understand it, these assumptions violate a basic premise of statistics. As an example, a study tests the effects of chemical $X$ on response $Y$. The analysis is performed on the log response ratio: the ratio of treatment $Y_{+X}$ (in the presence of $X$) to control $Y_{0}$ (no $X$): $$R = \ln(\frac{Y_{+X}}{Y_{0}})$$ Some of the studies included in the meta-analysis contain multiple treatments, for example different levels or chemical forms of $X$. For each treatment, there is a different value of $R$, although $R$ always uses the same value of $Y_0$. The methods state: responses to different treatments (levels and forms of $X$) within a single study were considered independent observations. Questions: Isn't this pseudoreplication? Is it inappropriate even if the violation of independence is stated in the methods? What would be an easy way (e.g. within the ability of a simple meta-analysis software package) to handle within study replication? Initial thoughts: Summarize results of each study, e.g. by taking the average response Select only one treatment from each study based on a-priori criteria (e.g. highest dose, first measurement)? Are there any other solutions?
