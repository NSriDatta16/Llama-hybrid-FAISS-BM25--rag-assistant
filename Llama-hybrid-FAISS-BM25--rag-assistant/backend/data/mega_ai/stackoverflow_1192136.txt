You have a few terminology issues: Where you say "network segment" you appear to mean "IP subnet". Devices on the same network segment can see the same IP broadcasts. Where you say "hub/switch" you appear mean "IP router". Where you say "won't forward UDP", the problem is actually "won't forward IP broadcasts". Once we get past that, you have a few options: Your servers could register themselves under a well-known name in DNS, if you have a DNS server that allows dynamic DNS updates. You should probably use a SRV record as specified in RFC2782 . The clients then do a DNS lookup to find the server(s). You could statically assign your server(s) well-known names in the organisation's DNS, perhaps with a SRV record as with the previous option. Your servers could join an IP multicast group, if your routers support IP multicast. The clients then send their initial discovery request as a UDP packet to the (pre-ordained) multicast address.
