What is called softmax in ML has the same equation as multinomial logistic equation. The latter can be used to calculate the probabilities. In practice it is widely used in estimation of default probabilities in competing risks framework for mortgages, e.g. see Eq. 4 in this paper . Hence, I would say that your intuition is not completely off the mark. However, in the above mortgage modeling example the dependent variable is the probability metric of loan defaults. You have a pool of mortgages and observe the number of defaults. A single mortgage can either be current or in default, the probability of its default is not observable. We only observe the discrete events. However, we do model the probabilities. How is this different from machine learning? It depends. I could decide to apply it to mortgage defaults, then it wouldn't be much different at all. On the other hand in different applications, this may not work. If you're not modeling the probability explicitly like in my example, then your model output may not represent the probability appropriately.
