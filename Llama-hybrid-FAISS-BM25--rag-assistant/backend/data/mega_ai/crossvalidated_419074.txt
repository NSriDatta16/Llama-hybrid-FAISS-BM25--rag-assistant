Here is my attempt to make sense of this. (If this is not helpful, then perhaps a targeted revision of your question will receive more helpful attention.) First, look at the first three months. A contingency table of Month by Proc (With or Without) is shown below, along with a chi-squared test to see if scheduling varied by month. No significant difference: P-value > 0.05. DTA1 [,1] [,2] [1,] 55 388 [2,] 58 385 [3,] 58 376 Pearson's Chi-squared test data: DTA1 X-squared = 0.18624, df = 2, p-value = 0.9111 Similarly, for the last three months: DTA2 [,1] [,2] [1,] 65 315 [2,] 67 302 [3,] 66 295 chisq.test(DTA2) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: DTA2 X-squared = 0.21354, df = 2, p-value = 0.8987 The P-values are so unusually high that I wonder whether scheduling may be systematic rather than random, with about the same number taken each month during the first three months (high 50's), and about the same number per month during last time period (high 60's). Your main question seems to be whether scheduling behavior is different before and after intervention. So I compared combined results for the first three months with combined results from the last three months. There is a highly significant difference: a greater proportion of the patients of interest received the procedure during the last three months (almost 18%) than during the first three months (about 13%).
