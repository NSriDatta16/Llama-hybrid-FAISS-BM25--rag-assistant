Suresh, I wish to pay attention to one issue. interrupt() methods itself does not interrupt thread. It just sends a request to a thread for interruption, by setting the flag to true. Usually your thread should process cancellation/interruption policy. It is greatly described in Java Concurrecy in Practice, section 7.1 Task Cancellation. Blocking library methods such Thread.sleep and Object.wait try to detect when a thread has been interrupted and return early. They respond to interruption by clearing the interrupted status and throwing InterruptedException.
