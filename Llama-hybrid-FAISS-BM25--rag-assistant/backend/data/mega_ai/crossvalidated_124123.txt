There is a nice definition on Wikipedia , or here : Confidence intervals are constructed at a confidence level, such as 95%, selected by the user. What does this mean? It means that if the same population is sampled on numerous occasions and interval estimates are made on each occasion, the resulting intervals would bracket the true population parameter in approximately 95% of the cases But there is a discussion by Bayesians, e.g. Kruschke (2010, pp. 224-227) , who state that classical CI's are commonly misinterpreted: The 95% confidence interval consists of all values of $\theta$ that would not be rejected by a (two-tailed) significance test that allows 5% false alarms. (...) The confidence interval tells us something about the probability of extreme unobserved data values that we might have gotten if we repeated the experiment according to the covert intentions of the experimenter. But the confidence interval tells us little about the believability of any particular $\theta$ value, which is what we want to know.
