Need to determine the correct statistical test for my study

Good afternoon. I am working on a study to determine if there is a difference in caregiver empowerment for those who have worked with a Family Support Partner and those that have not. I am using the Family Empowerment Scale as my measure. To score the measure, I add up the answers that fall into three subsets: Family, Service System and Community/Political. I have been advised this will make my study have three dependent variables as a result. I have 5 independent variables (ethnicity, age, gender, time as a caregiver, time you have worked with a Family Support Partner). The Family Empowerment Scale uses a likert system. I thought about using Ordinal Logistic Regression, but I don't think I can use this test with three dependent variables. Any suggestions? Thank you
