I would start by looking through the excellent free online book Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman . It leverages the equally excellent forecast package for R, which allows you to automatically build ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing models and forecasts very easily. With only 36 data points, there is really not much to work with, except for very blatant influences (for which you could look to the xreg parameter for forecast::auto.arima() ), so if you want to get more fancy, you would probably have to invest quite some domain knowledge.
