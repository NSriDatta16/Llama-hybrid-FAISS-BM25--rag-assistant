Including a C header which declares a variable called "new"?

I'm trying to use the OpenCA (libPKI) library in a C++ application. However, when including the file pki_x509_data_st.h the following code fragment is encountered: typedef struct pki_x509_callbacks_st { /* ---------------- Memory Management -------------------- */ void * (*new) (void ); void (*free) (void *x ); void * (*dup) (void *x ); This won't compile because of the "new" pointer declaration. How can I make it work? Update After renaming the "new" variable I've encountered some new problems ("using typedef name after struct" etc.. ). I want to avoid changing too much of the old C code (modifying library headers somehow makes me feel nervous) so I decided just create a minimal isolation layer instead.
