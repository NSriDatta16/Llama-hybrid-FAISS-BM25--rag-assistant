fork() spawns a process which have independent memory regions. Changed must be mediate through IPC. boost::thread create a thread which can share memory. They are not comparable. To create thread-local storage, use boost::thread_specific_ptr . See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/doc/html/thread/thread_local_storage.html . (You may also decorate a global variable as __thread int xyz; to make it thread-local, if the compiler and architecture can support it.)
