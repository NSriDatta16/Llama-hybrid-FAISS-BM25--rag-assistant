Are negative Detection Limit for concentrations consistent

We are monitoring Air Quality: essentially concentrations. We collect time series and we periodically calibrate analysers in order to control the process. Knowing the specifications or assessing it experimentally we have, for each analyser, some low threshold on the dynamic range (measurement extent) where data become meaningless because of the method variability, imperfections & limitations. Concentrations are physical real positive quantities. Therefore real concentration cannot be negative: whatever distribution it has, it should be positive. Analyser are real, and when measuring very low concentration, it can sometimes produce negative or null concentration due to variability of the process (we assume there is no bias in the method). In analytical chemistry question of Detection Limit often arises. It is a common practice to truncate part of the data series bellow some 'arbitrary' threshold (modelled or experimentally assessed). Of course this truncature bias data, which leads to higher expectation. But using meaningless data bias too. We know that dealing with DL are not the perfect solution, it is a filtering technique with advantages and drawbacks. My question is the following: When (1) null is an hard boundary that cannot be crossed (real concentration distribution is positive); (2) process variability close to the lower boundary of dynamic range of the instrument cannot be assumed: symmetric or concentration independent, is it reasonable to set a negative or null Detection Limit to truncate our data? If so, what hypothesis must hold?
