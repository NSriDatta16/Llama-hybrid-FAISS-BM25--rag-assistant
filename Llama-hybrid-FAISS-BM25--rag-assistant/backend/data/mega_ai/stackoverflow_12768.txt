How is the HTML on this site so clean?

I work with C# at work but dislike how with webforms it spews out a lot of JavaScript not including the many lines for viewstate that it creates. That's why I like coding with PHP as I have full control. But I was just wondering how this sites HTML is so clean and elegant? Does using MVC have something to do with it? I see that JQuery is used but surely you still use asp:required validators? If you do, where is all the hideous code that it normally produces? And if they arent using required field validators, why not? Surely it's quicker to develop in than using JQuery? One of the main reasons I code my personal sites in PHP was due to the more elegant HTML that it produces but if I can produce code like this site then I will go full time .net!
