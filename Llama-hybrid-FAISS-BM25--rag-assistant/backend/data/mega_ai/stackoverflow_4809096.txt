Usually it is good to use dragonfly, the Web developer tool to identify issues with your javascript, css, etc. Tested your file simple.zip, the scroll is stopping consistently on the 13th click. In Webkit it stopped on the 14th click, same thing for Firefox, the last white square doesn't come. it stay on the black. ok. I noticed you had for(var i=1; i and if you replace it by for(var i=1; i the script seems to be working. What about you? PS: it is better to not use numbers for id in general. Specifically if you serve your data as xml with application/xhtml+xml.
