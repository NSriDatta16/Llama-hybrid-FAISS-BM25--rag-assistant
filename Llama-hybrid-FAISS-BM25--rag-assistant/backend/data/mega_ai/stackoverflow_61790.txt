I think something like this is intergral for PHP to move forward. Being mainly a .Net programmer, I find PHP painful to work in with it's 1 million and 1 global functions. It's nice that PHP 5.3 has namespaces, but it doesn't help things much when their own libraries aren't even object oriented, let alone employ namespaces. I don't mind PHP as a language so much, but their API is terribly disorganized, and it probably needs a complete overhaul. Kind of like what VB went through when it became VB.Net.
