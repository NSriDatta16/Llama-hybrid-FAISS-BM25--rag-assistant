The post uses toy examples only, but in reality quantiles are not that easy. When talking about uncertainty estimation (a possible use-case of mixture densities), quantile regression display the worst result in the small data regime (see Fig 11 here ). Eventually they converge with other methods asymptotically to GP level performance in the big data regime. Asking about reasons, though, is harder. Usage varies due to several, non-scientific, factors, including the availability of code, 'hype' and prominent publications. And I suspect the reasons why are much more random and less pragmatic than one would like.
