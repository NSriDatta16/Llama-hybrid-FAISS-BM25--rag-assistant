Please suggest some simple functions that I can use to test my neural network implementation

I am a beginner and I have developed code in Octave to train a neural network (as part of Andrew Ng's coursera course). Now I would like to generate some datasets in Excel for simple mathematical functions and try and train my neural network implementation. I tried y = x^2 and y = sin(x), but my training accuracy is only around 67%. I have varied the number of hidden layer units, varied the lambda, but still don't get good results. Where could I be wrong?
