Time Series estimation on specific lags on MA part

I need to estimate specific lag ARMA model. Here is an example. ts1 The above model is $X_t = Z_t + 0.7 Z_{t-2} +0.1 Z_{t-5}$, where $\{ Z_t\}$ is white noise. Is it possible to estimate this model in R? I tried arima function and I haven't found the option to specify the specific lag. If it is not possible in R, is there any specific reason?
