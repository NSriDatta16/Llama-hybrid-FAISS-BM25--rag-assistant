A statistical model is given by a family of probability distributions. When the model is parametric, this family is indexed by an unknown parameter $\theta$: $$\mathcal{F}=\left\{ f(\cdot|\theta);\ \theta\in\Theta \right\}$$ If one wants to test an hypothesis on $\theta$ like $H_0:\,\theta\in\Theta_0$, one can consider two models are in opposition: $\mathcal{F}$ versus $$\mathcal{F}_0=\left\{ f(\cdot|\theta);\ \theta\in\Theta_0 \right\}$$ From my Bayesian perspective , I am drawing inference on the index of the model behind the data, $\mathcal{M}$. Hence I put a prior on this index, $\rho_0$ and $\rho_a$, as well as on the parameters of both models, $\pi_0(\theta)$ over $\Theta_0$ and $\pi_a(\theta)$ over $\Theta$. And I then deduce the posterior distribution of this index: $$\pi(m=0|x)=\dfrac{\rho_0\int_{\Theta_0} f(x|\theta)\pi_0(\theta)\text{d}\theta}{\rho_0\int_{\Theta_0} f(x|\theta)\pi_0(\theta)\text{d}\theta +(1-\rho_0)\int_{\Theta} f(x|\theta)\pi_a(\theta)\text{d}\theta}$$ The document you linked to goes into much more details into this perspective and should be your entry of choice into statistical testing of hypotheses, unless you can afford to go through a whole Bayesian book. Or even a machine learning book like Kevin Murphy 's. For instance, in the setting where $X\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta,1)$ is observed, if the hypothesis to be tested is $H_0:\theta=0$, the posterior probability that $\theta=0$ is the posterior probability that the model producing the data is $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. According to the above formula, if the prior distribution on $\theta$ is $\theta\sim\mathcal{N}(0,10)$, and if we put equal weights on both hypotheses, i.e., $\rho_0=1/2$, this posterior probability is \begin{align*}\pi(m=0|x)&=\dfrac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\{-x^2/2\}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\{-x^2/2\} +\int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\{-(x-\theta)^2/2\}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\times10}}\exp\{-\theta^2/20\}\text{d}\theta}\\ &=\dfrac{\exp\{-x^2/2\}}{\exp\{-x^2/2\} +\frac{1}{\sqrt{11}}\exp\{-x^2/22\}} \end{align*}
