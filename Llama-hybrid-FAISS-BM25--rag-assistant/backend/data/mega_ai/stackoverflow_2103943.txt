For 64 bit applications and iPhone applications (though not in the simulator), property synthesis is also capable of synthesizing the storage for an instance variable. I.e. this works: @interface MyClass : MySuperClass { //nothing here } @property (nonatomic, retain) MyObject *anObject; @end @implementation MyClass @synthesize anObject; @end If you compile for 32 bit Mac OS X or the iPhone Simulator, the compiler will give an error.
