Foundamental limit theorem of Markov chains with higher order chains?

I have a second order Markov chain with 4 states {A,T,C,G} (the 4 DNA nucleotides). the transition matrix looks like this: A T C G AA[0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.1] AT[0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1] AC[0.5, 0.3, 0, 0.2] AG[..., ..., ..., ...] TA[..., ..., ..., ...] TT[..., ..., ..., ...] TC[..., ..., ..., ...] TG[..., ..., ..., ...] CA[..., ..., ..., ...] CT[..., ..., ..., ...] CG[..., ..., ..., ...] GA[..., ..., ..., ...] GT[..., ..., ..., ...] GC[..., ..., ..., ...] GG[..., ..., ..., ...] I wanted to calculate the stationary probability vector for the 4 states to which this matrix converges. The Markov chain is regular. In case of first order Markov chains this is easily done by calculating the limit of $P^n$ with $n\rightarrow \infty$. I do not know how to approach the problem in case of second order Markov chains. Also, having a limited dataset from which to determine the transition matrix, can I consider the stationary distribution of the 4 nucleotides as being the theoretical distribution I would have if I had a much larger pool from which to draw (with the same transition matrix)? In other words, can I consider the stationary distribution like an estimation of the theoretical nucleotide frequency given the transition matrix obtained from limited data?
