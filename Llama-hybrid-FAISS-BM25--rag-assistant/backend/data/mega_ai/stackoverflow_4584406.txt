C++ Out of Scope Problem

I've created one function which generates a code table and another function which performs a table look up based on some parameters which are passed through it. Eg. generateCodeTable(int x, int y); tablelookup(int z); I've just realized that the variables created by the generateCodeTable function are out of scope and can't be accessed by tablelookup(). I could avoid this by initializing the variables before I call the generateCodeTable function but I was wondering if there was a more elegant way to implement it. Thanks
