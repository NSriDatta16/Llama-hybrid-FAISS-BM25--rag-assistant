What areas of mathematical statistics are highly employable?

I'm about to finish my honours in statistics, and I really want to do a PhD because I find mathematical statistics extremely interesting. Areas of research I most want to do a PhD in are stochastic processes and time series. However I also want to pursue a career in the private sector after my PhD. I was wondering what areas of mathematical statistics are most used in the private sector, and in what types of jobs? Obviously I'm not going to do a PhD just because it's employable, but I feel it's definitely something I need to consider and so would like some advice.
