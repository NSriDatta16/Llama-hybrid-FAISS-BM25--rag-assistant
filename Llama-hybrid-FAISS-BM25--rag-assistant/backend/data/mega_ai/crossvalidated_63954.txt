First, I am not sure how large is the time period. If you have less than 15 years, it is better avoid using cointegration. Second, since you are saying that you have 4000 samples each year, I am assuming that you have panel data. Again, if you have time less than 15 years you can avoid using panel cointegration. You can try using fixed effects, random effects, and pooled OLS model. There is Hausman test and other tests that will help you decide why you want to choose one over other. Please have a look at the Introductory Econometrics book by Wooldridge for introduction on panel data. If your time is larger than 15 years, you can think of structural break in data and there are large number of tests to decide on those for both time series and panel data.
