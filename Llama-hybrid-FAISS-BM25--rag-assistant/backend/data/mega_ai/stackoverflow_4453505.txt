HTML mail with dyanmic values

Here is what I need to do. I need to be able to dynamically generate custom emails. I have been using PHP's mail() function, but I have been encouraged to try phpmailer or Zendmail. But it doesn't seem to be able to handle custom emails. What I need to do is be able to grab values from the form and insert them into the body of the message. I've been doing: $message = ' First name: ' $first . ' '; $message .= ...(rest of message) Then I do: mail($recipient, $subject, $message, $headers); using the right headers for HTML. Is there a way to do what I want with phpmailer or Zendmail? Is there a way to do this in OOP instead that might improve on what are getting to be very lengthy pages? I'd appreciate some guidance.
