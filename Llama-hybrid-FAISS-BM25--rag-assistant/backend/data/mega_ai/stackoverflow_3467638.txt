Calculate rolling month value in SQL Server

I have a table in SQL Server 2005 database that has following columns: Id,ProductName,Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec What I need to do is to calculate an average ROLLING value for a product. For instance, if product named "Car" has 2 rows in a table(Year 2009 and 2010) I want to calculate average values from August 2009 to August 2010 or March 2009 to March 2010. What is the best way to accomplish this?
