Yes, in both cases, PCA and NNMF will produce components that are linear combinations of other variables. So in the same way as in PCA, you can just project your data based on components from NNMF. Mathematically it is therefore completely acceptable. That being said, with NNMF you don't have the situation when first few components capture most of the variance of your data. So to project your data based on first 3 components form NNMF doesn't make sense, or it make as much sense as projecting them to any 3 components. To further illustrate my point, here is a picture from Lee and Seung 1999; Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization. If you are trying to classify faces, and use first 7 NNMF components, you may end up classifying them based on a presence of mustache and a nose, neck and ear shadows. But as you commented, you can use all components and get a cleaner version of the data, just because you have fewer components than you had features, or even do some additional feature selection.
