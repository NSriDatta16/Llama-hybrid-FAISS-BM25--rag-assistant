Your problem is quite similar to estimating an upper bound of a uniform distribution, only your distribution is discrete. It is true that MLE estimate is equal to the maximal observed value, but, as explained here , the minimal variance unbiased estimator is greater than the maximal value. They also give an example of Bayesian analysis with a flat improper prior. Again, the expected value of the posterior turns out to be greater than the maximal observation. After you obtain the posterior, you can compute the likelihood and AIC for any given number of dice facets using a simple conditional probability (density) formula.
