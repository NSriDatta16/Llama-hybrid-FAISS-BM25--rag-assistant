Most awk one liners can be achieved with Perl one liners - if you choose to get into a Perl one liner mindset. Or, just use Perl three liners :) If you're maintaining shell scripts written by someone who liked awk, then clearly, you're going to need to learn awk. Even if there's no practical need, if you already know regex it won't take long to pick up the basics, and it's fun to see how things were designed back then. It's rather elegant.
