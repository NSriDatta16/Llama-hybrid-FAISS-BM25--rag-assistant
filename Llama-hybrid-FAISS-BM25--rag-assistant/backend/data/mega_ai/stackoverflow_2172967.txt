If you follow the rules of the HTTP specification , such a kind of attack will make no harm. The section 9.1.1 Safe Methods says: [â€¦] GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested. Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for them. So all requests that change data on the server side should only be allowed via POST. And even there you should only allow those requests that your system has authenticated by generating tokens that are only valid for a specific form/action.
