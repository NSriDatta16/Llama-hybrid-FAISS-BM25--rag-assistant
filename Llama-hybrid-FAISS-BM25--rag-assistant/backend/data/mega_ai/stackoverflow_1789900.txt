Apologies it was a misunderstanding on my part - its not creating a new connection every request, but maxing out the single connection. I will code in a time-out wait or up the max connections to a suitable high number. Below helped: HTTP/1.1 by default, uses persistent connections in which a single connection is used by the client to make multiple requests. The server maintains the connection in the keep-alive state enabling the user agent to make subsequent requests on the same connection rather than create a new connection for every request (HTTP/1.0). The server closes a connection if one of the the following conditions are met. * The time elapsed between now and the last request has exceeded the value specified for the timeout-in-seconds parameter. * The number of requests using a connection has exceeded the value specified by the max-connections parameter.
