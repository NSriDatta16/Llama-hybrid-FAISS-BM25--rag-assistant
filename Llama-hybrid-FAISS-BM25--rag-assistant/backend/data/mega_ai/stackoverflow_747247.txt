I was introduced to SSIS a couple of weeks ago. Executive summary: I am unlikey to consider it for future projects. I'm pretty sure flow charts (i.e. non-structured) were discredited as an effective programming paradigm a long time, except in a tiny minority of cases. There's no point replacing a clean textual (source code) interface with a colourful connect-the-dots one if the user still needs to think like a programmer to know where to drag the arrows. A program design that you can't access (e.g. fulltext search, navigate using alternative methods, effectively version control, ...) except by one prescribed method is a massive productivity killer. And a wonderful source of RSI. It's possible there is a particular niche where it's just right, but I imagine most ETL tasks would outgrow it pretty quickly.
