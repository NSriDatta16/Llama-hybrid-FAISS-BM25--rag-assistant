The "no free lunch" theorems (Wolpert) suggest there are no a-priori distinctions between classifiers; essentially whether one classifier performs better than another depends on the nature of the dataset. Note also for kNN a lot depends on what distance metric you use and how you choose a good value for k. It is not unlikely that a well-tuned kNN classifier will out-perform a badly tuned SVM. At the end of the day, there is only one way to know for sure if an SVM will out-perform a kNN on a particular dataset, which is to try it.
