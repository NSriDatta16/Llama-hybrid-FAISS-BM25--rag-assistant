What are these kinda classes classified under OOdesign? Can I do it in a more elegant way? You do have better alternatives, IMHO. I use a class that has just named constants , this class is used directly other classes to get values of constants in it.I dont instantiate the class. For e.g. in this case you don't necessarily need a class. You can have a settings module that defines the various "constants". I put constants in quotes because there are no constants in Python the way there are in say, Java. (2) I use a class with full of static methods, this class is basically used by other classes as a holder of methods that are used by them. So again i dont instantiate the class. Again, no need for a class. You can have one or more modules that contain these methods or rather, functions. They can be logically grouped as you see fit. I'd like to add a note that you don't have to stick to (Java style?) "classes only" approach (for lack of a better phrase). Rather try to write code that doesn't go against the grain of the language. In Python's case I'd argue that such classes as you described above are best avoided. They seem to me like a carry over from Java.
