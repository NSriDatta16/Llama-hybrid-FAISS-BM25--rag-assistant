Look at Info tab in Target settings. There are two keys: Bunle name -- is name of directory (followed by .app) where all program stuff are kept. Bundle display name -- is wat you exactly need, it is the name that will be displayed in SpringBoard It's common to set both bundle name and bundle display name to ${PRODUCT_NAME}, than set field "Product name" in project Build settings to whatever you want PS In organizer you see bundle name in small fond and bundle display name in large font. PPS AFAIK you need to upload another version to appstore in order to change display name.
