@Domenic this does not work. width auto does nothing more then the default behavior of that element because the initial value of width is auto ( see page 164, Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 Specification). Assigning a display of type block does not work either, this simply tell the browser to use a block box when displaying the element and does not assign a default behavior of taking as much space as possible like a div does ( see page 121, Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 Specification). That behavior is handled by the visual user agent not CSS or HTML definition.
