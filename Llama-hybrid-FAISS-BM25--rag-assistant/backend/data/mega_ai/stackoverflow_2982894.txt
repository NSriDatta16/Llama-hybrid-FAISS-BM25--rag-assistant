How can I access data that's stored in my App Delegate from my various view controllers?

This question is similar to this other post , but I'm new to iPhone development and I'm getting used to the good practices for organizing my data throughout my app. I understand the ApplicationDelegate object to be the best place to manage data that is global to my app, correct? If so, how can I access data that's stored in my App Delegate from various view controllers? For example, my array is created in the app delegate as such... appdelegate.m sectionTitles = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects: @"Title1", @"Title2", @"Title3", nil]; rootViewController.appDelegate = self; and I need to access it throughout the different views of my app, like my root table view controller... rootviewcontroller.m NSUInteger numTableSections = [self.appDelegate.sectionTitles count]; Is this the best way to do it or are there any reasons I should organize my data a better way? I ask because I can never really get too comfortable with using global variables (I blame my college professors), though I'm not sure if this can be considered a global variable. Thanks so much in advance for your help!
