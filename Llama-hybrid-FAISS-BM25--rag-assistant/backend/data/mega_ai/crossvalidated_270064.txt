The difference is in the multiplicity measure you are controlling. Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controls FDR, while the second one you are using - permutation max-T procedure - controls FWER. So, on one hand, the second procedure takes into account the structure of correlations between test statistics, which makes it more powerful (able to detect true deviations from the null); on the other, it enforces stricter control for multiplicity, which makes it less powerful. It seems that in your case the second force is stronger. By the way, are you using Pearson correlations? Since $y$ is a 4-valued discrete variable, I would suggest replacing correlations with, for example, one-way ANOVA Fisher's test statistics: $$ F = \frac{\frac1{4-1} \sum\limits_{k=1}^4 n_k \left(\bar{x}_k - \bar{x}\right)^2}{\frac1{N-4}\sum\limits_{k=1}^4\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n_k} \left(x_{ki} - \bar{x}_k\right)^2 },$$ where $\bar{x}_k$'s are averages $x$ values for the $k$'th level of $y$, $\bar{x}$ is the global average, and $n_k$ is the number of cases with $y=k$. This statistic measures the difference between average values of $x$ for different levels of $y$ without imposing a (possibly nonexistent) order relation between different class labels.
