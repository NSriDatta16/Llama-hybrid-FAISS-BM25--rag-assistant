Storage for global variables is allocated in your computer's virtual memory by the OS linker/loader at the time your program is loaded. The actual global variable storage is somewhere in the physical memory hierarchy (cache, RAM memory, SSD/HD backing storage, etc.), as mapped by the cache and VM system. It could all end up quite fragmented. The values of initialized globals are copied from the .data segment into a portion of the allocated virtual memory. Non-initialized globals might be zeroed, or might have junk left in them, depending on the security of the particular OS under which the program is running. The are other variations, depending on the language, compiler, language run-time, and OS.
