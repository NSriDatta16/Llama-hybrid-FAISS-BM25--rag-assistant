Visually representing confidence and standard deviation in a time series

We've been tasked with presenting a time-series graph showing 2 series of estimations each with a standard deviation and confidence. There are only 4-5 points in each series and both occur over the same time range (and might be very close in value/STD/confidence). Can anyone recommend best practices for graphically representing this kind of data?
