Which model you choose in the end depends on your data. We cannot really answer this for you. Only practice and trials and errors will actually help you doing this. For binary classification, you can choose among a very diverse range of models, from Logistic Regression to SVMs to Random Forests to Neural Networks. As a rule of thumb, you can use Occam's Razor => for two models giving the same performance, always choose the simplest one. So my advice is: try out a few model, compare their performance on a testing set and select whichever works best for you...
