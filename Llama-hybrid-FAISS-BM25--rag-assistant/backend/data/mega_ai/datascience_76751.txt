Multiple models in the same notebook

Having working on data sets, sometimes we want to keep track of mtiple models with different architectures which work on the same data set on which we have made some transformations and preprecessing of data has been done. So I would like to know what is the elegant way to work on multiple models which use the same data set? Because having multiple models on the same notebook is cumborsome and recreating the same data preprocessing nd transformations on separate notebooks is also a lot of copy-paste which I think can be solved with some existing solutions which I am not aware of. What is the industry standard when doing such tasks? Any help is appreciated.
