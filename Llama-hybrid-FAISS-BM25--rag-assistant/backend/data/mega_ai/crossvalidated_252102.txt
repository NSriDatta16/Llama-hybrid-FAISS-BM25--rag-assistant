Null distribution of sign bias test for GARCH

I just read the paper of Engle & Ng (1993) in which they introduced the sign bias test (positive sign bias t., negative sign bias t., joint test). I have a problem understanding what the test statistic is. Is it $\chi^2$ with 3 DF for the joint and 1 DF for the other tests? Reference: Engle, Robert F., and Victor K. Ng. "Measuring and testing the impact of news on volatility." The Journal of Finance 48.5 (1993): 1749-1778.
