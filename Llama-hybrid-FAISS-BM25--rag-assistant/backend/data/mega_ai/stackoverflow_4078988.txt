How to determine demographics of users visiting your site?

Ad-Servers seem (and do) know a lot about the use who is visiting a certain webpage leveraging Behavioral and Contextual Targeting. I would love to be able to keep track of that data as well. In particular I would like to know: age range male/female geographical info I would like this information on a per request basis (not a daily summary) What is the best way to accomplish this? Thanks!
