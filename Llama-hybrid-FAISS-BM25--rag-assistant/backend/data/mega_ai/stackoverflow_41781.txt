Microsoft T-SQL to Oracle SQL translation

I've worked with T-SQL for years but I've just moved to an organisation that is going to require writing some Oracle stuff, probably just simple CRUD operations at least until I find my feet. I'm not going to be migrating databases from one to the other simply interacting with existing Oracle databases from an Application Development perspective. Is there are tool or utility available to easily translate T-SQL into Oracle SQL, a keyword mapper is the sort of thing I'm looking for. P.S. I'm too lazy to RTFM, besides it's not going to be a big part of my role so I just want something to get me up to speed a little faster.
