Medical Machine Learning Data Set

I'm researching Medical Data set which includes variable concerning illnesses and treatment type. For example illnesses is colon cancer, it's decision variables (x,y,z,t) and treatment type is chemothreapy, radiothreaphy etc etc. I want to reach such a data set for my KDD and exploratory lesson. Because I want to make useful project prototype. if you know any data set web site pls share me (so-called site may not include medical)..
