If you do not want to show a placeholder, make sure that you do not set the sortable's placeholder option. I see no problem with the default sortable behaviour in IE8. I've tried to recreate what you described in this hosted example: http://jsbin.com/osobu (The sortable images are in the third tab.) It would be helpful if you provided more code or just edit the sample I provided (via http://jsbin.com/osobu/edit ) in order to duplicate the problem. Edit In response to your comment, you can just set the items option to "li" and the problem is fixed. Also, I have to you use #images li { float: left; } instead of #images li { display: inline: } or else the image will be offset while you are dragging it. Here is the fixed demo: http://jsbin.com/osezu
