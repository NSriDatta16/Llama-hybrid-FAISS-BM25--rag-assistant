Think about the users and use cases of your project. Do users expect to have access to it when they're disconnected from the Internet (for example, on an airplane or in a coffee shop with no Internet access)? Use Swing. Do you want users to be able to access the same tool from different computers (for example, both at work and at home)? Use a web UI. Also consider whether the user needs to save and load data, and whether the tool produces data files that some might consider sensitive (if so, storage on the web might be an issue).
