You should use ToolStrip or MenuStrip to call your child form. In your case, I assume you just drag and drop a Button into your Form1. That's why the button is floating. But if you are persistent and still don't want to use ToolStrip and MenuStrip, you can hide the button after showing the childform.. Ex: private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { Form2 f2 = new Form2(); f2.MdiParent = form1; f2.Show(); button1.Visible = false; // This will cause your button to be hidden. }
