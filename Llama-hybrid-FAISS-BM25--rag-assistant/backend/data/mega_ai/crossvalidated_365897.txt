Calculating standard deviation given mean and a range mean values that correspond to z-scores

When going over a stats review in my higher level engineering course I came across a problem I think I know how to solve but things are not adding up. The problem is "Assume that the average time of a prototype endovascular stent is 19 months, and that 60% of stents lasts 17 to 24 months, and that their age follows normal distribution. Find the standard deviation of the distribution" What I've done so far 2 months before μ (17-19 = 2 before ) and 5 months after μ (24-19 = 5 after) I took each percentage of before and after (2/7 months total (before) and 5/7 months total (after) to get 28.571% (before) and 71.4286% (after) Knowing that percentage i then multiplied the before and after percents by the total 60% that is made by that range so: before = 28.571% * 60% = 17.143% after = 71.4286% * 60% = 42.857% Knowing that I can find z-scores knowing that .5 -.17143 = .32857 (32.857%) comes before the start of the 60% and 1-(.5+.42857) = .07143 (7.143%) after the end of the 60% I then used standard normal probabilities sheet to calculate the corresponding z-score and got Zlow = -0.445 Zhigh = 1.465 Lastly I plug the z-score in to the formula z = (x- μ)/σ -0.445 = 17-19/(σ) σ = 4.494 months 1.465 = 24-19/(σ) σ = 3.413 This doesnt makes sense to me since the σ should be the same for both the low and high z-score. I've triple checked what I did and can't seem to find out where I went wrong. Thanks in advance!
