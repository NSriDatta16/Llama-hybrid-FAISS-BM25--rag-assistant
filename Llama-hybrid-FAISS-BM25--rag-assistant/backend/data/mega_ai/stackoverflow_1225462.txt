You have to re-select it. So it will end up like this: > That way each time you reload the jsp page, you verify if the current item you're painting is the same it was previously selected by the user. If so, you append "selected" to the option ( the first time it won't match anything ) I'm a bit rusty in JSP, so , probably there is a more "elegant" way to do it, but this "old-style" does works for sure. I hope it helps.
