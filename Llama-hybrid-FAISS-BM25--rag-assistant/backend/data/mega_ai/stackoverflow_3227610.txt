ui.draggable is the jquery object representing the dragged DOM element... all the jQuery methods are available on it :) For example to get an attribute: ui.draggable.attr('data-value') or if it's an input type element: ui.draggable.val() I can't say exactly without knowing what your draggable is...but it's the same way you'd get it if it weren't a draggable.
