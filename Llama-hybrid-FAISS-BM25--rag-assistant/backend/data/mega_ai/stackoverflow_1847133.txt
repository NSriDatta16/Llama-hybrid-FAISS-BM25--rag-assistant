NSThread is mostly a wrapper around pthread semantics. Advantages: - NSThreadWillExitNotification notification when NSThread exits - A NSMutableDictionary thread-local storage Limitations: - you can only create detached NSThread Be aware that Cocoa needs to know that you want to do multi-threading. It is important to first detach a dummy NSThread so the application can be considered multi-threaded .
