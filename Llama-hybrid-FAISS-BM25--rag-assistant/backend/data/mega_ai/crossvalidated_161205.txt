How to detect classifier curve in non-separable SVM problem

Suppose we want to classify two class of data that are non-separable with hyper-plane. So we use kernels to map data to high-dimensional space. See my codes: set.seed(10111) x = matrix(rnorm(40), 20, 2) y = rep(c(-1, 1), c(10, 10)) x[y == 1, ] = x[y == 1, ] + 1 library(kernlab) svp 0,1,2),pch=16) points(x[SVindex(svp),c(1,2)],col="blue",cex=1.5) # Extract w and b from the model w and this is the plot: My question is that, how we can (find and ) plot the non-linear curve that separate two class? Something like the black solid curve in blew picture:
