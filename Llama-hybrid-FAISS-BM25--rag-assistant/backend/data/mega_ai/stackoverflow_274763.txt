To reiterate what Kenny said above, it's really all about the coding standards of your organization. It's hard to objectively classify one style over the other, although everyone seems to have their own opinion. I generally tend to prefer having data and methods groups by access modifier, and so in this case would prefer Option #1. This is to emphasize the interface, not the design. That is, I could transparently change the implementation of the MyInt modifier in the future (maybe I don't really need to store a backing variable).
