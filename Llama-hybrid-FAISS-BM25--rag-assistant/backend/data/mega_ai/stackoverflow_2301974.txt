The WebBrowser control is just another instance of Internet Explorer, and thus inherits the security settings in IE. I have found no other way of changing the security options than to edit them in IE itself. You can most likely change the settings in registry as well, but they will be global for all IE instances. If you change it in your code, then you change it for all browser instances as well. In an automated application I wrote some time ago I disposed of the pop-ups by monitoring for window pop-ups, grabbing the window handle and sending a click to the button in that window. Certainly not an elegant solution :(
