C# Baseline Resources

Time to ask the pros, since I can't find a good answer anywhere else and I'm venturing into a side of the world that I'm just learning. I'm in a primarily open source shop that has recently begun taking in a lot of internal tools and partners that are .Net based. That got me to thinking that I may be able to utilize the best of both worlds by leveraging C#/mono in certain spaces. On a small scale I've been very successful and it's working great. However, pressing 'Build' and scp'ing the exe into place isn't going to scale well. I'd like to step it up a bit and get some more resources behind it, so here's my question; what are the baseline resources I need to establish a good dev/testing/staging environment. I don't need uber-detailed information and I'm willing to consider both commercial and open source solutions, I guess I'm more looking for good advice on resources. 99% of the items developed on either side of the OS line will be services. What sort of Unit/Regression testing tools are recommended, is NUnit the standard? What sort of deployment mechanisms are recommended for service level software? What, if any, additional tools have you found useful or indispensable during your development/design work? The first 2 items are of interest since they are the last things I'm lacking before I have workable, repeatable development and deployment process.
