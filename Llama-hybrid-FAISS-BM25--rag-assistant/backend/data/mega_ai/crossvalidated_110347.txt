When do kernel based method perform better than the regular

I am used with linear models. I can see rising use of kernel based method particularly in machine learning. The following is an example Gaussian kernel using gausspr function from the R package kernlab . The function is an implementation of Gaussian processes for classification and regression. require(kernlab) x The kernel methods available in this package include: rbfdot Radial Basis kernel function "Gaussian" polydot Polynomial kernel function vanilladot Linear kernel function tanhdot Hyperbolic tangent kernel function laplacedot Laplacian kernel function besseldot Bessel kernel function anovadot ANOVA RBF kernel function splinedot Spline kernel My first question how do I know it is better to use kernel versions? The second question is how do we select which kernel to use?
