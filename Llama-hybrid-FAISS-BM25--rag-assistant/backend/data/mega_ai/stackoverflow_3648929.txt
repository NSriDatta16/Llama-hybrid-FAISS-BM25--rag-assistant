It's hard to tell what you want given that you've given us almost no specific detail at all, but here's some ways to accomplish what you want. The simplest method is to add in the images using the img tags. Images are by default inline elements, and since you stated that they are of the same height as the text, I don't really see any problem with just adding them in, like this image here . As long as you give it the correct alt text, it should be fine. If actually want image text replacement, then you can utilize the usual method, something like: #replace { text-indent: -9999px; background: url('https://i.stack.imgur.com/da29E.png') no-repeat center bottom; width: 16px; height: 14px; display: inline-block; } Where #replace is a span inside a paragraph, like: The Flag of the United States of America is a brilliant flag. As you can see, its a little troublesome, and does not offer any advantage over the img method at all. Have a look at the text replacement version here: http://jsfiddle.net/VEn5p/
