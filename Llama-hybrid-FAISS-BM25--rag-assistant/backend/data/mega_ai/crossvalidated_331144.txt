time series with no stochastic trend but deterministic trend

is possible to have a deterministic trend and no stochastic trend? With the dickey fuller test i got a significative p value so it doesnÂ´t have a stochastic trend but i found a deterministic trend. Then how is possible for a time series to be stable with a deterministic trend. Thank you.
