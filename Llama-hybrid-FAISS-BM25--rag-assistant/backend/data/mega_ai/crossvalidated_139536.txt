How should I determine an average from a set of averages

I have a set of lines. I measure their length each 5 times, and then take the mean of their lengths (as I measure them). I also take the standard deviation. I want to know the 'average' line length. Certainly I can take the mean of the mean line lengths for each line, but how can I best weight these mean values to encompass the idea that some measurements are better (ie have smaller stdevs) than others? (Should I do this?) Further, how do I then describe the confidence I have in my final value? The lines are generated from experiment. The measurements of the lines are taken from images. Consequently, each measurement should be identical, but is performed repeatedly because the measurement is not so accurate.
