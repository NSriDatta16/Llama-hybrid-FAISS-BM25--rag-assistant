You could use a memmap import numpy as np from tempfile import mkdtemp import os.path as path filename = path.join(mkdtemp(), 'newfile.dat') # or you could use another dat file that already constains your dataset # supposing your data is loaded in a variable named "data" fp = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=data.shape) fp[:] = data[:] You can check full documentation on this page , the code above is based on the documentation. This way you: only change the declaration of your data matrices, keeping you code as clean as possible uses numpy built-in ndarray subclass without having to explicitly manage data retrieval from the disk
