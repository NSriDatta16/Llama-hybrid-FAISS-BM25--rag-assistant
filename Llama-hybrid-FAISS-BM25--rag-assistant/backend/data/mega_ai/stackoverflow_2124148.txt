Two possible contributing factors: Lisp languages aren't hugely popular in comparison to other languages like C/C++/Ruby and so on - that alone may give the illusion of a fragmented community. There may be equal fragmentation in the other language-communities, but a larger community will have larger fragments.. Lisp languages are easier than most to implement. I've seen many, many "toy" Lisp implementations people have made for fun, many "proper" Lisp implementations to solve specific tasks. There are far more Lisp implementations than there are, say, Python interpreters (I'm aware of about.. 5, most of which are generally interchangeable) There are promising projects like Clojure, which is a new language, with a clear goal (concurrency), without much "historical baggage", easy to install/setup, can piggyback on Java's library "ecosystem", has a good site with documentation/libraries, and has an official mailing list. This pretty much checks off every issue I encountered while trying to learn Common Lisp a while ago, and encourages a more centralised community.
