Yes, this is doable. The (potentially) unseen pitfall is that your model may require a great deal more data than you expect. A general rule of thumb for logistic regression is that you need at least $15$ observations in the less commonly occurring category (i.e., either $0$s or $1$s) for each variable in the model (cf., here ). You may think that you have just $2$ variables (viz., X_1 and X_2 ), and thus, you will be OK as long as you have at least $30$ 'successes' and $30$ 'failures'. However, there is a subtle inconsistency between how we interpret your variables and how a statistical model will use them. You will quite naturally think of X_1 as a single variable, but the model will treat it as $3$. Likewise, the model will treat X_2 as $7$ (!) additional variables, not one. More specifically, you are using the number of levels minus one ($4-1=3$ and $8-1=7$) in your model for every categorical variable you add. The upshot of this is that you want to have at least $150$ 'successes' and $150$ 'failures' ($N>300$) in your dataset to fit a model with just your X_1 and X_2 variables. A related issue is that you want to be sure there are sufficient data in each of those levels. Obviously, if no one chose X_2 = G , you won't be able to estimate anything about the effect of that level of X_2 , but you will also have a problem if some did choose G , but everyone who did has Y = 1 . That would lead to the problem of separation . Moreover, if you want to fit the interaction, you will need sufficient data in every combination of levels ($32$, in your case).
