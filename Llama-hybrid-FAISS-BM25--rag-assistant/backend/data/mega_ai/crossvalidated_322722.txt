Under $d \to \infty$ optimal acceptance rate is 0.234. The reference is Roberts et al 1997. Although after skimming the paper it appears to have been a result originally derived in an earlier paper. In any case this is the often cited paper which has some nice results and useful heuristics. Given that in your case you have $d=2$ it is unclear how relevant these results may be but are worth trying out empirically on your sampler for a first pass. For $d=1$ case it seems (see Roberts and Rosenthal ) that the optimal acceptance rate is around 0.44 so you may want to experiment with some values of $\Sigma$ that get you into the region $(0.233, 0.44)$ or maybe even a bit larger of an interval just to be on the safe side. For simplicity you can probably use a diagonal $\Sigma$ for a first pass.
