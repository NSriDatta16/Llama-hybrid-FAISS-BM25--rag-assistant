Supervised or Unsupervised Learning Classification: Facebook Prophet vs. ARIMA

I'm currently exploring time series forecasting and considering the use of Facebook's Prophet and ARIMA models. I'm a bit confused about whether these approaches fall under supervised or unsupervised learning techniques. Could someone clarify whether Facebook's Prophet and ARIMA are considered supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms in the context of time series forecasting? What are the key characteristics that determine whether a time series forecasting method like Prophet or ARIMA belongs to supervised or unsupervised learning categories? Are there specific features or elements in the implementation of these algorithms that make them align more closely with supervised or unsupervised learning paradigms? Any insights or resources that could shed light on this distinction?
