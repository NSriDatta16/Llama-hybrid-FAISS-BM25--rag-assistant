I am taking opening the camera through intents and trying to save the image into a folder in SDCard. I can take the image and the image is getting saved. But the problem is that is getting stored a thumbnail resolution image (160*120) size image. This is what i am doing... To open Camera mIntent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); mIntent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI .toString()); mIntent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_VIDEO_QUALITY, 1); startActivityForResult(mIntent, PHOTO_SELECT); And on Activity for result ... imageFileFolder = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "MyApp"); FileOutputStream out = null; Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance(); String date = fromInt(c.get(Calendar.MONTH)) + fromInt(c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)) + fromInt(c.get(Calendar.YEAR)) + fromInt(c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)) + fromInt(c.get(Calendar.MINUTE)) + fromInt(c.get(Calendar.SECOND)); imageFileName = new File(imageFileFolder, date.toString() + ".jpg"); try { out = new FileOutputStream(imageFileName); bmp.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, out); out.flush(); out.close(); scanPhoto(imageFileName.toString()); out = null; Can anyone please help in storing the high resolution image that i am taking...
