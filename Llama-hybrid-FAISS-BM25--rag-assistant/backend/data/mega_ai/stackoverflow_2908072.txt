Silverlight 4 HttpWebRequest user agent string is null

The problem I have a page with a silverlight object. It attempts to retrieve XML from another (external cross domain) page. But I am struggling with a security exception. I have this code working brilliantly in WPF. When using a website hosting a silverlight application with the same code, the user agent string of the HttpRequest object is null (and seemingly cannot be set). In fact there is no header information at all - this causes a security exception when attempting to make my asynchronous call. The question Why is the user-agent string (and header information) null in my silverlight 4 application when making an asynchronous call using HttpWebRequest? Thanks in advance!
