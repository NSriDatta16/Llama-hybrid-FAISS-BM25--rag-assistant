Obviously somevalue is an integer rather than explicitly typed as your enum. You should keep in mind that the underlying value of an enum is just the "storage type" and is not implicitly interchangeable. However, you can easily use the cast operator to make your code simple and "more" type safe: private enum MyEnum { Value1, Value2, Value3 } switch ((MyEnum)somevalue) { case MyEnum.Value1: someothervar = "ss"; break; case MyEnum.Value2: someothervar = "yy"; break; case MyEnum.Value3: someothervar = "gg"; break; default: throw new NotSupportedException(); } Eventually you would like a design where you did not have to convert from an integer to an enum, but often times when reading from disk or DB this is not the case.
