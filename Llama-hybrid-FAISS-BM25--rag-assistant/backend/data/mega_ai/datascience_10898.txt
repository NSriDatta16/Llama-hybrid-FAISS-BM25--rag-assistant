Method for finding top-k cosine similarity based closest item on large dataset

I have a dataset with 40 million item, where each item is 400-dimension double vector. What I want to do is to find top-k (small k, about 3~10) most similar items to an arbitrary given input vector . Similarity measure is cosine similarity, since this dataset is based on word2vec representation. However, this data is so huge, so it couldn't fit at main memory (I'm now working in single machine). The goal I want to achieve is to find top-k similar items as fast as possible, with small memory(~5G) that could fit in RAM. Any suggestions for this problem? I've already tried PCA, but I observed that this data projected in low-dimension wasn't working very well..
