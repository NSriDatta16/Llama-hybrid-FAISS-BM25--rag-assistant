You won't be able to calculate a (frequentist) confidence interval from a single observation since you cannot calculate two unknowns (mean $\bar{x}$ and variance $s^{2}$ needed for the normal approximation $\bar{x} \pm z^\ast \left(s / \sqrt{n} \right) $ ) with just one observation. However, in Bayesian inference you're starting with a prior probability which is already a "full" probability distribution. Hence, to paraphrase Richard McElreath, the minimum sample size required for Bayesian inference is $n=0$ . Both with the prior $p(X)$ as well as with the posterior $p(X|x_{1})$ (where $x_{1}$ is your single data point) you will be able to calculate $X_{exp} = \int X p(X)d{X}$ or $X_{exp'} = \int X p(X|x_{1})d{X}$ , respectively, or any credible interval. They will obviously be heavily influenced by your prior, but it is possible to calculate these quantities.
