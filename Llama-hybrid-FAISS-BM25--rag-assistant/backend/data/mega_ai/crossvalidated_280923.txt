ARIMA: how to do prediction when the data is detrended by subtracting the moving average?

Before fitting an ARIMA model, we found the trend of the ts is clearly nonlinear, so we remove the trend by subtracting the moving average (calculated by moving a sliding window over the ts and compute the mean of the numbers in the window) from the original data, after which the ts becomes stationary. But, how should I make a prediction in this case?
