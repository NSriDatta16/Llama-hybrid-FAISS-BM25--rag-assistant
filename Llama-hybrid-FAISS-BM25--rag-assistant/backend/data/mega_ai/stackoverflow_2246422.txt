I just wanted to state the obvious: normalize the data. message_types message_type | message_type_name messages message_id | message_type | message_type_name Then you can just do without any cached DISTINCT: For your dropdown SELECT * FROM message_types For your retrieval SELECT * FROM messages WHERE message_type = ? SELECT m.*, mt.message_type_name FROM messages AS m JOIN message_types AS mt ON ( m.message_type = mt.message_type) I'm not sure why you would want a cached DISTINCT which you'll have to update, when you can slightly tweak the schema and have one with RI.
