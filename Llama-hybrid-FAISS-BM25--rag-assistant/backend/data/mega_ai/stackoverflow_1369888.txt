SQL - Multiple criteria with a LEFT OUTER JOIN

I am trying to do an OUTER JOIN, with multiple join conditions. Here is my query (I will explain issue below): SELECT ad.*, cp.P_A, cp.P_B, cp.P_C INTO #AggData3 FROM #AggData2 ad LEFT OUTER JOIN #CompPriceTemp cp ON ad.PART=cp.Part_No and ad.[Month]=cp.[Month] and ad.[Year]=cp.[Year] GO For each record in #AggData2, which is average price and volume by month for each part, I want to join the prices of the three competitors (A, B & C). Thus, I want to join based on Part, Month, and Year. Because some competitors don't offer all parts, I am using a LEFT OUTER JOIN. So, the resulting table (#AggData3), should have the exact same number of rows as the initial table (#AggData2), just with the three additional columns with competitor prices. However, the new table (#AggData3), has ~35,000 more rows than #AggData2. Any ideas why that is happening, and how to fix my query.
