When you're including a file from within a function it's just as if you wrote the code within that file from within that function. e.g. file foo.php: getFoo(); file bar.php The above will result in the following notice/error being thrown, because $foo is not known within bar(). Fatal error: Call to a member function getFoo() on a non-object in /Users/hobodave/foo.php on line 3 Edit: I'm not sure what your "Core" class fully entails, but you could perhaps use it as a type of storage for your "globals". e.g. session = $session; Then your $session would be accessible in your header using $this->session
