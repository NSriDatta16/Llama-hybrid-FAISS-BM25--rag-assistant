You are right - the conditioning data is not necessary: The Gibbs sampler is an MCMC method designed to sample from an arbitrary joint distribution, in cases where it is simpler to get the conditional distribution of each element (conditional on the other elements) than it is so get the marginal distribution of the elements. The Gibbs sampler is applicable when you are seeking to sample from a joint distribution that is conditional on some data (i.e., a joint posterior or predictive distribution); it is also applicable when there is no (explicit) conditioning variable.
