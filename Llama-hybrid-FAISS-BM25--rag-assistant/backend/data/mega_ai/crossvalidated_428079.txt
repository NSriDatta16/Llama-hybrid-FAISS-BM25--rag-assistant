Questions about the principles of Bayesian analysis + R

Let's say I have a data of flywing lengths which is identically distributed (normal). (data: https://seattlecentral.edu/qelp/sets/057/s057.txt ). I want to estimate the mean (theta). I have to choose the model. Let's say the variance is measured 15.4. To the prior I choose that $$ \theta = 40 $$ . I assume I can choose the variance as well, so I set it to 5.0 Now when computing the posterior I get posterior mean of 4.205 and posterior variance of 0.118. (conjugate normal formula) Am I even slightly on the right path? If so, why does the variance data 15.36364 differ so much from the posterior variance? Is this generally normal in Bayesian analysis or is the variance of something else than the estimator?
