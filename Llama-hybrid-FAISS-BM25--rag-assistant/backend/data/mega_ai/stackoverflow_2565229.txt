Looking around in the platform resource files, I found this in res/values/themes.xml under the main Theme: 10dip @android:drawable/scrollbar_handle_horizontal @android:drawable/scrollbar_handle_vertical So, it looks like if you create your own Theme, as described in the documentation , you can provide your own drawables for the scrollbars. I do wonder what you mean by they are "too skinny to use". They aren't meant to be touched/dragged. They are meant for display, to show you your current position relative to the entire ScrollView.
