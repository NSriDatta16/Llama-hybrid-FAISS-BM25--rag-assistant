If you are using Xcode 4, just click the 'Archive' command in the 'Product' menu. It will build your app using the Release build configuration so it's suitable to run on other computer's besides your own. Once it's done building, it will open up the Organizer window with the Archives item selected and highlight the new archive it just created for your application. Click the 'Share...' button and select 'Application' in the radio group, then click 'Next' which will bring down a save panel where you can pick a location to actually save the app bundle and do whatever you want with it from there.
