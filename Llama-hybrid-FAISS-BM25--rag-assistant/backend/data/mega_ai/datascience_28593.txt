How to propagate error back to previous layer in CNN?

I have a convolutional layer (link) with an input 5x5x2 (width, height, depth): The layer has 3 filters with dimensions 3x3x2 , it produces an output with dimensions 3x3x3 . I have completed the forward pass: In a backward pass I calculated gradients of weights $dL/dw$, but I am not sure how to calculate $dL/dh$ (gradients for the previous layer). First or all, is my calculation of $dL/dw$ valid ? (please refer to external spread sheet linked to the question) And most importantly, how do I propagate deltas to the previous layer ?
