my_func(int P1,int P2) { return P2 + Storage_Offset'(4); } Well, this is a C function whose body is written in Ada. There is no "+" operator taking an Integer and a Storage_Offset; perhaps you're looking for function "+"(Left : Address; Right : Storage_Offset) return Address; and perhaps you meant to call my_func(something, Next_Address) ? In that case, the expression will return the address of whatever is 4 Storage_Element s, ie bytes, after Myarr('A') . Myarr_Type is an array of Character , which with any normal compiler on any common architecture is going to be a standard 8-bit byte. So Myarr_Type objects will be 11 bytes long, not 44, and Myarr('A')'Address + 4 will be the address of Myarr('E') . If you want the address of the last element of Myarr , try Myarr (Myarr'Last)'Address
