Caching is controlled by HTTP headers. You must send the appropriate headers if you want to browsers to cache images etc. ImageBundle just bundles the images together, creating sprites in order to minimize the HTTP requests. GWT just marks which files should be cached ( .cache. ) and which not ( .nocache. ). It's your servers responsibility to set the appropriate HTTP headers (and actually yours to configure your servers correctly!). Google has an explanation of "Perfect Caching" at the end of this article: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging.html Also there is a good (general) article about HTTP caching headers and browser / proxy compatibility here: https://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleHttpCaching Glassfish You need to implement a filter and configure it in web.xml for Glassfish. I won't go into much detail in this answer but have a look at this blog post: http://blogs.oracle.com/cwebster/entry/caching_static_resources_in_glassfish It has a link for a filter class at the end.
