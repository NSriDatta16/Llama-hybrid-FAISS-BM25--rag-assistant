Do native _SEPARATOR in PHP

I'm looking at some code that uses PATH_SEPARATOR . I don't think this constant is explicitly defined anywhere but I could be wrong. Does anyone know if this is a native constant in PHP, and do other similar separators exist without needing to define? I'm trying to see if I can use LINE_SEPARATOR, PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR, and such but nothing worked. How do I define these if I need to?
