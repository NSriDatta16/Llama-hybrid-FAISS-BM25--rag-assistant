In MySQL, InnoDB has an option of storing all tables of a certain database in one file, or having one file per table. Having one file per table is somewhat recommended anyway, and if you do that, it makes difference on the database storage level if you have one database or several. With connection pooling, one database or several is probably not going to matter either. So, in my opinion, the question is if you'd ever consider separating the "other half" of the database to a separate server - with the separate server having perhaps a very different hardware configuration, such as no RAID. If so, consider using separate databases. If not, use a single database.
