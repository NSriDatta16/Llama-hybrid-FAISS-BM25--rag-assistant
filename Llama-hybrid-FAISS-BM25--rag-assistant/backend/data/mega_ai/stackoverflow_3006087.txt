While you can add custom methods using just C, this is rather ugly and C++ provides a more elegant and natural way. In C++, you can use polymorphism and add a base class to your structures. In your example, all datastructures will probably support an add() and maybe a find() method. Therefore, you can write code which is independent of the underlying datastructure - you can change the implementation or even the used datastructure later, if desired. Additionally, e.g. a stack can be defined as a special list, therefore you can extend your list to be a stack (or queue) and thus you reduce redundancy in your code. Also, C++ comes already with most useful datastructures in the standard library, which is well written, template based thus generic, and everywhere the same, thus portable.
