Neural networks for email spam detection

Let's say you have access to an email account with the history of received emails from the last years (~10k emails) classified into 2 groups genuine email spam How would you approach the task of creating a neural network solution that could be used for spam detection - basically classifying any email either as spam or not spam? Let's assume that the email fetching is already in place and we need to focus on classification part only. The main points which I would hope to get answered would be: Which parameters to choose as the input for the NN, and why? What structure of the NN would most likely work best for such task? Also any resource recommendations, or existing implementations (preferably in C#) are more than welcome Thank you EDIT I am set on using neural networks as the main aspect on the project is to test how the NN approach would work for spam detection Also it is a "toy problem" simply to explore subject on neural networks and spam
