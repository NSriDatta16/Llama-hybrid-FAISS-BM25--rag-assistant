iPhone Radio program with VU Meter

I wrote an iPhone app that plays wma stream, using libmms and ffmpeg open source libraries. The app has already been approved by Apple and is available for download, free of charge. Now I'd like to have a VU meter on my app. I'm using the avTouch code sample, downloaded from Apple ( https://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/avTouch/Introduction/Intro.html ). I just can't figure out how to mix cpp and objc. When I put the avTouchViewController and avTouchController in the Document (command+o) at Interface Builder, and simply try to build and run the program, it crashes just after the Default image. What am I missing? What should I do to correct this problem? Or, even better, does anyone have a code sample that I could use to have a VU meter on my app? Thanks for your attention!
