When to stop training your machine learning regression model

Maybe this question is a duplicate but I struggle to find the answer. I train my models: random forest and linear regression at the same time and I wonder when I should stop the training? What is the heuristics for determination of the proper result for mse or mae ? I know there some techniques like validation curve and cross validation but they tell when there is no overfitting and it doesn't imply that the maximum quality of the model has been achieved
