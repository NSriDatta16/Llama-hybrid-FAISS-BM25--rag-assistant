experimental unit subject or organ piece?

I have an experiment where a a specific organ is taken from an animal. It is divided into 4 equal parts then each part is assigned a treatment. Then another organ is taken from a different animal and divided again into 4 equal parts and each part is assigned a treatment. I would like to know if there is an effect of treatment or time. What is the experimental unit the animal or the part of the organ? Would this be a repeated measures analysis or 2 factor ANOVA?
