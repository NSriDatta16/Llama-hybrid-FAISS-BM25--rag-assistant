Thanks for the replies! Before the edit it didn't work and I ended up coming up with another similar solution. Certainly got me thinking in the right direction! I'm still not quite used to LINQ and lambda expressions. In case anyone else is looking for solutions this also worked for me: var matchingItem = from TabItem t in tab_main.Items where t.Name == searchHash select t; if (matchingItem.Count() != 0) tab_main.SelectedItem = matchingItem.ElementAt(0); else ... One final question if anyone is reading this... is there a more elegant way to select the element from matchingItem by referencing the name property versus assuming the correct element is at position 0?
