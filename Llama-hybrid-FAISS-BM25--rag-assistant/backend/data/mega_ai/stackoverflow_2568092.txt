There is no way, that I can find, to retrieve the EditingSupport or TableEditor objects from a TableViewer. We Store the EditingSupport objects separately for our uses but it sounds like this is not an option for you so you could store the EditingSupport object for a given column in the data map of the column itself. Something like: TableColumn column = new TableColumn(table, SWT.RIGHT); EditingSupport editingSupport = new TableEditingSupport(); column.setData("editing_support", editingSupport); This gives you access to the EditingSupport objects through a single reference to the TableViewer and when you wanted to retrieve them you could do something like: final Table table = tableViewer.getTable(); for(TableColumn column : table.getColumns()) { EditingSupport editingSupport = (EditingSupport)column.getData("editing_support"); } Its fairly ugly and hacky and, depending on your circumstances, I would probably suggest rewriting the LabelProviders as you said but if you choose not to do that, this is an option. Obviously if you have access to either the table or the list of columns you can bypass some of the mess in retrieval but the core idea remains unchanged.
