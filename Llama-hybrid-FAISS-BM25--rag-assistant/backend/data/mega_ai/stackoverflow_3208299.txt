"Reverse" statistics: generating data based on mean and standard deviation

Having a dataset and calculating statistics from it is easy. How about the other way around? Let's say I know some variable has an average X, standard deviation Y and assume it has normal (Gaussian) distribution. What would be the best way to generate a "random" dataset (of arbitrary size) which will fit the distribution? EDIT: This kind of develops from this question ; I could make something based on that method, but I am wondering if there's a more efficient way to do it.
