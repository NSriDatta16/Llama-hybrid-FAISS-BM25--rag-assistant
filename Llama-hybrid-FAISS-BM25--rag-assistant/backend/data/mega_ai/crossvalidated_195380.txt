Is this data really detrended?

I have a time-series vector for a macroeconomic indicator, which clearly has trends, when I apply the detrend method of matlab, I see a change in the autocorrelation plot, but I suspect it's still not really decorrelated. This is the original acf plot: and this is the plot after detrend : the autocorrelation definitely decreased for bigger lags, but still most of them are in the reject region, so I'm not sure if I'm doing something correct. AFAIK, the detrend method computes the linear trend with simple least-squares fitting, and subtracts the trend from each data point. so maybe I need a more advanced detrending method. can I use PCA for this purpose, or any other alternatives? In the end, I want to obtain a measure of how the value changed with respect to last time point (month), so I'm actually expecting big autocorrelation values in lags 12, 24 etc. Thanks for any help! Edit The data I'm using is a time-series vector for a macroeconomic indicator, namely the consumer price index. It is monthly data which starts at January 1990.
