Textmate and Emacs are both garbage, I'm baffled as to why these plain over-glorfied notepads get so much attention. Notepad++ is ten times better than either of these. What you need is a full blown IDE and even without knowning which language you code, I can recomend one that supports most of them. Netbeans FTW, you won't find anything better and it is free. Only downside is the fast startup requirement. But those few extra seconds are well worth what this amazing IDE can do. You name it, Netbeans can do it!
