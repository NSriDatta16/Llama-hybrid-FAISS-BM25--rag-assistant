GUI on top of a JVMTI agent

I am planing to develop a profiler by using the JVMTI API provided by Oracle. For a visualization I would like to implement a GUI (Qt framework) on top of the agent code. My first jvmti agent is aready compiling and running and I started to integrate the agent into my Qt project. Now I am facing the problem how to couple agent with GUI. Should the GUI be launched inside the agent? For instance in the Agent_OnLoad function? A long-term would be to start the profiling out of the GUI, though I cannot imagine how to realize that.
