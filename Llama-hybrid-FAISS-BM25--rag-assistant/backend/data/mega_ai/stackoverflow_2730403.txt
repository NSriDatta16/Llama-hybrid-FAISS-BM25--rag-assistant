Problem in Drag And Move Forms in .Net

I Write a Windows Application By C Sharp. I Use a Picture in Background of my Form (MainForm) And I Use Many Picture in Buttons in This Form,And also I Use Some Panel And Label with Transparent Background Color. My Forms,Panels And Buttons has flicker. I solve this problem by a method in this thread . But Still when other Forms Start over this Form,my Forms hangs when I Drag and Move my Forms over this Form.How can I Solve this Problem to Move And Drags my Forms easily And Speed? Edit:: My Forms Load Data From Access 2007 DataBase file.I Use Datasets,DataGridViews And Other Components to Load And show Data in My Forms.
