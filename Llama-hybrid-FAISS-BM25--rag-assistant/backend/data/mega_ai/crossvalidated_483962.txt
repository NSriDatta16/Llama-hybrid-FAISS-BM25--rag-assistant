Average Correlation Coefficient

I have 20 sets of 5 data points, and I am plotting them all on the same figure. I am looking at blood flow signals and estimating a quantity from them. X is the variability (i.e. the variance) in the blood flow signal, and Y is the resulting confidence interval size in the estimate from that signal. There are 5 signals for each individual recorded on different days, and I am trying to determine if variability of the signal affects variability of the estimate. I want to find the overall correlation coefficient and significance of the correlation, based on each sets correlation. I can't take all the data points and find one correlation from those because it implies the opposite correlation to what is actually present (see the picture, the black line is if I take the overall of all the data, the coloured is each data sets correlation). How do I go about finding the overall correlation based on each sets correlation? Is there some form of average correlation, and if so, how do I extract a significance from this average correlation?
