HTMLDocument: does Swing "optimize out" span elements?

I'm messing about with HTMLDocument in a JTextPane in Swing. If I have this situation: ... something something else ... (the extra tags are to prevent Swing from complaining that I can't change the innerHTML of a leaf) or this situation ... ... I can call HTMLDocument.getElement() and find the element with ID 'paragraph1' but not the element with id 'span1'. If I change the tag for 'span1' from "span" to "p" then I'm fine. WTF is going on here? Is there another HTML element I can use instead that will allow me to access a particular portion of the document using the id attribute, that will not cause linebreaks? (span would have been perfect :( argh!) edit: I think the solution is to re-examine what I'm trying to do, which was to leverage the fact that I know how to make GUIs + tables + displays in HTML a lot more than I do in Swing, so I'll ask a different question....
