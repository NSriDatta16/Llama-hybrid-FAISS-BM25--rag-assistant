I've never done it, but it looks like the SOAP API supports creating individual shipment items . That'd be the first thing I'd check. If that doesn't work, I'd examine the source code the the Magento admin and reverse engineer what its doing with to create a single item shipment. Specifically, start tracing at the saveAction of the admin's Shipment Controller app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/Order/ShipmentController.php The order/shipment/invoice section of Magento codebase is one of the most volatile/iterative sections, with the core objects/methods/dependencies changing subtly between versions. Finding one "right" answer for this will prove difficult, if not impossible.
