time2 - time1 will just give you the time required to set the visible property of the UIComponent to true - which might be just a couple of lines of code. The real rendering happens at regular intervals when the UIComponent fires enterFrame event. I don't know of any method to measure the time taken to render one particular component, and I don't think you can do that. One idea that comes to mind is to listen for ENTER_FRAME and calculate the time difference between two consecutive events (or even better: take average over, say, 100 frames) to get an estimate of the time taken for rendering the whole stage. Now repeat the experiment after removing the particular component from stage. The difference between the two timings will give you an idea of the time taken to render your component.
