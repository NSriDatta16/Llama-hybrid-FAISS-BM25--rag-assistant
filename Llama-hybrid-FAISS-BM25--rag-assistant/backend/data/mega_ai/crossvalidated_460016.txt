How many times should I perform feature selection?

Good day, I had a question regarding feature selection. I found a very handy $\texttt{python}$ library $\texttt{mlxtend}$ which has a Stepwise feature selection function $\texttt{sfs}$ . For an assignment I am doing, I want to fit and compare a couple of models for both classification and regression. My question is, do I perform this once on a random model and keep the same features throughout (e.g. for classification just use the features proposed by a logistic regression model) and then fit all the other models on the same features? Or do I perform feature selection for each new model? Just picking one set of covariates feels the most correct and I did not question it before but I am a little stumped now. Are two models "comparable" if they use different covariates?
