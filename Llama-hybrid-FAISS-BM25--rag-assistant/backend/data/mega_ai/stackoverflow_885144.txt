How to get current position of an image in jQuery?

I've been developing a image manipulation script which has a background and user can upload one or more images onto that background. I want users to be able to drag and move around the BG and finally they can generate final image. However, I have no idea how to get the position of draggable image position on BG. I've been searching around the Internet and ebooks but no clue. Please show me some way and I'll be waiting for your precious replies.
