Logistic regression log-likelihood - meaning of Î¼

I'm trying to implement my own logistic regression, but I'm not sure I understand some of the notation. In Machine Learning : A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy, 2012), the negative log-likelihood is written (eq 8.3, pg 246): $ NLL = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[ y_{i}log\mu_{i} + (1 - y_{i})log(1-\mu_{i}) \right] $ I'm confused by what $\mu$ represents in this equation. Is it the mean of something? If so, what?
