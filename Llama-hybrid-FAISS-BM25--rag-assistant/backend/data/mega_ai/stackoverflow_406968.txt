Vulnerability Scanning - Typically an automated procedure to scan one or more systems against known vulnerability signatures. Security Scanning - This is a vulnerability scan plus a manual verification of the findings to help remove false positives/ negatives. Penetration Testing - A tester will attempt to gain access and prove access to the system owner. Risk Assessment - involves a security analysis of interviews with employees compiled with business and industry justifications for risks discovered. Security Auditing - Typically an in-depth auditing of software code and/or Operating Systems. This is often a very thorough line-by-line inspection of code. Ethical Hacking - This is very similar to a penetration test, but it is usually many of them against a number of systems in order to discover as many attack vectors as possible. Posture Assessment and Security Testing - This combines security scanning, ethical hacking and risk assessments to show the overall security posture of the organization. Each of these security testing types can be further sub-categorized by different methodologies.
