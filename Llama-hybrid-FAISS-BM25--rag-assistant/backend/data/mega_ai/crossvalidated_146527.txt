How do I do a classification problem with autoencoders (AEs)

I understand that if I want to fine-tune for classification, I can discard the output layer and link the hidden layer to a classifier, do backpropagation to get an improved weight. So when I want to do testing phase, I only need to feed the hidden layer of testing data to the classifier to get an actual result, right? I really need some confirmation here. Thank you in advance.
