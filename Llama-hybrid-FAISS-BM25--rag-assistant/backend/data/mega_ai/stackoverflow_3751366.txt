Objects that defy gravity but collide with others in Box2D. How?

newbie to iPhone game development and Box2D here. I'm developing a game in which I can move (drag) otherwise stationary objects that can collide with other objects. How do I make these objects stationary in a Box2D world with gravity while maintaining their ability to collide with dynamic bodies? One random thought is to exert a force equal to gravity on these objects all the time. Any better or simpler approaches? Will static bodies help?
