I'd like to know how people deal with this in other editors, FWIW on the Windows platform, the Zeus editor has a configurable right margin and a built in line wrap function. So for example, with the right margin set to 60 characters, marking the text of your example and then using the Macros, Linewrap Paragraph menu, Zeus will reformat the text as follows: As you edit the proseit will get all chopped up, like this. Normally you'd do a "reformat paragraph"to clean it up, but thenyou lose the newlines at the ends of your sentences! The wrapping is hard in that all the lines above have a end of line character inserted.
