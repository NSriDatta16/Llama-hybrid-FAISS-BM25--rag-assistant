Predicting dichotomous outcome of temporal data set with covariates

I have a set of data, with outcome and time-varying variables, for patients during the course of their respective stays in the hospital. There is a dichotomous outcome on the last day. The length of stay may be different for each patient. I am most interested in making a predictive model, in the same spirit as one might do with standard regression. I believe that the patient may develop some "momentum" which would tend lead to one outcome or the other. My previous attempts to model this data have been limited to logistic regression. I am beginning to think about lmer and friends, but I'm not sure if it would be suitable for the directionality in time. Also, I have considered some stochastic approaches, but I haven't made much progress with hitching this into a binary outcome or even considering the covariates. Any suggestions would be most welcomed. Fictional Data: Patient No. | Day of Stay | Outcome | Age | Gender | Blood Value | ... 1 | 1 | - | 70 | M | 123.1 | ... 1 | 2 | - | 70 | M | 134.2 | ... 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... 1 | 10 | 1 | 70 | M | 148.3 | ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 100 | 1 | - | 54 | F | 98.3 | ... 100 | 2 | - | 54 | F | 95.2 | ... 100 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... 100 | 6 | 0 | 54 | F | 54.1 | ...
