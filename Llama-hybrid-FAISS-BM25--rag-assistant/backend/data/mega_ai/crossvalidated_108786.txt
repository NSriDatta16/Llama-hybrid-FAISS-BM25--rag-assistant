If the reward for every potential action is known, then why do you need multi-armed bandits? The optimal policy becomes trivial, just pick the best action. More details in "Reinforcement Learning" by Sutton & Barto, Section 2.1, p.26, paragraph 3. I copy the passage of interest: "If you knew the value of each action, then it would be trivial to solve the n-armed bandit problem: you would always select the action with highest value. We assume that you do not know the action values with certainty, although you may have estimates".
