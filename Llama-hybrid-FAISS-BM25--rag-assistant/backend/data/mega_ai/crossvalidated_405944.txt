Constraints on choice of marginal distribution and likelihood

For some time I have been reading into Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning . Coming back to some earlier chapters the following got me confused and I am interested where, formally I go wrong. Bishop states in chapter 1 that Bayes' Theorem \begin{equation} p(C\mid x) = \frac{p(x \mid C)p(C)}{p(x)} \end{equation} holds for probability densities (as well as probability masses and cont/discrete mixed densities). The core problem is at the meaning of the denominator $p(x)$ . Is it an arbitrary prob. density or does the normalization constraint need to hold? What are the constraints for the choice of the RHS terms? Consider the following example : Assume $x\in \mathbb{R}$ to be a continuous variable and $C$ a class label $C \in \{0,1\}$ . As an example, could we imagine a situation with a marginal density given by a Gaussian \begin{equation} p(x) = N(x\mid \mu,\sigma) \\ \end{equation} and where at the same time the class-conditional probabilities (likelihood) are given by Gaussians \begin{align} p(x\mid C=0) &= N(x\mid \mu-\epsilon,\sigma) \\ &and\\ p(x\mid C=1) &= N(x\mid \mu+\epsilon,\sigma) \\ \end{align} that are shifted by $\delta$ from the mode of the marginal distribution? Assuming equal priors $p(C=0)=p(C=1)=0.5$ I am tempted to simply evaluate the LHS of the first equation, e.g. for an $x$ on the far LHS of $\mu$ I find \begin{equation} p(C=0\mid x) = 0.5\frac{N(x\mid \mu -\epsilon,\sigma)}{N(x\mid \mu,\sigma)}=...\propto \exp(\frac{\delta(-x+(\mu-\epsilon/2)}{\sigma^2}) \end{equation} This expression diverges towards smaller $x$ . We know that the posterior does not have to be normalized with respect to $x$ , and also I presume it can be $>1$ as it is a probability density. But, I think it still has to hold that $\sum_C p(C\mid x) = \sum_C \frac{p(x,C)}{p(x)} = \frac{\sum_C p(x,C)}{p(x)}=\frac{p(x)}{p(x)}=1$ . Which cannot be with the posterior at hand (direct consequence of not choosing a normalizing marginal). TL;DR: "Why" can is start with "apparently arbitrary" expressions for the RHS $p(x)$ and $p(x\mid C)$ and find an expression for the LHS, when it turns out that the densities are not consistent?
