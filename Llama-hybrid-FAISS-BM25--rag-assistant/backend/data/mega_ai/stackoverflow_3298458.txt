Logging is not Tracing . These two should be different libraries with different performance characteristics. In fact I have written one tracing library by myself with the unique property that it can trace automatically the exception when the method with tracing enabled is left with an exception. Besides this it is possible to resolve in an elegant way the problem to trigger exceptions in specific places in your code.
