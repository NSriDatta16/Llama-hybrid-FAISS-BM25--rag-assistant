Reference for xgboost

The xgboost package and the algorithm behind it are often mentioned in data science competitions. The method is called extreme gradient boosting. I would like to learn how it differs from typical gradient boosting, but I can not find a rigorous reference for its theoretical basis on the Web. What is the right reference for xgboost?
