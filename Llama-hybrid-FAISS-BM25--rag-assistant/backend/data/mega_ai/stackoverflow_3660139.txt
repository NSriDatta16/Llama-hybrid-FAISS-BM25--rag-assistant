Not exactly. The h1.hc-reform > p means "any p exactly one level underneath h1.hc-reform ". What you want is h1.hc-reform + p . Of course, that might cause some issues in older versions of Internet Explorer; if you want to make the page compatible with older IEs, you'll be stuck with either adding a class manually to the paragraphs or using some JavaScript (in jQuery, for example, you could do something like $('h1.hc-reform').next('p').addClass('first-paragraph') ).
