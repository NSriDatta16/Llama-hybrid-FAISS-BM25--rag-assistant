Just put a User-agent: * Disallow: /siteB in the robots.txt in the root of your main domain. All bots that have manners will accept this, but depending on the frequency they visit your site you might have to wait a bit before the search engines update their datbases. Additionally you could add a .htaccess with a redirect rule to /siteB/... that redirects requests that have been done using the siteA domain to http://siteB/ ... This will make everyone use the canonical domain even if they browse to the lesser-favored one.
