I haven't done enough projects where I've compared different models to say whether Logistic Regression usually outperforms other ML algorithms so unfortunately I can't answer that part of the question. I wanted to note though that in imbalanced datasets maximum likelihood estimates of logistic regression coefficients can be biased (King and Zheng, 2001). (King and Zheng, 2001) provide methods of estimating the bias and adjusting the coefficients to remove the estimated bias. I'm not overly familiar with the ML algorithms you mentioned in the question however a I believe some of them have a way of weighting the loss function to account for the imbalance in the classes. Sorry that this answer is a bit vague but hopefully you've got something new to explore.
