Unfortunately there is no mathematical proof whether or not the intermediate supervision improve the performance of the network. However stack hourglass article shows that according to ablation study: using more encoder – decoder units with intermediate supervision improve the performance – please have a look at the figure below. In that case – the remaining network doesn't perform identity transformation (although there is a residual connection between the remaining networks). My intuition is the every encoder – decoder serves as a PCA, that keep the most dominant feature maps. A series of encoder – decoder let the network reassess the feature maps until it get its most discriminate feature maps at the end.
