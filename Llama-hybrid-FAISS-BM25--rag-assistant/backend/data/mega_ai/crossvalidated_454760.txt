How to a predict the delivery estimate date from the historical data?

I NEED TO PREDICT THE DELIVERY TIME FOR ANY RANDOM DATE/TIME FROM THESE HISTORICAL DATA I have tried to take the difference between each step. I have to predict the delivery time for a given process and I have not sure what to use. I tried using linear regression but it didn't help. Any help from your side will be appreciated! Should I try a time series to predict the value? or Should I use some other regression model? Which time series model will be a good fit? The formula time I used for linear regression total time = transfer_delivered - tranfer_created created2received = transfer_created - tranfer_received received2convert = transfer_convert - tranfer_received convert2send_out= transfer_sendOut - tranfer_convert send_out_delivery = transfer_delivered - tranfer_send_out total time = created2received +received2convert + convert2send_out + send_out_delivery When I did that, it is giving me the same exact result for each value for both the training and test set which means R-squared is 1 Any help or tips will be appreciated !! PS. THERE IS NO OTHER COLUMN GIVEN
