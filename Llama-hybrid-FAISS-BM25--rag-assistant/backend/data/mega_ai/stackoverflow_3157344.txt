Why select this with the URL? You can detect basic "is mobile" with the User Agent library. Take that value and set the session to whichever the User Agent suggests, then simply link to a controller that switches the user between mobile and full versions when clicked. Run this in global code somewhere as a hook or a Base Controller . if($this->user_agent->is_mobile() && ! $this->session->userdata('site_mode')) { $this->session->set_userdata('site_mode', $this->user_agent->is_mobile() ? 'mobile' : 'full'); } Then you controller can just set the session to whatever based on what they have clicked. /switch/mobile /switch/full
