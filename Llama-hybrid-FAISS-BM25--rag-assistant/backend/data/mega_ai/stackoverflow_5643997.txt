A timestamp in exponential format means that someone was using floating point time counters and wasn't paying attention when they wrote the code to print it. If all you have is that piece of text, you're not going to be able to convert it to an accurate time, since it's only accurate to 1000 seconds (about 20 minutes). If you actually have the original as a double, you can get an accurate time from it. If you have it as a float, god help you. The number is (probably) a time_t, which is a count of seconds since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970). You can convert it to a broken-down time structure (year, month, etc) using gmtime() or localtime(), and then to whatever text format you want using strftime(). If you only have the text rather than an actual number, you'll have to parse it to a number first using strtod().
