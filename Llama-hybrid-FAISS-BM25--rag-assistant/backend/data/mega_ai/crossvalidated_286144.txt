Looking at the data sample you provided, I would suggest you to replace categorical variables with dummy variables. For example, if you have n categorical values, you will have n-1 dummy variables. Coming to the Hour column of your dataset, I would suggest you first plot your income based on hours and if you see that there is a definate relationship, you can also add them to your model. One easiest way to do that, would be to divide working ours into segments and then make binary variables based on these segments. Let's say, you have 3 segments: Morning- 8-11 am, Noon - 11am -2pm and Afternoon - 2pm - 5pm. For 15:00 you would have 1 in the column Afternoon and 0 (zero) for other two columns. After doing your feature engineering, you can then move onto model building. For this particular question, I would advice you to try: 1) Decision Tree (Random Forest) - http://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/ Multiple Regression - http://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-regression-for-machine-learning/ Neural Networks (for advanced level) - You can find it on the same webpage
