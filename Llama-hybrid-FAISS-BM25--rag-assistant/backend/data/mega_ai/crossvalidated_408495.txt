Bayesian A/B test for LogNormal data

I'm currently working on a (manual) calculation for a bayesian A/B test on logNormal data. I'm currently working with simulated data to increase my understanding. It's giving me some problems, so I wanted to ask questions. My process: Find prior parameters from user-data predating the experiment Find posterior distributions for control and variant group Look at the difference in posterior samples The results are: The probability of the B variant outperforming the control A should be: print(np.mean(trace['difference_B_A1']>0)) However, this returns a number around 50% even in an A/A test. It seems to me that I should subtract 50% to get the probability that the variant is actually better, but I'm not sure why. Can someone explain why this probability is 50% in an A/A test and upwards from 50% in a positive A/B test?
