The only solution is to add fake tags inside TextField.htmlText : Instead of textField.htmlText = " Some text [...] here Some text [...] here " Do that: textField.htmlText = " Some text [...] here Some text [...] here " You can do it automatically for each paragraphs: textField.htmlText = content.replace(" ", " "); It will insert margin after all paragraphs. Change to a greater size if you want more space.
