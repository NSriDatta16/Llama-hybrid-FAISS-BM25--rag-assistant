If you are guaranteed that the numbers in the array are bounded above and below, by say a and b, then you could allocate an array of size b - a, and use it to keep track of which numbers have been seen. i.e., you would move through your input array take each number, and mark a true in your target array at that spot. You would increment a counter of distinct numbers only when you encounter a number whose position in your storage array is false.
