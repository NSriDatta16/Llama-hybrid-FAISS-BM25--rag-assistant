If the context of your data affords a means to divide it into similarly-sized data buckets, often by timestamp, then two possible solutions you might consider are: Hadoop (with Spark for streaming data, with Hive, using Java or MapReduce, and optionally Hbase database) or MapR. Hadoop/Spark and MapR offer timestamp partitioning solutions that can quickly be searched and analyzed within seconds to hours instead of hours to days. MapR's website offers an insightful book with large database time series examples, written by Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman for free.
