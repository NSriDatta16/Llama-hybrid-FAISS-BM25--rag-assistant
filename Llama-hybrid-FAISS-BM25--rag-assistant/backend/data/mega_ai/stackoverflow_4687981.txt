Problem When Accessing MAPI properties from C#

We are having a repeated exception occur in our error log whilst accessing MAPI properties. Our VST0 2005 Outlook addin is experiencing problems at a particular site. The addin is running on a 64bit exchange terminal services environment there within Outlook 2003. I am getting the following error: "Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt. at Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.AddressEntry.get_MAPIOBJECT()..." We am seeing this error repeatedly. The funny thing is the addin was running fine on this box until a couple of months ago. The underlying class we are using to access MAPI was provided by Helmut Obertanner here: http://www.outlookcode.com/codedetail.aspx?id=1112 . It has worked just fine up until now. Can any bright spark out there help me out with this one? Thanks
