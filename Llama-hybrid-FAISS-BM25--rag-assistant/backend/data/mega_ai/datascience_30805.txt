Several options: Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) : This method construct a set of local geometric patches on each of which a data point is reconstructed through the weighted sum of its K nearest neighbor and maps these patches into a lower dimensional space. Find the code here and I strongly advice to use both LLE and Modified LLE and use the better one (visually). t-SNE : Maps the similarity of points in high-dimension, into a low dimensional manifold extracted by their distance in t-distribution. Be careful to tune parameters properly . Spectral Embedding : Spectral Clustering in fact (or to be precise, Spectral Clustering is indeed a simple clustering on Spectrally Embedded version of data). It projects the data on eigenvectors of its Laplacian according to the magnitude of corresponding eigenvalues. an many more ...
