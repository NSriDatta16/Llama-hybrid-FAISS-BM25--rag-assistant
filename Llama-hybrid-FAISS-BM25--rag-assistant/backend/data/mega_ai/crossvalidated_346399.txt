Does this bounded, continuous probability distribution have a name?

Does this bounded, continuous probability distribution over $x$ have a name? $P(x|y) \propto \big(\frac{y}{x}\big)^x\big(\frac{1-y}{1-x}\big)^{(1-x)}$ for $x, y \in (0,1)$. This comes about by setting $P(x|y) \propto 2^{-\mathrm{KL}(X\|Y)}$, where $\mathrm{KL}(X\|Y)$ is the KL-Divergence from $Y$ to $X$, and $X$ and $Y$ are Bernoulli distributions with parameters $x$ and $y$, respectively. More generally, is there a name for the approach of defining the Bayesian prior probability of a distribution, e.g., $X$, conditioned on another distribution, e.g., $Y$, to be equal to $2^{-\mathrm{KL}(X\|Y)}$? This seems like a natural choice when you want $X$ to be similar to $Y$, but I've never come across it before.
