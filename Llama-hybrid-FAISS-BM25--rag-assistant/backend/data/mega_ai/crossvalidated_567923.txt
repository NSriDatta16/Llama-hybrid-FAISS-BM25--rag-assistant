Poor out of time performance

I am working on a behavioral model which predicts the probability of default (PD) during the next 12 months for an existing customer with an outstanding loan. My dataset consists of monthly snapshots of customers including their payment behavior based on which we want to predict the future payment behavior. The dataset is highly imbalanced (2% bad rate). I have selected the first 6 months of year 2018 for train/test samples and the last 4 months of 2018 for out of time period. My model performance (XGBoost model and scale_pos_weight used for the imbalanced dataset) on train and test is comparable is good enough; however, the out of time performance drops significantly and the model assigns low PD to almost half of the bad observations in out of time population. Clearly, there is a time factor that is affecting the results, but I have included the months on book as a variable. What do you recommend to improve the out of time performance?
