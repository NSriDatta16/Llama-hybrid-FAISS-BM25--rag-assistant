First just calculate the slope of the trend line for simple linear regression without taking into account limits (for example using this formula). Now you have two cases, either the slope is positive, so the student is making progress, or the slope is negative (or zero), and student is not learning anything. I think these two cases should be handled in different ways, because we have a reason to think that if the slope is positive then the student will become better in the future (since he is studying hard), however we don't have a good reason to think that if the slope is negative then the student will become worse in the future. I think it is more likely that the negative trend is by accident, than that it is due to the fact that the student just keeps getting worse with time. So I think that if the slope is negative, you should just return the average of all his test scores as a prediction for any future date. Alternatively, you can always return the last taken test score, or the average of k last taken test scores. If however the slope is positive, then u can model it as follows: Define reciprocal score as (700 - score). So, if his score on test is 400, then his reciprocal score is 300. Our model is that as the student studies, his reciprocal score is multiplied by some factor less than 1 every day. With this model, his reciprocal score can never become less than 0, and so his score can never become more than 700. Basically we assume that it is as hard to go from 500 to 600, as it is from 600 to 650, and as it is from 650 to 675, and so on. Now we need to estimate the daily reciprocal factor by which this particular student's daily reciprocal score is multiplied. We can easily calculate the daily reciprocal factor(DRF) between any two nearby test dates. For example if there passed 20 days between adjacent tests, and the students reciprocal score in first test was 200, and in second test was 100, then the DRF is 20th root of 100/200, which is equal to 0.9659. After we calculate DRF between each two nearby tests, we now know the DRF for each date. But what DRF do we predict for the future? We could do just a simple linear regression on pairs of date/DRF, however it is possible that DRF is increasing (means the speed at which student's score increases is decreasing), and in this case the student will eventually start losing score and with time his score will go down to minus infinity. So, this is problematic. A better way is to just take a geometric mean of the DRF over entire history and assume that the geometric mean of the DRF will not change in the future. The geometric mean of DRF (GMDRF) is equal to exp( sum of the logs of DRFs of all days in history, divided by the number of days in history ) . Then you make predictions as follows: Given a date in the future, you calculate the number of days between this date and the date of last test. Let this number be denoted by N. Then the predicted score is equal to: Predicted score = 700 - (Reciprocal score of last test)*((GMDRF)^N) A second variant is to use "average reciprocal score of all taken tests (or k last taken tests)" instead of "Reciprocal score of last test" in the above formula. This second variant will usually predict a lower score than the first variant.
