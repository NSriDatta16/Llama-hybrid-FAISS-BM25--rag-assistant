Correlation frequencies with two different groups?

Have a dataset similar to this: LETTER FREQ GROUPS ESPECIE A 3 GROUP 1 X B 3 GROUP 1 X C 4 GROUP 1 X A 4 GROUP 2 T B 5 GROUP 2 T C 6 GROUP 2 T A 6 GROUP 3 T --- I would like to correlate the frequency of the letter A of the X species with the frequency of the letter A of the T species. And in the end I would just have a graph. In that case, would you have to make an average? Is it possible to calculate the correlation with the averages, does this compromise the result? How could you analyze this data?
