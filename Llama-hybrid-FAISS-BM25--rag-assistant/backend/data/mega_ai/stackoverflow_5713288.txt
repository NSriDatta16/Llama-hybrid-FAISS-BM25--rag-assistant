If you have a collection of images in isolated storage I'm guessing that you don't want to turn them into an animated gif on the phone anyway. Just use a Timer to cycle through the images. If you want greater control over the "playback" you could create an actual movie file but whether this is practical will depend on the images and how you get them into IS in the first place.
