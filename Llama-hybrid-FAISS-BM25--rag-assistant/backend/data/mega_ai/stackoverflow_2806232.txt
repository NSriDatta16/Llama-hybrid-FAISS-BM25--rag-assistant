Combining 2 Linq queries into 1

Given the following information, how can I combine these 2 linq queries into 1. Having a bit of trouble with the join statement. 'projectDetails' is just a list of ProjectDetails ProjectDetails (1 to many) PCardAuthorizations ProjectDetails (1 to many) ExpenditureDetails Notice I am grouping by the same information and selecting the same type of information var pCardAccount = from c in PCardAuthorizations where projectDetails.Contains(c.ProjectDetail) && c.RequestStatusId == 2 group c by new { c.ProjectDetail, c.ProgramFund } into g select new { Key = g.Key, Sum = g.Sum(x => x.Amount) }; var expenditures = from d in ExpenditureDetails where projectDetails.Contains(d.ProjectDetails) && d.Expenditures.ExpenditureTypeEnum == 0 group d by new { d.ProjectDetails, d.ProgramFunds } into g select new { Key = g.Key, Sum = g.Sum(y => y.ExpenditureAmounts.FirstOrDefault(a => a.IsCurrent && !a.RequiresAudit).CommittedMonthlyRecords.ProjectedEac) };
