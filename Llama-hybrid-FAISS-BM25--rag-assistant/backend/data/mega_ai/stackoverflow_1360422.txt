Since the OP says (in a comment) that "the data volume is very high, probably hundreds of entries per second. It is higher than the disk write speed," it sounds like the data is being aggregated from a number of servers. My suggestion would be to keep the storage task distributed to the individual servers. What front end web servers are you using? Apache has a module for logging to a db. Or use log rotate and pick up the files on a regular basis. Aggregate, using Hadoop, or probably better, pig, when you want to look at and analyze the data. Don't try to turn it into one giant firehose of data unless you really really need to. pig: http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/ pig training video: http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-training-pig-introduction
