SpecFlow is an implementation of Cucumber for .NET Core and .NET BDD-Framework . The SpecFlow and Cucumber uses the same gherkin language to write your specifications. SpecFlow aims at bridging the communication gap between domain experts and developers by binding business readable behavior specifications to the underlying implementation. It aims to: provide a pragmatic and frictionless approach to specification-by-example for .NET projects. Additionally it: supports the concepts of acceptance test driven development (ATDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD), which are often used synonymously with specification-by-example. SpecFlow can most easily be installed through its NuGet package . Install-Package SpecFlow SpecFlow is open source and provided under a BSD license. Visit the SpecFlow site for more information.
