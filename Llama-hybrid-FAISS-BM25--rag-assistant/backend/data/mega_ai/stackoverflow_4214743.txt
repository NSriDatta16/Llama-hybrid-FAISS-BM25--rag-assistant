This operation is going to be performed very often, so it needs to be as fast as possible. The things that you notice happen "very often" are frequently not the bottlenecks in the program - it's often surprising what the actual bottlenecks are. You should code something simple and measure the actual performance of your program before performing any optimizations. I was thinking of many different approaches, including binary search and simple insert-on-copy, but found it hard to decide. Assuming that this is the bottleneck, the big-O performance of the different methods is not going to be relevant here because of the small size of your array. It is easier to just try a few different approaches, measure the results, see which performs best and choose that method. If you have followed the advice from the first paragraph you already have a profiler setup that you can use for this step too.
