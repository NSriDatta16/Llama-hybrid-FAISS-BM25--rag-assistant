This can be done with supervised learning. First create a dataset of spectrogram patches by systematically varying all the parameters - and keep these two associated, for example use a database of parameters, and an ID for the generated spectrogram. Then train a neural network, by letting the input X be the spectrogram and the target Y be the parameters. A Convolutional and/or Recurrent Neural Network is the most relevant here. This network will learn to output the parameter setting whenever it gets an input spectrogram. As a side-effect the network will also internally create a latent representation. In order to explore variations, you can start with the latent corresponding to an input (spectrogram) and then add noise to this latent vector to get new outputs (parameters).
