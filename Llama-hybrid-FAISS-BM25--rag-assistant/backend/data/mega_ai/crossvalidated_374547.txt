I think if the model is defined as a set of equations (can be a system of concurrent equations or a single one), and we learn its parameters, then is parametric. That includes differential equations, and even Navier-Stokes' equation. Models defined descriptively, regardless of how they are solved, fall into the category of nonparametric. Thus, OLS would be parametric, and even quantile regression, though belongs in the domain of nonparametric statistics, is a parametric model. On the other hand, when we use SEM (structural equation modeling) to identify the model, it would be a nonparametric model - until we have solved the SEM. PCA would be parametric, because the equations are well defined, but CCA can be nonparametric, because we are looking for correlations across all variables, and if these are Spearman's correlations, we have a nonparametric model. With Pearson's correlations, we imply a parametric (linear) model. I think clustering algorithms would be nonparametric, unless we are looking for clusters of certain shape. And then we have the nonparametric regression, which is nonparametric, and LOESS regression, which is parametric, but serves the same purpose: we define the equation and the window.
