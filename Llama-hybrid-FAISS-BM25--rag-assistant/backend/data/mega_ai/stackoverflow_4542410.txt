One possible solution: modify the manifest (so it reloads) modify the master file (index.html) to reference a non-existant manifest, so it gets a 404 Hardly elegant, but it seems to work. The main problem then is that you're stuck with this 404-generating false manifest entry until everyone who has ever been to your site has returned and had their cache cleared. There has got to be a better way...
