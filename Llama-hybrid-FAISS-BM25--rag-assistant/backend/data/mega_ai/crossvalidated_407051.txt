Consider the following data: y x 1 1.4 2 1.6 9 3 The difference in medians m(y)-m(x) = 0.4 The pair-differences $y_i-x_i$ are -0.4, 0.4 and 6, and the pairwise averages (including the self-averages) are 0, 2.8, 3.2, -0.4, 0.4, 6, for which the median is 1.6; hence the pseudo-median (1.6) is quite different to the difference in medians (0.4) for this example. How did I construct it? Mainly making the x-sample not too far from symmetric (/mildly skew) and the y-sample more heavily skew in order to get a skewed set of pair-differences; this pulls the pair-averages up relative to the differences in median. My guess is you'll probably see some skewness in your pair-differences as well. Looking at your data, this is indeed the case -- the pair differences are somewhat skew, with more of a tail to the right.
