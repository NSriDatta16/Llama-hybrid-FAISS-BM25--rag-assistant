Your page is working as expected. The hello_world virtual attribute is being initialized as false and then set to true. The problem is your expectation of what will happen when you refresh the page. The refreshed page is seen as a totally new request to rails with it's own (new) copy of @mymodel. This is why your results are the same when the refresh is done as the old value of @mymodel.hello_world is lost when the new instance is created. If you wish to avoid this you will need some mechanism to persist the value between requests. This can either be some form of persistent storage such as a database or you can use the standard mechanism for persisting temporary values between requests, namely the session.
