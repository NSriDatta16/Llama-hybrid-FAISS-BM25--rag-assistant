When a predictor variable needs to be adjusted for technical covariates, is it better to add those covariates to the outcome model or use residuals?

When a predictor variable of one model needs to be adjusted for other measures before it is interpretable, is it better to fit a model for that predictor and then feed the residuals of that model into the outcome model? Or is it better to add the predictor-related measures into the outcome model? As an example, say I am trying to investigate the relationship between whole blood WGS-derived mitochondrial DNA copy number and overall mortality. Overall risk of mortality may need to be adjusted for some covariates, so I might write the model in R as something like this: Model 1: coxph(Surv(Follow_up_time, Death) ~ Age + Sex + Smoking_Status + BMI + Education + Ethnicity + mtDNA_CN, DF) However, because in this case mitochondrial DNA copy number is a tissue-specific relative value, it also needs to be adjusted for a number of technical covariates before it is interpretable, such as sex, age, white blood cell count, platelet count, blood cell subtype parameters, autosomal coverage, etc. Model 2: lm(mtDNA_CN ~ Age + Sex + WBC_n + Platelet_n + Blood_Parameters + Autosomal_Coverage, DF) Should I take the residuals of Model 2 and feed them into Model 1 instead of mtDNA_CN? e.g. Model 3: coxph(Surv(Follow_up_time, Death) ~ Age + Sex + Smoking_Status + BMI + Education + Ethnicity + Model_2_Residuals, DF) Or would it be better to simply add the technical covariates for mtDNA_CN into the survival model even though they may not themselves be related to mortality? e.g. Model 4: coxph(Surv(Follow_up_time, Death) ~ Age + Sex + WBC_n + Platelet_n + Blood_Parameters + Autosomal_Coverage + Smoking_Status + BMI + Education + Ethnicity + mtDNA_CN, DF) I have asked a few researchers I know and I've received conflicting answers. I have also seen similar questions asked in other threads, but was not able find one that answered this question specifically.
