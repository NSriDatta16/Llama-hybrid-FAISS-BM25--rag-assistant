Hey mdresser, I know this may sound stupid, but have you tried restarting Visual Studio? I've come across this several times, and its always Visual Studio 2008 going a bit mental. Re-starting it fixed it every time. Just make sure that your relationships are in fact in the DB, and make sure you've refreshed your connections in the Server Explorer before dragging in. Finally, doing a build before adding the tables sometimes helps... I know it sounds random, but let me know cheers
