You need to implement a gesture recognizer in your application. In your interface: #define kMinimumGestureLength 30 #define kMaximumVariance 5 #import @interface *yourView* : UIViewController { CGPoint gestureStartPoint; } @end kMinimumGestureLength is the minimum distance the finger as to travel before it counts as a swipe. kMaximumVariance is the maximum distance, in pixels, that the finger can end above the beginning point on the y-axis. Now open your interface .xib file and select your view in IB, and make sure Multiple Touch is enabled in View Attributes. In your implementation, implement these methods. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; } -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self.view]; CGFloat deltaX = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.x - currentPosition.x); CGFloat deltaY = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.y - currentPosition.y); if(deltaX >= kMinimumGestureLength && deltaY = kMinimumGestureLength && deltaX This is one way to implement a swipe recognizer.
