Your boss has got the wrong end of the stick. I know of no tools that will generate unit tests for you. What he may be mistaking is code coverage and unit testing . While related they are in fact separate issues. Code coverage will instrument your code and once finished running give you the low down on how much of your source was used in the run. This is useful when unit testing as it will effectively show you where you have tested and where you need to focus your work. It is fairly easy to get the first two thirds of code covered but diminishing returns means to get near a magic 100% takes a lot of time and effort.
