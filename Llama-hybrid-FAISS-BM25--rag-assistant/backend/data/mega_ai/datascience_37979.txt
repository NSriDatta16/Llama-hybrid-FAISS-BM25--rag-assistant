Check If Answer is Correct by Similarity

I am new to data science and machine learning. Let's say that I have a question, and some correct answers for that question (for example, 10 correct answers). Is there a way to get a new answer as input, and "calculate" whether it is right? If you can recommend some readings, that would be great.
