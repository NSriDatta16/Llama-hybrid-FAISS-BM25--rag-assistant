How should I serialize an array of Moose objects?

I use MooseX::Storage for serialization of Moose objects. Can I use it for serialization of multiple Moose objects to the same file, or more specifically, an array or a hash of Moose objects? I guess I can define another Moose objects ('array_of_myobj') but this isn't very elegant. So, how would you recommend to serialize an array (or a hash) of Moose objects?
