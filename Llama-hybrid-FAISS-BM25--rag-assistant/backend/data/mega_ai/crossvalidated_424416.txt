It's because the two variables are inconsistent types Since these are variables in your logistic regression, there is no reason they can't be treated as floats, and so I would encourage you to do so. Here is a simplified copy of your Stan model data{ int N; real xc[N]; int xb[N]; int y[N]; //Binary outcome } parameters{ real b0; real b1; real b2; } model{ b0~normal(0,1); b1~normal(0,1); b2~normal(0,1); y~bernoulli_logit(b0 + b1*xc + b2*xb); } This model errors out with the following message SYNTAX ERROR, MESSAGE(S) FROM PARSER: No matches for: real * real[ ] Available argument signatures for operator*: real * real vector * real row_vector * real matrix * real row_vector * vector vector * row_vector matrix * vector row_vector * matrix matrix * matrix real * vector real * row_vector real * matrix No matches for: real + ill-formed Available argument signatures for operator+: int + int real + real vector + vector row_vector + row_vector matrix + matrix vector + real row_vector + real matrix + real real + vector real + row_vector real + matrix +int +real +vector +row_vector +matrix No matches for: real * int[ ] Available argument signatures for operator*: real * real vector * real row_vector * real matrix * real row_vector * vector vector * row_vector matrix * vector row_vector * matrix matrix * matrix real * vector real * row_vector real * matrix No matches for: ill-formed + ill-formed Available argument signatures for operator+: int + int real + real vector + vector row_vector + row_vector matrix + matrix vector + real row_vector + real matrix + real real + vector real + row_vector real + matrix +int +real +vector +row_vector +matrix Expression is ill formed. error in 'model368e1c9443af_stan_368e727bc831' at line 17, column 38 ------------------------------------------------- 15: b1~normal(0,1); 16: b2~normal(0,1); 17: y~bernoulli_logit(b0 + b1*xc + b2*xb); ^ 18: } ------------------------------------------------- Error in stanc(file = file, model_code = model_code, model_name = model_name, : failed to parse Stan model 'stan-368e727bc831' due to the above error. I'm confident that this is because the continuous and integer variables are treated as real / int and not as vectors. Changing the data block to data{ int N; //changes here vector[N] xc; vector[N] xb; //Rest the same int y[N]; } compiles the model.
