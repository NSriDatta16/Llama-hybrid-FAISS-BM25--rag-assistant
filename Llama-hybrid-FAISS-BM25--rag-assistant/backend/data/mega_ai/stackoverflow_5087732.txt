Not sure what your goal is, but if you're looking for an embedded data storage library with JPA-style persistence, your best bet is using Berkeley DB Java Edition with the Data Persistence Layer API . There's an interesting article on how to convert SQL queries to the DPL here . Basically, using the DPL to access Berkeley DB Java Edition is about 10x faster than using Hibernate to access an RDBMS. Disclaimer: I'm the product manager for Berkeley DB, so I'm a little biased. That said, we have lots of Java application developers who chose BDB JE because it's small, fast, scalable, reliable and the API is a natural fit for their application development environment.
