How do I manually add additional rows to the bottom of an ASP.NET gridview?

I have a situation where I'm populating a gridview with a bound data source, and want two additional rows at the very bottom; one to show the sum of values in the columns and one to show the average of values in the columns. I can quite easily calculate these values by aggregating information taken from the rowDataBound event, but don't know how to go about manually adding the additional two rows to the gridview. Any help much appreciated.
