I am trying to wrangle in the code first approach and I have a gap in understanding here. I have a collection of posts and files. public class post { public post(){attachements = new list ();} [key] public int id{get;set;} public string title{get;set} public string body{get;set;} public virtual ICollection attachments {get;set;} } public class file{ [key] public int id{get;set;} public string filename {get;set;} } And I think I have the ViewModel down with the following public class MyView{ public post post {get;set;} public list files {get;set;} public MyView(post p, list f){this.post = p; this.files = f;} Everything works fine for List and Display ... but when I try to create a new post and files it all falls apart. I've tried using the ViewModel but I am not sure how to add items to the list in the view model. I created a view based on my 'post' and then have a partial view that uploads files and keeps a list of them in a hidden field I can get everything to work, I am just not sure if that is the elegant solution. Could someone let me know if I am way off base ... I hope to start the convo and hopefully collect some responses that will be helpful to other noobs.
