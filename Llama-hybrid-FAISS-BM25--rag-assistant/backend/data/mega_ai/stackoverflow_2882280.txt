DataReader - hardcode ordinals?

When returning data from a DataReader I would typically use the ordinal reference on the DataReader to grab the relevant column: if (dr.HasRows) Console.WriteLine(dr[0].ToString()); or if (dr.HasRows) Console.WriteLine(dr.GetString(0)); or if (dr.HasRows) Console.WriteLine((string)dr[0]); I have always done this because I was advised at an early stage that using dr["ColumnName"] or a more elegant way of indexing causes a performance hit. However, while all references to data entities are becoming increasingly strongly-typed I feel more uncomfortable with this. I'm also aware that the above does not check for DBNull . What is the most robust way to return data from a DataReader ?
