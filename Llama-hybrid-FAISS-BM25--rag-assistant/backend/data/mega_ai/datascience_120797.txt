Is using GPT-4 to label data advisable? Yes. E.g., with GPT-2: Veyseh, Amir Pouran Ben, Franck Dernoncourt, Bonan Min, and Thien Huu Nguyen. " Generating Complement Data for Aspect Term Extraction with GPT-2. " In Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Deep Learning for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing, pp. 203-213. 2022.: [Task: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)] We fine-tune the generative language model GPT-2 to allow complement sentence generation at test data. The REINFORCE algorithm is employed to incorporate different expected properties into the reward function to perform the fine-tuning. We perform extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method that achieve the state-of-the-art performance on different datasets. Veyseh, Amir Pouran Ben, Viet Lai, Franck Dernoncourt, and Thien Huu Nguyen. " Unleash GPT-2 power for event detection. " In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 6271-6282. 2021: We propose to exploit the powerful pre-trained language model GPT-2 to generate training samples for Event Detection (ED). [...] We evaluate the proposed model on multiple ED benchmark datasets, gaining consistent improvement and establishing state-of-the-art results for ED
