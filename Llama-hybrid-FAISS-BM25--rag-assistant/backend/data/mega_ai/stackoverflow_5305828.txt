Whenever you have determiner every (or any or no ) in an English sentence the corresponding FOL sentence should have both a universal quantifier and an implication in it. E.g. the translation template for the noun phrase every man would be: ∀ x (man(x) ⇒ ...) If your English sentence does not contain any determiners, then reformulate it so that every noun in it would come with a determiner. This way the mapping to FOL becomes clear. E.g. the ambiguous/vague sentence Turtles outlast Rabbits. could be reformulated in several semantically different ways: Every turtle outlasts every rabbit. There are some turtles that outlast every rabbit. There are some turtles that outlast some rabbits. Most turtles outlast most rabbits. ... Btw, there is an online tool APE that converts English sentences into FOL provided that you first reformulate your sentences so that they fall into the fragment of English that this tool supports. Note however that this tool returns a single FOL reading, i.e. it does not enumerate all the ambiguity the input might contain.
