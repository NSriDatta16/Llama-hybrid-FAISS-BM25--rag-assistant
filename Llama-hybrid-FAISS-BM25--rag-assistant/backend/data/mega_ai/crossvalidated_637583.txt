You don't actually have a continuous proportion. That is a discrete proportion. The proportions you have are counts of successes out of 100 trials. You are fortunate that you know the number of trials for each value (and that they are all the same). You should determine the underlying counts by multiplying the proportions you have by 100. Some rounding may be needed, but it is unlikely to have much impact, especially with a lot of data. From there, you can run a logistic regression with the counts of successes and failures. You can see a little bit how this is done in my answer to Difference in output between SAS's proc genmod and R's glm or perhaps Test logistic regression model using residual deviance and degrees of freedom .
