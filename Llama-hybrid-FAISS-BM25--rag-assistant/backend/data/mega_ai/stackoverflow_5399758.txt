We've taken a slightly different approach at my current job. We use Jenkins (formerly Hudson) for our PHP related scheduling needs. It's nice because you can leverage the existing infrastructure for notifications (jabber, email, etc), and it sits along side our other build jobs for code releases. There's also the ability to watch console output in real time, get transcripts of every run, etc. I documented the way we organize our PHP jobs recently so that we can easily leverage our application framework from CLI, which is how Jenkins interfaces with the jobs. Here's the post about organizing PHP batch jobs for use with Jenkins or Hudson: http://blog.shupp.org/2011/03/15/organizing-php-batch-jobs/
