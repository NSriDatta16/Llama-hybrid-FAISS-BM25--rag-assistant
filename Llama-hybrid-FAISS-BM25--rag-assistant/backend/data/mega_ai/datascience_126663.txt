ARIMA Model shows flatline on predictions

I am learning time series for first time and trying it out on some kaggle datasets. For daily stock price predictions/weather prediction ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data/data ). To keep it simple while learning, I did not do any big stats/visualizations. I used autoarima and got order and predicted using ARIMA model. But I always end up on a flat line. Why is it so? m = ARIMA(train['meantemp'], order = (1,1,1)) fit_model = m.fit() predictions = fit_model.predict(start=len(train), end=len(train) + len(test) - 1) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(test.index, test.meantemp, label = 'Test data') plt.plot( predictions, label='Predictions', color='red', linestyle='--') plt.title('ARIMA Model') plt.xlabel('Time') plt.ylabel('Value') plt.legend() The below graph is for climate prediction This is for stock prediction Can someone guide me on what I am doing wrong?
