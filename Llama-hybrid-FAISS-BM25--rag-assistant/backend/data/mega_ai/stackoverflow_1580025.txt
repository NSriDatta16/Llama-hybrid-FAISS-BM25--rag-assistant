What do you mean by "only highest level of aggragation? You can avoid the NULLs by checking if a column in grouped, like so: SELECT CASE WHEN Grouping(GroupID) = 1 THEN '#ALL' ELSE GroupID END AS GroupID, CASE WHEN Grouping(SubGroupID) = 1 THEN '#ALL' ELSE SubGroupID END AS SubGroupID, Sum(Value) FROM Table GROUP BY GroupID, SubGroupID WITH ROLLUP It will display #ALL insteaed of NULL.
