Combining probabilities for class prediction

Before I release a new web service, I am trying to develop my data analytics skills so I can monitor the performance of the service. I may end up using and external service (eg: Google Analytics) or an analytics library, but I need to understand how the algorithms work before I can be confident I am using and interpreting the analytics correctly. The best way I learn is to build software, but I am stuck on a (probably simple to experienced analysts) problem: I have a dataset of 10,000 items. There are 100 labelled with class A (the items can have multiple classes). I note that 60 of the class A items have attribute X. I also count the other significant attributes that seem to correlate with items of class A. I might then think that any new item with attribute X has a 60% chance of being a class A item (ignoring the influence of other attributes for the present). But I also calculate that 20% of the items of the whole dataset have attribute X. How do I calculate the change in my prediction probability? I suspect a Bayesian approach would be suitable but the results do not look right. If I make the same calculations with other classes and other attributes, how do I merge the probabilities? (eg: to find the probability of a new item with attributes X,Y having class A, I look up P(A|X)=0.3 and P(A|Y)=0.5, then...). I tried the p=ab/(ab+(1-a)(1-b)) merging formula but this seems wrong. Some gentle guidance would be appreciated.
