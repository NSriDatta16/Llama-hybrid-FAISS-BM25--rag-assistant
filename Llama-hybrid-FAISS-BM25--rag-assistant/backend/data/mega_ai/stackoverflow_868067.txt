Since you've stated that it is working in your development environments and not on your clients, you might want to check the clients Apache's AddDefaultCharset and set this to UTF-8, if it's not already. (Assuming that they're using Apache.) I tend to make sure the following steps are checked PHP Header is sent in UTF-8 Meta tag is set to UTF-8 (Content-Type) Storage is set to UTF-8 Server output is set to UTF-8 Make sure your php code files are encoded in UTF8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark)
