Variable importance is calculated by considering the average increase in node purity a split on that variable causes. Variables whos splits cause larger increases in node purity are more important. The first split typically causes the largest increase in node purity. I am assuming that min depth in this package means what is the first time this variable is used to split the tree. If this is the case it makes sense that more important variables have lower min depth values. The splits that cause the larger increases in purity happen early and so the important variables are split on early.
