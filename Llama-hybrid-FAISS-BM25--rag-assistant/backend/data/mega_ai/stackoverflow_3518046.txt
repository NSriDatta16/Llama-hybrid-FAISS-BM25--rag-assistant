Something like this seems a lot more likely: Image *image_object = new Image(L"Image Name"); Except that there's a pretty decent chance you don't want to allocate the Image object dynamically at all -- unless you really do, you generally want to just define an object with automatic storage duration: Image image_object(L"Image Name");
