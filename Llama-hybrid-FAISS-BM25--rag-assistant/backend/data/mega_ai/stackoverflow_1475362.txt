Speaking from complete lack of experience in the matter, the ideal situation is probably to create a shared version control system between the teams. Then after a few initial organizational/awareness meetings, treat the shared depot as an opensource project that people can contribute to. So, looking at a couple of cases: You write some code to be shared : this requires creating a new area in the depot for the code, adding some basic documentation, tests, code clean up, etc...but there's incentive to do it right if it's considered "public". You want to use code and it's good quality : Sounds like a good library, but there's a few limitations. You add more documentation, tests, and extra functions, and so on. You want to use code, but it's rubbish : You need to chat with the original developers. Then do a major rework of the code, but it's still slightly better than reinventing the wheel. Both teams benefit when you're done. The trick is making it all public knowledge. So you need champions on each team to push people to reuse and contribute. That's what you get from the initial round of meetings. Assuming the opensource model is a proven practice, there's no reason it can't work if you have champions.
