How does Facebook prefetch url/feed content?

I posted a url to a blog post in a Facebook message http://www.autoblog.com/2009/06/22/we-are-all-bumblebee-beijing-transformers-fans-gather-to-celebr/ and Facebook inlined the title and abbreviated text as if it fetched them from the rss feed http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml but when I submitted the link the blog post was already expired out of the feed - I checked. see this screenshot: http://i43.tinypic.com/nwbu4m.jpg Is it using a feedburner search? How can this be similarly accomplished? cheers
