I am assuming you are declaring currentHour on the server side and that it outputs correctly in the JavaScript fragment you posted. You don't need to put the currentHour in quotes and parentheses. $(function() { var dd = 0 var dsc = ; if (dsc > 14) { dd = dd + 1; // go one day in the future } } You don't need the dsc variable either: $(function() { var dd = 0 if ( > 14) { dd = dd + 1; // go one day in the future } } Edit: (following the comments) The syntax is an asp feature that will only be processed when in an ASP page. If this is in a static JS file, it will remain as it is and not be processed.
