PCA results (the different dimensions or commponents) generally can't be translated into a real concept I think is wrong to assume that one of the components is "fear of bears" what lead you to think that was what the component meant? Principal components procedure transforms your data matrix to a new data matrix with the same or less amount of dimensions, and the resulting dimensions range from the one that better explains the variance to the one that explains it the less. This components are calculated based on a combination of the original variables with the calculated eigenvectors. Overal PCA procedure does convert the original variables to orthogonal ones (linearly independent). Hope this helps you clarify a little about pca procedure
