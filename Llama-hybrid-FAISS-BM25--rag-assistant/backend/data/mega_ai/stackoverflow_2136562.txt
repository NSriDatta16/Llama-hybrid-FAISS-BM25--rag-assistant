If the .dwt file is moved from the Templates folder, or if the Templates folder is moved or renamed, the link will be broken. It is very important to keep the .dwt file in the Templates folder where Dreamweaver creates it. Taken from Understanding paths in Dreamweaver templates I suggest you create each language as an independent folder inside of your Templates folder. So /fr/master.dwt becomes Templates/fr/master.dwt In the end, it makes sense to have your templates exist inside of a templates folder organized by language.
