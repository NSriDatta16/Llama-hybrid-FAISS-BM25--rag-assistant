I have had this problem. I am not sure of the cause and neither are the hdf5 maintainers. The authors of the R package have not replied. Alternatives that work In the time since I originally answered, the hdf5 package has been archived, and suitable alternatives ( h5r , rhdf5 , and ncdf4 ) have been created; I am currently using ncdf4`: Since netCDF-4 uses hdf5 as a storage layer, the ncdf4 package provides an interface to both netCDF-4 and hdf5. The h5r package with R>=2.10 the rhdf5 package is available on BioConductor. Workarounds Two functional but unsatisfactory workarounds that I used prior to finding the alternatives above: Install R 2.7, hdf5 version 1.6.6, R hdf5 v1.6.7 , and zlib1g version 1:1.2.3.3 and use this when writing the files (this was my solution until migrating to the ncdf4 library). Use h5totxt at the command line from the [hdf5utils][1] program (requires using bash and rewriting your R code) A minimal, reproducible demonstration of the issue: Here is a reproducible example that sends an error First R session library(hdf5) dat Second R session: library(hdf5) hdf5load("test.h5") output: HDF5-DIAG: Error detected in HDF5 library version: 1.6.10 thread 47794540500448.
