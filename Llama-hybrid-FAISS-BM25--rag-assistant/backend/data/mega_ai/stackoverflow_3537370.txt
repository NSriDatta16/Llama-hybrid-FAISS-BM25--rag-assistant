Best design pattern for associating subdomain with area and PRG pattern?

Now that the next version of ASP.NET MVC is being prototyped and previewed (ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 came out a couple of weeks ago), I wonder if we should call the attention of the Core Dev team (S Hanselman, Phil Haack and all) to this "feature." Is there a easy/non tacky way of associating subdomains → areas? Something like: http://admin.example.com/ → Mapped to Area = Admin http://www.example.com/managers/ → Mapped to Area = Managers http://www.example.com/admin/ → Invalid (since the dev has chosen to map admin as a sub domain). Also, whats the best accepted design pattern in implementing PRG pattern in ASP.NET MVC? I guess it should also get some official loving in MVC 3.
