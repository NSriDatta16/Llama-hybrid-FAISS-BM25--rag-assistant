I have the same question. I did find a fairly decent comparison of TokuDB against Innodb http://www.pythian.com/news/5139/testing-tokudb-faster-and-smaller-for-large-tables/ However, I am interested in any other experiences that others may have had with TokuDB or any other similar storage engine for MySQL. Another review here http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/04/28/detailed-review-of-tokutek-storage-engine/
