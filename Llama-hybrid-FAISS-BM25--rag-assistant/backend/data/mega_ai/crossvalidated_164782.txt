What is white noise? Time series data that shows no auto correlation is called white noise. How do I know whether it is white noise? A general assumption is that if 95% of the spikes in the Auto-correlation Function lie within (+/-)2/sqrt(T) , where T being the length of the time series. So, by the above mentioned formula, one can infer whether the series/data is white noise or not.
