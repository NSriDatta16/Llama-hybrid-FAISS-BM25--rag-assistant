Validation accuracy greater than training accuracy in cnn

I've splitted my training set in the ratio 80:20 and have developed cnn model with a dropout of 0.5. I'm getting an accuracy of 98%. But the validation accuracy stays greater than training accuracy. Is there any problem with this?Does it leads to over fitting? If yes, then why am I getting an accuracy of 98%?The graph is given below.The red line is the validation accuracy and blue is training accuracy.
