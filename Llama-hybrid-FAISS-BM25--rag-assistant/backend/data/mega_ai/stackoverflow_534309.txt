Security through obscurity is an interesting topic. It is (rightly) maligned as a substitute for effective security. A typical principle in cryptography is that a message is unknown but the contents are not. Algorithms for encyrption are typically widely published, analyzed by mathematicians and, after a time, some confidence is built up in their effectivness but there is never a guarantee that they're effective. Some people hide their cryptographic algorithms but this is considered a dangerous practice because then such algorithms haven't gone through the same scrutiny. Only organisations like the NSA, which has a significant budget and staff of mathematicians, can get away with this kind of approach. One of the more interesting developments in recent years has been the risk of steganography , which is the practice is hiding message in images, sound files or some other medium. The biggest problem in steganalysis is identifying whether or not a message is there or not, making this security through obscurity. Last year I came across a story that Researchers Calculate Capacity of a Steganographic Channel but the really interesting thing about this is: Studying a stego-channel in this way leads to some counter-intuitive results: for example, in certain circumstances, doubling the number of algorithms looking for hidden data can increase the capacity of the steganographic channel. In other words, the more algorithms you use to identify messages the less effective it becomes, which goes against the normal criticism of security through obscurity. Interesting stuff.
