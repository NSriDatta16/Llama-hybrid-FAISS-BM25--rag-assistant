Does scaling of the ordinal variables make sense before PCA?

I have some data with 200+ variables/columns (30% numerical, 30% Likert 1-5 scale and 40% Likert 1-10 scale). I want to do principal component analysis (PCA) in R. I think I should scale the data before calling psych::principal . My questions: Is it correct to scale the data having both numerical and categorical variables? Does scaling of categorical variables make sense? I believe the answer is NO for both questions.
