Rendering a node sequence as M x N table

@Oded: Sorry to have been poor in my exposition... My input document has a fragment like this: example 1 example 2 example 1 .... example 1 containing an arbitrarily long node sequence. The attribute "n" reports the order of the node in the sequence. I need to arrange as output that sequence in a M (rows) x N (columns) table and I have some trouble doing that. I cannot call a template with something like: ........ because code is invalid (and I should repeat it at the end of the template in some way) and I must put some (maybe too much) trust in the presence of the numbered attribute. Someone has a hint? Thanks!
