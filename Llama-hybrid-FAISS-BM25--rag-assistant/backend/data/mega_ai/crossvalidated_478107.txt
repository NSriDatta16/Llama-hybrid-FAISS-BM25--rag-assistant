Stats test to compare two distributions of proportions?

I am struggling for a statistical test to compare two distributions of proportions i.e. my control group and experimental group. Exp design is as follows: 40 samples (1 sample = 1 tree) each for control and experimental group. Each sample is 10 yes/no recordings per tree. 10 recordings x 40 trees = 400 recordings for experimental and 400 for control. I take the proportion of "yes" answers per tree for all 40 samples. Thus I am left with 40 proportions for control and 40 proportions for experimental. I want to compare for a statistically significant difference. tree1 k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7 k8 k9 k10 proportion yes no no yes yes yes no yes yes no 0.6 . . . tree40 k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7 k8 k9 k10 proportion yes yes no yes no no no yes yes no 0.5 I've been told I can use a chi-square test to compare these, and I've also seen using a z-test. However I believe a z-test would be suitable if I were comparing two of these samples, for example, but not two distributions of many proportions. A z-test also requires normally distributed observations (I believe) which my test would violate since all the proportions are bound between 0 and 1. At this stage I'm unsure whether to take the average proportion for control/experimental and compare (but again, would need to allow for the bounding in comparing mean proportions) or can I somehow compare 400 bernoulli trials for each group? I'm beginning to think it is a case for logistic regression Any help much appreciated!
