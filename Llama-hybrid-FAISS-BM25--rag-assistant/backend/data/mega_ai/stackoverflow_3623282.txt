Fetch all of wordpress (less header/footer) into magento. I can only get the posts

http://inchoo.net/wordpress/how-to-use-wordpress-home-page-in-magento-home-page-cms-page/comment-page-1/#comment-8020 to accomplish getting my wordpress to show some info inside magento (blog posts) but I can not understand how to pull in the entire page. The only part I don't want is the header and footer. Any ideas?
