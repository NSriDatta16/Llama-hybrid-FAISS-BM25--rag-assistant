Combinef in R HTS package- constrain to keep forecasts positive?

When using the combinef function from Rob Hyndman's very useful hts package for forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series, there does not seem to be a way to constrain the optimally combined forecasts to be positive- the starting forecasts can be positive, but can go negative through the reconciliation process. The forecast.gts and forecast.hts functions have an argument to keep forecasts positive, but this does not seem to be an option when using combinef by itself with forecasts obtained by other methods. Am I correct in this understanding, and if so is there a decent workaround?
