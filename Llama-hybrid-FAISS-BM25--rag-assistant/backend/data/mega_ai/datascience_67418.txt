Momentum is linear and provides speed to the update RMSprop contributes the exponentially decaying average of past "squared gradients" In RMS Prop By using the average, we actually try to diminish the vertical movement because they sum up to 0(approximately) while averaging. RMS provides average to the update Adam uses RMS prop and Momentum Speed and Average of update combined together, On an average it will speed up the direction in which more update is needed All three are faster than Stochastic Gradient Decent without Exponential Weighted Average, Worst Case use Momentum, Dont go for normal weight updates
