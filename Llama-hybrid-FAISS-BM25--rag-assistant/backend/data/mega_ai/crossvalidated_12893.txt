With respect to 1.: as chemometrician, my practical question is: do you really have no offset? One standard situation that corresponds to your scenario from my field of work is linear (univariate) calibration using the Beer-Lambert-law : $$ A = \varepsilon l c $$ (here $\varepsilon$ is the absorption coefficient, no error term) In practice, even if you obey the prerequisites the fit will include an offset (blank value) because reality is not as easy as theory. E.g. because you use a double beam instrument to compensate variability in the source intensity, but then you cannot use the same single cuvette for sample and blank, which can (will) cause an offset. Of course, you may have noise $\gg$ offset, so you can neglect the offset... Or you say that the true model does have an offset as physical reasons can be given. But taking into account the influence of the measurement my bet is that it will be pretty hard to find an example system that is really supposed to be linear. (Anyone knows an example?) With respect to the general question: Depending on the situation, however, a constrained model may be better even if it is only an approximation (keyword: bias variance tradeoff, see e.g. the Elements of statistical learning )
