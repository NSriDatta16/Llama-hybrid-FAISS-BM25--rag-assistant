what does generalized estimating equations with robust standard error mean

I am currently working on logistic regression and came across some articles stating " generalized estimating equations with robust standard error " or " with robust sandwich estimators for variance ". Can someone please tell me what these mean? Below is how I run my logistic regression. I am not sure if R already took care of those error calculations. If not, what associated R code I should run in order to have this included in my analysis? model
