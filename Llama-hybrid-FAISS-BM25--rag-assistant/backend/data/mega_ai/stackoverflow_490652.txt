Using the spring framework I would simply not be putting the login information into the DTO (or in Thread Storage that I manage) any more. I'd simply let spring inject the proper credentials into the service when needed. This works really nice with login information. When running integration tests like you are doing, spring takes care of it all. You asked for alternatives.
