Drag and Drop Table Rows Using Javascript

I'm wondering if there is a good library or script out there that trivializes drag and drop functionality for table rows in Javascript? Really the only requirement I have is that rows must be draggable within the table itself, but also to other tables on the page. I'm not too familiar with JQuery or Javascript itself, so I'd like to try and find a self contained library or script that makes the drag and drop portion pretty simple so I don't have to write the code myself. I understand JQuery is a nice Javascript library, does it have this kind of functionality?
