Calculating acceptance rate in Monte Carlo Markov Chain while doing Bayesian analyis

I am doing Bayesian analysis using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain of length 10000 and burn-in length 1000. I consider my chain as converged when the acceptance rate is equal to 23% and the chain mixing looks convincing (visual inspection). There is a difference in acceptance rate value when I consider the whole chain for acceptance rate calculation and when I consider the chain after burn-in. Which acceptance rate value should I try to make 23?
