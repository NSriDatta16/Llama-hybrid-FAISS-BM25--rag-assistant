I'm not sure, but I think I bumped into this problem once: Forms can be posted by pressing enter, in which case no value for the button is posted. So I would strongly discourage to use three different submit buttons for three such different actions. Instead, I'd use three forms, and use another way to distinguish between them, like putting a hidden field in them or posting to a different url (or put something like ?action=signup in the forms action attribute.
