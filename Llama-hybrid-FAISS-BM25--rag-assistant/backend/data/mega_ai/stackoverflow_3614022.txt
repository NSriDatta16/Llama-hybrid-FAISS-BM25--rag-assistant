Cannot access my UI controls in C# code. What's wrong?

I cannot access my UI controls on my ASP.Net website. When I create a brand new form and drag a control on it, I can use C# to change the properties of the control easily, like one would expect. But when I try to do the same on another page, I cannot access any control whether I drag a new control on the page or not. It seems the code behind and the visual page aren't connected. How can I fix this?
