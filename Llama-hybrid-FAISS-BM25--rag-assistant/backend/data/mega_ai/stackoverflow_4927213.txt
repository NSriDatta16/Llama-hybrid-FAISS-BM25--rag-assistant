Linq multi column grouping and averaging

I'm trying to get the average of some numbers after grouping but it just won't group for me. Why isn't this doing what I think it should? var eventInfo = from eventData in dt.AsEnumerable() group eventData by new { Phase1Minutes = eventData.Field ("Phase1Minutes"), Phase2Minutes = eventData.Field ("Phase2Minutes"), TechnologyType = eventData.Field ("TechnologyType"), TechnologySubType = eventData.Field ("TechnologySubType") } into g select new { Phase1Avg = g.Average(x => x.Field ("Phase1Minutes")), Phase2Avg = g.Average(x => x.Field ("Phase2Minutes")), g.Key.TechnologyType, g.Key.TechnologySubType };
