The QQ plot looks "reasonably" Normal given that there are implicit constraints on the values the residuals can take because: The independent variables are gender (two levels) and relationship type (also two levels). The dependent variable is meanEmotion defined as the average of two Likert-type ordinal variables. That's why there are 107 observations (the degrees of freedom of the Shapiro Wilk test) but we see only about 20 distinct residuals in the QQ plot: there is overplotting (points plotted on top of each other). Since you know — even before doing the analysis — that the Normal distribution is only an approximation in your case, you shouldn't over-interpret the result of the Normality tests. Your data would be better modeled with an ordinal logistic regression instead of the ANOVA, which assumes (among other things) that the response is continuous. @EdM points to the UCLA Stats tutorials which have a section about ordinal logistic regression. This answer by @ChristianHennig discusses some pitfalls of checking model assumptions: Testing Model Assumptions in R .
