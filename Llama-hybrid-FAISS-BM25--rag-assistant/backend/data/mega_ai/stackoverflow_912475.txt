How can I elegantly create a hash from an array reference in Perl?

I am looking for a more elegant way to create a hash that contains the list I have read in from my configuration file. Here is my code: read_config($config_file => my %config); my $extension_list_reference = $config{extensions}{ext}; my @ext; # Store each item of the list into an array for my $i ( 0 .. (@$extension_list_reference - 1) ) { $ext[$i] = $extension_list_reference->[$i]; } # Create hash with the array elements as the keys foreach my $entry (@ext) { $extensions{$entry} = "include"; } Thanks.
