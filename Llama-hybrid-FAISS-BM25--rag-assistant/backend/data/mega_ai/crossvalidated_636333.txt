I don't want to spread misinformation on this forum. So for future viewers who see this question I would like to apologize. There was an error in the code of the scaling function that I used for my neural network. It turns out that the Shapley value for my Neural Network are very similar to what the decision tree determines is important. I consider my question resolved.
