In 1961 James and Stein published an article called "Estimation with Quadratic Loss" https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bsmsp/1200512173 . While it doesn't specifically coin the term shrinkage, they discuss minimax estimators for high dimensional (actually even for a 3 parameter location) statistics that have less risk (expected loss) than the usual MLE (each component the sample average) for normal data. Bradley Efron calls their finding "the most striking theorem of post-war mathematical statistics". This article has been cited 3,310 times. Copas in 1983 writes the first article Regression, Prediction and Shrinkage to coin the term "shrinkage". It's defined implicitly in the abstract: The fit of a regression predictor to new data is nearly always worse than its fit to the original data. Anticipating this shrinkage leads to Stein‚Äêtype predictors which, under certain assumptions, give a uniformly lower prediction mean squared error than least squares. And in all successive research, it seems that shrinkage refers to the operating characteristics (and estimates thereof) for out-of-sample validity of prediction and estimation in the context of finding admissible and/or minimax estimators.
