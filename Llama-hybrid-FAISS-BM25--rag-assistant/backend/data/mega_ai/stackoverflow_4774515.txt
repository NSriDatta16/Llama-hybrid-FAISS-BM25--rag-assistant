One simple thought: A table implies a tabular organization to the information, i.e. the nth value of every row represents the same attribute of the row. Nested lists don't imply a relationship between the items in the subordinate lists. I don't have any specifics reasons to use one of the other and with powerful tools like jQuery, it may be that you can certainly accomplish what you want with either organization. However, all other things being equal, for simplicity, I would try choose the representation that most naturally models the data. It minimizes the "surprise factor" for future maintainers (including future you) and you may find better support in tools when your scenario matches the expected use cases (e.g. tabular data is in a table). I'm not trying to talk you out of it - I'm just giving you something to consider if you hadn't already. But, experimentation is how we learn, exploration adds spice, and its your app. I say try it and see.
