Since doing anything about these findings can distort inference, you have to question why do them. (That is especially true for outliers). Best to use methods that are not greatly effected by outliers or high leverage points. For outliers, semiparametric ordinal models can be used (see here ) and for collinearities, reformulate the model using unsupervised learning (data reduction) techniques such as variable clustering. I go into this in Chapter 4 of RMS .
