It is a little difficult from your description to see the problem clearly, which might explain why this post have lingered unanswered for so long. You seems to have many different features which might (or not) be associated with faulty components. With your approach you are looking separately at each feature. Doing this, for each feature you have a $2\times 2$ contingency table, and the question binomial or hypergeometric corresponds to analyze this table with Fisher exact test or chi-squared test. Maybe it does not make much of a difference! This approach will lead to multiplicity problems. Maybe it is better to estimate a model, start with logistic regression, the binary response is fault/no-fault, predictors are dummys for the features. This also makes possible the inclusion of interactions, and I believe this will be a more informative analysis.
