MCMC acceptance rate with discrete but noisy function

I have a question regarding the acceptance rate of MCMC sampling (I am using an implementation of the Goodman and Weare 2010 algorithm) in the special case that the output of my model has a considerable amount of randomness / noise. Specifically, the model consists in a variant of a Wiener process for which no analytical solution exists, and the fit (logL) therefore depends not only on the parameters, but also on the simulated random walk, which obviously varies when parameters are even only changed by a tiny amount. Therefore, even very similar parameters can vary to a certain degree wrt the logL returned. Now I am pretty sure that this in general is no problem for MCMC sampling, but with increasing sampling I notice that the acceptance rate drops considerably, until as low as 2-3%. I think what happens is that the accepted proposals are more and more "selected" due to variance in the random numbers and, thus, new proposals need to not only be somewhat reasonable parameters, but also in a sense draw well from the random noise. Does that make sense at all? And if so, does someone know a way to deal with this? Any help would be appreciated :)
