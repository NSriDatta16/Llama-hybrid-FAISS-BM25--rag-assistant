Why is there a difference between manually calculating a logistic regression 95% confidence interval, and using the confint() function in R?

Dear everyone - I've noticed something strange that I can't explain, can you? In summary: the manual approach to calculating a confidence interval in a logistic regression model, and the R function confint() give different results. I've been going through Hosmer & Lemeshow's Applied logistic regression (2nd edition). In the 3rd chapter there is an example of calculating the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Using R, I can easily reproduce the model: Call: glm(formula = dataset$CHD ~ as.factor(dataset$dich.age), family = "binomial") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.734 -0.847 -0.847 0.709 1.549 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.8408 0.2551 -3.296 0.00098 *** as.factor(dataset$dich.age)1 2.0935 0.5285 3.961 7.46e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 136.66 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 117.96 on 98 degrees of freedom AIC: 121.96 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 However, when I calculate the confidence intervals of the parameters, I get a different interval to the one given in the text: > exp(confint(model)) Waiting for profiling to be done... 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 0.2566283 0.7013384 as.factor(dataset$dich.age)1 3.0293727 24.7013080 Hosmer & Lemeshow suggest the following formula: $$ e^{[\hat\beta_1\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\times\hat{\text{SE}}(\hat\beta_1)]} $$ and they calculate the confidence interval for as.factor(dataset$dich.age)1 to be (2.9, 22.9). This seems straightforward to do in R: # upper CI for beta exp(summary(model)$coefficients[2,1]+1.96*summary(model)$coefficients[2,2]) # lower CI for beta exp(summary(model)$coefficients[2,1]-1.96*summary(model)$coefficients[2,2]) gives the same answer as the book. However, any thoughts on why confint() seems to give different results? I've seen lots of examples of people using confint() .
