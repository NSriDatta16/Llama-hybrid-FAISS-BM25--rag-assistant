After much consideration, I reached out the following points: The top plot you asked the first, and the second questions are shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X) . It is an overview of the most important features for a model for every sample and shows impacts each feature on the model output (home price) using the SHAP value metric. When top sorted feature in this summary plot which is LSTAT (% lower status of the population) $\text{SHAP}_\text{LSTAT} = 0$ simply means it has no contribution on the output of the model for those samples (nearly no effect on the home price). This plot reveals for example that a high LSTAT (e.g. $\text{SHAP}_\text{LSTAT} = -7, $ etc.) lowers the predicted home price. The colors represent the feature value (red high, blue low). Note that all features are included even LSTAT. Exclusively, SHAP values for all instances are calculated and plotted. if you want to plot the SHAP values for the first\single instance x you need: shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0,:], X_test.iloc[0,:]) Visualization of the first prediction's explanation shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0,:], X.iloc[0,:]) according to this doc shows: features each contributing to pushing the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset has been passed) to the model output. features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red (e.g. $\text{SHAP}_\text{LSTAT} = 4.98$ , $\text{SHAP}_\text{PTRATIO} = 15.3$ ), those pushing the prediction lower are in blue (e.g. $\text{SHAP}_\text{RM} = 6.575$ , $\text{SHAP}_\text{RAD} = 1$ , etc.) when $\text{Model}_\text{output} = 24.41$$ for home price. This amount of contribution (magnitude) also has been highlighted in Figure 4 of the paper from Lundberg et al. [Nature BME] slightly better on the feature named "Total volume" with annotation as follow:
