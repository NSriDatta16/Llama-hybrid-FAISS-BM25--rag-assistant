Assuming that you have a file like you can do replacements with this sed command (using GNU sed): sed "s/ /\${ iframesrcUrl }/g; \ s/ /\${ currentPage.title }/g;" \ input.xml which produces: ${ iframesrcUrl } ${ iframesrcUrl } ${ currentPage.title } Is it what you need? Or do you want to replace attributes' values? Or do you want to put your substitution text into these tags? To find and edit all files in-place (attention! changes your files, please test without -i before use, put your file mask instead of '*.jsp'): find . -type f -name '*.jsp' -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i "..." UPDATE To replace attribute values, not the lines of file themselves, I would strongly recommend using xmlstarlet instead of sed / awk . It is much more reliable and flexible. I cannot post solution exactly for your case, because xmlstarlet needs a complete (valid) file to process, but this is an idea: Given a file: Let say we want replace foo with SPAM and bar with EGGS . Then this command will do it (splitted lines for readability): $ printf ' ' | \ xmlstarlet ed --update "//c[@name='foo']/@name" -v SPAM \ --update "//c[@name='bar']/@name" -v EGGS I used XPath syntax to select an element to replace (in the first case it is name attribute which belongs to any c tag and is equal to foo ). ed subcommand of xmlstarlet allows various transformations, replacing (updating) an element is just on of them. In real-life examples you will need to specify also bean workspace, i.e. add something like -N bean=urn:... to the list of xmlstarlet 's options. You can find the correct URI in the first lines of your .jsp file (I don't have any to look at).
