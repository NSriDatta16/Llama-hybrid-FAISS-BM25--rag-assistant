Does the cost function for logistic regression use log base 10 or natural logarithm?

I'm trying to implement the cost function to estimate the SVM models I've trained with scikit-learn for a classification problem. Unfortunately, from my course (Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning), I have not understood whether the cost function should use 10-based logarithm, or the natural logarithm. Here's the formula: Could I use both logarithm functions? Does it have any influence? Which is more appropriate in general?
