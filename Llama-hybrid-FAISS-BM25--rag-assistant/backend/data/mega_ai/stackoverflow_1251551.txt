Hard to say from this code fragment and not knowing the client, but is it possible that your sending of 150 (indicating a new data channel), not 125 (indicating use of existing data channel) confuses the client and it simply does not start reading the data? Have you had a look of pyftpdlib as an alternative for rolling your own server?
