Combining UITabBarController with UINavigationContoller

I am sure this is very simple, yet I am stuck... I have created an application and added UITabViewController (dragged in from the library in Interface Builder. My application has 3 different views, clicking on appropriate tab brings the different view. So far so good. I want to convert one of the views to be a UINavigationController: basically a table with the option to delete rows (so UINavigationController would need to have a button "Edit" on top). I saw many samples which would do either 1 or 2, but not both. How would I combine it, keeping in mind that I have used provided UITabViewController and did not added UITabBar directly to the view. Thanks
