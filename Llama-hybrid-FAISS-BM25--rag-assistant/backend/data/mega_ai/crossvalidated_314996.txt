Calculate price elasticity from a history of sales data

I'm looking at sales data with sales at different prices over time, I can't figure out a good approach to getting the: 'If we increase our prices by 1% how much will our demand change by? ' the data i have looks as such: Individual line item sales, associated with whole orders, associated with accounts. I've tried grouping by accounts and comparing average prices, grouping by purchase and comparing average accounts purchase sizes, and basically a lot of grouping and doing things. I guess I could approach this problem with a random forrest clasifier, or perhaps run it through a neural network, but i'm a little lost and looking for a point in the right direction at this point.
