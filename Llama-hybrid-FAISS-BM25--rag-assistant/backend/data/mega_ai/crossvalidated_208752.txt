validating model in machine learning - what does it mean in reality (intuition)

Could someone explain (in simple way) what does mean of validating model ? I tried to understand it, but I didn't managed to. I can do cross-validation, but I am not sure about if it is validation. What is the aim of validation ? What are ways of validation ? As I mentioned above - I don't expect very long expactation (that I can find in book), I have a problem with intuition here.
