If you want this to be separate from the style of the controls, and you want to specify multiple "properties" per control, then an attached property may be an option. I would recommend looking into Behaviors from the Blend SDK. They would make this fairly easy (especially if you're using blend), as it would allow you to make a tooltip behavior that you could just drag onto your controls.
