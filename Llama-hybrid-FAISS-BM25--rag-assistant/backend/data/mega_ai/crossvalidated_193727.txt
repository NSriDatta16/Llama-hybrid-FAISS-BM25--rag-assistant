Bayesian inconsistency

I have a small knowledge of Bayesian analysis which I want to apply to invert some instrumentation data which has a complex nonlinear response. However this simple example confused me so before I go any further I wanted to check it. Lets assume I had n trials each with a 10% chance of success. I have 10 successes, and I want to find out how many trials there were. (This is equivalent to me saying I have an instrument with a 10% chance of detecting the things I want to measure. It detected 10 of them. I want to find how many things there really were - I know this is a trivial example, I just want to understand the method). I can use a binomial distribution to generate my likelihood function - which is equal to my posterior as my prior is the same for all values. This gives a mode at 100 trials - as expected I guess. However the expectation is 109. Somehow I think something is wrong here. If I set up many experiments each with 100 trials and a 10 % success rate then on average I get an expectation of 109 trials (every experiment gives an expectation on n sucesses * 10 + 9) rather than 100. Surely the expectation should be unbiased? Am I doing something wrong or have I misunderstood? Edit below to give more information after Greg Snow's response My understanding is as follows, please correct me if I am wrong Taking Bayes theorem I have P(Nt|Ns,I) = k x P(Ns|Nt,I) x P(Ns|I) where Nt is the number of trials, Ns the number of successes, I is my conditioning information and k is a constant of proportionality. My conditioning information is simply that the trials are independent and each have a 10% chance of success. I have no prior information about Nt so my prior is just set to a constant - i.e P(Ns|I)=1. This gives P(Nt|Ns,I) = k x P(Ns|Nt,I) or if I sub in my numbers P(Nt|Ns=10,I) = k x P(Ns=10|Nt,I). I can represent P(10|Nt,I), by a binomial distribution P(Nt|Ns=10,I) = k(0.1^10)((0.9)^(Nt-10))Nt!/(Ns!(Nt-Ns)!). I then find the expectation which makes the k drop out and I get E[Nt] = 109. if I repeat with different values of Ns then I always get E[Nt] = Ns/0.1 + 9.
