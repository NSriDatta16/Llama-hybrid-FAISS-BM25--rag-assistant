You should call allTargets on the button and see if it returns the target you want. If it does not then none of the public API methods will let you hit that target and you are wasting your time. Apple hardwires some of its controls and developers cannot override that. Edit01: UIThreePartButton is a private class. If you use its methods your app will be rejected by the app store. However, I did find a source that claims to be the header for it and its superclasses. You can see if you can find anything. http://ericasadun.com/iPhoneDocs/_u_i_three_part_button_8h-source.html Even if you don't care about rejection, if you ultimate goal is to access or override something in the API, I think your wasting your time. It's unlikely to work and it will be fragile if it does. There is probably another way to do what you want.
