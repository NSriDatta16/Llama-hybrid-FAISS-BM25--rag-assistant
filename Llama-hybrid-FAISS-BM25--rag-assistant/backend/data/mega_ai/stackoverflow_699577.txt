Javascript/css/php/mysql to collect user email addresses in a div on a website

Suppose you want a box on your website that says "Give us your email address and we'll send you news" or somesuch. What's a simple/elegant way to collect those email addresses (assuming a standard LAMP stack)? In particular, I'd like recommendations on Javascript to handle the UI (complain if invalid email address, say thanks when they hit enter, etc). CSS to make it look decent. PHP to actually collect the email addresses and store them (either flat file or database is fine). Or if there's a fancy Rails or AJAX way to do this, I'm very open to that, too. (All I know currently is how to do this the old-school CGI way, with a plain html web form with a submit button and a server-side script that takes the form contents, pulls out the email address, and spits out html (potentially a redirect back to the original page).) If I'm naive in thinking I can grab something off the shelf for this and should be starting with something like an AJAX tutorial, let me know that as well. I've seen this JQuery/AJAX tutorial recommended. Is that or something like it the quickest way to get a simple sign-up form up and running?
