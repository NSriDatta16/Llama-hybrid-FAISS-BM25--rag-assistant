dTrace scripts and tools

I've recently began using dTrace and have noticed just how awesome it is. Its the perfect tool for profiling without placing the burden on programmers to set up hundreds of probes in their applications. I've found some nice one liner and sample scripts here and there, but I was wondering about what scripts, tools and links others might want to share. BTW Anybody tried Chimes?
