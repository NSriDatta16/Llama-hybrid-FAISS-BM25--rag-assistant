It's intuitively clear. If you have the correct model as the linear regression, the residuals should be distributed with mean zero. If you take the average on the residuals, you are left only with the predicted values. For example, if your model is $y = c + ax + \epsilon$ , where $c$ is constant vector, $a$ is coefficient vector, $x$ is the feature vector, $\epsilon$ is the Gaussian residual vector. When you take the expectation of $y$ for the mean, you get $E(y) = E(c + ax + \epsilon) = E(c + ax) = E(\hat{y})$ because $E(\epsilon) = 0$ as the mean of residuals are zero.
