Firth's method for logistic regression - interpretation of R output

I have a multivariate, multinomial logistic regression model with exclusively continuous covariates. After some examination, I found that I had a problem of quasi-complete separation. The textbook Applied Regression Analysis (3rd Ed, Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant) recommends trying Firth's method or perhaps a Bayesian method. I am starting with Firth's method. I have 16,000 observations (1000 per class for 16 classes), and no missing data. I have three covariates: total_length , total_num_peak and and total_peak . My response is called class_var . After proceeding according to the textbook's recommended model fitting technique presented in Chapter 4, I found that I should retain all of these continuous variables. I then attempted to test the hypothesis of a linear relationship between each continuous variable and the polychotomous response using fractional polynomials, as they suggested. require(mfp) fp_trial1 summary(fp_trial1) Call: glm(formula = class_val ~ I((total_length_data/10)^2) + I((total_length_data/10)^3) + I((total_num_data/100)^-2) + I((total_num_data/100)^-2 * log((total_num_data/100))) + I((total_peak_data/10)^1) + I((total_peak_data/10)^2), family = binomial, data = datatouse) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.00748 0.00000 0.00000 0.00055 2.46316 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 100.924 5.207 19.381 The resulting model fp_trial1 gives me warnings: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred (of course, due to quasi-complete separation). This warning was not given in any of my earlier models without fractional polynomials. I saved the transformed continuous variables: trans_length_1 The textbook and several other sources recommend trying either Firth's method or Bayesian methods to correct the maximum likelihood estimates of the model coefficients. I tried Firth's method twice. First on the non-transformed, original continuous variables (no fractional polynomials): firth_try1 Then again on the variables given by fractional polynomials: firth_try2 Question : How can I interpret the results of Firth's method? My guess : In the fractional polynomial output for Firth's method, the Chi-squared test statistic gives Inf or 0 . In the case of Inf , that means the expected cell counts were 0. In the case of 0 , that means the expected cell counts matched the observed cell counts exactly. I think that means my quasi-complete separation is occurring due to trans_length_1 and trans_length_2 . Most of the confidence intervals contain 0, which to me means that most of my variables are not significant, but that doesn't make sense if there's quasi-complete separation (at least one variable must be significant, as it nearly perfectly predicts class identity). Can anyone help fill in this analysis properly?
