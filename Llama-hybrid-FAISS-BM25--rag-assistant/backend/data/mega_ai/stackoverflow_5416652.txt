I would use a repeater as well. However there are two more options: Create a custom web control for this purpose Use a literal control and assign the html to its Text property. Not very elegant, but might work if you just want a quick-and-dirty solution. Remember to set the literals Mode-property to "Passthrough" in order to allow html-tags.
