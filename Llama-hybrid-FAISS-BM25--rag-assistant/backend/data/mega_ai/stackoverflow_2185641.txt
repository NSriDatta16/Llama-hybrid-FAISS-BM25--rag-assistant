Suppressing "Day too big" warning in Perl LWP::UserAgent

I have a fairly simple perl script with uses the LWP::UserAgent module to follow URLs through redirection to find the final destination URL which it then stores in our MySQL database. The problem is that from time to time the script reports warnings that look like this: Day too big - 25592 > 24855 Sec too small - 25592 11647 Day too big - 25592 > 24855 Sec too small - 25592 11647 The warnings don't provide any other details as to why this is happening or which module is causing the issue but I'm pretty sure it has to do with LWP::UserAgent. I'm initializing the agent using the following code: use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(cookie_jar => { },requests_redirectable => [ ]); $ua->agent('Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:9.9.9.9) Gecko/20079999 Firefox/2.0.0.1'); $ua->timeout(10); I searched online and the only result I found was to the following thread which was never resolved http://www.mail-archive.com/libwww@perl.org/msg06515.html . The thread author thought that these warning were somehow related to cookie dates being captured by the LWP::UserAgent module. The warning doesn't seem to be effecting the script but I would appreciate any help in better understanding what might be causing this issue and advice on how to resolve it or at least suppress the warning messages. Thanks in advance for your help!
