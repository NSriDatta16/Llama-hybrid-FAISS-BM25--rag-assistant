Selenium vs old-school POST/GET based tests

We have a considerable code base with relatively high test coverage for pages/forms, all via vanilla POST/GET. Now, we are find ourselves moving more into the 'ajaxy' space, and it's not quite possible to test with GET/POST complete scenarios like user registration, or an item creation, as they involve lots of JavaScript/Ajax calls. While things like that are the most likely candidates for testing with Selenium, I wonder should we adopt the Selenium testing across the board, leaving the old-school POST/GET tests altogether? Advantages of Selenium adoption seems to be too good - ability to run pretty much same GET/POST tests but across the range of browsers. Or am I missing something in my pursuit of cool and trendy stuff and ditching the old proven POST/GET tests?
