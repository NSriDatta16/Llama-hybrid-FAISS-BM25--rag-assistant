Drawing A Piano

I have started working on a software synthesizer (or keyboard). I have decided to use Java because of the available Jfugue API. I am trying to figure out how to go about creating the actual keys (notes) of the keyboard user interface, but I am stuck. I have tried to create an interface by dragging/dropping black and white rectangular buttons onto the panel, but that doesn't seem to work. Could someone point me into the right direction?
