FileNotFoundException AndroidManifest.xml

I am working through my first Android app and have gotten it to work in the emulator but am unable to get it running on a real device (myTouch running cupcake). I have put the app out on my web site accessible through a link with type attribute set to application/vnd.android.package-archive and I have also added that mime type to apache (and restarted it). I can download the app with my phone but when I try and install it I get an error message. I have verified that the apk file actually has it, which is does. I have signed the apk file with a personal key. I tried the same process on the emulator (downloading via web) and had the same negative result. The log does give some additional information, basically that there is a FileNotFoundException while trying to load the AndroidManifest.xml file. I looked into installing the app via usb, but found no way to do so. All of the documentation I have come across pretty much glosses over installing the app on your own phone, so I am thinking it is easy and I am just missing something. Just as a last bit of info... I am developing with Eclipse 3.5 on Ubuntu and Java 6. Does anyone have any suggestions?
