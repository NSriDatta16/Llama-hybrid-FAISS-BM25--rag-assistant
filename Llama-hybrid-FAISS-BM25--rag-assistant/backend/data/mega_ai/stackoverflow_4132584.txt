I guess the plugin expects the to have the 's ID set as the value for it's own 'for' attribute. You need to modify the plugin and build your own selector for $label (horrible varname btw) if you want to use your current markup: $label = $("label[for=" + $('#'+id).attr('value')+" ]"); And Robert's your mother's brother.
