Add linked server: Server Objects->Linked Servers a) Write script to copy (you don't prefer this method, I think) b) Create package SSIS in VS and execute it with different parameters (you can pass input parameters to package) c) Use wizard (Import/Export) than save this task as package (as file to edit or to server to execute) I think c) is your case. EXPRESS has no SQL Server Agent, so use other server (enterprise or standard editions) to execute your package periodically
