Machine learning roadmap not for beginners

To introduce myself: I know what is RL, know some RL algorithms such as PPO, A2C. Know about offline RL, online RL. I have read many papers about RL. Such as MuZero, AplhaZero, Decision Transformer and etc. I also know much about supervised learning. Know many architectures from MPL to modern Transformers. I can solve many tasks. I have read many papers about supervised learning. Such as DETR, VIT, T5, BERT, GPT-3 and many others. I know some things from unsupervised learning. I have read some papers such as DINO, UP-DETR, SIMCLR, and etc. Yesterday i knew about SwAV. I gonna read paper. And learn more about clustering in unsupervised learning. To create Neural Nets i use pytorch. I'm student at university. I want to be professional AI researcher. And want to work at FAIR. Question: What should i learn next? Which skills i have to have to be AI researcher? Please give full roadmap from my current level to level of researcher. Thank you.
