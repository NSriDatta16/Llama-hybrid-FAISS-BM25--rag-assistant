How to embed a SilverLight control in ASP.NET control (user or custom)

We have a ASP.NET web application written in VB.NET where we build content programmatically during the Init event. We make extensive use of user controls, building them on the fly, and I now want to start including SilverLight content. Is there an easy way of embedding a SilverLight application in a control, and then instantiating the whole thing in code, in the same way as you'd programmatically add ordinary ASP.NET controls to a page? The SilverLight component itself works fine when added to a page using the tag but I really want to be able to reuse it elsewhere in code. Since I'm expecting use of SilverLight to increase in our application, and the asp:Silverlight control seems now to be deprecated , I'm looking for an alternative way of wrapping the content. Thanks for any pointers.
