Flex How To Call A Function With A Variable Number Of Parameters?

Let's Say I Have This Class: package{ import flash.display.Sprite; public class Main extends Sprite{ public function Main(){ trace(getAverage(1,2,3)); trace(getAverage(1,2,3,4)); trace(getAverage(1,2,3,4,5)); } public function getAverage (...numbers) { var total = 0; for (var i = 0; i How do I accomplish the "opposite" of this? Namely, how could I now CALL 'getAverage' with a dynamic number of paraemters? For instance, if I wanted to do something LIKE : var r:int=Math.random()*6; var a:Array=new Array(); for (i:int=0;i What I want to know, is if I have a function that takes a variable number of arguments, that's great, but how can I CALL IT with a variable number of arguments, when that number isn't known at runtime? Possibly it's impossible... I'm just not sure, since 'callLater' seems to be able to take an array and generate a dynamic number of parameters from it somehow... NOTE: Answers consisting solely of "Why Do You Want To Do This?", will be downvoted. P.S. This IS NOT about calculating Averages! I REALIZE There Are Way Simpler Ways Of Doing All Of This! (I could just write getAverage to accept a single array as its only parameter) The Above is just an EXAMPLE to Illustrate my Question. HOW TO PASS A DYNAMIC NUMBER OF PARAMETERS TO A FUNCTION?
