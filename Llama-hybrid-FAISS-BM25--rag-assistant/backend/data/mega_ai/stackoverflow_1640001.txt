Natural language software does its magic by leveraging corpora and the statistics they provide. You'll need to tell nltk about some German corpus to help it tokenize German correctly. I believe the EUROPARL corpus might help get you going. See nltk.corpus.europarl_raw and this answer for example configuration. Also, consider tagging this question with "nlp".
