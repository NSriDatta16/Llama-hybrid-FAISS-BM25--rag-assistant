Mobile Web App Framework in Java or PHP

I am working on a web service for which we have already developed apps for iPhone and Android. To cover the rest of the web enabled phones, temporarily or otherwise, we are going to use a web app. We would like the app to conform nicely to each device as well as cover as many devices as possible including low end devices. Can anyone point me to a framework for such an application, if such a thing exists. What I'm looking for is device/user agent detection and perhaps a boilerplate template for a wide range of mobile devices. Either Java or PHP wil do. I'm looking for the best solution between the two. Thanks
