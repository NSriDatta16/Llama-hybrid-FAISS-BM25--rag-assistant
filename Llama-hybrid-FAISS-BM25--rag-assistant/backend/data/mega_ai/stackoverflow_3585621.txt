Well, the high level idea is that you need to add mouse state to your program. Your remoteDesktop will need to keep the state of the mouse. private boolean mouseDown = false; Then, on mouse press and release actions you need to set the flag appropriately. Then, you need to add logic in the mouse move code. if (mouseDown) handelDrag(); else handleMove(); That's the general idea of how I would go about it.
