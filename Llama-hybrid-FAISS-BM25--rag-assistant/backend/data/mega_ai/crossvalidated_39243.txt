How does one interpret SVM feature weights?

I am trying to interpret the variable weights given by fitting a linear SVM. (I'm using scikit-learn ): from sklearn import svm svm = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') svm.fit(features, labels) svm.coef_ I cannot find anything in the documentation that specifically states how these weights are calculated or interpreted. Does the sign of the weight have anything to do with class?
