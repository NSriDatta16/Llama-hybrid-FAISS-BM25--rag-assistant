Confusion on result of K-Fold Cross Validation and Independent Test set

I am relatively new in Machine Learning. I am using Random Forest and SVM for a project. Where I did a 10-fold cross-validation on the train set. which gives the following K-Fold Average Score: Random Forest : 0.8716 & SVM : 0.8665 On the other hand, when I tested with the independent test set it gives the following accuracy: Random Forest : 93.63% SVM : 90.47% I am confused is it ok? I mean can the test accuracy be greater than K-fold? Is it what underfitting called. Please help. TIA.
