LSTM model for many time series

Let's say one has many time series for which one wants to build a predictive model (based on LSTM). Which of the following cases would be more optimal and why? 1) building one model for all the time series in which each time series has a categorical label which will be included in the model by one hot encoding. 2) building individual models for each time series.
