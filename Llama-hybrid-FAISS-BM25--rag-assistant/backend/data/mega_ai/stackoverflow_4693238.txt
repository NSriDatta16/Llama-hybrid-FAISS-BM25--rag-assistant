This is an infuriating problem for my web app written in PHP. I ended up searching the string in question for any instance of 'w:' and 'StartFragment' using strpos() , and if I found either one, I called the PHP function strip_tags(); I then alert the user that formatting was lost and suggest that formatting be done within the app, and not in MS Word. Totally imperfect, yeah, but works for my users.
