Your first option should be to check if the existing application that you are enhancing already uses something to access MySQL. If it does then just leverage that. It will avoid compatibility issues. Otherwise, if you want to do something that is very scala-like, you should have a look at scala-query at http://github.com/szeiger/scala-query . You can also leverage any Java ORM. With Scala you can tap into existing framework and libraries. Finally, if you just want something that doesn't require you to download many things and to sift through documentation, you can use straight JDBC (search for "JDBC MySQL" in google or on SO): val s = conn.createStatement() s.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMP") val rs = s.getResultSet() while (rs.next()) { ... } rs.close() s.close()
