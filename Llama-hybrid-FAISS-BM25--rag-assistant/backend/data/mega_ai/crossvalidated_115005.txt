Double Seasonal Holt winter method using dshw

I have a two weeks data set which have intraday and intraweek cycles so I decided to use dshw in r. Although it gave me a pretty good MAE and RMSE, when I wanted to see SSE, it showed me a null value. Does it mean that Im using a wrong model for my dataset?I only used auto.arima command to see the best fitted model but the recommended model did not provide any seasonality values while the time series plot clearly shows seasonality in hours of a day and days of a week. Hence I switched to dshw. On the other hand, what is the commend to find predictions for the next cycles? I tried command "predict" but it did not work. Thanks
