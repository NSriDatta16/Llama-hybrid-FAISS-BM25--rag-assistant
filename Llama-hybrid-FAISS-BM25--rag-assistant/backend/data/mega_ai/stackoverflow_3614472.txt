Is there a way to detect that I'm in a Selenium Webdriver page from JavaScript?

I'd like to suppress the initialization of TinyMCE inside my tests and can do this easily if the JavaScript can detect that I'm running inside a Selenium-automated page. So, is there some JavaScript code that I can use to detect the Selenium driver? Alternatively, how can I extend the user agent string to include a pattern that I can detect from JavaScript? If it really matters, I'm running this through Cucumber and Capybara on Mac OS X.
