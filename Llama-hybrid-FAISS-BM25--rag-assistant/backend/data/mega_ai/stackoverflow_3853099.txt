Select all the agents that are not in the list of agents who have worked in location 51 : SELECT * FROM agents WHERE agents.agentid NOT IN ( SELECT agents.agentid FROM agents LEFT JOIN schedule USING (agentid) LEFT JOIN projects USING (projectid) WHERE (projects.locationid = 51) GROUP BY agentid ORDER BY agentid )
