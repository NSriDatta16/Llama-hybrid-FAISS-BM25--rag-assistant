Is it correct to standardise (z-score) features within samples before PCA?

Given a data set where we have different measured features in the same units for each subject. For example, numbers of different cell types (features) in a tumour (subject), where we have n tumours and m features. If we want to see which cell types (features) explain most of the variation across tumours (subjects), is it correct to z-score the values of the features within subjects (i.e. have each subject distribution of values centred around 0)? Thanks.
