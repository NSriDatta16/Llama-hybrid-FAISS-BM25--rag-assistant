The cutoff function returns a 0/1 matrix by selecting a specified share (threshold) of most important features from a matrix of feature importance metrics (feature.set); 1 corresponds to a selected feature, 0 - to excluded. In your example, the first column should be used for the required information; namely rnd_86775 can be forecasted using the first lag of rnd_92909 (rnd_92909.l1), second lag of rnd_86775 (rnd_86775.l2) and third lag of rnd_87171 (rnd_87171.l3). Generally, the package is focused to forecasting of all components of the multivariate time series at the same time - e.g., using the vector autoregressive model: fs Similarly, the selected features can be used as inputs for ANN, KNN, etc.
