Rails Alternative to The Django admin panel / CRUD View Generator?

I am currently trying to decide between Rails and Django.. At the moment the I'm finding ruby much more elegant so my only reason for considering Django is the admin panel.. I have no experience of either but i have to develop an application fast to meet a deadline. Is there a way in rails to generate a (close to production ready) set of views for all of your CRUD actions based on your model like the admin panel in django? (ie it would look at your model and see that you have a person that belongs to a group and generate a dropdown for that grouop on the create person view)? If not which is the quickest way (without manually writing) to get a first draft of all the CRUD views? Thanks, Daniel
