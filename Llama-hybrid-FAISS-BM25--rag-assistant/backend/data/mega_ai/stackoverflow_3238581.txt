I am aware of the problem where pickle can't store a generated or dynamic class. I solved this by rigging in my dynamic type into the modules dict like so: new_class = type(name, (models.Model,), attrs) mod = sys.modules[new_class.__module__] mod.__dict__[new_class.__name__] = new_class It's FAR from a clean or elegant solution, so if someone can think of a more django-friendly way to make this happen, I am all ears. However, the above code does work.
