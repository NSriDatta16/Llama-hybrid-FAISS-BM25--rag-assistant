Java - why are 2 versions shown?

I would like to know which version of java is installed on my ubuntu system. The java -version command shows: cmdprompt$ java -version java version "1.6.0_20" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 16.3-b01, mixed mode, sharing) However the following cmd shows 2 Java versions installed? What are these? cmdprompt$ ls -l $(type -path -all java) lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 2010-02-28 14:21 /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 2010-06-29 22:36 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java -> ../jre/bin/java How do I ensure there is ONLY ONE version of JAVA is installed - so that there are no build conflicts?
