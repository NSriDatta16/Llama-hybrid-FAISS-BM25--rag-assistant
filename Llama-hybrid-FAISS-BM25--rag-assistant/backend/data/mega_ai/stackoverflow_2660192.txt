My own thought: People do follow fashion and IT is no exception. Nobody dares to question the fundamentals until some Gurus have themselves interest to do so. For example in the case of Java nobody dared to question EJB until Rod Johnson came along with another framework which he said was inspired by .NET pragmatism. And now .NET is becoming itself more and more frameworklish with EF.
