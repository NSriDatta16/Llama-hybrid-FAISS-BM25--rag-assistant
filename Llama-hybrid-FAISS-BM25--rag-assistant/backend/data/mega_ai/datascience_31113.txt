Validation showing huge fluctuations. What could be the cause?

I'm training a CNN for a 3-class image classification problem. My training loss decreased smoothly, which is the expected behaviour. However, my validation loss shows a lot of fluctuation. Is this something that I should be worried about, or should I just pick the model which scores the best on my performance measure (accuracy)? Additional info: I'm fine-tuning the last layer of a Resnet-18 that was pre-trained on ImageNet data in PyTorch. I must note that I'm using a weighted loss function for the training phase since my data is highly unbalanced. To plot the losses, however, I use the unweighted loss as to be able to compare the validation and training loss. I would use the unweighted loss, were it not that the distributions of the training dataset and validation dataset are somewhat different (they are both highly unbalanced however).
