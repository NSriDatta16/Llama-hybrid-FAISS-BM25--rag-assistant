Why and when to have multiple build agents?

Consider TFS 2010's ability for a Build Controller to have 1+ build agents. Since builds are a subjective topic to the team/environment, consider an environment where builds are performed on commit/check-in. Each Project Collection will have 10+ Team Projects, but perhaps only 1 or 2 are being committed to in a day. When should a TFS administrator consider creating a new build agent? Do multiple agents run in parallel? When a single agent is defined to a Build Controller, does it run serially? MSDN states: "if you set up your agents to have specialized capabilities..." . What does this mean? A technology/platform differentiator? How can you setup your agents to have specialized capabilities? How can 'tagging' build agents be used effectively in an environment where builds are (typically) performed on each check-in.
