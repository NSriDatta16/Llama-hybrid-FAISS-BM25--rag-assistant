How to approximate constant parameters of any generalized function?

I am new to Data Science and Machine Learning. I am trying to approximate constant parameters of any generalized not necessarily polynomial function given the input, desired output and the form of the function using neural network. Is there any other way to do it using neural network or should I use some other technique? For example this is one of the functions whose parameters par6 and par7 I am trying to approximate: I have the values for x and f2(x) . Any help will be appreciated. Thank You.
