C++ Design pattern for Search and Replace

I have big paragraph with some special characters as %1 , %2, %3 I need to know if there is any design pattern to replace those with proper values and create final paragraph. For Example: Following is my static paragraph. %1 is beautiful country , %2 is the capital of %1, %1 national language is %3. I get values of %1,%2, %3 by some source.
