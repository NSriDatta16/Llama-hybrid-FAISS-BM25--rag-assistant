You can put some numbers to answering this question. In general, k-means and kNN are fairly old algorithms, which may be one of the reasons for this. For k-means, I reference you to Complexity and this paper Time Complexity of K-Means and K-Medians Clustering Algorithms in Outliers Detection . There is als a more friendly post The Cost Function of K-Means Vanilla kNN, for large data sets, has a large computational cost . There is an old post on kNN complexity: k-NN computational complexity You can then compare that with something like recurrent Neural Networks. Here is a paper on the complexity analysis Bounds on the complexity of recurrent neural network implementations of finite state machines
