Note that for a Bayesian*, their prior distribution on a parameter represents their prior knowledge/beliefs about the parameter(s) of interest. The prior on P(Head) would normally be a distribution with support on [0,1]. It might well be centered at $\pi_H=0.5$ , or it might not. It might have mixture of a spike at $\pi_H=0.5$ plus some continuous distribution around it, or it might be pure-continuous. It could be a single spike at $\pi_H=\frac12$ . It's perfectly possible for an individual Bayesian to have a prior distribution that has $0$ density on a possible value for the parameter; they can exclude the actual case, if under their knowledge or belief, such a value is not possible - a Bayesian can have false beliefs. However, a wiser Bayesian might seek to not exclude the possibility of a coin that has heads (or tails) on both sides and place a tiny amount of the prior on such possibilities. A suspicious Bayesian may well put a substantial amount of their prior on such cases. In short, yes, a Bayesian's prior belief can fail to accord any probability to a situation that actually occurs. For example, games with much randomness like poker and games that are more complexity based like chess -- would we treat what makes them "interesting" (I know there are other interesting aspects to these games) as the same sort of thing? I'm not sure I follow what sort of model you're supposing** - what the response is and what information might be in the model. In general there's little reason to suppose similar models for the two unless your model is extremely abstract. * at least for most varieties of Bayesian ** nor how it relates to the title question, to be honest
