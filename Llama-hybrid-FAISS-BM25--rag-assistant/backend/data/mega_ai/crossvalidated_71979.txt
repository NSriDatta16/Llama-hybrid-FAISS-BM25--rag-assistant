One form of inference is based on the random assignment of experimental treatments, & not on random sampling from a population (even hypothetically). Oscar Kempthorne was a proponent. The first example in Edgington (1995), Randomization Tests illustrates the approach well. A researcher obtains ten subjects, divides them into two groups at random, allocates treatment $A$ to one group & $B$ to the other, measures their responses & calculates Student's t-statistic for the difference in group means. Rather than using normal sampling theory to assess significance he calculates $t$ for every possible way the treatments might have been assigned (there are 252 of them); then, noting that each permutation is equally probable under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, he sees that nine give a higher value of $t$ than that observed & calculates a p-value of $10/252=0.04$. "Obtains" here, as very often, could mean anything at all—perhaps the first ten undergraduates at his lecture to put up their hands were picked—but with this analysis there's no need to maintain the pretence that the subjects have been randomly sampled from the population of interest (the downside is that any generalization beyond these ten is extra-statistical). Prediction is another area where you're not necessarily formulating propositions about populations. (I don't know that everyone would want to call prediction "inference", but there's Geisser (1993), Predictive Inference: An Introduction ). Often prediction follows from a fitted population model, but not always; e.g. @Matt's classification example, model averaging (Bayesian or based on Akaike weights), or forecasting algorithms such as exponential smoothing. NB I think "inferential vs descriptive statistics" more often refers to the discipline Statistics, rather than to quantities calculated from samples. There's no essential difference between an inferential & a descriptive statistic; as @Jeremy has pointed out, it's a matter of what use you're putting it to.
