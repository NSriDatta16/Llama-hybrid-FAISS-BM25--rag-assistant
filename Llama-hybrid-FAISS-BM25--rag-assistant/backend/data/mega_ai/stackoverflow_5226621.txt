Is it possible to typcast TFormBorderStyle property to Integer and vise versa?

It looks like I could use the RTTI to convert the enumerated type of a TFormBorderStyle property to String ans store it in my IniFile, and vise versa. However, I assumed I could typecast it back and forth from integer as well, but it does not seem to work. Why? var Border: Integer = 3; procedure TfrmMain.FormCreate(Sender: TObject); begin BorderStyle:= TFormBorderStyle(Border); pnlHeader.Visible:= ShowHeader; btnConfigure.Visible:= Configure; pnlFooter.Visible:= ShowFooter; end;
