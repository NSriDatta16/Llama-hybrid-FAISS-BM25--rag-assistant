Your confusion is coming from the definition of discrete random variables . I will use two examples to illustrate. Example 1. Assume you can receive $X$ mails a day, $X$ is a discrete number that can be $0,1,2,\cdots$. Assume you collected 1 week data, and it is $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)$. So, the expected value / average is $4$. So you know the physical meaning is on average you will receive $4$ mails a day. This is the case that the expected value has intuitive physical meaning. Example 2. Assume there is an animal in the room, but you do not if it is a cat or dog or pig. Let's use $\Omega \in \{\text{cat,dog,pig}\}$ to represent the possible outcome. Note, As @Glen_b, @whuber, and @Aksakal mentioned, we cannot think $\Omega$ is a random variable, because iti s not a real number. So, we need to use some mapping to build random variables. Let us use $Y \in \{1,2,3\}$ to be a discrete random variable and represent $\{\text{cat,dog,pig}\}$, and you collect $7$ data points, they are $(1,1,1,1,1,1,2)$ so the expected value is $1.142$. Here is where your confusion comes from: what does this number mean? This number does not have physical meaning, i.e., which animal it is. To conclude, you confusion comes from the definition of discrete random variable and the expectation. The expectation does always have concrete physical meaning.
