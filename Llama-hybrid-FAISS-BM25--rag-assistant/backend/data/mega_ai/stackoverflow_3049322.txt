If a table has six columns and all of them are searchable, should i index all of them or none of them Are you searching on a field by field basis or are some searches using multiple fields? Which fields are most being searched on? What are the field types? (Index works better on INTs than on VARCHARs for example) Have you tried using EXPLAIN on the queries that are being run? What are the negetive performance impacts of indexing UPDATEs and INSERTs will be slower. There's also the extra storage space requirments, but that's usual unimportant these days. If i have a VARCHAR 2500 column which is searchable from parts of my site, should i index it No, unless it's UNIQUE (which means it's already indexed) or you only search for exact matches on that field (not using LIKE or mySQL's fulltext search). Generally I put an index on any fields that i will be searching or selecting using a WHERE clause I'd normally index the fields that are the most queried, and then INTs/BOOLEANs/ENUMs rather that fields that are VARCHARS. Don't forget, often you need to create an index on combined fields, rather than an index on an individual field. Use EXPLAIN, and check the slow log.
