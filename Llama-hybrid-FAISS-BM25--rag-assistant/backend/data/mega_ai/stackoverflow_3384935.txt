Safari browser ignoring my no-cache

I'm unable to force a page to always expire in Safari. Chrome, IE and Firefox are good citizens but Safari is cruising along just fine with ignoring the following ASP.NET code: // Expire immediately Response.Expires = 0; Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Response.AppendHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); Any recommendations?
