If you don't have natural alignment in the structures, compilers will usually insert padding so that alignment is proper. If, however, you use pragmas to "pack" the structures (remove the padding), there can be very harmful side affects. On PowerPCs, non-aligned floats generate an exception. If you're working on an embedded system that doesn't handle that exception, you'll get a reset. If there is a routine to handle that interrupt, it can DRASTICALLY slow down your code, because it'll use a software routine to work around the misalignment, which will silently cripple your performance.
