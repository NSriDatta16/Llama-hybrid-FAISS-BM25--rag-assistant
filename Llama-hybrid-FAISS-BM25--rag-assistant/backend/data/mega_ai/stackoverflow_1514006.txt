How to install a package in LaTeX

I'm fairly new to LaTeX, but have been using my own document template for a couple of years now to do basic typesetting. What I want to do is to add the pst-gantt package from PSTricks. I have never installed a new package before, but want it available to all of my projects. For the sake of completeness, I am running OSX10.6 and use TeXShop to edit text, however am slowly switching over to TextEdit. Anyway, I have googled and the results all say to use .dtx and .ins files (which I cannot find). If someone can give me some pointers as to what I need to install (do I need PSTricks first?) and how to go about doing it, that would be great. Thanks
