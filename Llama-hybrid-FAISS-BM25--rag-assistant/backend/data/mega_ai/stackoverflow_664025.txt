Group List of nodes into Tree of nodes with XSL

I'm parsing a huge word file with Test descriptions, and have a problem of scope of nodes. Word basically creates a list of paragraphs and I want to group them into a parent node. So for each node 'A' I want to group all the following nodes up to the next node 'A' into 'A'. How can this be done with XSL? Example: I've gotten to : But need: Thank you!
