My confusion stems from when it is appropriate to take the first seasonal difference. In the literature, taking the first seasonal difference seems to be the correct way to handle seasonality. Seasonal differencing should be applied when the series is seasonally integrated. That happens when the time series is generated from alternating random walks (one per period). As a consequence, any two consecutive observations of the time series diverge (!) under seasonal integration, which is often hard to justify. Thus I would think twice before applying seasonal differencing. Regarding diminishing seasonality, I think seasonal AR or MA terms in the SARIMA model might work fine. But I am not quite sure. You could try auto.arima in R to see what SARIMA model is suggested and how the model residuals look; perhaps they will be adequate.
