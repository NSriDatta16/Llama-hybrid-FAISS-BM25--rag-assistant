Let $X$ be a random variable with density $f$, and let $A$ be an event that $X$ takes a value in a certain set $W$. $$A = X \in W. $$ The probability of the event $A$ is $P(A)$. However, this can be rewritten as, \begin{align*} P(A) & = P(X \in W)\\ & = \int_{X \in W} f(x) dx\\ & = \int I(X \in W) f(x) dx\\ & = E\left[I(X \in W) \right]\\ & = E\left[I(A) \right] \end{align*} So the probability of observing a certain event A can be written as the long-run average. However, this has nothing really to do with frequentist statistics. This is just a property of probability. EDIT The differentiation I am trying to make here is that probability addresses an event and expectation addresses a random variable. The occurrence of an event is a random variable. For example, $A$ is the event, $I(A)$ is the random variable that indicates whether $A$ occurred or not. Thus, the chance of $A$ occurring can be rewritten as the expected value of the random variable $I(A)$.
