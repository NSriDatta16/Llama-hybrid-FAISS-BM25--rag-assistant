Try some kind of regularized linear regression, like ridge regression or lasso regression. EDIT: You have 40 different tags, and 5000 articles. You want to predict the number of page views based on which tags the article has. You ask for a simple/straightforward statistical model to get started with this excercise. You have 40 binary explanatory variables (tags) and one dependent variable (number of page views). You cannot have anything simpler than a linear regression. Since the number of explanatory variables (40) is much less than the number of examples (5000), you would have a reasonable performance even without regularization. Since the number of page views can probably change by orders of magnitude (it is quite possible that one article would receive 1000 times more views than another one), it would be reasonable to use log(page_views) or log(page_views+1) as the dependent variable, rather than just raw page_views. After you have done this, in order to improve your model you may want to try also 40*39/2=780 combinations of two tags as additional explanatory variables, in which case you might significantly benefit from regularization. There are many other approaches to the problem, like neural nets, or random forest. But they are far from simple.
