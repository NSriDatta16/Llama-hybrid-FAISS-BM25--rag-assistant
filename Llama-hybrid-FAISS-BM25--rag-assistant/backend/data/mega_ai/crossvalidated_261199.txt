Sparse data structures conserve RAM. Algorithms which respect sparsity will have speedup essentially proportional to the amount of sparsity. Using PCA to rank-reduce a sparse data set is as simple as writing a routine to do power iteration and Gram-Schmidt (because you only want the $k$ basis vectors corresponding to the largest $k$ eigenvalues, not all of them, you need only do computations to estimate $k$ orthogonal vectors).
