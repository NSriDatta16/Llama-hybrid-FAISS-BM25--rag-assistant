I think it's mostly a stylistic difference. Generally you talk about sufficiency with regard to a parameter $\theta$, but if $\theta$ somehow indexes the full family of distributions $\mathcal{P} = \{ P_\theta : \theta \in \Theta \}$, then you could just as easily say a sufficient statistic for $\theta$ is sufficient for the entire model. I wouldn't pay too much attention to any particular authors preferences and just remember the important parts from the formal definition about conditioning, and understand intuitively what sufficiency means. The last corollary is of course true but not very interesting. It's saying that an ordered sample contains all the information from an i.i.d. sample about the distribution $F$ from which it came, which is pretty much a tautology.
