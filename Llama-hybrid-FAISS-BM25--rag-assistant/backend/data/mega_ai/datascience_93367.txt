Neural network for time series forecasting with an auxiliary data

Lets say we have 2 data sets. First is the close price time series data set and we want to predict future values of it. The second is volumes of each price from the first data set and we do not want to predict on it but use this data to help predict future price values. What kind of neural networks is suitable for this task? In my sight this may be an LSTM with some changes. Advise me please.
