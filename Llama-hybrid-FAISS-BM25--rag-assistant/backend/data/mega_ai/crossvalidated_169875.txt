You have a discrete variable with, in your example, very small frequencies. It would be fine to show relative frequencies so long as you made clear the small sample size. I suggest that it would be nevertheless be simpler to show sample frequencies directly: In this case we hope that people are able to look at the graph and think (e.g.) 3 out of 7 were on Monday, and so forth. Small children are often encouraged to do this, which presumably explains why it is sometimes thought too challenging for business people. I am happy, personally, with the idea that this is a histogram, as it shows the frequency distribution of a numeric variable. The fact that the variable is discrete and not continuous does not worry me. As a convention to underline discreteness many people like to leave some space between the bars. Some even like to show spikes. I have often done either. Here there is no signal what the data are, beyond showing car makes. Suppose that the data are daily sales or numbers of cars serviced. If there is an idea that some business is open for part of the day only, then spaces between bars convey a fair picture. Conversely, if the days were touching 24 hour periods, then I think the bars are better shown as touching. Do not be surprised if some people prefer to call this a bar chart, not a histogram. Graphically a histogram is just a bar chart, but in many statistical discussions pedagogic tradition and minor snobbery join forces to insist that a histogram showing a frequency distribution is not a bar chart at all! All that said, I imagine that your real data set is larger than your example, so it might well be in order to show relative frequencies as well as frequencies (counts). It is hard to get people to agree on whether the numeric information should be given (a) on the graph (b) in a table (c) in accompanying text, and indeed any or even all could make sense, depending on the data, the readership and the goals of he analysis. Without more said, the underlying probabilities are to be estimated as the sample proportions.
