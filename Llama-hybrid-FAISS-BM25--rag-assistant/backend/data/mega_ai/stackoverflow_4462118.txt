predict.svm does not predict new data

unfortunately I have problems using predict() in the following simple example: library(e1071) x The result is as follows: > predict(mod, newdata = test) 1 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 Can anybody explain why predict() only gives the fitted values of the training sample (x,y) and does not care about the test-data? Thank you very much for your help! Richard
