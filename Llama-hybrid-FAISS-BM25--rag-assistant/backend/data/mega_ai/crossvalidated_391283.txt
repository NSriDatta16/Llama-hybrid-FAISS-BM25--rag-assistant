Dummy variables with dummyVars() - return to original columns

For building a machine learning model I used dummyVars() function to create the dummy variables for building a model. dummies_model I am now deploying the model but I want to return to the user the table with the original columns (not the factor columns). Is there a function that returns the original columns and not the dummy ones created by dummyVars() ?
