One-Factor Experiments with n Levels. Why Anova and Not Regression

Reviewing old notes. We have an experiment to see whether temperature levels affect output ( number of items.) So we consider 4 levels of temperature $100 , 150, 200, 250$ and we evalue for each, the number of items in the output. We repeat each experiment 6 times at each of the mentioned temperatures and each time we get the average output at each temperature. We analyze output using Anova. Question Why not just consider regressing output Y on temperature X using the averages as values instead of Anova? Is one way better than the other?
