The mean known as Dodonov's mean seems to fulfill what you are asking for: in this, every data-point is assigned a weight based on the inverse average distance to each of the other data points. Let $w_i = {{n - 1} \over {\sum^{n}_{j-1}|x_i-x_j|}}$ be the weight for the i'th datapoint. Then the Dodonov-mean is defined as $\mu_D = {{\sum^n_{n=1}w_ix_i} \over{\sum^n_{n=1}w_i}}$ The paper by the Dodonovs is located here .
