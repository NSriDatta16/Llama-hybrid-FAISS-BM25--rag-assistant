ung Hospital, and Gurugram Civil Hospital. Following the completion of pan-India validation, Garbhini-GA2 will be implemented in clinics throughout the country. The Ministry of Science and Technology's Department of Biotechnology provided financing for the research, with additional support from the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IIT Madras) and the Centre for Integrative Biology and Systems Medicine (IIT Madras). In order to support healthy aging, constructive lifestyle modifications, and psycho-social wellbeing, Wipro and the Centre for Brain Research at IISc partnered in May 2024 to create an AI-based personal care engine that will consider a person's past medical history, desired health state, and behavioral responses to offer personalized help with chronic disease prevention and treatment. Researchers from St. John's Hospital and IIIT-B are focusing on using computer vision for early detection of autism. Mobility In an effort to improve road safety and decrease fatalities by half, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari inaugurated Intelligent Solutions for Road Safety through Technology and Engineering (iRASTE) under Mission Zero on September 11, 2021. The pilot project will run for two years in Nagpur. Intel, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, Central Road Research Institute, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Nagpur Municipal Corporation are part of the pilot project. It is focusing on vehicle safety, mobility analysis, and infrastructure safety. To improve vehicle safety, NMC will outfit its fleet of vehicles with advanced driver-assistance systems and collision avoidance systems. They will also be equipped with sensors which will continuously monitor the road network's dynamic risks for mobility analysis, mapping the city into three zones: white (normal), grey (accident could happen), and black (accident has already happened). The data will be gathered by Intel AI Center at IIIT-H for monitoring and fixing the grey and black zones. MINRO at IIIT-B is working on traffic analysis of Indian road conditions, analyzing traffic data, and using data for multimodal transport to make recommendations about the locations of rail transit and bus stations. Government In 2021, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs introduced the first phase of MCA21 V3.0. It will allow for the electronic filing of documents under the corporate law and public access to corporate information. AI will be utilized by the platform to gather, organize, and classify stakeholder comments and inputs and produce analytical reports that will facilitate speedy policy choices. With assistance from Google, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare and the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence created Krishi 24/7, the first AI-powered automated agricultural news monitoring and analysis tool. Through better decision-making, Krishi 24/7 will support the identification of valuable news, provide timely notifications, and respond quickly to safeguard farmers' interests and advance sustainable agricultural growth. The application converts news articles into English after scanning them in several languages. It ensures that the ministry is informed in a timely manner about pertinent occurrences that are published online by extracting key information from news items, including the headline, crop name, event type, date, location, severity, summary, and source link. The National Center for Disease Control has effectively implemented a comparable automated surveillance and analysis tool for disease outbreaks. As part of the Safe City initiative, 1,000 AI cameras with facial recognition were placed at a cost of â‚¹96 crore in Lucknow's commercial districts, colleges, hostels, large crossings, and public gathering spots. By integrating with the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System, the cameras will detect suspicious movement of individuals by comparing their faces to a police database,
