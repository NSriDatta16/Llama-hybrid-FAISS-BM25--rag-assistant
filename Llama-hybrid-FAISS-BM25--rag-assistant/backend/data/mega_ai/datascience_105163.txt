It's a quite complex problem, there are certainly many ways to look at it. A simple non-ML option that comes to mind is to just use the history of the "jack" and the product: for every jack and/or every product, calculate for example the average amount of "over-requesting" in the past. If this average is higher than some threshold, flag the next request as a potential "over-request". Now as a regression problem, as far as I understand, it's necessary to consider both the jack and the product as independent variables. So I don't think that the same jack with two different products would count as a repeated measure. However in the history there might be some instances with same jack and same product, once with "over-requesting" and other not. This would be more like a repeated measure as far as I know, but anyway it doesn't really matter: linear regression or any other regression method can deal with inconsistencies in the data, as long as there is some general pattern. But I doubt that linear regression would be flexible enough for the variations in this kind of data, I'd suggest something decision tree regression (M5P) or SVM regression (SVR).
