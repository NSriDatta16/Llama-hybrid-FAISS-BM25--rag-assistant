autoregressive time series issue understanding expectation

Consider the following question How is it obvious that $\mathbb{E}(X_t) = 0$ ? Is it because of the following? Recursively we find that $\mathbb{E}(X_t) = \phi \mathbb{E}(X_{t-1}) = \phi^2 \mathbb{E}(X_{t-2}) = \phi^{t-1} \mathbb{E}(X_{1})$ . So now we see that for $\mathbb{E}(X_t) = \mathbb{E}(X_s)$ for all $s (a requirement for stationarity) either $\phi=1$ or $\mathbb{E}(X_t) = 0$ we cannot have the former since $|\phi| thus we have $\mathbb{E}(X_t) = 0$ .
