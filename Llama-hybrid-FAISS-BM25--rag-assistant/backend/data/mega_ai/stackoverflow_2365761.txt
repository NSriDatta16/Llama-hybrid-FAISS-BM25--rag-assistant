The answer is "no" , but it has nothing to do with your app being WPF or not: With software like Daemon Tools it is trivial for users to make an image of your CD appear to be the actual physical CD. You could go to extreme lengths and custom-manufacture your CDs with built-in microprocessors that execute a portion of your application logic and communicate optically via the CD drive's built in laser. Your hardware could have all sorts of protection mechanisms and multiple layers of security, but you still could not guarantee that the logic could not be reverse-engineered using chemicals, electron microscopes, etc. Consider the recent TPM hack to understand why this is so. On the other hand, if you just want to discourage the casual user, DriveInfo.DriveType is probably your best bet.
