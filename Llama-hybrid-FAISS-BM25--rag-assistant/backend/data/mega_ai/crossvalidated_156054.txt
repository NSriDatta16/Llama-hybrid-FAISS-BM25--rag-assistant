In a narrow sense, you are correct. Power is the chance to correctly reject a false null hypothesis, so you had a small chance but were able to do it anyway. However, from a bayesian belief updating perspective, "reducing power implies reducing the belief shift that is warranted from observing a statistically significant result (McClelland et al. 2015)." Think of it this way: if I told you I surveyed 30,000 people from the general public and found that, contrary to sales figures, people tend to like Pepsi more than Coke, that would be very compelling. I found a result after studying 1% of a population (i.e. the US general public). It is likely to generalize to the larger population. If I surveyed 7 people and found the same thing, even if it was statistically significant, I wouldn't convince anyone. You can argue a lot of reasons for that (you can't get a representative sample, ANOVA/regression assumptions may not be met etc.), but what's important is that high power means highly persuasive (and you should be as critical or more of your results as those you are trying to convince). For the Bayesian mathematics as well as further explanation, you can check out any of the following. Abelson, R. P. (2012). Statistics as principled argument. Psychology Press. Brinberg, D., Lynch Jr, J. G., & Sawyer, A. G. (1992). Hypothesized and confounded explanations in theory tests: A Bayesian analysis. Journal of Consumer Research, 139-154. McClelland, G., Lynch, J. G., Irwin, J. R., Spiller, S. A., & Fitzsimons, G. J. (2015). Median Splits, Type II Errors, and False Positive Consumer Psychology: Don't Fight the Power. Type II Errors, and False Positive Consumer Psychology: Don't Fight the Power (March 10, 2015). Also, Ioannidis (2005) provides some compelling arguments to low power results reflecting type I errors even in the absence of p-hacking and other biases that often result from low power (and the paper is open access in case you don't work for a university or something similar!).
