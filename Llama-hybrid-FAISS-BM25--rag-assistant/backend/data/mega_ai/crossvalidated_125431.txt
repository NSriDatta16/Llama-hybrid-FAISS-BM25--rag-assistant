Which mean value should I use

I am to test the transformational shifts in three different directions for 3 different imaging techniques in a group of 30 patients. I am trying to prove one is not statistically different to the gold standard. Should I get the mean shift values in each direction for the 270 images OR should I get the mean shift per patient, then the mean of those 30 patients?VERY confused. If I use the 270 figures I get very good normal distribution on histograms and pp plot, however when finding the average per patient and getting the average of that I am getting the mean of 30 mean figures, and the distribution is no longer normal!
