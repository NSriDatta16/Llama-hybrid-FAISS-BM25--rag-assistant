I think we see the same typo: The formula should be $$ p(\{x_1,\cdots,x_N\})=\prod_{i=1}^{N}p(x_i|x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}) $$ Confirming: the 2017 article explicitly says (section 2.1, 2nd paragraph) that probability is based on prior measurements, so yes, this was a typo. Note that this arises from "unrolling" a joint probability distribution using Bayes theorem: $P(a,b,c)=P(c|a,b)P(a,b)=P(c|a,b)P(b|a)P(a).$ No approximations or assumptions are used; this is an exact relation.
