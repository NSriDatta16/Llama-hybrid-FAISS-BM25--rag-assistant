How regression coefficients change when shifting the scale of the response variable

I am running a regression with y: a 7 point index ranging from -3 to 3, x: binary indicator (0,1) of second wave of data collection. When I fit this regression, I get the following equation: y = 0.61 + 0.21x To comment on the % of change between wave 1 (x = 0) and wave 2 (x = 1) of data collection, I divide 0.21/0.61 = 34% However, when I shift the scale of y (by adding 3) to range from 0 to 5, I get the following equation: y = 3.61 + 0.21x See here, the coefficient of x did not change although the scale of y has shifted. Now the % of change in the average score across the 2 waves is way smaller 0.21/3.61 = 6% What am I missing here? Why has the percentage of change shifted drastically (from 34% to just 6%? Is it normal that the coefficient of x didn't change although the scale of y has changed?
