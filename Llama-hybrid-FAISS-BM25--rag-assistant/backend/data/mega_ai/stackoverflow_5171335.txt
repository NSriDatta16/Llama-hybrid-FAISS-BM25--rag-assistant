JAXB+JPA+JAX-RS, JAXB Annotation problem

Hello and excuse my english! Suppose I have this entity with this namedquery that select the name column with the jaxb annotations. @Entity @NamedQueries({ @NamedQuery(name = "Person.selectAll", query = "SELECT p FROM Form p"), @NamedQuery(name = "Person.selectName", query = "SELECT p.id,p.name FROM Form p"), }); @XmlRootElement public class Person implements Serializable { @Id @Column private int id; @XmlElement private String name; @Column @XmlElement private String surname; .. } Suppose now i have a Rest method that executes the namedquery Person.selectName and returns XML or JSON code of the response. @GET @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) @Path("/list") public List getList() { //here i execute the namedquery Person.selectName List persons = executeNamedQuery().getList(); return persons; } Now the problem is during the marshalling because there's not a @XmlRootElement annotation for the name field. I would the output like value1 value2 without the tags only when the namedquery Person.selectName is executed. And i can't use the @XmlTransient because the namedquery "selectAll" wants that one. How to solve in "elegant manner"?
