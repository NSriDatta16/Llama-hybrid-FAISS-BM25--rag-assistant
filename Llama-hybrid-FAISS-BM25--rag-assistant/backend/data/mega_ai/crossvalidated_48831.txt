There's Tukey's suggestion of a minimum of 5 observations per mean parameter (he also suggested 25 observations per variance or covariance parameter). I don't recall the exact location of that suggestion, sorry. But it really depends on the accuracy you want. If you want to be able to get a reasonable idea of actual effects sizes, this suggests that for a logistic regression something more like 50 observations per parameter might be more in the ballpark. This has sample-size-related rules of thumb; if you can specify the required information you might be able to figure out what you need.
