Why would I bother to design clear and explicit error messages for the cases where the visitor who uses correctly the website will never have? If everyone used the web correctly, we'd never need to have validation. As Ronald Reagan once said, "Trust, but verify". Put in server-side validation for the length of fields. Put in validation to make sure there aren't any XSS or SQL Injection attacks. It's not the people who use your site correctly that you have to worry about, it's the ones that use it maliciously.
