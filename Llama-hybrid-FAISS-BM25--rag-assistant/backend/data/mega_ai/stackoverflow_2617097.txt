Probably because your HTML is so invalid. Fix that and your problems will disappear... Password: To your comment: HTML isn't technically case sensitive, but you should never ever use uppercase for tag/attribute names. That's just bad practice. I think the reason it sometimes worked is because you had an open paragraph tag, but never closed it, so Chrome was probably sometimes placing the paragraph outside of your form.
