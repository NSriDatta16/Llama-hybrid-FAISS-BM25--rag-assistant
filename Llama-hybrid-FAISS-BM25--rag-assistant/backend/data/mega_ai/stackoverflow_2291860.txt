You set the default storage engine in the MySQL configuration, but that will only apply to tables that are created after that point. You'll need to alter any tables that aren't InnoDB manually like this. If you have lots of data, this can take a while because it will create the new table, insert all the records and then drop the old table leaving this one in it's place. ALTER TABLE table_name ENGINE = INNODB;
