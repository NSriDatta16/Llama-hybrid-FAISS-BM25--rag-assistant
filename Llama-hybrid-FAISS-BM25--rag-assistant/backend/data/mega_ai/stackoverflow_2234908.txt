Which control is used as editor in mac mail - message body?

What is the control used as editor to compose messages in mac mail? My guess is TextView but I cannot get: How will I show icon in message body when some document is dragged and dropped in it, as in mac mail. Right now it only shows path of document! How will I show vertical bars to represent different quote levels?? From this question I got the clue that they can have used WebView in mac mail, but this post is still has not been answered. Can anyone suggest some idea or link or code through which I can implement - formatting messages like in mac mail?
