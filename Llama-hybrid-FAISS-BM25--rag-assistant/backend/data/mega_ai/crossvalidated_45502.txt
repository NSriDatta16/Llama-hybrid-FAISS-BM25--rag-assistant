AcF and Stationarity

Very often in time series literature, it is remarked that if a series is non-stationary the AcF will decrease to zero very slowly while the opposite occurs for a stationary series. What's the basis for this "rule of thumb"? I know that for a strictly stationary process the autocorrelation is independent of time, whereas for a wide-sense stationary process the autocorrelation is a function of the time lag but these don't explain the "rule of thumb".
