One of the primary differences between new and malloc is that new will call the object's constructor. Another difference is that new will throw an exception (may be circumvented by a compiler pragma ) if the memory cannot be succesfully allocated. The malloc may cause a system signal to be generated. Although some C++ libraries implement new by calling malloc . There may be a few instances where objects need to be dynamically allocated without invoking their constructors. In over 20 years, I haven't come across any (not even in the embedded systems arena).
