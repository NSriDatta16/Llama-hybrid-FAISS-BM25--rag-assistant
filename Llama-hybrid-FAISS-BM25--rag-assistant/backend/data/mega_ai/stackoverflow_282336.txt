You should really think hard about whether you really want to design, document and maintain your own protocol or use something that is already existing. It is probable there is already a documented protocol that matches your needs. Depending on what you are doing it will probably look overkill at first and implementing all the spec will look tedious and a lot less fun than writing your own but if you intend for your application to still be actively developed in a few years it should save you a lot of time and money to use something that already exist and is known by third parties. Besides, if you can use an existing library for that protocol, the implementation part should be a lot faster. Designing new protocol is more fun than implementing one but less than maintaining one as you have to live with all the defects. No protocol is perfect but if you have never designed one you can be assured you will make more mistake designing it than the people who designed the existing well known protocol you could use instead. In short, leverage what already exists whenever possible.
