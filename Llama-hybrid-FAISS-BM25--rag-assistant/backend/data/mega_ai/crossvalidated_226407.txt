The Malley (2012) is available here: http://dx.doi.org/10.3414%2FME00-01-0052 . A full reference is in the references part in the ranger documentation. In short, each tree predicts class probabilities and these probabilities are averaged for the forest prediction. For two classes, this is equivalent to a regression forest on a 0-1 coded response. In contrast, in randomForest with type="prob" each tree predicts a class and probabilities are calculated from these classes. In the example here I tried to use the uniform distribution instead of the normal distribution to generate the probabilities, and here the other approach seems to perform better. I wonder if these probabilities are really the truth? By the way, the same results as in the randomForest example above can be achieved with ranger by using classification and manual probability computation (use predict.all=TRUE in prediction).
