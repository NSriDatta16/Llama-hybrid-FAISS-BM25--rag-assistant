Best Silverlight Controls

Who provides the best 3rd party Silverlight controls for LOB applications? In the past I’ve used Infragistics for WinForm controls which were very good and they also provide good support. However, they seem to be a bit behind the likes of Telerik in the Silverlight space. I’ve also noticed the Silverlight toolkit as well – are these as robust as Telerik’s? I'd be grateful if anyone could share any opinions or experiences that they may have.
