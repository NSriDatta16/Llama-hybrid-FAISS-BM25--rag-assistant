Ideally the first thing I would do is store the numbers in reverse digit order, so 43,712 is stored as: 2 -> 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 It makes arithmetic operations much easier. Displaying a number can be done either iteratively or more simply with a recursive algorithm. Note: all this assumes singly-linked lists. Edit: But you've since stated you have no choice in the storage format. As such, your best bet is to reverse both the lists, do the addition and then reverse the result.
