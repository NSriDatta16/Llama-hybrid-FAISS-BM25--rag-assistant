All: Require some form of runtime on your system (JVM/.net/Python runtime) All can probably be compiled to executables without the runtime (this is iffy and situational, none of them are designed to work this way) Are good languages All have specific areas where they are much more appropriate than the other two Java: Tries very hard to be Cross Platform--generally succeeds Little access to platform features that are not in the SDK Slowest of the three to change and does not contain features common to the other two such as closures Very backwards compatible (partly because of the previous point) FAST (about 2x slower than C, quite a few x faster than python) Probably has the most library support of the three Strong multi-platform server systems already deployed using J2EE Scales down to embedded (I've worked on 2 different embedded java projects--coming soon to a cable box near you) Static C# Quicker to add new features Windows only--Mono is cross platform but does not have the library support. Started very similar to Java but has many more language features now. Much better access to windows APIs Not sure about speed--I think it's similar to Java. Very good library support The only one of the three that you have to pay for (it's free for "entry level") Static Python Language is cross platform. Not sure about non-language platform access (such as drag-and-drop)--anyone know? Probably an easier language to learn The only one of the three that does not use c-like syntax Slowest of the three, but still pretty darn fast compared to other dynamic languages.
