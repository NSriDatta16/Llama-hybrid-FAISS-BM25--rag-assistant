Your questions sure peeked my curiosity. I can hopefully shed some light on them. The XHTML schema states the following three elements as preserve : STYLE SCRIPT PRE This means that all other container elements should have suppressed the whitespaces around them. Your Mozilla link ( "Whitespace in the DOM" ) says: In Mozilla, all whitespace in the text content of the original document is represented in the DOM... This becomes apparent when running a test page with plenty of whitespaces and breaks. Viewing the generated code (You can do this using the Web Developer toolbar: select View Source - View Generated Source ) reveals that "the text content" means everything inside the HTML root tag. So, in other words, there's only whitespace suppression on the outermost tag ( HTML ). Running the same page in IE8 tells a slightly different story (view the generated source by pressing F12 and in the Developer Tools, press CTRL - G ). They're not 100% conformant either, but way more conformant than Firefox. They're suppressing not only the HTML element, but pretty much everything else (as it should). They heed the SCRIPT and STYLE elements' preserve rule, but still leaves a break inbetween. In the body, it replaced multiple breaks with single breaks. Nested DIV tags (and their content text) on a single row was split up with breaks. In short, both Firefox and IE8 are not conforming user agents . And no, you can't suppress the whitespace between two tags with the white-space property (you probably could go about doing it with JavaScript/jQuery if you really wanted to). The white-space property specifies how to deal with whitespace in the content part of the element (e.g. white-space: nowrap prevents the text from wrapping).
