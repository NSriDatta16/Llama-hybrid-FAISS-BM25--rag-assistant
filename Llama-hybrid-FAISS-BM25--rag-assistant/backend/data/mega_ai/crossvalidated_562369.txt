You could use $x = 24$ successes in $n = 76$ trials to test $H_0: p = .53$ against $H_a: p where $0.53$ is the lower end of the CI from meta analysis. In R, the relevant exact binomial test is as shown below. The null hypothesis is strongly rejected with P-value nearly $0.$ binom.test(24, 75, .53, alt = "less") Exact binomial test data: 24 and 75 number of successes = 24, number of trials = 75, p-value = 0.0001944 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.53 95 percent confidence interval: 0.0000000 0.4195974 sample estimates: probability of success 0.32 There may be more elegant solutions, but your data with $\hat p = 0.32$ are so far from matching the results of the meta analysis that the decision is hardly in doubt. [Turns out that there is a "more elegant solution"; see @Scortchi's Answer.] Even a 99.9% one sided CI for $p$ indicates your point estimate $\hat p = 0.32$ is not consistent with $p > 0.5035,$ below $0.53.$ binom.test(24,75, .53, alt="less", conf.lev=.999)$conf.int [1] 0.0000000 0.5034918 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.999
