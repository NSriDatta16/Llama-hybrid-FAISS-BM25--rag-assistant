Stopdrag not working as intended

I try to drag something, and on stopdrag it should start a function if certain requirements are fulfilled: if(e.target.dropTarget.parent == targetName || e.target.dropTarget.parent.parent.parent.getChildByName("cloud").getChildByName("itemPlacer").getChildAt(1) == targetName){ This works well when I drag and stopdrag correctly (requirements are fullfilled) but if the requirements aren't met I get an error saying that the place I refer to cannot be null. I know that the problem lies after the || part, but how can I resolve this? Is there a shorter way of doing these checks? At the moment, I am going through a lot of parents and getchildat statements and was wondering if there was another way.
