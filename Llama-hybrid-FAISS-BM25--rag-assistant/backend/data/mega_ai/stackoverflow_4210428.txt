Use: tar -zcf /home/mywebsite/public_html/backups/`date +%A`_backup.tgz ./public_html date +%A gives you the current weekday (try it in your shell or man date to see this and other options). I never tried something like this (i.e. embedding a command) within cron line itself, so you might need to move it to a separate script and call that script instead.
