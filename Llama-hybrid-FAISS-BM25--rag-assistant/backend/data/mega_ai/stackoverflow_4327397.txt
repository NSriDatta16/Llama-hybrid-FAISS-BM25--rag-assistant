Multiple problems: you never declare cont or YES so the compiler doesn't know what they are you declare go within the loop, so its out of scope in the while expression comparing strings with == doesn't do what you need here -- you might have two different strings with the same contents. Use equals instead. The error messages from the compiler should tell you about the first two -- pay attention to what the compiler is saying. easiest fix: add String cont; before do , get rid of go and make the test while ("YES".equals(cont)); This will still exit if the user enters "yes" or "Y" or " YES" or some other variation, however.
