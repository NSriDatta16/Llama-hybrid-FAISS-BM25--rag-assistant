In Java, what event is *continuously* fired on mouse button down?

I would like to know if there exists in Java an event that is continuously fired when a mouse button is being held down (pressed), even if the mouse is not moved. I could not find it in typical MouseListeners: MouseDragged is fired only if the user move the mouse while holding the button down MousePressed is fired only once when the button has been pressed And that's about it. Any idea how to make such an event? Cheers jy
