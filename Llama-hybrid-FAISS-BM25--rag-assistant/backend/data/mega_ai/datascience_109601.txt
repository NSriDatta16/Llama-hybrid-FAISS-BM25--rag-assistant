It is commonly called [data leakage]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning) if the algorithm is given features during training that are not present during testing. Data leakage will result in high performance during training and greatly reduced performance during testing. Most often the goal of machine learning is high performance during testing, thus only train the model with features that are present during testing. In your case, train the model with only grey-scale videos.
