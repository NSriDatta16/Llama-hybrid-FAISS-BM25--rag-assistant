When sending headers to download a PDF, Safari appends .html

Here is the request and response headers http://www.example.com/get/pdf GET /~get/pdf HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://www.example.com Cookie: etc HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 29 Apr 2010 02:20:43 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8i DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 X-Powered-By: Me Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: private Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="File #1.pdf" Content-Length: 18776 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 ---------------------------------------------------------- Basically, the response headers are sent by DOMPDF's stream() method. In Firefox, the file is prompted as File #1.pdf . However, in Safari, the file is saved as File #1.pdf.html . Does anyone know why Safari is appending the html extension to the filename? I'm also using Kohana 3, serving the PDF from a controller method.
