This question is related to the notion of D-Separation in a Bayes Net. Here we have a variable Baking with arrows/arcs drawn to Smell, Humming, and Roommate Present. The three child variables in the net are D-Separated only if I know the state of the parent variable , Baking. https://www.coursera.org/lecture/probabilistic-graphical-models/conditional-independence-PTXfn , https://www.coursera.org/lecture/probabilistic-graphical-models/independencies-in-bayesian-networks-JRkCU So if I don't know whether baking is happening, then my child variables are NOT independent, and my observation of one will affect my expectation for the others.
