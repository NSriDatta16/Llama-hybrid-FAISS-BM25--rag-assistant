So if you are looking at using Microsoft's remote desktop, you can add a reference to Microsoft Terminal Services Control Type Library in the COM section. If you are working with a gui, you can just drag the control and do something like: rdp.Server = txtServ.Text; rdp.UserName = txtUser.Text; IMsTscNonScriptable secured = (IMsTscNonScriptable)rdp.GetOcx(); secured.ClearTextPassword = txtPassword.Text; rdp.Connect(); If you are using the console, should be just as simple just without the buttons and all.
