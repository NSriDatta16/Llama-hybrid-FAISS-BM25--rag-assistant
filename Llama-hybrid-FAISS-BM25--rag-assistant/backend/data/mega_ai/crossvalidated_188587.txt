There are two way to think of the problem. One is to say that the sources observe a noisy version of the latent variable "it will rain / it will not rain". For instance, we could say that each source draws its estimates from a $Beta(a+b,a)$ distribution if it will rain, and a $Beta(a,a+b)$ distribution if it will not. In this case, the $a$ parameter drops out and the three forecast, $x$, $y$, and $z$ would be combined as $$p = \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{1}{x}-1\right)^b\left(\frac{1}{y}-1\right)^b\left(\frac{1}{z}-1\right)^b}$$ $b$ is a parameter controlling how under ($b>1$) or over ($b $$\frac{p}{1-p} = \frac{x}{1-x} \frac{y}{1-y} \frac{z}{1-z}$$ Which is just saying: the odds of rain is the product of the odds given by each source. Note that it is not well defined if a source gives an estimate of exactly $1$ and another gives an estimate of exactly $0$, but under our model, this never happens, the sources are never that confident. Of course we could patch the model to allow for this to happen. This model works better if you're thinking of three people telling you whether or not it rained yesterday. In practice, we know that there is an irreducible random component in the weather, and so it might be better to assume that nature first picks a probability of rain, which is noisily observed by the sources, and then flips a biased coin to decide whether or not it is going to rain. In that case, the combined estimate would look much more like an average between the different estimates.
