The most reliable accounting application that I've ever used was Quicken v2 that I bought in 1992. I used it for 11 years through to 2003 and never once did it crash or corrupt data or do anything unusual and performed its function perfectly and simply. One of the features that it did not have (if memory servers me correctly) was downloading from banks. However, if you want to see a solid, full featured and elegantly designed piece of accounting software to use as a template for yours then I'd suggest that you try and track down that version of Quicken. It was designed for Windows 3.11.
