Multiple forms in one table, but Firefox is changing my mark up automagically?

I'm trying to make a table that has one webform per table row. The problem is, when I display the page in Firefox, it closes off my form tags immediately. Am I not allowed to have multiple forms in a table? EDIT: I am running jQuery plugin "uniform" but I disabled it, and get the same result. My code: id name type clickable live save " /> /> /> save Firefox turns it into (note the closing of the form tags): id name type clickable live save 001 Narrative Biography html save 002 Complete Biography html save I'm sure it is changing my mark up to be valid, but why, and what should I do? Multiple tables? That seems less than elegant.
