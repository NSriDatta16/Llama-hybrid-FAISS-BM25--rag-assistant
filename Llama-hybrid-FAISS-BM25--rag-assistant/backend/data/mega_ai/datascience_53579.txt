Machine learning model for determining whether a transaction is cheap, fair, or expensive,

I am currently working on a final project related to data science and would like some advice. I have a second hand bike selling data set that consists of around 100,000 observations with the attributes: {Brand, Model, Machine Capacity, Mileage, Sold Date, and Price} . Now, I need to decide on what to do with this data. Obviously, I could use a regression model to predict the price of a given bike. However, I would like to do something different, such as, for a particular type of bike getting the information on the price range that is considered cheap (e.g.: from 1000 - 2000 dollars), fair, and expensive. I know that this can be solved by some simple statistics such as using normal distribution, and then using the empirical rule to divide the curve into 3 categories mentioned above. However, if I want to take the machine learning approach, what kind of technique should I use to solve this problem? Thank you.
