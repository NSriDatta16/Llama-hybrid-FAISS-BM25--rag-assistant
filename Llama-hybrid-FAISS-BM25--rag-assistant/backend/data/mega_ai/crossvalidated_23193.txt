Averaging images

I want to see if it is possible to analyse openly available images (from google, flickr, etc.), and conclude something from them (the same way one might do this from census data but with images as data). In my opinion online sources offer a wealth of data, and can easily be grouped by subject (for example: by searching for a specific term on google: "my house"). And i think averaging these images could tell us something about the way most people tend to take pictures of certain subjects (our pets, our family members, etc.). That in turn could possibly tell us something about the way we perceive those subjects, and hopefully even more... What i am going to do is collect as much images as possible about several readily available, simple subjects (i.e. "house", "portrait", etc.). Resize them so they have equal sizes, and calculate the average of those images pixel by pixel (mean, median or mode, i am still deciding). Ideally i would also try to align the subjects (so that for the keyword "house", all the houses are directly on top of eachother, and the same size). I am very excited about the possibilities, but am curious to know what the experts think. What are the possible pitfalls in doing this? Does this idea make sense to you? Any suggestions or critique?
