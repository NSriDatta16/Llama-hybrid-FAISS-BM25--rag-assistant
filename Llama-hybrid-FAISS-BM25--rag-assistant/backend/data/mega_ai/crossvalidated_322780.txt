The explanation of normality of repeated-measure ANOVA can be found here: Understanding repeated measure ANOVA assumptions for correct interpretation of SPSS output You need normality of the dependent variables in residuals (this implies a normal distribution in all groups, with common variance and group-dependent average), as in regression. As you noticed, multivariate normality implies that all linear combinations of the dependent variables are normally distributed, so it is a stronger concept than normality of single variables ($3 \rightarrow 1$). However, I'm not convinced this implies normality of residuals ($3 \rightarrow 2$), given residuals are determined by independent variables (groups, in ANOVA) as well. I agree with you for point $5$: you are basically talking about an individual-level random effect having a normal distribution.
