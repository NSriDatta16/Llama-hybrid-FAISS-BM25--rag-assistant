Implement different variation of Holt Winter technique using R for 52 weeks of data

As per my job requirement I have to do forecasting using only Holt Winter technique in R.I have weekly data for 2 and half years & I have to predict weekly.I'm planning to build time series with frequency 52. I'm seeing that HoltWinters() function in R can do only Additive trend-Additive Seasonal (A,A) & Additive trend -Multiplicative Seasonal Model (A,M). I want to try other models like (M,A),(M,M). I saw these models can be done by ets() but the ets() has maximum frequency restriction of 24. Can you please suggest me some method in R where I can use these models with 52 weeks of frequency? Thanks in advance
