Sorry everyone, I have worked out a solution. Clearing the error code didn't work, so I had to use a number of GOTOs instead, and now the code works (even if it isn't the most elegant solution). Below is my new code: dl = 20 For dnme = 1 To 3 BeginLoop: Select Case dnme Case 1 drnme = kt + " 90" nme = "door90" drnme1 = nme Case 2 drnme = kt + " dec" nme = "door70" 'decorative glazed' Case 3 drnme = kt + " gl" nme = "door80" 'plain glazed' Case Else GoTo EndLoop End Select On Error GoTo ErrorHandler Set sh = Worksheets("kitchen doors").Shapes(drnme) sh.Copy ActiveSheet.Paste Selection.ShapeRange.Name = nme Selection.ShapeRange.Top = 50 Selection.ShapeRange.Left = dl Selection.ShapeRange.Width = 150 Selection.ShapeRange.Height = 220 25 dl = dl + 160 Next dnme EndLoop: ActiveSheet.Shapes("Txtdoors").Select Selection.Characters.Text = kt & ": " & kttxt Worksheets("kts close").Protect Password:="UPS" Exit Sub ErrorHandler: Err.Clear dl = dl + 160 dnme = dnme + 1 Resume BeginLoop End Sub
