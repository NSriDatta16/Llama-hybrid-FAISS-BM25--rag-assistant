How to keep a php script from timing out because of a long mysql query

I have an update query being run by a cron task that's timing out. The query takes, on average, five minutes to execute when executed in navicat. The code looks roughly like this. It's quite simple: // $db is a mysqli link set_time_limit (0); // should keep the script from timing out $query = "SLOW QUERY"; $result = $db->query($query); if (!$result) echo "error"; Even though the script shouldn't timeout, the time spent waiting on the sql call still seems to be subject to a timeout. Is there an asynchronous call that can be used? Or adjust the timeout? Is the timeout different because it's being called from the command line rather than through Apache? Thanks
