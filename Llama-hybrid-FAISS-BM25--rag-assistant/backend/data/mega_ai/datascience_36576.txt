How do you know if your Autoencoder network is fully connected?

I am new in deep learning and I am confused about fully connected network. Is an Autoencoder with more than one hidden layers a type of deep neural network (DNN)? Is DNN always fully connected? Let's say an Autoencoder network with three hidden layers was built using H2O R package, how do you know if the Autoencoder network that you build is fully connected?
