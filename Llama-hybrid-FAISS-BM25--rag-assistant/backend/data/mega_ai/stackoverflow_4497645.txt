My only concern is Microsoft could suddenly change GUID implementation in future versions of Windows. Deal with it, if it happens. No, seriously, you could also worry about the implementation of integer , Microsoft could decide to switch to the .NET datatypes and make the integer system-wide a 4-byte value. Worry about other things, if implementations are changing, you'll have to rewrite/change/fix your program anyway. Edit: If I understand you right, you're worrying about the return value of the function, not the GUID-Structure itself. And you mean that at the moment it can return either a GUID or the uninitialized value, but in future implementations it might return a 0-filled-GUID? In that case I stick to my first paragraph, worry about it if it happens. At the moment the function has a clearly defined behavior, work with that. Check for uninitialized values and that's it. You can't guess what Microsoft will do in the future (hell, sometimes even Microsoft can't).
