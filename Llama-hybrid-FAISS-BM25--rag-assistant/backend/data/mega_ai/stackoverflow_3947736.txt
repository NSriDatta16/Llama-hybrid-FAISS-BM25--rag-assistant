Ok, I am assuming you have already set Nullable to True in the Properties window of the Visual Studio when you have the Swift or Iban field selected in the entity designer, and then you have saved to regenerate the .Designer.cs file. If so (it sounds like you're doing this...), this is what you should be seeing: With Nullable set to True : Should generate this: [Column(Storage="_Swift")] public string Swift { ... With Nullable set to False : Should generate this: [Column(Storage="_Swift", CanBeNull=false)] public string Swift { ... So as you can see, String is nullable by default, so there is no need for a CanBeNull property in the Column attribute when Nullable is set to True. Anyway, if the above doesn't provide any more clues, you may need to provide a snippet of your generated code (as I mentioned in a comment on your question). Hope this helps.
