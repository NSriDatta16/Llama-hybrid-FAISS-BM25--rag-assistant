In practice, data sets are rarely linearly separable. In fact, it is recommended by the developers of LIBSVM to proceed right to training an SVM using a Gaussian kernel, experimenting with different bandwidths. The advantage of SVM's over NN's is that SVM's are more interpretable, so if you're going to end up explaining your result to perhaps the issuer of the data, then this approach could work well. I would say that in most cases, NN's will do a better job of classification, provided they are structured optimally.
