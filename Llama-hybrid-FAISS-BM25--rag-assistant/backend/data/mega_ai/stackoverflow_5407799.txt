Eliminate all white space in PDF using iText

I am testing iText to generate a PDF that is composed of 8 images in a tiled format. I use JFreeChart to create a graph, which in turn is converted into an image by iText. The PDF generates fine, but when I open the output file, there is still about an inch of white space on the left, right and bottom. I want to utilize all space on a legal size page when printed. I know there is no concept of "margins" in PDF and its not an editable format. The image must be created without white space. What do the extra params in the Document constructor actually do then? I thought by supplying the necessary parameters to the Document object (LEGAL and the 1f params) would eliminate the white space and my table would take up all 8.5x14 on the printed page, but no luck. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance Original Code: // Setup document Document doc = new Document(PageSize.LEGAL, 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(doc, new FileOutputStream("c:\\temp\\image_in_chunk.pdf")); doc.open(); //create the chart, save to file system, and create an iText Image object ChartUtilities.saveChartAsPNG(new File("C:\\temp\\img.png"), createChart(createDataset()), 240, 240); Image img1 = Image.getInstance("C:\\temp\\img.png"); PdfPCell cell1 = null; Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(); paragraph.add(new Chunk(img1, 0, 0, true)); PdfPTable table = new PdfPTable(2); for (int i = 0; i Corrected and working Code (Of course create your own JFreeChart as img1. I cannot post a sample image output not being a member): // Setup document Document doc = new Document(PageSize.LEGAL, 0f, 0f, 0f, 0f); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(doc, new FileOutputStream("c:\\temp\\image_in_chunk.pdf")); doc.open(); //create the chart, save to file system, and create an iText Image object ChartUtilities.saveChartAsPNG(new File("C:\\temp\\img.png"), createChart(createDataset()), 305, 250); Image img1 = Image.getInstance("C:\\temp\\img.png"); // Create pdf document for (int i = 0; i
