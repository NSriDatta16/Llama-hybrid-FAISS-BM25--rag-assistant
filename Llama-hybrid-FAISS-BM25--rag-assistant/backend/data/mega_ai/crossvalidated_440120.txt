What to assume if exact lower limit data values are not available

I have some data - about 100 values, maximum value 100. However, values below 10 are just written as How can I impute these data points. What value should I assume these data points to have? Should I take 5 (midway between 0 and 10)? If we assume normal distribution for whole data, average of these points would be around 7 (considering tail of normal distribution curve). Thanks for your insight. Edit: re discussion in comments: For a perfect triangle with base between 0 and x, mean seems to be 0.633 times x (on checking data on spreadsheet), though I do not have mathematical proof.
