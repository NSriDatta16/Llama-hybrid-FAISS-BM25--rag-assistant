Commercial DBMS (Informix, DB2, probably Oracle, ...) have partitioning or fragmentation capabilities such that you can place different data in different fragments, and the query optimizer will ignore fragments that it knows it does not need. You can sometimes use these to place the less frequently used data into storage areas only used for archaic data. The advantage of this is that the system deals with the placement (OK, the system plus the DBA), and the applications are completely oblivious to it. Any scheme that requires changes to reporting applications is doomed to break at least some of those applications.
