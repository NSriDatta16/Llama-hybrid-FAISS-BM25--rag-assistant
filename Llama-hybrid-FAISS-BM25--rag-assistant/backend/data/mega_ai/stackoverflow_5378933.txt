In CSS the comma ( , ) separates selectors. It's not a selector itself so it can't be used inside a selector. So depending of if you want to apply the rule to paragraphs that are not .class1 and paragraphs that are not .class2 , paragraphs that have neither .class1 nor class2 or paragraphs that don't have .class1 and .class2 it's p:not(.class1), p:not(.class2) { } or p:not(.class1):not(.class2) { } or p:not(.class1.class2) { } BTW, IMHO it's better to avoid :not if possible and in this case, for example, have a general rule that applies to all p s (with the properties you want to set in the :not rule) and one that applies to ones with the class and overrides the properties of the first rule if necessary.
