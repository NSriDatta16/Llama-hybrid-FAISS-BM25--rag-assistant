It sounds like you're interested in 'stochastic optimization', where the goal is to optimize a stochastic objective function (typically its expected value). Note that some people take this term to include methods for optimizing deterministic functions where the solver uses randomness (not what you want). These references may be useful: Hannah (2014). Stochastic Optimization. Fu et al. (2005) . Simulation optimization: A review, new developments, and applications Amaran et al. (2014) . Simulation optimization: A review of algorithms and applications You may also be interested in Bayesian optimization. In this setting, the objective function can be stochastic, and the goal is to choose parameters that optimize its expected value, given the parameters. As with some other stochastic optimization methods, the objective function can be a black box, meaning you have the ability to evaluate it, but may not have a closed form expression (e.g. it might depend on the result of a simulation or physical experiment). Evaluating it may be very expensive. Bayesian optimization treats evaluations of the objective function as observed data, and uses them to update a probabilistic model of the objective function (e.g. using Gaussian process regression). New evaluation points are chosen in a way that trades off between exploration (sampling from uncertain regions to get a better estimate of the objective function) and exploitation (sampling from regions that are predicted to increase/decrease the objective function). Brochu et al. (2010) . A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Cost Functions, with Application to Active User Modeling and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. Snoek et al. (2012) . Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms. If you do have a closed form expression for the objective function (as in your example), it would make more sense to try to exploit this known structure than to throw it away and treat the function as a black box. For example, in the best case you may be able to derive an expression for the expected value given the parameters, then use standard, deterministic methods to optimize it.
