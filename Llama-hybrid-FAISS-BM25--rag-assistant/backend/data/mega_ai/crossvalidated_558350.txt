Random forests, and some other machine learning techniques, are notorious for failing to achieve good absolute predictive accuracy (calibration curve = line of identity). I think of unbiased calibration assessment (using resampling or, if the sample size is huge, using external validation) as a test that a predictive method must passed in order to be a good candidate, then other attributes are assessed such as predictive discrimination. I don't tend to compare two calibration curves, but to only use methods achieving good absolute accuracy.
