converting uneven hierarchical list to a data frame

I don't think this has been asked yet, but is there a way to combine information of a list with multiple levels and uneven structure into a data frame of "long" format? Specifically: library(XML) library(plyr) xml.inning Where the following is the structure: > llply(xml.list, function(x) llply(x, function(x) table(names(x)))) $top $top$atbat .attrs pitch 1 4 $top$atbat .attrs pitch 1 4 $top$atbat .attrs pitch 1 5 $bottom $bottom$action b des event o pitch player s 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 $bottom$atbat .attrs pitch 1 5 $bottom$atbat .attrs pitch 1 5 $bottom$atbat .attrs pitch runner 1 5 1 $bottom$atbat .attrs pitch runner 1 7 1 $.attrs $.attrs$num character(0) $.attrs$away_team character(0) $.attrs$ What I'd like to have is a data frame from the named vector from the pitch category, along with the proper ( top , atbat , bottom ). Therefore, I would need to ignore levels that won't fit into a data.frame due to different number of columns. Something like this: first second third des x 1 top atbat pitch Ball 70.29 2 top atbat pitch Strike 69.24 3 bottom atbat pitch Out 67.22 Is there an elegant way of doing this? Thanks!
