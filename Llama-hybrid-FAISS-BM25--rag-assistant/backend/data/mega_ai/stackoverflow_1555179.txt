How to achieve proper CSS line-height consistency

My basic CSS rule for font-size and line-height is pretty simple: body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; } When I create a paragraph that contains an or a (or even some which uses a different font-size than the ), I notice that these elements increase the line-height by a pixel or two. This leads me to believe that most browsers take the largest inline element to display line-height . Is that right? My goal is to make the line-height consistent, regardless of which elements are inline. The only way I've found to make the line-height consistent is to define: em, strong, code, etc { line-height: 100%; } Is this the right way to go about this? Or am I being too much of a perfectionist? Edit 1: This also seems to work: em, strong, code, etc { line-height: 1; } Edit 2: After playing with this for a few days, it doesn't appear that there is a reliable solution for keeping a consistent line-height . If anyone has any ideas, I'd certainly love to hear them. Edit 3: For my own future reference and from my own research, these tags should be considered with line-height: 1 as long as they are displayed inline along with other standard body text: abbr, acronym, b, big, cite, code, del, dfn, em, i, ins, kbd, q, samp, small, strong, sub, sup, tt, var These elements are questionable: a, bdo, img, span
