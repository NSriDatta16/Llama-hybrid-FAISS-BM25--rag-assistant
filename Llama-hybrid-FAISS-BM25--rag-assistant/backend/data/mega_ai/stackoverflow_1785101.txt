( Here's an article Bing published about their cloaking detection in 2007 ) Support browsers (and crawlers) that can't handle pushState .

Make sure you can handle the load of the crawlers. It's a good idea to support browsers and crawlers that can't handle (or users and organizations that won't allow) JavaScript Tricky JavaScript that relies on arcane or specific features of the language might not work with the crawlers.
