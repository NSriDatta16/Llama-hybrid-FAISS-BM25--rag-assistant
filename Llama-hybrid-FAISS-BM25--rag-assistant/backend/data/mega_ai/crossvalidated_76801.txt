Roughly speaking, the Bayesian and the frequentist perspectives agree on calculation of the likelihood, but disagree on the interpretation . That's because the Bayesian interpretation of probability is, very roughly speaking , a superset of the frequentist one. From the frequentist perspective, the probability only makes sense if the likelihood is describing the probability of an event that will be repeated for a sufficiently large number of independent, identically distributed trials. From the Bayesian perspective, it's the quantified degree of belief. If there are to be a sufficiently large number of i.i.d. trials, then the Bayesians' belief, if rational and informed, should match the frequentist's probability. The Bayesian might also be a little more explicit about the background assumptions. We're not really calculating $p(x|\theta)$, because that's not even a thing. We're really calculating $p(x|\theta,\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ represents all of the background assumptions. That looks like a trivial change, because we hold $\Omega$ to be constant. I believe it's non-trivial It's subtle, and it's more about cognition than maths, but hear me out: Because the Bayesian is routinely forced to make explicit, and quantify, the underlying assumptions, this becomes a way of thinking, or culture, or intuition, or whatever you'd like to call it. And this way of thinking is very valuable in decomposing $\Omega$, when the combination of observations and calculation leads to contradictions and extremely low posterior probabilities. (at the risk of churning over old ground) This does highlight something that is at once a fundamental difference between the Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, and a commonality. As Sivia shows so elegantly in Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial , the standard frequentist tools are exactly the analytic solutions you get from a Bayesian perspective with specific uninformative priors. Same tools, same answers, if the underlying assumptions are identical. The difference is that the Bayesian has the option of informative priors, and is compelled by the method to explicitly quantify their prior.
