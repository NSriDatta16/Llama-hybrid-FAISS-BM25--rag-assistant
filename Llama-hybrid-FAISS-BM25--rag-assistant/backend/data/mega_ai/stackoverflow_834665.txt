Embedding Flash in 3D-rendering binary

I want to embed Flash (2D GUI) in my 3D game C++ application, and it must be portable. Rendering Flash is not enough, I need user action callbacks. I found Hikari for Ogre3D , but I guess the technique it's based on only works on Windows? (It uses OLE.) Further, from what I've heard (unverified) CryEngine uses Flash. Almost forgot the obvious question: how do I go about business?
