The "state design pattern" could be considered an "architectural pattern"?

"An architectural pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization schema for a software system ". There are software systems that can be described as finite-state machines (specially many real-time systems and embedded systems), if we consider the previous description given in the first paragraph for an " architectural pattern ", don't you think that in specific cases the " state design pattern " can be also an " architectural pattern "? I received this question when discussing a design document with a junior developer that involved the "state design pattern". I answered YES to this question, that the " state design pattern " could be considered an " architectural design pattern " since the application is mainly a finite-state machine. Anyway, looking in Google I don't find a specific discussion related to this question, so I'm not sure if my answer was correct. What is the correct answer (if it's possible to give one)? What is the rationale for your answer? Best regards.
