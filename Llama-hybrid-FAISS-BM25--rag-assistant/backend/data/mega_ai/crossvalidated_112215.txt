Longitudinal data format in WinBUGS or OpenBUGS, different number of items per time point

I am working with longitudinal data, where there are a different number of "items" per time point. I am working with the MCMCdynamicIRT1d function in MCMCpack in R to estimate a dynamic IRT model with binary items. However, now I am interested in modeling ordinal items within the same model. I found an example of a dynamic IRT model with ordinal data in BUGS and the code is based on a CSV data file looks like this: CTRY YEAR Item1 Item2 Item3 Item4 Afghanistan 1981 0 1 0 0 Afghanistan 1982 2 0 1 2 .... Albania 1981 0 2 0 0 Albania 1982 1 0 0 1 .... The issue is that my data have a different number of "items" per timepoint. I am working with US Supreme Court cases, and the Court sees a different number of cases per year. So my data might look something like this: Justice1 Justice2 year time 0 0 1960 1 1 0 1960 1 0 1 1960 1 0 0 1961 2 0 0 1961 2 0 0 1961 2 0 0 1961 2 0 0 1962 3 0 0 1962 3 Any thoughts on how I can accommodate my data structure with a different number of "items" per time point? I appreciate any advice you can offer!!! ===== BUGS code I am trying to work with ==== model{ for(i in 1:n){# n is the number of obs for(item in 1:4){ logit(Z[i, item, 1])
