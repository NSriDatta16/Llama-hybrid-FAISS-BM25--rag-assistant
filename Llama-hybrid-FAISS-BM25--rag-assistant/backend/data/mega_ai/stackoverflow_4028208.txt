If "guessing" device IDs is your only concern, make the device IDs unguessable? For instance, use the result of HMAC-SHA256 with a vendor-private key and serial number as the payload. Not even you would need a copy of the vendor's key. That wouldn't be terribly useful though, as the device's network connection is probably sniffable thus its ID could be trivially captured over the wire. A secret key element must be present on the device, therefore. But this is where I get slightly confused - your concern over using a shared private key seems to be logistical, rather than whether the device can actually support it (implying that it does have some crypto) - yet you can't use HTTPS? What kind of limitations does the device have (memory/CPU/storage)?
