Visually comparing two models based on the per-observation AIC

In order to visually compare two models (logistic regression, in case that it matters) I thought of plotting the contribution of the individual observations to the AIC of the respective model. The plot looks like this: One can see that, although for some observations the full model makes larger errors than the simple one (i.e. a larger contribution to the AIC), for the majority of the observations the per-observation AIC is lower for the full model. The linear regression (the orange line) reflects that by being below the diagonal dotted line. This, I hope, gives some visual support for using the full model---assuming that the model selection is based on the AIC in the first place. Are plots like these actually used in practice and do they have an established name? If not, why? Is this plot in any way misleading or unclear?
