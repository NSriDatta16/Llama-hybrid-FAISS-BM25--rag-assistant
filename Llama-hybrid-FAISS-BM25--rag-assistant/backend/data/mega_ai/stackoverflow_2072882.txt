Where should the TClientDataset component be located?

Some background: I want to develop a desktop application, with a SQL database as storage. There is only one user at one time connected to the database. To make maintainance easier, I would like to seperate GUI from Busniss Logic. Thus, I thought using a DataModule (where the BL is implemented), for each Dialog. My question: Where is the proper place to insert a TClientDataset component? Directly in the Dialog or in the DataModule?
