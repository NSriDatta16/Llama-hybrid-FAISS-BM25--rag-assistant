Can an SVM perform better than an Ideal Observer?

Under what circumstances is the above not true? It seems that in fields like vision science, the ideal observer is preferred against other classifiers when the underlying distributions are known for psychophysics experiments. However, the low-level psychophysical stimuli is usually not as complex and diverse as other classification problems such as multiview object recognition or text classification. I also wanted to get a confusion out of my head: Is an Ideal Observer the same as a Naive Bayes Classifier? Because mathematically they look very alike.
