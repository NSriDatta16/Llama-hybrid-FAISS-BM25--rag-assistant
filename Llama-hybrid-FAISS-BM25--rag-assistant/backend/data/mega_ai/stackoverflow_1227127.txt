Dijkstra has been mentioned already, there is also the A* algorithm which can be better performance-wise under certain conditions and from which one can learn a lot. There is also a good book on graph algorithms with lots of Java code examples by Robert Sedgewick which I found useful several years ago. The title is "Algorithms in Java, Part 5: Graph Algorithms" .
