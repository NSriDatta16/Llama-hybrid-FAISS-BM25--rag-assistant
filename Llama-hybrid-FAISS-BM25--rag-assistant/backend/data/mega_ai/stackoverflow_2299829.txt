Should I dump all WebForms/ASP.NET MVC and WinForms development and move to Silverlight?

There seems to be a strong movement towards Silverlight, even with Windows Phone 7 rumoured to have dev based around it. Is Silverlight a valid alternative for all web/thick client development? You can remove the concern around plug-in requirements. I'm more concerned about it being technically deficient or cumbersome as opposed to traditional development. To this point I've been holding off learning how to leverage it and I'm worried the train may have already left the station.
