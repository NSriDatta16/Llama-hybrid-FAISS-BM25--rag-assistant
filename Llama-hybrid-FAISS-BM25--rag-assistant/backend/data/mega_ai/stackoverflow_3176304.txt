Get touch location from touchesBegan? (And other game questions)

I'm trying to get the location of the touch event on the screen from -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event . What code can I use to read the touch coordinates? I've gotten this far so far: NSLog(@"Touch data: %@", [NSString stringWithFormat:@"NSSet: %@",[touches description]]); I'm trying to make a game using an OpenGL template application. The touches will only register in the EAGLView file, not the ESRenderer1 file. I assume that I should use the EAGlView to set variables and then read the variables from there into the ESRenderer to perform game calculations. Is this a good approach?
