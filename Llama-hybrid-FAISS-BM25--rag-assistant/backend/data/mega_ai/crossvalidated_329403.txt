Yes, a Gaussian Process (GP) is strictly non-monotonic. This is easy to show for the case that the kernel is non degenerate (ie full rank) as the posterior of any unobserved point will have a posterior distribution which is normally distributed between hence spans $[-\infty, \infty]$. As such the probability of $y However, there are hacks. There has been work done on modelling the derivative of a function space with a GP and given an appropriate mean function claims can be made about draws of the function space being approximately monotonic. You can also probably model some function of the derivative space such as the log or square root of the derivative, but inference will likely become more complex.
