How to estimate model with both linear and exponential parameters?

I have a theoretical growth function that can be perturbed by events, and I'd like to estimate the growth parameters as well as the perturbation, and the rate of falloff after that perturbation. I'm thinking of using a logistic function to model the effect of the event and the falloff of that effect (if any). To ground this, $x$ is time, and $t$ is the time the event occurs. Before time $t$, or if the event never occurs, we have a simple linear regression. After the event occurs, I model the contribution of the event with magnitude controlled by $\beta_2$ and rate of falloff by $\beta_3$. $y_i=\left\{x_{i} t:\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+2\beta_2\frac{1}{\left(1+e^{\beta_3\left(x_i-t\right)}\right)}+\epsilon_i\right\}$ ( edited to add the error term ) Here's a Desmos graph if it helps. I'm really not sure how to estimate parameters for this model in any of the stats packages I'm familiar with in R. Do I need to turn to Bayesian methods?
