This is advice comes from my experiences building software. The IDs can contain slight formatting differences, so regular expressions are not the best solution as they would need to be updated every time an exception is detected. Then build more robust regex. Regex is incredibly powerful and useful (even use something like the "or" pattern: r"(pattern1)|(pattern2)|(pattern3)|..." ). Starting with a ML model is going to push the project way out of scope and cause delays. Maybe start reading https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/rules-of-ml/ - its first rule is: Rule #1: Donâ€™t be afraid to launch a product without machine learning.
