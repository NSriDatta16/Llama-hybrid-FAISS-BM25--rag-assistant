+1 to @Chris C's comment on reading up on meta analysis. One thing to keep in mind for your particular question is each study's sample size. Suppose this is $n_1=20$, $n_2=50$ and $n_3=30$, then you should really calculate a weighted average: $$\frac{n_1d_1+n_2d_2+n_3d_3}{n_1+n_2+n_3} = 0.33$$ This will have an impact if your studies are wildly different in sample size.
