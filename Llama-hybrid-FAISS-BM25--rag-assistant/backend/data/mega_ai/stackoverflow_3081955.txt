Regarding your stripped down version, are you using a different featx function than the one used in http://streamhacker.com/2010/06/16/text-classification-sentiment-analysis-eliminate-low-information-features/ ? The exception most probably happens inside featx and multiprocessing just re-raises it, though it does not really include the original traceback which makes it a bit unhelpful. Try running it without pool.map() first (i.e. negfeats = [feat(x) for x in words] ) or include something in featx that you can debug. If that still doesn't help, post the whole script you are working on in your original question (simplified already if possible) so others can run that and provide more directed answers. Note that the following code fragment actually works (adapting your stripped down version): from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews from multiprocessing import Pool def featx(words): return dict([(word, True) for word in words]) if __name__ == "__main__": negids = movie_reviews.fileids('neg') posids = movie_reviews.fileids('pos') p = Pool(2) negfeats =[] posfeats =[] for f in negids: words = movie_reviews.words(fileids=[f]) negfeats = p.map(featx, words) print len(negfeats)
