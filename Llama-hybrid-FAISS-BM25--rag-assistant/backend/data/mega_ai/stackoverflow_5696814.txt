How to organize data for Mutllevel modeling - Decision Tree, Classification, or Regression

I have three tables - Sales Manager, Customer, and Order. Each sales manager has multiple customers, and each customer can have multiple orders. I am interested in determining if certain attributes of sales manager and attributes of customer will lead to sales of a particular product (Let's say Product A Yes/no). Suppose I have 3 sales managers, 10 customers, and 20 orders. Should I structure the data set to have 3 rows, 10 rows or 20 rows. Please advise. Also, will the decision tree, and classification algorithm automatically understand the hierarchical relationships among manager, customer and order? Thanks.
