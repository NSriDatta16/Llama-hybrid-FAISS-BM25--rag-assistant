How do we know $X'X$ is nonsingular in OLS?

I am currently working through understanding the mechanics of OLS estimates and the hat matrix. One thing I have been searching for without luck is how we know that the term $X'X$ is invertible where $X'$ represents the transpose of $X$. I understand that $X'X$ is a symmetric matrix, but I also know that being symmetric alone does not guarantee nonsingularity. For reference I am referring to this equation: $$ H = X(X'X)^{-1}X' $$ Any help with this is greatly appreciated. Through the helpful answers below and a few other google searches I think I have found an answer to my question (at least for most cases). When performing OLS. We have organized our data with $n$ observations and $p$ parameters. In almost every case $n > p$. This means that the columns of $X$ must be linearly independent. $X'X$ results in a matrix with $dim(X'X) = p$. This means that $X'X$ must also have columns that are linearly independent. Because $X'X$ is a square matrix (rows equal columns), it must have rows which are linearly dependent as well (i.e. $rank(X'X) = p$ aka "full rank"). A full rank matrix is always invertible. Please correct me if I am wrong here, but I think the logic follow. I used these questions as resources: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2430179/if-x-is-linearly-independent-prove-xtx-is-positive-definite https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/691812/proof-of-when-is-a-xtx-invertible https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/214542/linear-independent-sets-of-non-square-matricies
