The important issue here is whether one of your numbers is a known reference , for example, a theoretical value. With no reference number, use the percent difference as 100*(y-x)/((x+y)/2) The important distinction here is dividing by the average, which symmetrizes the definition. From your example though, it seems that you might want percent error , that is, you are thinking of your first number as the reference number and want to know how the other deviates from that. Then the equation, where x is reference number, is: 100*(y-x)/x See, e.g., wikipedia , for a small discussion on this.
