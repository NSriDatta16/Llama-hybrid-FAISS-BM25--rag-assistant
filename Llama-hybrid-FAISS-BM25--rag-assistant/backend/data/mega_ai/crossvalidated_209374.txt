With multinomial regression, how to predict an event and get the ROC curve?

I'm using the multinom package in R to run a multinomial logistic regression model. My dependent variable has 3 levels and as the output, I'm getting the probability for each of the level. Currently, I have the VIF, AIC, p-values and confusion matrix in the model. I have the following questions: I want a single output based on the probabilities. How do I decide a "cut-off" for deciding the "best event"? Does it make sense to get an ROC curve here? If yes, then how do I get one? What are the things I should look at for the validation of the model?
