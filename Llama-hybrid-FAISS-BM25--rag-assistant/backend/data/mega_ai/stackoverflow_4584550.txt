You can certainly do some of your acceptance tests this way, but I think most BDD advocates would not advise using this for all tests. And of course, true BDD advocates wouldn't call them tests... The RSpec Book advocates a two-level cycle with acceptance tests (or Scenarios) written first (primarily in Cucumber ), and unit tests written (in RSpec ) in an inner cycle more resembling the traditional TDD. The outer cycle of acceptance testing can also use tools like Selenium to drive the entire application through the UI (and the authors of The RSpec Book spend a chapter on this). But it is not appropriate for unit tests. Tests exercising the entire application through the UI are harder to make repeatable, and have a tendency to be slower and more fragile than unit tests.
