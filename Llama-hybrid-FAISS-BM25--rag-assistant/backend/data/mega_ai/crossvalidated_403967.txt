I already wrote some of this on Facebook, but I figured I would fill it out a bit more here. First, I would make sure that the NAs have been properly dealt with. I don't think that is affecting your hurdle model, and I'm not positive what the default method for pscl is when it encounters NA values, but it would be best to impute them. I would recommend the mice package and a nonparametric model that would be able to handle the zeros in the response variable as well as the relatively high number of NAs (maybe random forest?). Secondly, I think you should find the best model using whatever criteria you planned to use, getting rid of uninformative variables with the truncated negbin model. Then, I would implement the same model with a truncated Poisson distribution, and compare those two models to determine which is better using the log likelihood ratio test. I wouldn't stress about what the estimate of Theta is, just determine which distribution fits the data better. Is there a biological reason you are using a hurdle model instead of a zero-inflated model?
