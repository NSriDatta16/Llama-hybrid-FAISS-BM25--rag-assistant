I would have to test the theory but I think Remus could probably confirm or not, if I wanted a sneaky way outside of the transaction to make adjustments I would check whether making a call to msdb.dbo.sp_start_job 'yourjob name' and configuring a job that performs the update statement you want would work. It's sneaky enough that it might work - the agent job would be run on a different account and should be outside of your connection / transaction. It's a easier than writing a CLR stored proc, although I appreciate it is a hack. A. (Tested it - hack worked)
