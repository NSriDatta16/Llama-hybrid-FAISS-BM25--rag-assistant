In approach 2, after you have fixed all the Bert layers and trained the last classification model, you have the option to un-fix the Bert layers and further train your model, and get (hopefully ) more optimized parameters for your current task. In Pytorch this can be done by: first fix layers for param in model.parameters(): param.requires_grad = False then unfix layers for param in model.parameters(): param.requires_grad = True
