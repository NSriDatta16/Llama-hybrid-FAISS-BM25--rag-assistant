You might want to look at Mono . It's basically cross-platform .NET. You could write your app once and run it on Windows or Linux (and easily port it to Android or iOS). You can also look into Moonlight , the open source version of Silverlight if you want to focus on an MVVM pattern. Leveraging .NET will make it a lot easier to move to a web application framework. As a benefit you can do your development on either Windows, Linux, or Mac. If you need database access, and are going to go with .NET, I'd recommend dblinq and a MySql backend.
