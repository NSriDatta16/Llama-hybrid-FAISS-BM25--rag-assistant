Eastsun 's answer gave a very good reason why you calculation overflows. As a workaround I would redefine the sum function to use foldLeft , which allows you to specify the accumulator. def sum(xs: Iterable[Int]): Long = xs.foldLeft(0L)(_ + _) or using the shorthand for foldLeft (which I quite like as it puts the starting value of the fold in front of the Iterable you are trying to fold). def sum(xs: Iterable[Int]): Long = (0L /: xs)(_ + _) In both cases, the code you were trying to run gives the correct results. -- Flaviu Cipcigan
