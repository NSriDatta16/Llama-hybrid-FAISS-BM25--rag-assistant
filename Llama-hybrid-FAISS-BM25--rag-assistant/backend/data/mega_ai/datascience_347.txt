As mentioned in above answers grasp the basics of ML by following MOOCs by Prof.Andrew Ng and 'Learning From Data' by Prof. Yaser Abu-Mostafa. R is the clear winner as the most used tool in Kaggle competitions. (Don't forget to check the resources on Kaggle wiki and forums) Learn basic R and Python. Coursera 'Data Science' track has an introductory R course . Almost all the algorithms can be found in Python and R libraries. Feel free to use the algorithms you learned in few kaggle competitions. As a starting point compare the performance of several algorithms on Titanic dataset and Digit recognizer dataset on kaggle . And do continue practising on various datasets!
