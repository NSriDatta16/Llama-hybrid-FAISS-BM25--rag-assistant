Typically in a sales forecast task you will use data structured like the following: date | customer_ID | product_ID | quantity_sold ---------------------------------------------------- 2022-09-22| 1 | 1 | 10 2022-09-22| 1 | 2 | 20 2022-09-22| 2 | 1 | 10 2022-09-22| 2 | 3 | 50 ... So yes, you can frame this as a regression task where you predict the sales (either quantity or value) per customer, product and date. It makes usually sense to aggregate your data on the level which is desired for your forecast (in your case this means to stick with sales per customer per product per day but if your forecast only needs to be on a weekly level, for example, you could and probably should aggregate your data on a weekly level too). To better understand your task and potential approaches I suggest you have a look at sales prediction tasks such as Kaggle M5 Forecasting - Accuracy which is very similar. In my experience, gradient boosted decision trees often provide very good results for tasks as these. However, the key thing will be feature engineering, e.g. introduced lagged features. Again, the M5 Kaggle competition I linked above (or similar forecasting competitions) can provide many ideas how to tackle this.
