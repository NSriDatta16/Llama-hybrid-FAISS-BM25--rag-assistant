How to combine two result sets from one table sorted independently using one SQL query?

This is a simplified task which I have to solve in real project. In this project data is stored in HSQLDB. Data is accessed using JDBC. I have one table: name | flag ----------- aa | 1 bb | 0 cc | 1 dd | 0 ee | 1 ff | 0 I need to compose query to get the following table: name | flag ----------- aa | 1 cc | 1 ee | 1 ff | 0 dd | 0 bb | 0 The final table is like rows with flag = 1 were taken and sorted ascending , rows with flag = 0 were taken and sorted descending and results were combined one after another. Please, pay attention, that rows with flag = 1 and rows with flag = 0 have opposite sort order. Is it possible to do in SQL? I wouldn`t like to make two queries and merge ResultSets in Java code manually.
