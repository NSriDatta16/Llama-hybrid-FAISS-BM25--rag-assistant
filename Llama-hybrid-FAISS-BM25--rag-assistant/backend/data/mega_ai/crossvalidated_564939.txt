The first thing to note is that the logistic regression model you describe in your comments has more parameters ( $n^2 + 2n$ ) than there are segment combinations ( $n^2$ ), meaning that it is overparametrized and therefore will just give you the observed frequency of wins for each possible combination. If that is what you are interested in, you don't really need to perform logistic regression - simply count the number of wins for each combination and treat it as a standard binomial estimation problem (with $k$ wins for a given segment out of $m$ games). This way you can deal with symmetry by considering reversed positions as the same combination - just count for example (4,2) and (2,4) together, so you have in total $n(n+1)/2$ combinations instead of $n^2$ , and you get a estimated win probability for each.
