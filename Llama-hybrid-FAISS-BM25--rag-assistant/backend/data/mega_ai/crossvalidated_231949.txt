Yes, this is usually the case when creating autoregressive (AR) models, as you can see in this question: Estimate ARMA coefficients through ACF and PACF inspection However, ACF and PACF compute linear correlations, while neural networks are nonlinear, so the applicability of those techniques may not be obvious. This paper shows that they are indeed useful for feature selection on neural networks.
