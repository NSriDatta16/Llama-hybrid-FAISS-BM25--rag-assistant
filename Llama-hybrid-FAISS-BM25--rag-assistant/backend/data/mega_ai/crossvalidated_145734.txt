The mean and sd calculations you give are used in PERT three-point estimation . They might be regarded as based on either assuming particular cases of a four-parameter beta distribution or a particular double triangular * distribution, such that the median and mode coincide. * The double triangular has a density consisting of two triangles back-to-back (with a discontinuity at the mode). The general case has probability $p$ in the left triangle and $(1-p)$ in the right, but in the particular one discussed above, $p=0.5$ The values given for calculating the mean and sd are based only on the three specified values. In the case of the double triangular with equal probability in both halves, the given mean is right, but I haven't checked whether the sd estimate makes sense (I believe it's based on a rough approximation). To derive a suitable sd estimate for your differently weighted average, you'd need some basis on which the weighted average was a suitable way to approximate the distribution's mean and then obtain a suitable sd estimate from that same basis. I think you might perhaps be able to choose a different beta or perhaps some other distribution so as to make your weighted mean work and then base an estimate of standard deviation off whichever distribution you ended up with. (No double triangular will produce relative weights of 2,4,1.)
