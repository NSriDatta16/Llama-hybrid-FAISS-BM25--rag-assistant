Which data store for a management service like IIS

I have a C# Windows service which manages some stuff for my server application. This is not the main application, but a helper process used to control my actual application. The user connects to this application via WCF using a WinForms application. It all looks a bit like the IIS manager. I need a data store for this application. Currently, I use separate XML files which are loaded at start up, are updated in memory and flushed to disk on every change. I like this because: We can simply edit the XML files in notepad when issues arise; I do not have external dependencies to e.g. MSSQL express; I do not have to update a database schema when the format changes. However, I find that this is not stable and that the in memory management is very fragile. What should I use instead that is not overkill (like e.g. MSSQL express would be) without loosing too many of the above advantages?
