There's no real evidence of any kind of leak from what you've posted. The garbage collector hasn't run for a while, that's normal on an idle program. The 0.5 MB those uncollected objects take is peanuts. What will happen when a program is idle for a while is that its virtual memory pages will get swapped out to the paging file. When it regains the focus, those pages need to be swapped back in. When the machine is old, that can take a while. Your real problem is more than likely disk fragmentation, especially on the paging file. You should be able to tell from the hard disk drive access light, it ought to be furiously blinking. You can also tell from TaskMgr.exe, Process tab. View + Select Columns, tick Page Fault Delta. That number should go to zero in a second or less after restoring the program's window. Defrag your disk. Especially the paging file, which is hard to do. Ask questions about that at superuser.com
