I'd say that there are still valid reasons to not use nvarchar. Storage space is at a premium, such as on a shared host or the database is really huge. Performance is critical. Brownfield development (i.e. the database has existing tables that use varchar). You are integrating with another older system that only understands single byte characters and/or varchar. However new development should probably use nvarchar esp. since 64-bit systems are becoming the norm. Also, companies (even small ones) are now more commonly global.
