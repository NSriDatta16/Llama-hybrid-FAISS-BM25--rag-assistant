There are two issues here: (1) what to do about the fact that you have repeated measures on each participant and (2) what to do about the fact that the scores have a limited possible range. If you have more that two scores per person, life gets more complicated, since you have only 2, there are simpler options available. With >2, you would need to use some form of mixed effects model, such as the repeated measures ANOVA that @NickStauner mentions. You can still use that here, but you can just as well go with a simpler model, which I suspect you might prefer. With just two measurements there are two strategies that people often use. You can subtract the earlier from the latter to create change scores (that's what you were trying), or you can use the earlier score as a covariate in a multiple-variable model. How to choose between these options has generated a lot of controversies over the years (see here: Best practices when analyzing pre-post treatment designs ), but a quick version of the conventional wisdom is that you should use change scores if you cannot assume the groups were equal on average beforehand, but should prefer controlling for the earlier score as a covariate otherwise because of the advantages this approach offers. Specifically, you can see the effect of having a higher or lower initial score. Since you randomized your participants, you can use the covariate approach. The limited nature of your data poses a much trickier problem. There are very sophisticated ways of modeling such data in psychometrics using item response theory , however, I doubt you have enough data and you don't want to have to try to learn IRT overnight if you aren't already familiar with it. My guess is that the easiest option for you is to use an ordinal logistic regression model predicting score2 from group and score1. You may also need to include a squared term for score1 to capture a possible curvilinear relationship. If you have enough data you could also include interaction terms to assess if some instructional methods are better for students who are already doing well / poorly, should that be a question you are interested in.
