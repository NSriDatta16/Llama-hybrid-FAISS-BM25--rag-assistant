RJAGS - Bayesian Beta binomial syntax

I am working on a classic problem when the posterior probability distribution of a proportion must be obtained. This parameters is assumed to followed a beta distribution, therefore the number of ocurrence is modelled by a beta-binomial distribution. I am using RJAGS to compute the posterior distribution and have some question about the syntax I have to use. The data I have is characterized for having number of occurrence (Y) and sampling size or number of observation (M) for each row. The distribution of the observed failure rate (Y/M) is depicted in the following plot: As can be seen, it is left-skewed distribution with some observation to the right side showing larger proportion values. The quantiles for this parameters is the following: The code of the first model is given by: jags_model_syntax After compiling the model and computing the posterior, the results are the following. The probability distribution of p (the proportion) is a beta distribution and it is signficantly different to the distribution of the observed proportion. I have following question: Should I give one probability to each lot, that means fitting a hierarchical model. This would change by adding a p[i] at each iteration Why beta distribution can not fit the original distribution?
