Code coverage and Profiling command line tool in VS2010 Ultimate

I can run those commands to generate the .coverage file to get the code coverage result. vsinstr -coverage helloclass.exe /exclude:std::* vsperfcmd /start:coverage /output:run.coverage helloclass vsperfcmd /shutdown Can I use the same tool for getting profiling report? If so, what can I do that? If not, what tools are available for profiling in VS2010?
