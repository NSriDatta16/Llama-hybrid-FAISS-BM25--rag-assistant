UITextView and UIPickerView with its own UIToolbar

I like to replicate the form behavior of Safari on the iPhone in my own app. If you enter data in an web form you get a separate UIToolbar (previous, next, done) just above the UIKeyboardView. Same for choosing an option: you get the same UIToolbar just above an UIPickerView. I am looking for demos / sourcode / ideas how to implement this. Would I create my own subview with that toolbar and textview / pickerview? Is there a more elegant way? Especially something that leverages becomeFirstResponder of UITextfield?
