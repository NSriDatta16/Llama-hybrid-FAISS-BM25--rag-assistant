MySQL InnoDB not releasing disk space after deleting data rows from table

I have one MySQL table using the InnoDB storage engine; it contains about 2M data rows. When I deleted data rows from the table, it did not release allocated disk space. Nor did the size of the ibdata1 file reduce after running the optimize table command. Is there any way to reclaim disk space from MySQL? I am in a bad situation; this application is running in about 50 different locations and now problem of low disk space is appearing at almost all of them.
