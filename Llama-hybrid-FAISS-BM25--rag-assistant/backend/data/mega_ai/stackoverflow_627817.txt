I would have the use of WPF dependant on the size and number of projects. The more work you have ahead the more sense it makes to leverage the power of WPF. For CRUD applications, you will not gain much in terms of functionality from WPF besides some eye candy. Where you will win is in medium term productivity as WPF follows a clean approach and not one that has already evolved over and over the years and is highly patched, even though very well dressed, like Windows Forms. Laying out screens in XML does have its benefits. For quick little tools, however, I would stick to Windows Forms until WPF proficiency is attained, unless one of the purposes is the referred proficiency itself.
