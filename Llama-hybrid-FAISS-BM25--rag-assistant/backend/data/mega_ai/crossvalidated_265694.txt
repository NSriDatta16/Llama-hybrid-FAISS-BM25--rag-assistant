How to define Y and X variables in Firth's penalized logistic regression

I'm using Firth's penalized logistic regression in R with logistf package. Should the Y variable be defined as factor (L$Y = factor(L$Y) before running a model or not? Because the outcomes of the model were different when the Y variable was and was not defined as factor before running and the stpPlr package cannot run when I defined the Y variable as factor. How to select the best model for the Firth's penalized logistic regression? Which package can I use for model selection and which value we use for comparing the models?
