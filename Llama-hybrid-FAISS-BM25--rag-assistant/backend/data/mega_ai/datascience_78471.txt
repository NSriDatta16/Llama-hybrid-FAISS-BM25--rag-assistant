" Agnostic " means that nothing is known or can be known of the existence. In data science, the term " Agnostic " is used when there's self-modelling/self-learning technique is involved. For e.g. A robot modeled itself without prior knowledge of physics or its shape and used the self-model to perform tasks and detect self-damage [1] . It is task agnostic self modeling. It is reminiscent of meta learning.
