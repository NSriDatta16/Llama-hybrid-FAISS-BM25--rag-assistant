One thing that helped me get a handle on a complex JavaScript code base that I inherited was the AOP package in dojo. . Using it, you can get a nicely formatted execution path of your code (kind of like Firebug's profile but in a list in the order the methods were invoked). I don't know if jQuery has something similar but it might be worth looking into because it beats the snot out of littering your code base with log statements that you may (or may not depending) have to remove. Once you know how things are working, you can go about re-organizing it using some of the excellent tips here.
