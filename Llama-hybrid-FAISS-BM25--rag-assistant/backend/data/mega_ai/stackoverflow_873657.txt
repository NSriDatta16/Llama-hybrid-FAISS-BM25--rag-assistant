Touch Handling Handoff to Subview

I have a table view that is placed in front of a scroll view. When the user drags vertically I want the table to scroll up and down and when they drag horizontally I want the scroll view behind to scroll its image. I understand how to check the touches using the UIResponder delegate methods to sense whether the user is scrolling horizontal or vertically. I am looking for advice on how to hand off the touch handling to the scroll view in the horizontal scrolling case. How does one get the events to stop coming to the table view and to the scroll view (which is nextResponder)?
