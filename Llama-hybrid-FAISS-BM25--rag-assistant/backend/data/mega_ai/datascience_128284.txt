Permanent account number

Permanent account number PAN is a unique 10 digit alphanumeric. Will there be requirement in future to be changed to a 11 digit alphanumeric taking into consideration the growing population of India? Example: Today's Date is 14th March 2050 instead of 14th March 2024. India's Population: 180 crores instead of 142 crores. Can prediction machine learning algorithms assist in this regard? Note: Year 2050 is a future date.
