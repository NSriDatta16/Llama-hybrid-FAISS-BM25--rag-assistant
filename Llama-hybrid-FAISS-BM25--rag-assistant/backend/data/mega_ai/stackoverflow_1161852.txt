I too prefer my apps in greyscale, although a hint of colour doesn't hurt. For example, meta.stackoverflow.com looks kinda weird to me after spending a lot of time on stackoverflow. If you're looking for just colour ideas, I'd check out these sites for colour suggestions: http://www.colourlovers.com/ http://kuler.adobe.com/ For typeography: http://webtypography.net/ Maybe also pick up some good design books? (I like this one http://www.amazon.com/Designer-Grid-Lucienne-Roberts/dp/2880466784 )
