Using predictive modelling for temperature data set

I am absolutely new to this area of predictive modelling in data science. I am not able to understand how and what modelling techniques do we use? Does it depend on the data type? Does it depend on size of data? To be specific to the title, I have to predict missing values in a given temperature data set and i am unaware of anything that i can use. Could someone guide me through?
