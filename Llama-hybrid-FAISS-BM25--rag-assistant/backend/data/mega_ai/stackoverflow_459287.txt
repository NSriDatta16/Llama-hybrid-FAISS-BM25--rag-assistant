C++ code coverage tool running on command line

I use code coverage tool for writing unit testing cases. I have a code coverage tool but only have to do everything through its GUI interface. Ideally I'd like to get a tool that is able to produce a text output (.diff is the best) on individual .cpp files. Does such a tool exist?
