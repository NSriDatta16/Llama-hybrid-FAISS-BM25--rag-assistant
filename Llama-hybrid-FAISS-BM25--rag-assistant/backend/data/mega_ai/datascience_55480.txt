predicted bounding boxes that stretch beyond grid cell (Andrew NG CNN course)?

I was following Pr. Andrew Ng course on Course about Convolutional neural network and I have a doubt regarding one of the points he mentions in the Yolo algorithm. In one of the slides he mentioned two key points: 1) For each grid in our $3 \times 3$ grid image will have 2 predicted bounding 2) And each of these bounding boxes will be bigger than the size of the grid. I couldn't get why there will be $2$ predicted bounding boxes? Is it because we consider two anchor boxes? Also, how can the bounding boxes bigger than the size of the grid? Because we know that each object can belong to one grid only based on the midpoint
