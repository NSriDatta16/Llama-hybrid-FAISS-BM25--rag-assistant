Although mostly used for classification, LDA can be used for dimensionality reduction too: "Data reduction entails a sequence of unit-variance, linear discriminant variables $\beta_k^T x$, chosen to successively maximize $\beta_k^T \Sigma_{\mathrm{Bet}} \beta_k$ , with $\Sigma_{\mathrm{Bet}}$ the between-class covariance matrix. These discriminant variables represent a subspace for which the class centroids are spread out as much as possible." (from Hastie T, Buja A, Tibshirani R. Penalized discriminant analysis. The Annals of Statistics. 1995 Feb 1:73-102 ). Regarding SVMs, a corresponding dimensionality-reduction technique would be Kernel-PCA .
