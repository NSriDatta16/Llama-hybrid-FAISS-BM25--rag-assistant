Make sure that your _db isn't getting reset to a new context at any point between the retrieval and change, if so well that is the problem. Also you can simplify your assignment of your datasource by doing TheListBox.ItemsSource = _db.Customers; . I have many places in current code where I am doing exactly what you describe and the changes are propogating fine. An additional suggestion, setup logging on your context (set the _db.Log to some writer, I generally use the Console.Out so I can watch changes in the output window while debugging) so you can see the changes that actually do occur when you call SubmitChanges() .
