So I did a simulation, and my perfect binomial lines up reasonably well with your real-world data. Code: #parameters N The graph of the distribution (qqnorm) was: The text output of the summary was: > summary(ysum) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 94.0 145.0 154.0 154.6 164.0 224.0 In 50,000 attempts to get the lowest value, I barely get where your data does. It is a far tail, but it is within the tail. Your results are out near 4 standard deviations from the mean. What you are looking at (imo) falls into long-run/short-run statistics. I have seen a few items about "longest" but it is interesting that your data is meeting the "shortest" so well. There is physics driving that. Why is it not meeting the mean? A betting person would expect it to line up with the mean, not with an extreme minimum. The level of minimum is on the order of 3 in 50,000 or 1 in 16,600. I had to run ~16k re-runs to get a minimum as low as yours. That is very atypical. One in a few hundred, or even a few thousand might not be as strange. This only occurs on the order of 1 in 10,000 sequences. And your data is from years of real-world data. Thoughts: If a wreck is bad enough to block the intersection then there will be less traffic. If a wreck is bad enough to hit the news, then folks might avoid that route. What if I am a few decimal points off in the probability and it is 0.225 not 0.23? That might move the mean over some. This is why I like using at least 4 decimal places to work with - so my answers are accurate to 2 or 3 decimal places.

It is a good thing that I made sure that my sample size was sufficient to re-create the 2-days in a row. I don't know if I am "in the ballpark" but I am at least in the same county. The distribution was: the summary was: > summary(ysum) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 11.00 30.00 35.00 35.49 40.00 72.00 If I were a betting man, and if the 2-day sequence had NOT been in the tail, then I would guess about 35 times there was a 3-day sequence. Note that 4 in a row is counted as 3-days twice. So lets think .. if there are 2 in a row, how many are needed to make it 3 in a row? Just one more positive outcome. As long as they are independent draws, then the likelihood is right about 23%. PS: So I looked at arima models, and the best fit is a first order moving average. model = (0,0,1). This suggests that the runs aren't exactly independent.
