Tomcat within Eclipse - starting with JPDA enabled

I'm trying to get a webapp up and running - for debugging - within a Tomcat instance configured in Eclipse (to keep my work flow as automatic as possible). I'm trying to get remote debugging enabled within the Tomcat JVM, and I've read about two sets of VM arguments: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n or.. -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n But whenever I attempt to use either of these, I get an error message in my console: Error occurred during initialization of VM agent library failed to init: jdwp ERROR: Cannot load this JVM TI agent twice, check your java command line for duplicate jdwp options. I don't know where I should be looking for these other - supposedly duplicate - jdwp options. Where are these configured? How can I get this working?
