I'd definitely change from text to binary but keep each day in a separate file still. You could name them in such a way that insertions in between don't cause any strangeness with indices, such as by including the date and possible time in the filename. You could also consider the file structure if you have several fields per location for example. Is it common to look for a small tile from a large number of timesteps? In that case you might want to store them as tiles containing data from several days. You didn't mention how the data is accessed which plays a big role in how to organise it efficiently.
