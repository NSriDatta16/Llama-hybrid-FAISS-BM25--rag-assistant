Firefox adds when paste from Word in TinyMCE

I'm currently using TinyMCE 3.3 on a drupal site, with an annoying problem. Using both "paste from word"-button or "Force cleanup on paste" in Firefox cause TinyMCE to insert line-breaks in my paragraphs where the line would have ended in Word. In IE, I do not have this problem. When viewing the source code in the editor, it doesn't show a -tag, but an actual line-break. When viewing the normal text in the editor, I see no linebreak at all, but on saving, it's really there when viewing the page. Even in the beginning of every first line of every paragraph it insert a linebreak. How do I solve this?? "Remove linebreaks" isn't an option, since people want to insert linebreaks to create some vertical spacing.
