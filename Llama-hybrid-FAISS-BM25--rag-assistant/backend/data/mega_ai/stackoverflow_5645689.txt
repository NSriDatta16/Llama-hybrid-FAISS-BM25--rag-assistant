There are multiple problems with the fragment of code. The first and simplest error is that you have not anywhere opened the file fo . Unless that is done elsewhere in code you haven't shown here, you need to add something like set fo [open test.txt w] before your foreach loop. The second problem is that your code is going to write this content to the file: data1 data2 data3 but probably you intend for it to write this content: This is Data1 Value This is Data2 Value This is Data3 Value Here the error is more subtle. What your loop is doing is setting different_content to the name of each variable of interest, but you want the value of those variables. Essentially you need to doubly dereference the different_content variable. Adding a $ at the start of the variable name gives you one level of dereferencing. Unfortunately with Tcl, you can't just slap another $ onto the front to get the second level. But you can use the set command. After all, $ is just syntacic sugar for set : $foo is identical to [set foo] . Therefore, I believe you need to rewrite the body of your loop as follows: puts $fo [set $different_content] So, putting it all together: set data1 "This is Data1 Value\n" set data2 "This is Data2 Value" set data3 "\nThis is Data3 Value\n" set fo [open test.txt w] foreach different_content {data1 data2 data3} { puts $fo [set $different_content] } close $fo
