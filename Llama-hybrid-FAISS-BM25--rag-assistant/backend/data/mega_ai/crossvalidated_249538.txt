Expressing a regression estimate when predictor is continuous and between 0 and 1

I am regressing a count variable (adverse consequences) against a continuous predictor variable between 0 and 1 where all values are beween 0 and 0.5 (blood alcohol. I am using a hierarchical negative binomial regression and thus the regression estimates are log-count. I would like to express the relationship between the predictor and the outcome as a rate-ratio, and usually would exponentiate the estimate to say something like 'an increase of 1 unit of the predictor leads to an x-unit increase in the likelihood of an adverse event occurring'. Here is the output of the glmmADMB model: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.236837 0.092043 -13.43760 3.640743e-41 EstimatedBAC 10.318858 0.428410 24.08641 3.470139e-128 So for each one-unit increase in blood alcohol the expected increase in the log-count of the number of adverse consequences increase by ten. However in this case because the predictor is blood-alcohol level it doesn't make sense to talk of a 1-unit increase in x because a blood-alcohol value of 1 is blood that is actually just ethanol! The exponent of this log-count is 30,299. So does that mean that for every 1% increase in blood-alcohol concentration the chances of having an adverse events increase by 302.99 times? I don't know what I am required to do so that the regression coefficient can be expressed in a more intuitive way, or am I expressing the statement in the previous paragraph correctly? I have looked around CV and the web and haven't been able to find an answer that matches my problem.
