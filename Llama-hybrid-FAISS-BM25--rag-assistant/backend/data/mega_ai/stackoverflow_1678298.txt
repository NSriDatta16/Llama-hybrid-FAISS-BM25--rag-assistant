itext multiline text in bounding box

Does anyone know, how to, in iText, add multiline text in bounding box (with coordinates specified). I tried cb.showTextAligned( PdfContentByte.ALIGN_LEFT, text, bounds.getLeft(), TOTAL_HEIGHT-bounds.getTop(), 0 ); But it does not support newlines. I also tried PdfContentByte cb = writer.getDirectContent(); cb.moveText(300,400); document.add(new Paragraph("TEST paragraph\nNewline")); This supports newlines but does not react to moveText, so I don't know how to put it at given position or better: bounding box. I suspect chunks or PdfTemplate or maybe table might help, but i don't (yet) know how to put it together. TIA for help.
