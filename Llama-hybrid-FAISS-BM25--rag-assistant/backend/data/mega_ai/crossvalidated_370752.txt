regression algorithms for asymmetric losses

I have a regression problem where over-predictions are better than under-predictions. I am now aware of Quantile Regression. Just wondering, which machine learning algorithms exist and/or can be adapted to deal with asymmetric losses? Any package suggestions in R or Python would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
