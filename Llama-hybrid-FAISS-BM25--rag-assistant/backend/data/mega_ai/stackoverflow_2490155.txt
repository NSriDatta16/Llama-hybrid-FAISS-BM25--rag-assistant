I recommend and have used the following options: Option 1: Run a small and light webserver in the iPhone and of course, use HTTP to transfer. I recommend mongoose websever, i've tried it with very simple and very heavy load. Also here , you can find an actual drag and drop project to deploy this webserver in the iPhone. Option 2: Use something like Bonjour, this is something very useful if you want the "smart" discovery of your device in the network, maybe for opportunistic peer discovery. You can check here and here , to understand how to get bonjour to run in the iPhone and use it to exploit discovery and sharing. Hope it helps!!
