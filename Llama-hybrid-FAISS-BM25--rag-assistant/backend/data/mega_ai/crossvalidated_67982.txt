I believe there is some underlying psychology for the 5%. I have to say I don't remember where I picked this up, but here's the exercise I used to do with every undergrad intro stats class. Imagine a stranger approaches you in a pub and tells you: "I have a biased coin that produces heads more often than tails. Would you like to buy one from me, so that you could bet with your buddies and make money on that?" You hesitantly agree to take a look, and toss the coin say 10 times. Question : how many times does it have to land heads/tails to convince you that it is biased? Then I take a show of hands: who would be convinced that the coin is biased if the split is 5/5? 4/6? 3/7? 2/8? 1/9? 0/10? Well, the first two or three won't convince anybody, and the last one would convince everybody; 2/8 and 1/9 would convince most people, though. Now, if you look up the binomial table, 2/8 is 5.5%, and 1/9 is 1%. QED. If anybody is teaching an intro undergrad course right now, I would encourage you to run this exercise, too, and post your results as comments, so that we could accumulate a large body of meta-analysis results and publish them at least in The American Statistician 's Teaching Corner. Feel free to vary the $n$ and one-sided vs. two sided conditions! In another answer, Glen_b quotes Fisher providing the discussion about whether these magic numbers should be modified depending on how serious the problem is, so please don't make it "There's a new treatment for your sister's leukemia, but it would either cure her in 3 months or kill her in 3 days, so let's flip some coins" -- this would look as silly as the infamous xkcd comic that even Andrew Gelman did not like that much. Speaking of coins and Gelman, TAS had a very curious paper by Gelman and Nolan titled "You can load a die, but you can't bias a coin" , putting forth an argument that the coin, flipped in the air or spun on a tabletop, will spend about half of the time heads up, and the other time, tails up, so it is difficult to come up with a physical mechanism to seriously bias a coin. (This clearly was a pub-originated research, as they experimented with beer bottle caps.) On the other hand, loading a die is a relatively easy thing to do, and I gave my students an exercise in that with some 1 cm/half-inch wooden cubes from a local hobby store and sandpaper asking them to load the die, and prove to me it is loaded -- which was an exercise in Pearson $\chi^2$ test for proportions and its power.
