In general, one tries to avoid discretizing variables (why make life harder by throwing out information?). If you are performing a logistic regression, you can keep the variable as-is if it's an independent variable; only the dependent variable needs to be categorical. Furthermore, there's nothing wrong with describing changes on a per-dollar basis. The idea of marginal costs or benefits is a fairly common one in business economics. You just need to be aware of the range of your data and don't assume that a marginal change goes on forever. If you must transform your data, net profit/loss could be useful (assuming you have data about expenses)...
