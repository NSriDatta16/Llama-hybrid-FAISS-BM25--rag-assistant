Arcball Implementation for Papervision3D

Is there an arcball implementation for Papervision3D? There are many arcball implementations for Flash/ActionScript but none specifically for Papervision3D. Here's an example of an arcball implementation for flash: http://www.unitzeroone.com/blog/2009/09/08/source-better-flash-10-3d-interaction-arcball/ I have taken to writing my own implementation based on the DirectX ArcBall class. It does not work correctly, however, and I am at a loss as to why. From the cubes initial position I can click and drag the arcball as one would expect. However, if I start accumulating the axis/angles in a quaternion, the directions reverse when the cube is rotated enough. There should be no reversing of the directions of rotation or any other weird behaviour. I have scoured the internet and found nothing directly related to Papervision3D and arcballs. (Perhaps there is an arcball implementation for another 3D Flash engine?) Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. ** EDIT ** Added a 500 point bounty for an answer with a working arcball implementation for Papervision3D (must have at least 1 object (i.e.) cube in the scene).
