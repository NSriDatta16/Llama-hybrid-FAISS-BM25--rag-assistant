You could leave the agent in the list when dead, ready for re-use. No worries about shrinking your container, and you retain the benefits of a vector. You could keep a separate stack of pointers to dead/reusable agents, just push onto it when an agent dies, pop one off to reclaim for a new agent. foreach Agent { if (agent.health > 0) // skip dead agents process rules
