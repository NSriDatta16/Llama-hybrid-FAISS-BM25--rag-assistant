Can a GAN be used for tabular/vector data augmentation?

Can a generative adversarial network (GAN) be used for data augmentation (i.e. to generate synthetic examples that are added to a dataset) for data that is tabular/vectorized (i.e. not an image)? Are there any public implementations of methods to this effect. I am aware of the following papers on images: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04340 https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05401 https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01229
