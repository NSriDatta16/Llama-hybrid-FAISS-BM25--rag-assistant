Extract a mean and an error from different measurements

I have the following values from several measurements (they contain both systematics and statistical errors): $25.885\pm 1.851, 26.139\pm 0.979, 27.404\pm 2.049, 30.230\pm 6.729$ If I do a simple weighted average mean I get this: $26.350\pm 0.792$ , but I am not totally sure if this is right. If I had just statistical errors (and trusted them well), it would be the right thing to do, but given that I have systematics, too, it seems that the error ends up being a bit too small (for example I don't account for the scatter in the values of the means). Is there a better way to estimate the mean and the error on the mean for this data? Thank you!
