combining trained neural nets in tensorflow

I am using tensorflow to train two instances of the same neural network with two different datasets. the network itself is quite simple with an input and output layer and 6 hidden layers (each layer is a 20 meurons followed by a non-linear activation function). I can train the network with two different datasets and that is fine. Now, what i want to do is basically create a new network which is a combination of these two trained networks. In particular, I want the input and the first 3 layers to be from one of the trained network and the last 3 layers and the output layer to be from the other network. I am very new to tensorflow and have not found a way to do this. Can someone point me to the API or some way to do this sort of hybrid networks?
