ASP.NET Session reset? in IE, not in FF

Thanks in advance for any assistance anyone can provide with this torturous issue. I have an ASP.NET website built against framework 3.5SP1 in VS2010. This (essentially the) same website has been deployed several times on several servers without this issue - however they were built with VS2008. The server is 2003 IIS 6. The application loads ok initially - and in order to do so it requires a session variable be set - otherwise you get no map. If you drag a box on the map it should zoom in - and in Firefox this happens. Now the issue: In IE (6 or 8, haven't been able to test 7) when you drag a box on the map you get the Processing graphic and then a response from the server indicating that things went wrong because what's in the session is not acceptable. Yes, I know that's not very clear, and if it turns out that we need more info I'll provide it, but it a complex flow. But here's what I am wondering: Has anyone experienced a situation in which IIS treats IE differently than FF in terms of the Session? If so, how to debug, links to white-papers, etc... Please let me know if you need any more information to think through this. And again, thanks. Edit to add Request headers.
