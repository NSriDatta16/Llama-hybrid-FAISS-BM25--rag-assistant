Neither of them establish causality - unless we talk about specific experimental set-ups (e.g. randomized studies). They show correlation. E.g. a linear model for maximum daytime temperature with the ice cream sales as a predictor cannot show that selling ice cream causes higher temperature, even if higher ice cream sales correlate with higher temperatures. Of course, I could come up with a whole convoluted story of how this works (e.g. all those freezers increase the outdoors temperature in order to produce ice cream), but that would all be post-hoc reasoning. In my example, we can of course immediately tell that I probably got my causality the wrong way around, but in many practical examples that is a lot less clear. Just the same thing is happening, if I do a logistic regression for "Was it a very hot day" (yes/no).
