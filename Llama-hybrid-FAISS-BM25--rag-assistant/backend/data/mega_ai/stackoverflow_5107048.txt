IOS: Drag more than one image

I try to make more than one image dragable in my iPhone-App. I have followed a tutorial on YouTube but it doesn´t work. I create the images this way: image1=[[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"button_klein.png"]]; [image1 setFrame:CGRectMake(touchPoint.x-25,touchPoint.y-25,50,50)]; [[self view] addSubview:image1]; image2=[[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"button2_klein.png"]]; [image2 setFrame:CGRectMake(135,215,50,50)]; [[self view] addSubview:image2]; And then I tried to make them dragable this way: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *myTouch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [myTouch locationInView:self.view]; if ([myTouch view] == image1) { image1.center = location; NSLog(@"Test1"); } if ([myTouch view] == image2) { image2.center = location; NSLog(@"Test2"); } } But it doesn´t work. When I tried to make one image dragable, it worked. - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *myTouch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; image1.center = [myTouch locationInView:myTouch.view]; } Can anybody tell me, where the problem is?
