From my understanding, what t-SNE do is: First, create a probability distribution over pairs high-dimensional object. Second, from all of those distributions, they map object into a low-dimensional space. At this step, similar objects are mapped closer together, obeying the t-distribution. The original SNE they don't use t-distribution in the second step. The author of t-SNE stated that, by using t-distribution, the less similar pair are penalized less heavily on the lower-dimensional embedding.
