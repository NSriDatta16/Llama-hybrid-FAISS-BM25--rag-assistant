How do I get categories for a product in Magento

I'm trying to add product_type to my Magento Google Base output based on the product's categories, but I seem to be unable to. I have the following code: // Get categories from product to include as product_type $categoryIds = $object->getCategoryIds(); foreach($categoryIds as $categoryId) { $category = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load($categoryId); $this->_setAttribute('product_type', $category->getName(), 'text' ); } The issue is that it returns all of the categories, not just the ones the product is in. Anyone have a solution?
