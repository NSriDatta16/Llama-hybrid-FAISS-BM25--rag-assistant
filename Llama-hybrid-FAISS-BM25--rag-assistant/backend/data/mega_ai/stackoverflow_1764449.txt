The original idea was to gradually switch to str.format() approach while allowing both ways: PEP 3101: The new system does not collide with any of the method names of the existing string formatting techniques, so both systems can co-exist until it comes time to deprecate the older system. The idea is still being pursued: We are still encouraging people to use the new str.format(). Python Issue 7343 Since the original '%' approach is planned to be deprecated and removed at some point in the future, I would suggest writing new code with str.format(). Though at the moment, it is just a matter of personal preference. I personally prefer using dictionary-based formatting, which is supported by both '%' operator and str.format() method.
