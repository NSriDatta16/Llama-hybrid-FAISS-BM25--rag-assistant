If you store the values of the textfields in an array then the index of the array would be the same as the row. You could even have multiple arrays: cellLabelArray cellTextFieldArray which isn't terribly elegant but would solve the problem. Then you would get rid of your switch statement and do something like this: cell.myCellLabel.text = [cellLabelArray objectAtIndex:indexPath:row]; cell.myTextField.text = [cellTextFieldArray objectAtIndex:indexPath:row]; Using an array to be the datasource of a UITableView is a common pattern. I don't know what happens when your button gets pressed, but if you need to change the values of the labels, you would just change the values in the array and then send the tableview a reloadData message.
