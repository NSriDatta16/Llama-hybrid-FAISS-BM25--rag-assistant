Poisson Regression formulation seems ambiguous

I'm looking for a detailed formulation of the Poisson Regression with time offset. In the Wikipedia , it is written: $$\log(\mathbb{E}[Y\mid x]) = \log(exposure) + \beta'x$$ with $Y$ following a Poisson distribution: $$p(Y = y\mid x;\beta) = \frac{\lambda^y}{y!}e^{-\lambda} $$ This formulation is not clear for me: What exactly is the response variable? The Poisson distribution with a parameter $\lambda$ expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. So incorporating time in our regression model, the Poisson distribution should be expressed as below: $$p(Y=y\mid x,t,\beta) = \frac{(\lambda t)^y}{y!}e^{-\lambda t} $$ with: mean: $\mathbb{E}[Y \mid x,t,\beta] = \lambda t$; variance: $\text{Var}[Y \mid x,t,\beta] = \lambda t$. And the Poisson Regression model (with the $\log$ link function) is expressed as: $$\log(\mathbb{E}[Y_i \mid T_i,X_i) = \log(\lambda_i T_i)=\log(T_i) + \beta'X_i$$ In which $\lambda_1 t_1 = y_1$, $\lambda_2 t_2 = y_2$, $\dotsc$ where $y_1,y_2,\dotsc$ are the count events. Is this true? And here comes another confusion: in $\lambda t$ we already incorporate time element, why do we add an offset term $\log(T_i)$?
