Switching to Python from Matlab is going to be somewhat dependent on the field you are in (for example, if you are in image processing/ imaging, Matlab is pretty well solid and so swithcing will be more difficult) and the stubbornness of your coworkers/boss. While documentation for Matlab is easy to find, it's also all you get, whereas Python packages generally have decent documentation as well as countless posts on SE in which someone has likely already answered your question. One of the greatest aspects of Python is that it is open source, but it can make finding the right tool slightly more time-consuming. Your example is about resampling. Pandas resample is designed for time-series (see pandas doc ). All the arguments are described, but I can also look at the source code if I really need to understand anything more in depth. Or I search for some examples online: http://benalexkeen.com/resampling-time-series-data-with-pandas/ But it seems like you are actually interested in interpolation functions. If we search for "Python interpolation" we will discover a few methods. Looks like Scipy has an extensive package for interpolating: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html It takes some time to figure out how to search for what you need in Python, but once you get the hang of it, there are a lot of great examples online of all sorts of application. Plus, plotting in Python (and R) is way beyond Matlab (c'mon mathworks). In the end, you can do what I did which is flat out refuse to use Matlab unless it is actually necessary and hope they don't fire you!
