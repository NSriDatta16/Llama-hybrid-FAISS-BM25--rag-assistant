How to choose embedding size for tensorflow recommender system

I am going to build a recommender system using TensorFlow recommender and the two-tower-model. I have wondered, how to choose the size of the embedding dimension. Are there any papers on this for large scale recommender systems? For the example, Google chose a size of 32 dimensions for the movie recommender. My vocabulary contains around 30,000 different items. Help is highly appreciated!
