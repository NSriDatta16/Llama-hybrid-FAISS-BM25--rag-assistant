Origin of "machine" in SVM, GBM etc

Is it known who originally introduced the term "machine" used in terms like machine learning, support vector machine or gradient boosting machine? Could it be defined as an "algorithm that fits a statistical model"? OLS could then be called "least squares machine"... Is there an official definition of the word "machine" in statistics?
