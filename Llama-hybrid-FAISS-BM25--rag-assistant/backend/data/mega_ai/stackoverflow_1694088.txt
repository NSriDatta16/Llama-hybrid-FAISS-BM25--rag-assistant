Users entering the site via deep links Nonsensical links (like /clothes/men/hats#women/shoes ) can be avoided if you construct your Ajax initialisation code in such a way that users who enter the site on filtered pages (e.g. /clothes/women/shoes ) are taken to the /clothes page before any Ajax filtering happens. For example, you might do something like this (using jQuery ): $("a.filter") .each(function() { var href = $(this).attr("href").replace("/clothes/", "/clothes#"); $(this).attr("href", href); }) .click(function() { update_filter($(this).attr("href").split("#")[1]); }); Users without JavaScript As you said in the question, there's no way for the server to know about the URL fragment so filtering would not be applied for users without JavaScript enabled if they were given a link to /clothes#filter . However, even without filtering, these links could be made more meaningful for non-JS users by using the filter strings as IDs in your /clothes page. To prevent this messing with the Ajax experience the IDs would need to be changed (or the elements removed) with JavaScript before the Ajax links were initialised. How practical this is depends on how many categories you have and what your /clothes page contains.
