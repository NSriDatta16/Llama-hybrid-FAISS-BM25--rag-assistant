Well, you cannot do it that way, but it's possible when adding a inner element to your container, like this: content content content content content content content content content sidenote: wrapping content inside paragraphs is a good practice too, plus that one extra element isn't giving that much of problems, if any at all... And JavaScript: var innerHeight = document.getElementById('innerElement').offsetHeight; alert(innerHeight); P.S. For this JavaScript to work, put it after your #element div, because plain JavaScript is executed before DOM is ready if it's not instructed to do so. To make this work when DOM is ready, check this . But I'd suggest getting jQuery , it will come in handy later on if you're going to extend JavaScript operations in your site. Plus, jQuery is the power , for real! That way, simply add this script to your (assuming you've jQuery included): $(document).ready(function() { var innerHeight = $('#innerElement').height(); alert(innerHeight); }); Example @jsFiddle using jQuery way!
