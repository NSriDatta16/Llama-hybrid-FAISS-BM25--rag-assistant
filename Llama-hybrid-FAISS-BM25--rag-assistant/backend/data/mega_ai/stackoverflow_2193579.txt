I think one of the most important first steps is to set standards. Set a mandatory coding style (no one-line if/for/while/etc. statements, tabs instead of spaces, docs on every function, etc.); having a minimum requirement for the cleanliness of code is very important to maintaining a high level of quality control. A good next step is to find where your employees are competent and where they aren't. Figure out which parts of the language your employees are having trouble with (i.e.: new PHP 5 features, efficiently using DOMDocument, writing secure classes...) and assign mandatory reading. That leads me right into my next suggestion: have a "company library". For the places I've worked, it's been a bookshelf that employees can borrow books from to either reference or study. Keep it stocked with a variety of books from different publishers. From what I've seen, employees are more than willing to learn something new if it isn't forced on them and they're able to do it at their leisure. A good programmer is always looking to learn. Lastly, start a blog/mailing list/forum that employees are encouraged to participate in regularly. Post tidbits (and encourage your employees to also post) about best practices. You might post on how using gettype with a switch statement is bad or how to properly disable magic quotes programmatically. Good luck!
