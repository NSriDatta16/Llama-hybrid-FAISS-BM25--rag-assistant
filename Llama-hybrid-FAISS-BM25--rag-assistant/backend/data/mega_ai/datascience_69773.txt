So, I'm still not sure about what you consider to be an annotation on curlie.org. What I understood, you'll correct me if I'm wrong, is that you would like to annotate some text, more specifically you would like to annotate/identify concepts, and you would like to follow the structure on curlie. From what I see, curlie doesn't contain any annotation, it's more like a website ontology, which has at the bottom real url and as hypernyms domain-specific topics and then at the top level broad topics. So the only thing you might consider an annotation, at document level, i.e. a single label for a whole website, is the domain-specific topic. If you want to create an ontology similar to curlie, Protege could be a good choice. Also, if you're interested in retrieving some general taxonomy information for a word, you probably want to look at some lexical databased like WordNet or ConceptNet . If this is not what you want and you're interested in making your own annotations at word level, e.g. "I bought an iPhone[ object ]" then probably the taxonomy of curlie is too generic and you will definitely need to narrow down the scope of your annotations. Take a look at some literature of NLP tasks like Named entity recognition , it's plenty of papers. Also, if you will go down this road (creating your own annotations) a good tool is Prodigy . Consider that even at word level, annotations can defined at several levels for each document. For example, in opinion mining usually people are interested in annotating not only a chunk of words representing an opinion, but also other aspects like the target of the opinion, e.g. "[This [GPS] $_{target}$ really sucks] $_{opinion}$ , it never works!". But in my experience people stop at max 3 layers of annotations, and it truly depends on the purpose for which the annotations are made in the first place.
