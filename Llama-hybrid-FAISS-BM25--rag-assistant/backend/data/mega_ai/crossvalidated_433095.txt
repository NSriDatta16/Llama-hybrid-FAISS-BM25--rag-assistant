This is an interesting investigation because of the flash-pan nature of the event. It's not the same as, say, installing a fence and trying to see if the number of trespassers was reduced. In that case, after the fence was installed, we would expect to see a permanent impact (if there was any) on the rate of trespassers. In this case, a bunch of mods will resign/be fired/be suspended over the issue over a course of a few days, and then the rate of these will die down. There are only so many moderators willing to/forced to do these things, and once they do them it's done. We would expect the rate of leavings to die down eventually. Graphically, you could represent this with a line chart. If you take the number of moderators leaving per day and plot it, you'd expect to see relatively consistent leavings up until the firing (lets call it $D_0$ ) after which you expect to see an increase, and a fall back to the original rate. Numerically, if you wanted to show that this spike is not within the normal variation of the process, I'd try to treat this almost as if it were quality control. Take some data from before $D_0$ . Calculate an estimate of the mean leavings per day, an estimate of the variance, and then construct a confidence interval for that mean at your preferred level of significance. If $D_0$ (and other days in the aftermath) are outside this interval, then you can conclude that these points represent a shift in the average leavings per day. Anyway, that's my approach. I'm sure there are others.
