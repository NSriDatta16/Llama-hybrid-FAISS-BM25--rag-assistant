A better similarity ranking algorithm for variable length strings

I'm looking for a string similarity algorithm that yields better results on variable length strings than the ones that are usually suggested (levenshtein distance, soundex, etc). For example, Given string A: "Robert", Then string B: "Amy Robertson" would be a better match than String C: "Richard" Also, preferably, this algorithm should be language agnostic (also works in languages other than English).
