Representing a Suite of Hypothesis with Stan

After having read the excellent Think Bayes from Allen Downey, I'm now diving deeper into Bayesian Analysis and learning MCMC with Stan . The dice problem in Think Bayes goes like this: Suppose I have a box of dice that contains a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, a 12-sided die, and a 20-sided die. Suppose I select a die from the box at random, roll it, and get a 6. What is the probability that I rolled each die? My goal is to model this with Stan. It seems that the observed data should follow an uniform distribution between 1 and a second parameter d that we're trying to guess. Probably d has a lower constraint of 4 and an upper constraint of 20. The following is my best guess of what the model should look like, with the obvious problem that d is not bounded to the set of hypothesis (and most likely with other issues): data { int J; // number of draws int y[J]; // draws } parameters { real d; } model { y ~ uniform(1, d); }
