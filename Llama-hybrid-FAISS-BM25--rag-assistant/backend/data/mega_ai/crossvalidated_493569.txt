In his original formulation, Rasch treated ability as fixed --- and such model are nowadays fitted using a conditional approach, which is what pure Rasch modelers prefer, for theoretical reason --- hence the name 1-PL (for item difficulty), but there are other approaches like the joint maximum likelihood technique (poorly recommended) or mixed-effect models, which are more flexible and allow to fit a wider range of models. In the latter case, individuals are treated as random effects and ability estimates are drawn from the posterior distribution (expected a posteriori, EAP). Bayesian models were developed in the 80s but newer models became available after 2000, especially for multidimensional and multilevel IRT models. Generally, they also rely on EAP estimation using MCMC. See Fox, J.-P., Bayesian item response modeling: theory and applications, Springer, (2010), for a review. More generally the k in k-PL refers to the number of item characteristics that are estimated from the sample: 1-PL for difficulty alone (intercept of the item characteristic curve), 2-PL for difficulty and discrimination (intercept and slope), and 3-PL for the 2-PL with a guessing parameter (intercept, slope and lower asymptote). There's even a 1-PL model with fixed but pre-defined discrimination parameter (usually it is fixed to 1 by most software) --- I forgot the name but it was developed by the Cito team in the Netherlands.
