We create a baseline, custom AMI with all programs that we know we'll always need already on the AMI. The software we develop (and update constantly) is stored on external storage (we use a Maven repository, but you could use anything that works well with your environment. We then fire up our custom AMI with everything we need on it, deploy the latest version of our software from Maven, and we're good to go. So the workflow is: Setup Create a custom AMI with stuff we'll always need Ongoing Develop software locally Deploy binaries to external storage (Maven repository in our case) Fire up multiple instances of custom AMI as needed Copy binaries from external storage to each instance Run on each instance
