Just to add from my experience. In some companies I worked for I couldn't change screensaver or standby settings due to security policy. A PC was bringing up screensaver during long synchronization periods (like generating really big report), and execution was broken. To avoid that I created simple "Anti Sleep" function that slightly "moves" mouse every 5 minutes. http://automation-beyond.com/2009/08/18/anti-sleep-function/ Private Const SleepTime_Max = 300 ‘ 5 minutes Public Function AntiSleep() Dim iter Dim objTimer Dim objDeviceReplay Dim intTimeElapsed Set objTimer = MercuryTimers(“AntiSleep”) intTimeElapsed = CInt(objTimer.ElapsedTime/1000) If intTimeElapsed = 0 Then MercuryTimers(“AntiSleep”).Start Exit Function End If If intTimeElapsed Example of using it in a custom synchronization function: http://automation-beyond.com/2009/08/20/gui-object-synchronization-custom-function/ Thank you, Albert Gareev
