Dealing with dependent data in a Bayesian model

Background: Consider a series of dependent data points, $$ y_1,y_2,y_3,\cdots,y_N. $$ In cases where the dependence is well described by an exponentially decaying auto-correlation function, it is natural to only consider every $n$-th data point for an approximately independent subsample (e.g. for MCMC), where $n$ is large compared to the characteristic correlation length. But if the data has a more complex dependence structure, there are many ways one can obtain an approximately independent subsample, and not obvious how to pick one subsample over another. My situation: I want to calculate the posterior distribution for a set of model parameters $\theta$, given a number of data points, $$ p(\theta | y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_N) \propto p(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_N|\theta) p(\theta) $$ The evaluation of the likelihood function involves a number of terms which grows exponentially in $N$, and it is therefore unfeasible to evaluate the model for large dependent data sets. I do, however, know something about the dependence structure of my data. I have a symmetric matrix of scores which indicate the dependence between each pair of data points $y_i, y_j$ (i.e. similar to the correlation matrix). This matrix allows me to select subset of data points (subsamples), where each data pair have a dependence score below a threshold. Slightly different put, I can identify blocks of data points which are dependent above a threshold, and then identify an approximately independent subset by selecting one data point per block. Assuming that $y_1, y_{42},y_{51},\cdots$ corresponds to such an independent subset, I can factorize the likelihood function, and the posterior is easily calculated as $$ p(\theta | y_1, y_{42}, y_{51} \cdots) \propto p(y_1|\theta) p(y_{42}|\theta) p(y_{51} |\theta ) \cdots p(\theta) $$ There are however, a number of ways to identify a subset. Question: What is the best way to approximate the posterior, given multiple subsets of approximately independent data, but where data points in different subsets have various degrees of dependence? It seems natural to average the posterior distribution, but I am uncertain about the validity of such an approach. If the posterior is described by hyper-parameters, is it reasonable to average these hyper-parameters, e.g. by making an extra layer of hyper-parameters to incorporate the averaging over different subsets of the data sample? Or, if I only manage to sample from the posterior, is it reasonable to combine equally sized samples from the posteriors based on different subsets of the data?
