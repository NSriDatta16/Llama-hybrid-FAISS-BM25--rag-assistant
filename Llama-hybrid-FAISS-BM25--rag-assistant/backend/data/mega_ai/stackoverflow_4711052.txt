The standard application configuration of .NET does not allow dynamic updates as far as I know. But if I were you, I would rather write my own application config class which reads an xml or whatever config, watch for changes of this configuration file and if something changed, my own class would reload the configuration file dynamically. If this is possible, it should be much more elegant than killing and starting new processes. If your application has no problems with being called multiple times (there are two instances when you start the new process) and being stopped, and if configuration changes are rather infrequent, there should be no drawback in your approach. I don't know if you can start windows services at good will.
