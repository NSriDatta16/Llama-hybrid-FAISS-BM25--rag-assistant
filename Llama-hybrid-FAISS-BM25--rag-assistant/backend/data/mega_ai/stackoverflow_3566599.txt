Where is the best place to store constraints in an api using mongodb

I'm writing an API which uses MongoDB as the storage backend. Let's say the API allows a consumer to query for upcoming events. Let's say some events are private, and for the current user, should not come up in the results. Should I: Implement this at the API level. The API code, will be responsible for these checks. The advantage seems to be that if I change storage engines (unlikely), the business code will be intact. Implement this as a stored javascript function.
