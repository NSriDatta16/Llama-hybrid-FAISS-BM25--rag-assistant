Warning: Blunt subjectivity ahead Pixel perfect is a useless buzz word created by people who want to control something they don't understand. Why Clients give more attention to pixel perfect compatibility than Accessibility and usability of a site? Clients generally don't understand web pages / development / design. Pixel is a fancy tech word, so it makes cilents feel in the know . Perfect is always.... well.... flawless, so pixel perfect must be the bees knees.... It's a developer's / designer's job to educate the client and show them the advantages of accessibility, usability, etc. over serving immutable and uncompromising grids of pixels.
