Noob is parsing Google Earth XML data using VB.NET, part III

I have this XML that I am trying to read into an object hierarchy: 1321 herbert street, Warren, MI 200 geocode Herbert St, Madison Heights, MI 48071, USA US USA Herbert Ave, Warren, MI 48089, USA US USA Here are my objects: Namespace GoogleAddress Public Class kml Private _Response As Response Public Property Response() As Response Get Return _Response End Get Set(ByVal value As Response) _Response = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Response Private _name As String Public Property name() As String Get Return _name End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _name = value End Set End Property Private _Status As Status Public Property Status() As Status Get Return _Status End Get Set(ByVal value As Status) _Status = value End Set End Property Public Placemark As Placemark() End Class Public Class Status Private _Code As Integer Public Property Code() As Integer Get Return _Code End Get Set(ByVal value As Integer) _Code = value End Set End Property Private _Request As String Public Property Request() As String Get Return _Request End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _Request = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Placemark Private _address As String Private _AddressDetails As AddressDetails Private _ID As String Public Property ID() As String Get Return _ID End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _ID = value End Set End Property Public Property address() As String Get Return _address End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _address = value End Set End Property ' _ Public Property AddressDetails() As AddressDetails Get Return _AddressDetails End Get Set(ByVal value As AddressDetails) _AddressDetails = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class AddressDetails Private _Country As Country Public Property Country() As Country Get Return _Country End Get Set(ByVal value As Country) _Country = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Country Private _CountryNameCode As String Public Property CountryNameCode() As String Get Return _CountryNameCode End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _CountryNameCode = value End Set End Property Private _CountryName As String Public Property CountryName() As String Get Return _CountryName End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _CountryName = value End Set End Property End Class End Namespace ...and I am using this routine to deserialize the XML into my objects: Public Shared Function DeSerializeFromXMLString(ByVal TypeToDeserialize As System.Type, _ ByVal xmlString As String) As Object Dim bytes() As Byte = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(xmlString) Dim mem As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream(bytes) Dim ser As System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer = New System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(GetType(GoogleAddress.kml), "http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0") Dim KmlResult As GoogleAddress.kml = TryCast(ser.Deserialize(mem), GoogleAddress.kml) ' Return KmlResult End Function The problem is when I try parse the AddressDetails node. Something about the Attributes is screwing things up and I don't know how to handle it. If I remove the attribute information on the AddressDetails nodes, the deserialization works fine, but I don't have that option. You may notice my commented out attempt to handle Accuracy attribute like was done for the earlier ID attribute on the Placemark node. What do I have to do to get it to work with the attribute info on the AddressDetail nodes?
