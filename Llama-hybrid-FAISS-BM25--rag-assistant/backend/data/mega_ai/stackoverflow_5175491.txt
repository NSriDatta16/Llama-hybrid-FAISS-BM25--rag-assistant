How to increase card count in greenhopper display?

I want to see more items in the list view for greenhopper. With epics, stories, etc (and not being able to collapse the stories into the epics) there's a lot of items to be arranging. I can't seem to drag between pages, so I want to see more items on a page. I can't find a way to set that up. Anyone know?
