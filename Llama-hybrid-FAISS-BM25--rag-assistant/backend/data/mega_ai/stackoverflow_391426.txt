Don't try installing the framework in the system - it's better to keep a copy in your application bundle. To use the 3rd party framework, drag in Xcode -> Frameworks -> Linked Frameworks . Then create a "Copy Files" phase under the targets to have your 3rd party framework copied onto Contents/Frameworks within your application bundle. For more details and a step-by-step example, check out Sparkle framework's documentation
