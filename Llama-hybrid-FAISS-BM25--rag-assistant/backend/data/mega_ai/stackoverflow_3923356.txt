Using the conditional operator ? to check for null session variable

Take a look at this code: System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState ss = HttpContext.Current.Session["pdfDocument"] ?? false; if ((Boolean)ss) { Label1.Text = (String)Session["docName"]; } Basically I want to check if HttpContext.Current.Session["pdfDocument"] is not null, and if it isn't to cast to Boolean, then check if its true or false. I'm trying to avoid nested if statements and figured there would be a more elegant way to do it. I'm therefore only interested in answers that contain the conditional ? operator. Any tips?
