Where you have two tables to join, the subquery asks the table with the older paragraphs to give just the last one, ordered by date (datestamp DESC) and match it up based on your user ID. Finally the outer query limits the whole thing to just the user in question (@UserID). SELECT name, address, aboutme FROM users LEFT JOIN (SELECT aboutme FROM oldertable WHERE aboutMeID = users.id ORDER BY datestamp DESC LIMIT 1) WHERE users.id = @UserID;
