Setting HotSpot(TM) Server VM in Java 1.6 environment

I have a question related to setting Java hotspot server VM in java 1.6 is there any way to set Java HotSpot Server VM in java 1.6 environment? When i run following command java -version it's showing as below, java version "1.6.0_16" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_16-b01) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 14.2-b01, mixed mode, sharing) I want this has to be displayed as below in third line. Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 14.2-b01, mixed mode, sharing) Is there any command so that whenever we run java -version, it will always show Hotspot Server VM rather Client VM?? Thanks Robert.
