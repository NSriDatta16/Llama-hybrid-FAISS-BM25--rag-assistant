Logistic Regression with Unreasonable Odds Ratio

I am building a logistic regression of TREATED (yes/no) and BLOODLOSS_PERCENT (continuous, skewed right). I have also built a multivariate logistic regression to control for possible confounders, but the issue is the same. I am getting an odds ratio for BLOODLOSS_PERCENT to be 50000+. Looking at the effect plot and the histogram of deviance residuals, the model appears to be fitting well, but there is obviously an issue I can't identify. Do you have any suggestions? PROC LOGISTIC DATA=DATA PLOTS=EFFECT; MODEL TREATED(EVENT='1')=BLOODLOSS_PERCENT; RUN;
