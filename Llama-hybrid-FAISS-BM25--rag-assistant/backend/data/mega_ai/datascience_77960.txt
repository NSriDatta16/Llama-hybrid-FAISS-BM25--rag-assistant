Is there a deep learning method for 3D labels?

As the question says, I want to feed labels into a neural net that are three dimensional. Let's say that I have 3 possible labels and each one of my data points corresponds to a percentage of those labels. e.g, my first datapoint contains 20% of label A, 30% of label B, and 50% of label C. Is there any architecture able to deal with this shape of label data?
