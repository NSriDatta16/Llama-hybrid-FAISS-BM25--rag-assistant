The paper is about Bayesian estimation and $\eta$ is a prior. Given your data and the priors you can estimate posterior probabilities. Posterior probabilities are calculated because the paper is about density estimation, so you use their method since you are interested in the density itself. If you were interested in something else, you could use the MCMC samples to estimate any quantities of interest, as you correctly noticed.
