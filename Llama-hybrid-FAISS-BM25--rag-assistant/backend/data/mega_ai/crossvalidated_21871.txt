The issue arises from the assumption of normality not quite being valid. The simple confidence interval typically reported assumes the sample means is normally distributed with a deviation equal to the standard error. This assumption is based on the central limit theorem, which requires large numbers. It is possible to get exact Frequentist confidence intervals for small populations. For this case, with happy/not happy, the results are binary and the percent happy has a binomial distribution. For this sample size, a more fun approach is a Bayesian approach -- what's the posterior distribution of beliefs in possible parameter values. The probability of being happy has a prior beta distribution. The formula is very simple, scroll down to Shrinkage Factors on this page. Beta Binomial Distribution on Wikipedia . It is easy to plot a nice graph in Excel showing the posterior distribution.
