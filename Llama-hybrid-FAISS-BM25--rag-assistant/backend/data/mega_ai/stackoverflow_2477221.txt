I personally don't mind that I would have to include 5 libraries. My view is that if your services are completely independent of each other, then they should be in a different lib. Easier to maintain and enhancements can be applied to a single lib service rather than across the board. If there would be an issue where someone doesn't like having to include 5 libraries, it is easy to explain why. More flexibility in providing enhancements, smaller downloads (if it would be an option), etc. etc. Not to mention that load times will be faster for the libraries. To OregonGhost's point, I hadn't thought of ILMerge - so here is a link that might be of use: Daniel Cazzulino's Blog : Leveraging ILMerge . I have only heard of ILMerge - and haven't had a chance to use it. Hope that helps a bit.
