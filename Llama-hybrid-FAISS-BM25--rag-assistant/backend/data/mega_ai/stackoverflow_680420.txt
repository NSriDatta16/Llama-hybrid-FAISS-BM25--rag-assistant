In many database systems, including the major database products from Oracle, Microsoft and Sybase, groups of related database tables can be pulled together into a schema . Some large systems (and, for that matter, some not so large systems) use this as a way to control access, or just as a way to keep things well organised. For example, the tables supporting an online catalog (e.g. Amazon or Barnes & Nobel) might all be Marketing.* , the tables around order fulfillment Sales.* and those around Stock management Stock.* . The sys schema that you've noticed is where system tables live - tables that you can query to find out details about the rest of the database - such as whether a column already exists.
