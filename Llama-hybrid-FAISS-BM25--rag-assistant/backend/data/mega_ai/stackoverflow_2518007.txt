The subdirectories you use in XCode are groups not actual folders. all of the resources are likely being flattened out to the output folder. If you create actual folders outside of XCode that might work. Try creating the folder and file heirarchy and drag/dropping into XCode. Also check your build folder using Finder to see exactly how XCode is deploying your files.
