How do I deal with low loadings in the first principal component of PCA?

I have a matrix data consist of 40 variables (year data) with 1500 obs. I used this code: jjas Here are the results both variance explained and loadings. head(expl.var) # [1] 86 6 2 1 1 1 pca.jjas$rotation # PC1 PC2 # y1981 -0.1628 0.092 # y1982 -0.1668 4.24E-05 # y1983 -0.1613 -0.0442 All of loadings value less than |0.3|. My problems seems like this question . Here are my questions: a. Since variance explained high in the first 2 principal component (accounts for 92%), why loadings so low? How do I deal with the results? b. If raw data were converted to another distribution like Log Normal Distribution, could the result will be different?
