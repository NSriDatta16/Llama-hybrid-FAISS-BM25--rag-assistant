I've managed to work it out. I can remove DisplayImage.aspx completely and just call the image handler directly from my calling page, so my GridView now looks like this: function ShowImageInNewPage(url_add) { window.open(url_add, 'ViewScreenshot', 'resizable=yes,scrollbars = yes'); } > ' type="button" value='View...' onclick=' ' /> When the user clicks the button, the image loads into a new window and can be resized on the client by dragging the window corner. Thanks for everyone's help on this.
