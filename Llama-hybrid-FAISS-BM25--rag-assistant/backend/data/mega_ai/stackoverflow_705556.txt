Why would javascript click-areas not be working in IE8?

I'm trying to find a bug in an old ASP.NET application which causes IE8 to not be able to click on the following "button" area in our application: NEW When we switch IE8 to IE7 compatibility mode, the problem disappears, IE7 is able to click on it. Since the above HTML is generated by a third party control (Janus, http://www.janusys.com/controls ), we don't have the source code. has anyone experienced any similar problems with IE8? I've determined that it actually fires the onMouseDownCommand command also the CSS of the button area is different in IE8, it doesn't have color shading that it does in IE7. I can imagine that somewhere the HTML is not valid and IE8 being stricter is not playing along, but where? any advice on how to narrow in on this bug welcome ANSWER: Turned out to be that the application was not checking the navigator.agent for "MSIE 8.0" and was thus treating IE8 has a non-Internet-Explorer browser. Thanks Lazarus for the tip, the IE8 Javascript debugger is very nice, like a Firebug for IE, will be using it more!
