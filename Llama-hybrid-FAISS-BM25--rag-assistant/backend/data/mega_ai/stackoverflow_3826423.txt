Some quick benchmarking (each test = 500k appended elements and the results are averages of multiple runs) showed the following: Firefox 3.6 (Mac): Small arrays: arr[arr.length] = b is faster (300ms vs. 800ms) Large arrays: arr.push(b) is faster (500ms vs. 900ms) Safari 5.0 (Mac): Small arrays: arr[arr.length] = b is faster (90ms vs. 115ms) Large arrays: arr[arr.length] = b is faster (160ms vs. 185ms) Google Chrome 6.0 (Mac): Small arrays: No significant difference (and Chrome is FAST! Only ~38ms !!) Large arrays: No significant difference (160ms) I like the arr.push() syntax better, but I think I'd be better off with the arr[arr.length] Version, at least in raw speed. I'd love to see the results of an IE run though. My benchmarking loops: function arrpush_small() { var arr1 = []; for (a = 0; a
