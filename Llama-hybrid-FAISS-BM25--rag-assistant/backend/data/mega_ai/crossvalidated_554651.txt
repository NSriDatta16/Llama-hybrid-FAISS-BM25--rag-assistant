As already mentioned, it depends on what data you train your GAN. But it also depends on what you expect as an outcome of the GAN. Most methods focus on complete new synthetic data, but that's not the only option. This approach of landing AI seems to be more promising than just generating new artificial data, they augment existing data using a GAN to enrich it with rare events. This can help to generate data for classes that are underrepresented in the training data or could help to mitigate bias in some cases.
