Find circle coordinates with points by machine learning

I have 5 planes that are parallel to each other. Some circles collisions with the planes and i have 5 collision points for each circle. Now how i find the coordinates of each circle with that points by machine learning algorithms? Actually just finding out what points are for one circle solves the problem Something like this image:
