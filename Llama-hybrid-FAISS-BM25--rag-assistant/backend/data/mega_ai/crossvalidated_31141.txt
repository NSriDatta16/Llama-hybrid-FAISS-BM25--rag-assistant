Asynchronous (irregular) Time Series Analysis

I am trying to analyze the lead-lag between time series of two stock prices. In regular time series analysis, we can do Cross Correlaton, VECM (Granger Causality). However how does one handle the same in irregularly spaced time series. The hypothesis is that one of the instruments leads the other. I have data for both symbols to the microseconds. I have looked at RTAQ package and also tried applying VECM. RTAQ is more on a univariate time series while VECM is not significant on these timescales. > dput(STOCKS[,])) structure(c(29979, 29980, 29980, 29980, 29981, 29981, 29991, 29992, 29993, 29991, 29990, 29992), .Dim = c(6L, 2L), .Dimnames = list(NULL, c("Pair_Bid", "Calc_Bid" )), index = structure(c(1340686178.55163, 1340686181.40801, 1340686187.2642, 1340686187.52668, 1340686187.78777, 1340686189.36693), class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt"), tzone = ""), class = "zoo")
