There are several resources for FBML canvas apps including http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mmfacer and the related screencasts. These are out of date, but give you at least a good overview. You can also ask questions on the Facebooker google group. (Note: I'm a little biased as I'm the author of the link book and the maintainer of Facebooker)
