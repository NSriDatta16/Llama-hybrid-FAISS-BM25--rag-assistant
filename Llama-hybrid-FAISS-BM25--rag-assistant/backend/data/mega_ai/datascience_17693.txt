How does XGBoost compute the probabilities in predict_proba()?

I'm using the sklearn wrapper for XGBoost. I didn't manage to find a clear explanation for the way the probabilities given as output by predict_proba() are computed. In random forest, for example, I understand it reflects the mean of proportions of the samples belonging to the class among the relevant leaves of all the trees. However, in XGBoost I couldn't understand the computation from the documentation or the code. Shouldn't it give different weights for each tree?
