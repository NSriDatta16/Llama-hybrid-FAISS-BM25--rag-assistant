Balancing XGboost still skews towards the majority class

I have unbalanced dataset for multiclass classification and I tried to use the class weights option in XGboost and the classifier still tends to favor the majority class. I am not sure if I need to tune something else or how I should approach this. If the algo was predicting all over the place I could still understand but not sure why it still skews towards the majority class. Any pointers? Update: What I mean is that majority of the predictions are still for the major class which is roughly 30% in both test and train
