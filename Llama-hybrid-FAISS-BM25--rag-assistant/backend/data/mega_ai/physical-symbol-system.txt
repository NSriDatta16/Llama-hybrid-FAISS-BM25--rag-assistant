A physical symbol system (also called a formal system) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions. The physical symbol system hypothesis (PSSH) is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence formulated by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. They wrote: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action." This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence). The idea has philosophical roots in Thomas Hobbes (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), David Hume (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even Immanuel Kant (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules). The latest version is called the computational theory of mind, associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor. Examples Examples of physical symbol systems include: Formal logic: the symbols are words like "and", "or", "not", "for all x" and so on. The expressions are statements in formal logic which can be true or false. The processes are the rules of logical deduction. Algebra: the symbols are "+", "Ã—", "x", "y", "1", "2", "3", etc. The expressions are equations. The processes are the rules of algebra, that allow one to manipulate a mathematical expression and retain its truth. Chess: the symbols are the pieces, the processes are the legal chess moves, the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board. A computer running a program: the symbols and expressions are data structures, the process is the program that changes the data structures. The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of the following are also examples of physical symbol systems: Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are thoughts. The processes are the mental operations of thinking. English language: the symbols are words. The expressions are sentences. The processes are the mental operations that enable speaking, writing or reading. Evidence for the hypothesis Two lines of evidence suggested to Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence: psychological experiments on human beings and the development of artificial intelligence programs. Psychological experiments and computer models Newell and Simon carried out psychological experiments that showed that, for difficult problems in logic, planning, or any kind of "puzzle solving", people carefully proceeded step-by-step, considering several different possible ways forward, selected the most promising one, backing up when the possibility hit a dead end. Each possible solution was visualized with symbols, such as words, numbers or diagrams. This was "symbol manipulation" -- the people were iteratively exploring a formal system looking for a matching pattern that solved the puzzle. Newell and Simon were able to simulate the step by step problem solving skills of people with computer programs; they created programs that used the same algorithms as people and were able to solve the same problems. This type of research, using both experimental psychology and computer models, was called "cognitive simulation" by Hubert Dreyfus. Their work was profoundly influential: it contributed to the cognitive revolution of the 1960s, in addition to the founding of the fields of cognitive science and cognitivism in psychology. This line of research suggested that human problem solving consisted primarily of the manipulation of high-level symbols.
