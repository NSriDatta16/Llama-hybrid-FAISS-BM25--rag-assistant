After a touchesBegan event is fired the UIKit looks for a positional movement of the finger touch which translates into touchedMoved events as the x/y of the finger is changed until the finger is lifted and the touchesEnded event is fired. If the finger is held down in one place it will not fire the touchesMoved event until there is movement. I am building an app where you have to draw based on touchesMoved and it does happen at intervals but it is fast enough to give a smooth drawing appearance. Since it is an event and buried in the SDK you might have to do some testing in your scenario to see how fast it responds, depending on other actions or events it could be variable to the situation it is used. In my experience it is within a few ms of movement and this is with about 2-3k other sprites on the screen. The drawing does start on the touchesBegan event though so the first placement is set then it chains to the touhesMoved and ends with the touchesEnd. I use all the events for the drag operation, so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case. To test in your app you could put a timestamp on each event if it is crucial to your design and work out some sort of easing. http://developer.apple.com/IPhone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIResponder/touchesMoved:withEvent :
