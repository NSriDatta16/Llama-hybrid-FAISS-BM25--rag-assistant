ceteras is right, WHERE text_field returns true where text_field = '1' (for some obscure reason). However, pay attention : NULL is not equal to an empty string (NULL is not even equal to NULL !). If you want to select every row where the column text_field is not empty , you would have to do something like this : SELECT * FROM table WHERE LENGTH(text_field) > 0; -- or SELECT * FROM table WHERE text_field <> ''; The last query can use an index if wanted, I am not so sure about the first.
