Fisher's test with large data

I want to compare the proportions in two samples, that can be organized as P NP SAMPLE_A 3,129,548 427,953 SAMPLE_B 2,930,639 407,353 If I look at the proportions I see that P NP SAMPLE_A 88% 12% SAMPLE_B 87.8% 12.2% which is a pretty good result, considering the kind of phenomenon under investigation. However, since I'm dealing with millions of observations, both the Fisher's test and the Chi-Square approximation give p-values so low that I have to conclude that any difference of proportions that I observe is significant --- which is not: considering what I'm analyzing, a difference of 0.3% is not meaningful. My question is: instead of simply show the similar proportions, can I do further analysis in order to better characterize such a similarity?
