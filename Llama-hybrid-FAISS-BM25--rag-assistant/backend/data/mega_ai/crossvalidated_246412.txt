Interpretation of logistic regression: can I convert the coefficient change to probability change?

In classic interpretation of logistic regression, We convert the coefficients to odds changes (using exponent). For example, if the coefficient is $1.0$, $\exp(1.0)=2.7$, we say the odds is $2.7$ times higher. My question is that: can we talk in probability changes, using odd changes is still not convinenet? Say if the coefficient is $1.0$, the probability will increase or multiply or (other relationship) by $x$ amount? I think the relationship is just plogis (as shown in plot), but how can I talk in English?
