How to do low scale logistic regression?

Let's I have data on 10 customers. For example, I have their Age, gender, income, marital status and whether they bought a car or not. Now I have another new customer data. How can I predict/find out whether this new customer will buy a car or not? Is there any logistic regression for low sample data? Is there any simple statistical approach that can guide us to know whether the new customer will buy a car or not? Or it simply cannot be done (effectively) because of low data? I understand with low data, we cannot make any reliable predictions but don't organizations in real time face this challenge? Do they use any simple statistical technique like t test, chi squared test, hypothesis test etc to at least gain some insight on whether he will buy a car or not?
