Try Weka ... it's a free data mining tool that implements a lot of machine learning algorithms. It has a GUI and an API, so you can use it directly to on your data set or you can program against it. If you like the results from the various machine learning algorithms and you're still interested in implementing your own algorithms, then you can implement the one(s) that you like the most. This will also help you remove some of the "will it actually work" feeling that you normally get before you build an ML/AI algorithm.
