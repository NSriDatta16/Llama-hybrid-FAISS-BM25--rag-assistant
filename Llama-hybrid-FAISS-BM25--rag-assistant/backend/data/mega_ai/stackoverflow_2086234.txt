Query Excel worksheet in MS-Access VBA (using ADODB recordset)

I'd like to query an Excel worksheet in VBA and specify conditions. The simple query "SELECT * FROM [PCR$]" works perfectly, but I don't know how to add a WHERE clause. I tried cmd2.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM [PCR$] WHERE ([B1] IS NOT NULL)" but then it complains about missing parameters. This is the complete code: Dim rs2 As New ADODB.Recordset Dim cnn2 As New ADODB.Connection Dim cmd2 As New ADODB.Command Dim intField As Integer Dim strFile As String strFile = fncOpenFile If strFile = "" Then Exit Sub With cnn2 .Provider = "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0" .ConnectionString = "Data Source='" & strFile & "'; " & "Extended Properties='Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes;IMEX=1'" .Open End With Set cmd2.ActiveConnection = cnn2 cmd2.CommandType = adCmdText cmd2.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM [PCR$]" rs2.CursorLocation = adUseClient rs2.CursorType = adOpenDynamic rs2.LockType = adLockOptimistic rs2.Open cmd2
