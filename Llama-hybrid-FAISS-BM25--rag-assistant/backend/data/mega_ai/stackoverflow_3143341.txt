Perfomance difference between Open GL and UI kit for a map based application

I am currently working on a navigation based app which uses third party maps. I use a lot of tiling. Though the maps are of very high resolution, I estimate an average of 6 tiles each of 256 * 256 pixels loaded . I might refresh the tiles like once in five minutes. I am currently using UIScrollview + tiles... Should I really switch to Open GL ? I am hestitant to use Open GL because all the zoom functions and scrolling have to be hard coded in case of Open Gl. Could some one please suggest the performance difference I would have? Thanks
