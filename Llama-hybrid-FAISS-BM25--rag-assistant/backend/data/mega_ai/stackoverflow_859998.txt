Passing primitive type to WCF RESTful service

I've been banging my head against the wall for the past couple of hours, here's what we're trying to do: a method expects a primitive/simple type as the request body. Originally we tried with a boolean, but that didn't work so we tried with string and object. Same thing. Here's the server-side code [OperationContract] [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "/foo/{foo_id}/bar", Method = "POST", ResponseFormat=WebMessageFormat.JSON)] string G(string foo_id, string content); And here's the request in Fiddler: Header: User-Agent: Fiddler Host: localhost Content-Type: 'application/json', Content-Length: 19 Body: "hello_world" We tried to wrap "hello_world" in a json object, like {"content":"hello_world"} but no luck. Any thoughts?
