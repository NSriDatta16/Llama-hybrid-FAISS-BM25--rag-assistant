STRONG and B have distinct semantic meaning now. There was a lot of effort to clean up semantically-ambiguous elements like that. Even HR got some attention. I use DL all the time, personally. It my workhorse KeyValuePair type. I sometimes find myself wishing it had more rigorous semantics, but then other times I'm thankful for its flexibility in allowing me to define its semantics contextually. I suppose it depends on your definition of 'useless', which I take to mean 'having no practical use whatsoever'. I don't really know of any element in HTML5 I could say that I'll never use under any circumstances.
