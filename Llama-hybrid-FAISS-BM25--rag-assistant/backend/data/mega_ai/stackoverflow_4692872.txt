If you are wanting it to work without the use of javascript then it seems the only method you have is to forgo the initial scale down with css. You will want to do this in the "antiquated" way of adjusting the width and height of the image in the markup. This would allow you to still keep your layout in tact if the user agent is not up to date. ** I don't know if the percentage works in the literal height/width definition. But you can always figure out the ratio you need and plug it in.
