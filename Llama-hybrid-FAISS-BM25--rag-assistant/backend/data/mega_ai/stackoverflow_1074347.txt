I don't know the answer to your question, but have some points to make: I edited your question to make clear that you're asking about Process Templates I also clarified that you're talking about Team Projects, and not Visual Studio project files. These two edits together should keep people from thinking you're asking about the things that show up when you use File->Add New Project. Finally, you should consider that process templates can be customized. You may want to organize around the set of fields, instead of by the template, unless you need information about the template itself.
