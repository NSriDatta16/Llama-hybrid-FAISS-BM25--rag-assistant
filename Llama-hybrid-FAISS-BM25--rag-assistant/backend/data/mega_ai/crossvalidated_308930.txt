This sounds a bit like a scenario that calls for Dirichlet or Chinese Restaurant processes. The Dirichlet distribution is commonly used as a prior for multinomial or categorical distributions (to which it is prior), but these require knowing the number of possible categories in advance. To solve this, people sometimes turn to processes , which essentially probability distributions over probability distributions. The Chinese Restaurant Process is usually described with this analogy. Suppose there was a giant Chinese restaurant with countably-infinite number of round tables*, numbered starting at 1. The first customer to enter the restaurant sits down at Table 1. The subsequent customers either "found" a new table, with probability $\frac{\alpha}{n - 1 + \alpha}$ or join the customers already at the $k$th table with probability $\frac{c_k}{n - 1 + \alpha}$, where $c_k$ is the number of customers at the $k$th table and $n$ customers total. This seems very similar to your scenario, where one is likely to see more of the trees already seen the most, but might encounter a rare new species too. I think the original reference is Aldous (1985). I liked this tutorial by Gershman and Blei (2011) , and it has become a pretty standard topic in Bayesian non-parametric methods. * The tables are invariably described as 'round', and the restaurant 'Chinese'. I have no idea why the roundness is emphasized, but the Chinese part is allegedly it is due to the seemingly-infinite seating capacity of Chinese restaurants in San Francisco. If your group memberships are not 'hard' and a data point can partially belong to multiple groups, you may want to look into the amusingly-named Indian Buffet process instead.
