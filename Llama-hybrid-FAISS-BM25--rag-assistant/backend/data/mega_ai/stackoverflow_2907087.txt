Embedding a scripting engine in C++

I'm researching how to best extend a C++ application with scripting capability, and I am looking at either Python or JavaScript. User-defined scripts will need the ability to access the application's data model. Have any of you had experiences with embedding these scripting engines? What are some potential pitfalls?
