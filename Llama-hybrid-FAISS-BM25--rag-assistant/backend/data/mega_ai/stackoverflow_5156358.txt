The source of the Javascript is irrelevant for the purposes of HTML being embedded within the page. What matters is the location of the page the HTML is embedded within. For instance, if you load a page from example.com/index.php , and some Javascript loaded from example.com/js/script.js inserts some HTML into the main page, then image path references are going to be relative to / , as that's where the page was loaded from, not from /js . As for embedding PHP in JS, you're right - but you can have PHP emit a .js file trivially: var settings = ; would generate perfectly valid Javascript, even thought it came from a PHP file.
