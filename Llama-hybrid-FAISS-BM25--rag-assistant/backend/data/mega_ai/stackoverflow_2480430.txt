I think you should wrap/proxy each web service that needs to be implemented. This might sound like a lot of work for each service, but you may be able to find common themes. Details: Provide a WS from your web server that takes the user's profile identity and then actually calls the real web service with the correct credentials (retrived from server-side storage). Thus, no credentials need to be made available to the user in the client. The client javascript only needs to call your server. And you can implement your SSO API by wrapping the other services. Caution: Double check the "fair use" license for each web service. Some of them will detect high number of calls from a single IP as a violation of their service agreement and then block or black-list your server.
