Any prior on $\alpha$ (or $\beta$ ) is admissible as long as it satisfies the requirements of the beta distribution in your parameterization, usually $\alpha >0$ and $\beta >0$ , and as long as it yields a finite posterior. Assuming univariate priors and independence of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , one option might be the exponential distribution, since it's bounded by $0$ . Additionally, it has a mode at $0$ , meaning that plausible values will tend to be small. Some might find this attractive because they may desire only vague prior information. In this case, your prior is $$p(\alpha)=\lambda_\alpha\exp(-\lambda_\alpha \alpha)$$ $$p(\beta)=\lambda_\beta\exp(-\lambda_\beta \beta)$$ But this is just an example. Any non-negative prior is an option. Modern Bayesian inference software such as Stan dose not restrict you to conjugate priors.
