Simply subtract away the millisecond part: DateTime myTime = DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay; myTime = myTime.AddMilliseconds(-myTime.Millisecond); It could be done in less code, without first assigning to myTime : DateTime myTime = DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.AddMilliseconds( -DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.Millisecond); Although somewhat elegant, it is a bad idea. When accessing TimeOfDay twice, there is a chance that it at some point will have passed another millisecond before the second access. In that case the result would not be zero milliseconds.
