When an entity is currently managed (attached to a session), all updates to it are directly reflected to the underlying storage even without calling persist() . In your case, you load your entity, so it's in the session. Then even if you don't call persist() it will be updated in the database on transaction commit. The persist() description from the javadoc: Make an entity instance managed and persistent. This means that the method doesn't do anything in your case, since your entity is both persistent and managed. P.S. Where I say "session", understand "entity manager"
