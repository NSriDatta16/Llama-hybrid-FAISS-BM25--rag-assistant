Output of ANN with zero initialized weights represents what?

In class we discussed that if the weights of an ANN (standard feed forward NN in binary classification setting [0,1]) are initialized all at zero, the ANN fails to break symmetrie and therefore, the units in each layer develop equivalently. My professor stated at the end that the vector of predictions at the end represents something and I forgot what exactly. The resulting vector that contains one element for each observation has everywhere the same value 0.425. Is it the average conditional probability for beeing in class 1?
