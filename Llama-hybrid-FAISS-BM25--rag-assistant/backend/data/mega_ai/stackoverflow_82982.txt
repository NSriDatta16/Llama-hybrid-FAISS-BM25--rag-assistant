Hang on, the encapsulation point is a valid one but flash can execute JS functions, and Seldaek is right that an HTML element with a higher z-index should float on the flash movie. So if you did all the drag handling in JS and had the flash read its own dimensions and the position of the pointer in the app it could signal JS methods that slave element(s) to the pointer even (especially) when the pointer leaves the boundaries of the flash app. It would be pretty hairy though.
