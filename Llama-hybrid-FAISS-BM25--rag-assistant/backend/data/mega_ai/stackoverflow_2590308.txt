The best bet would be to take a look at the Audio Queue Services API . This is basically the next "deeper" level into the Core Audio stack provided by Apple. Unfortunately, the chasm between AVAudioRecorder and Audio Queue Services is vast. AQS is a C-based API and a fairly low level abstraction of the even more "raw" lowest levels of Core Audio. I would suggest reviewing the guide above, then taking a look at the example SpeakHere . It should easily be able to handle your current requirement. No matter which API, you will have to handle the "intermediate" storage of your PCM data, probably temporarily storing it as a WAV or raw PCM, which you then reload and append with PCM data when continuing.
