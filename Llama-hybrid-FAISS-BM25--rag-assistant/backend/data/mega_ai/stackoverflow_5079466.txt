Hide Emacs echo area during inactivity

The echo area is the line at the bottom of Emacs below the mode line: ~ ~ | | +-----------------------+ |-U:--- mode-line | +-----------------------+ | M-x echo-area | +-----------------------+ Now the mode line is highly customizable while the echo area is more rigid (and unused a lot of the time). The question is pretty simple: is it possible to hide the echo area during inactivity and redisplay it once it needs your attention: ~ ~ ~ ~ | | | | | | +-----------------------+ | | |-U:--- mode-line | +-----------------------+ +-----------------------+ |-U:--- mode-line | | M-x echo-area | +-----------------------+ +-----------------------+ Inactive Active This is similar to the way Google Chrome displays URLs when you hover your mose over a link and the Firefox addon Pentadactyl where the command-line is hidden by default.
