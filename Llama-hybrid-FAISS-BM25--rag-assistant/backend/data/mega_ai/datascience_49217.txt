Maximize Precision Deep Learning

For some binary image classification problems having close to 100% precision is super important and recall is much less important. What are best practices for maximizing precision? Setting the probability threshold for model.predict() greater than 0.5 seems like a reasonable approach. Are there any other recommended methods?
