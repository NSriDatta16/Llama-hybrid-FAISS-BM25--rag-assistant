I think the most straight forward approach (keep in mind there are several ways to skin this cat) is to perform a simple regression analysis on the difference in pre- and post-test scores with a single independent dummy variable for gender. So for example, you'd want to preprocess your data and obtain $y_{diff_i}=y_{pre_i}-y_{post_i}$ for the $i$ th subject $i=1$ to $39$ . Then simply fit the model: $y_{diff_i}=\beta_0+\beta_{gender}X_{gender_i}+\epsilon_i$ If you are interested in testing for a gender effect, you'd test whether: $H_0: \hat{\beta}_{gender}=0$ vs. $H_1: \hat{\beta}_{gender}\ne0$ . Then, assuming there's no gender effect, to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the pre and post tests, you simply test whether: $H_0: \hat{\beta}_0=0$ vs. $H_1: \hat{\beta}_0\ne0$ . If you do find an important gender effect, you'd want to go about determining the average increase in score for each gender separately with the use of a contrast. Assuming men are coded 1 and women are coded 0, then estimated pre-post change for men becomes: $\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_{gender}$ and the average pre-post test change for women is estimated by just $\hat{\beta}_0$ . So continuing with your toy example, in R this could be fit as follows: > y_diff=pre-post > myfit summary(myfit) Call: lm(formula = y_diff ~ gender) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.1334 -0.9911 0.4681 1.1861 2.4989 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -3.1081 0.4209 -7.385 8.75e-09 *** gender -0.3158 0.5480 -0.576 0.568 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 1.683 on 37 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.008892, Adjusted R-squared: -0.01789 F-statistic: 0.332 on 1 and 37 DF, p-value: 0.568 Of course, you'll need to carry out the usual model diagnostics and such, but I think you are familiar with those details. Other possible methods include fitting a model and adjusting for the pre-test score as well as gender: $y_{post_i}=\beta_0+\beta_{gender}X_{gender_i}+\beta_{pre}Y_{pre_i}+\epsilon_i$ .
