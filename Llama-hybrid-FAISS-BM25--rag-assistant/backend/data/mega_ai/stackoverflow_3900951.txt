A program to control memory for a task in C

I have got a task to solve, that is a bit cryptic. The task is to make a program in C that handles texts messages, the program should simulate a system with a small amount of memory, the system should only be able to hold X messages with maximum X characters, every character takes 1 byte (ASCII). To manage messages should I make a system that is held in the primary memory (to simulate a system with limited memory). When the program starts the program should allocate ONE memory area for all information for messages. This is called the metadatastructure in the task: The memory area used for storage in its entirety to be continuous in memory, but divided in 32 bytes data blocks, the amount of data blocks in the system should be limited to 512. The tasks also says that i should create X number data blocks , X depends on with value X number messages the system is set to contain. I believe I need to create a structure like a ring buffer to hold every message (data block?). This is called the bitmap for data blocks : To keep track of witch data block that is free and busy I have to implement a bitmap where I have 1 but for each data block. The bit value is 0(busy)/ 1(free). This bitmap should be used to find free data blocks when I want to add a message, the bitmap should be up to date when the systems deletes or creates a data block for a message. The allocated memory for this system should be divided into 3 blocks /areas , 1 for the metadatastructure, 1 for the bitmap for each data block and 1 for data blocks. I need help to thing aloud about solutions and how this can be solved in C. Thanks
