Developing on a local server should be faster since you can preview all the changes "live", without uploading the updated files to the hosted server. So yeah, I'd recommend working locally. I use Wamp myself. As for the database, you can export it in PHPMyAdmin (ships with Wamp). It should generate a gigantic query (a set of queries, actually), which you can then execute on your site to create the tables and fill them with content.
