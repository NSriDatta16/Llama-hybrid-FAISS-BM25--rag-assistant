See documentation on thttpd as to why single threaded non blocking IO is good . Indeed it makes good sense for static files. If you are doing CGI however, you may have a script that runs for a long time. It's nicer to not hold up all the quicker simpler traffic, especially if the script has an infinite-loop bug in it and is to eventually be killed anyway! With threads the average response time experienced by users will be better - if some of the requests are very time consuming. If the files being served come from disk and are not in main memory already, a similar argument can be used.
