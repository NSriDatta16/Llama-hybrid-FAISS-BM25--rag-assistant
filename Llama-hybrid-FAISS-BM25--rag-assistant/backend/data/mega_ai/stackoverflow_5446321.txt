How to organize swing stuff in Java (labels, buttons, anything)

I'm writing a Java program which is GUI (swing/awt stuff). Is it sensible to build the entire GUI in one method? That is, create and add every label, button, menubar, menu, menu item, etc. Is there a better way to organize this? What about the events? Thanks!
