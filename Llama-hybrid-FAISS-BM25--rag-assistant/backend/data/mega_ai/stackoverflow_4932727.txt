WPF RTP Streaming

I am currently in the process of writing an application that will receive an RTP Video Stream from a VLC Client. I am hoping to implement this in WPF and so have been looking for any solutions online to help me. So far I've skimmed over Live555 RTP Streaming and considering the possibility of embedding a VLC client into the WPF Application. I also looked at WpfMediaKit but I could not get that to work properly, which is probably my own fault. I am just wondering if it is at all possible to do the video streaming over RTP purely through WPF or will I have to make use of an external library. Thanks, Stuart.
