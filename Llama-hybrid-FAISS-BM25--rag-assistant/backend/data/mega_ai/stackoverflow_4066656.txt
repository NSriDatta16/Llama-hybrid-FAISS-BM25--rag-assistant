Ipad piano-like app help!

I am writing an iPad piano-like app. I firstly created the keys by UIButton, everything worked fine but when I want to slide from one key to another I found that it's a drag-out action (of the first button) rather than touch down action (of the second button) so Just wondering does anyone know any ways to disable the dragging of UIbutton or any other better way to do that sliding ?
