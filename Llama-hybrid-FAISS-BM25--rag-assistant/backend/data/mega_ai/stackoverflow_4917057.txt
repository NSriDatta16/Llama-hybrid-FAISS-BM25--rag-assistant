From a prioritisation perspective: software development has the end goal delivered functionality, and if you can't deploy, then you can't deliver any functionality. For most projects - web or otherwise - the first story should be something like "As a user, I want to be able to install the product, so I can run it." This usually causes the development of the deployment mechanism to be done very early, and maintained as the codebase changes when additional stories are completed. The deployment mechanism should be your way of delivering functionality to the customer for approval and testing. It is very important to avoid getting to the end of a project and having to ask "okay, now how do we deploy it?" Edited to add: Also make 100% certain you're aware of the licencing and distribution restrictions on any third-party components you're using. Pay particular attention to any Free code that may be covered by licences like the GPL. Check whether any commercial components you're using require royalties per deployment, or require special 'server' licences.
