autocorrelation interpretation (annual bird surveys)

I am following a method used by others (McCrimmon et al. 1997 Ecological Applications 7(2):581-592) to look for trends in the annual count of nesting pairs of birds at 29 nest sites over a 42 year period. We graphed the time series and the first differences (FDs) of total annual counts. FDs presumably show a trend in the population (FDs >0 show increasing, and The graph of count of annual pairs and associated FDs: ACF Model Description Model Name MOD_8 Series Name 1 sum_pairs; 2 FDs total pairs Transformation None Non-Seasonal Differencing 0 Seasonal Differencing 0 Length of Seasonal Period No periodicity Maximum Number of Lags 41 Process Assumed for Calculating the Standard Errors of the Autocorrelations Independence(white noise)a Display and Plot All lags Applying the model specifications from MOD_8 a Not applicable for calculating the standard errors of the partial autocorrelations. We are limited to posting only 2 links, but we have the PACF chart and the ACF and PACF output and charts for the FDs. We read many of the other posts, and it appears our data are sinusoidal, with about a 20 year lag interval to the lowest inflection point, then a 20 year lag rising to flatline around 0 towards the end of the dataset. How do we interpret this chart overall, and the importance of this weak upswing? The PACFs are within the confidence intervals after year 1 and the years alternate positive and negative in an uneven number at each uptick or downtick. Again, we are unfamiliar with how to interpret these data and will appreciate any input. We produced the same analyses for the FDs.
