I'm not sure how you end up with 3 times bigger, as conversions between classes scale in powers of 2. The only explanation I can think of is that the original image, im was probably a uint8 with 3 color channels. This upon conversion to grayscale and double , becomes 8/3~2.67 times as big. However, it doesn't look like you're going from 3 dims to 1, unless if you didn't post that part of the code here. As for using SVDs to reduce storage, if you re-multiply your matrices, you're going back to a full matrix with the exact same number of elements as you started with and hence you'll get the same sized image.
