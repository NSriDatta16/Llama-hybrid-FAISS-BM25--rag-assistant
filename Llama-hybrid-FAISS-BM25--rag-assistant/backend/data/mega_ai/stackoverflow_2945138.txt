We are the victim of a crummy exception message. Loading assemblies with Assembly.Load(byte[]) that contain unmanaged code is not supported. This is the subject of this feedback item . UPDATE: the linked feedback item is gone, deleted as part of the cleanup at VS2012 release time. The only part of it could still recover is this fragment, copied from another web page: “[…] we only allow ILOnly images to be loaded […] since anything else is not safe”-- UPDATE: link fixed with archive.org backup copy.
