Pure C that mimics object-oriented programming?

Possible Duplicates: Object oriented programming in C Can you write object oriented code in C? Hi I know there are some coding styles for pure C that mimics object-oriented programming : "method call"(functions) on "objects"(struct) .c and .h organisation, and so on... What are your habits about that ? Is there some good tutorial on that ? Or examples ?
