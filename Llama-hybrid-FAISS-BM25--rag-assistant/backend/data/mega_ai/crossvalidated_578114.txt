Here is a simulation of the sampling and calculation, done in R . If you don't have R installed you can copy the code below and run it here, https://rdrr.io/snippets/ . I include two different ways of sampling. Out of the $N = num\_fams*4$ individuals, define $n = roundup(p*N)$ and sample $n$ individuals (without replacement). This guarantees that exactly $n$ are sampled. For each person, sample them with probability $p$ . The mean number of people sampled is $n = p*N$ , and there is some variation in the exact number sampled. The number sampled follows a binomial distribution. My approach is to simulate a sample of $N$ people as 1s and 0s, where 1s indicate that person has been sampled. Add them up in groups of 4, giving num_fams values ranging from 0-4, then count the number of values that equal to 1, saved as num_singletons . That gives the number of families that had exactly 1 person sampled, and also equals the number of people who were not in a family with another selected. Then I classify the simulation as a "success" in two ways. 1) if the number of singletons is less than half the total number sampled we count that as a success. 2) is inspired by @ThomasLumley's answer, if the number of singletons is less than the number of families with 2 or more sampled we count that as a success. num_fams 1) > num_singletons) { successful_fams[i] [1] 79.7053 mean(successes) #> [1] 1 mean(successful_fams) #> [1] 0.4815 # random number to sample set.seed(1234) successes 1) > num_singletons) { successful_fams[i] [1] 79.6984 mean(successes) #> [1] 1 mean(successful_fams) #> [1] 0.4792 Created on 2022-06-08 by the reprex package (v2.0.1) As we can see, taking $p = 0.3280935$ results in a roughly 50% chance of the second type of success, but is far too high for the first type of success. There are on average 79.7 individuals without any sampled family members, but we are sampling 262.4 individuals on average. So only ~30% of individuals are alone in their family. Fiddling with the proportion, it looks like taking $p = 0.208$ makes the first type of success have a probability of about 50%.
