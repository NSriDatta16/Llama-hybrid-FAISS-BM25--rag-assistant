DIV goes to another line when resizing the browser

I have a main div, and inside it..I have 2 divs, both left aligned. For some reason(or property), when I drag the right of my firefox to make the browser smaller, the 2nd div goes on to the second line. I would like this div to stay on the first line, instead of jumping down a line. How can I do that? I am assuming overflow property?
