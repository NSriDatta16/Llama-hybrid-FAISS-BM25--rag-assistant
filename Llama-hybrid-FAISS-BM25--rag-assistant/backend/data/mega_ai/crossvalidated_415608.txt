Not splitting test set and just using competition public score

With relatively small (~700) training set, would it be better if I train model with XGboost+k-fold validation and just use public score to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data? I wonder if splitting out test set initially adds any value, especially on small data set. Is there any gain from testing model on internal test set and testing again with public score?
