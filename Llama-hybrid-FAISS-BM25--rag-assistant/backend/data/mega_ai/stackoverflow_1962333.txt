What you are looking for is the glue to make it work, as you have a storage ( your database ) and the user interface. But, as you pointed out just right, your onClick actions, or more widely spoken, your whole user-interaction needs to be filled with action. I won't give you a specific advice here as I think you should read a bit about the Model-View-Controller Pattern here, as well as about how Android handles all that stuff. A good entrypoint for gaining knowledge is, as always, Wikipedia. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to offend you by not answering the specific question: I just think it's more valuable for you to first learn the basics required for building great apps instead of reading a step-by-step manual!
