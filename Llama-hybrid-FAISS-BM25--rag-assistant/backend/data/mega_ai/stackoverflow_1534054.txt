Use the language that best supports what you want to do. If you're going to be doing a bunch of string processing, perl is one of the better choices. If you need speed, then a (possibly pseudo-) compiled language might fit your needs, such as C, C++, Java, etc. If you want to do something simple, then batch scripting (+ grep/awk/sed/whatever) might be what you're looking for. PHP definitely has its uses, but if that's all you know, then you're locking your future up in a box and putting yourself at a disadvantage. Pick up a copy of "The Pragmatic Programmer: Journeyman to Master" -- one of the key gems is to 'learn at least one new language a year'. Then you'll know the answer your own question above.
