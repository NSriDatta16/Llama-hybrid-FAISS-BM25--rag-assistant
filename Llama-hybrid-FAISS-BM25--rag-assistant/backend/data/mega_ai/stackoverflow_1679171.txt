i once was in the same situation you are. at first during development, there were no wcf services for data access available, so i used nhibernate for data access. to ease switching from direct nhibernate access to wcf services for data retrieval, i had something like : client app -> Repository Interfaces -> Repository Implementations (at first this one retrieved the data through nhibernate, the second implementation via wcf). having an interface that hides the implementation details from your application code may be a suitable solution for your problem. (btw, the nhibernate data access code was mainly reused on the server side, so you wonÂ´t have to throw stuff away).
