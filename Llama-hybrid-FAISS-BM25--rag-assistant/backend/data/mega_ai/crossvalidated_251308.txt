It looks like you're interested in some kind of hierarchical clustering here. Take a look at the hclust function, it will do the work of producing a classification tree. However, your data seem to have many zeros, so you'll need to use a proper data transformation to deal with that, take a look at the vegan::decostand function and the hellinger transformation. Sometimes, it's not so easy to find the best limit to define the groupings, using Bootstrap can help, take a look at the pvclust package.
