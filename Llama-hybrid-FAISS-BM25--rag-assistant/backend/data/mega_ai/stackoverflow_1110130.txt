VNC won't send a Ctrl+Drag event, so its usefulness for something like Interface Builder is nil... I've been looking for a remoting program that will send a Ctrl+Drag; if anyone has developed using Interface Builder remotely, I'm very interested. (Mac Mini, being controlled by XP SP3; have tried TightVNC, UltraVNC, several others -- prefer a free solution but would be willing to pay at this point.)
