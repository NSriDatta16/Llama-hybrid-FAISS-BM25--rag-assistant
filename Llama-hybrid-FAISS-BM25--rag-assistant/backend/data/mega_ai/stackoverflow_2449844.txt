You can use javascript to do client-side file management if you have special permission from the browser (or other javascript-executing agent) to do so. One good way to get that is to have your script installed as part of a plug-in for Firefox or Chrome, using a toolkit such as Greasemonkey . So, the answer is "yes, but ask for permission first!"
