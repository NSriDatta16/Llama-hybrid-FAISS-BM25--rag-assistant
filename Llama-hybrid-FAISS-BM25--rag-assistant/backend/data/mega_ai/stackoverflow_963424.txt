I don't beleave it works because the agent is running as a system service so it has limited network access (I beleave). Instead of trying to use a post build step to copy the output, I think you should look into using TeamCity's Build Artifact's . That's what we use at my work altho we are new to TeamCity as well. What I don't know is if Build Artifact system will do extactly what you want.
