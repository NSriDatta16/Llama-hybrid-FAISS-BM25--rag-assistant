PCA-like analysis for dataset that has both categorical and continuous variables

I have a dataset containing a categorical variable and multiple continuous variables. The categorical variables are coded as discrete integers, whereas the continuous variables are just a range of floats. I believe that the variance in my dataset can be almost entirely described by the single categorical variable and one of the many continuous variables. To justify this, I would be interested in using PCA, but I'm not sure the best approach to use when I am considering categorical data. Any suggestions?
