Note that you have 4 features and only 6 data points. It is very likely the perfect separation was happening in your example. To fix this, you can add more data points (use the whole data instead of just some samples), reduce number of features, or add regularization. One of my answers have the demo of the problem and why regularization will help. Is there any intuitive explanation of why logistic regression will not work for perfect separation case? And why adding regularization will fix it?
