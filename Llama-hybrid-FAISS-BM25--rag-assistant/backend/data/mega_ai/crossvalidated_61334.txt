Logistic regression, "sum" confidence interval

I have an existing fitted logit regression model. Model: $\hat{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\hat{\beta}x}}$ With parameter estimates $\hat{\beta}$, and observation $x$ Given a new set of datapoints $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ and $o_1,\ldots,o_n$, I want to construct a confidence interval for $E=\sum_i \hat{p}(x_i)$. To goal is to check if $O=\sum_i o_i$ is (not) significantly different. For a single observation, you can construct a confidence interval for the probability quite easily. Given $\hat{\beta}$ is normally distributed, and the confidence interval for these estimates is ($\hat{\beta}_{0.025}, \hat{\beta}_{0.975}$), the confidence interval for the predictor is: ($\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\hat{\beta}_{0.025}x}}$, $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\hat{\beta}_{0.975}x}}$). Is there a good way to get the confidence interval for the "sum" of the predicted probabilities?
