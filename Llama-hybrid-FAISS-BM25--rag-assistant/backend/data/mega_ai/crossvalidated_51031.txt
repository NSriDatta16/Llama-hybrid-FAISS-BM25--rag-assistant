Regression with time series is generally not advisable as there may be (will be) autocorrelation in the residuals. When building a predictive model with time series data one needs to be concerned with how many time trends (if any) are needed how many (if any) level shifts are needed what differencing is needed what is the appropriate autoregressive lag structure (ARMA) are there any outliers that need to be treated so that the model parameters are not impacted by the unusual are the parameters constant over time is the variance of the errors constant over time is there a need to incorporate causal variables. Post your data and your analysis for one of your data sets and I will report my results taking into account the above considerations.
