A few ideas. When I first read this question, I thought "just measure distance from the center." Then I read the comments. Dikran Marsupial suggested converting to polar coordinates, which is quite similar to what I had thought of. In another comment, Sycorax referenced a thread where he suggests using random forests for a similar problem. Sycorax's example is very well worked out, so I won't say more about that here. But I will modify a bit of his code code to create data. Let's try out mine and Dikran's. First, I'll make some data that looks more or less like what the question has (I increased the sample size and added some noise): set.seed(1234) N This produces which seems close. Now, just to check, let's try regression on this: m1 and, as expected, the parameter estimates are very close to 0 and not close to significant. So, let's find the polar coordinates: r and regress on r and $\theta$ (I don't expect $\theta$ to be useful). Lo and behold, it works: Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.59991 -0.26826 -0.07653 0.27481 0.99404 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.6992665 0.0222995 31.358 Of course, you could try different distance measures or modify things other ways.
