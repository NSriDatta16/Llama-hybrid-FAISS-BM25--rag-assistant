While not NER specific, the go-to PyTorch implementation of BERT (and many other transformer-based language models) is HuggingFace's PyTorch Transformers . There is plenty of documentation to get you started. They also have models which can directly be used for NER, such as BertForTokenClassification . I am not sure if you were looking for something higher-level, but as the question doesn't specify, this is the answer I would give to someone looking to use BERT in PyTorch.
