A great discussion of clustering in a Bayesian framework appears in: Hanson, Robin, John Stutz, and Peter Cheeseman. "Bayesian Classification Theory." http://robinhanson.com/ijcai91.pdf ... the AutoClass system searches for the most probable classifications, automatically choosing the number of classes and complexity of class descriptions ... ... evaluation function optimally trades off the complexity of the model with its fit to the data, and is used to guide an open-ended search for the best classification ... Note AutoClass does not use "true" clusters, and has a history of illuminating new meaningful classes to subject matter experts. https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/rse/synthesis-projects-applications/autoclass/
