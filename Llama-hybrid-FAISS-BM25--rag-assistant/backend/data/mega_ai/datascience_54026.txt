Similarity score: Can Sklearn SVR predict values greater than 1 and less than 0?

I am using svm.SVR() from scikit-learn to apply Logistic Regression on my training data to solve a similarity problem. Using GridSearchCV, I am finding the best hyper parameters using the scoring as "R2". The best hyperparameters are C=1, cache_size=200, coef0=0.0, degree=3, epsilon=0.001, gamma=0.005, kernel='rbf', shrinking=True, tol=0.001 . I fit the training data and training label as model.fit(X_train, Y_train) Now I use test data in the same model as: prediction = model.predict(X_test) The reason I am using SVM-Regression is to find similarity between two inputs. However, for some of the test data, the prediction contains value in negative (less than 0) and for all the same vs same comparison it returns the value as 1.09469178. I am expecting the value to be between 0 and 1. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong?
