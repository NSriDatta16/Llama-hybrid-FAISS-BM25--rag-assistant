The problem is that when you turn on VoiceOver, touch events are blocked by the system. To prove it, put a trace in your touchesBegan function. It should fire fine until you turn on VoiceOver. The little clicky sound you hear when you double tap is the VoiceOver over-ride gesture. VoiceOver has its own set of gestures but you can over-ride VoiceOver's gestures with a double-tap-hold. For example, swiping down does not scroll a page with VoiceOver on. But if you double-tap-hold, wait for the clicky sound and then swipe down, it will scroll.
