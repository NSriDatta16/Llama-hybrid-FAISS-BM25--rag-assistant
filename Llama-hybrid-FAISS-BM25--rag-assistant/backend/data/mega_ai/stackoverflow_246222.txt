I believe the datetime is physically stored as float so the improvement would be the same as when converting float to INT. I would rather use indexes as that is what they are designed for, and the datatime is designed for storing dates with times. There is a set of functions associated with the datetime so if you decide to use custom storage type you will need to take care of that yourself.
