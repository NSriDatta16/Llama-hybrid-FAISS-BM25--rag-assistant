Two assumptions are made: (1) the rate of US citizens to all people is the same within the Google+ population as in the global population, and (2) for US citizens, the rate of people with any surname to all US citizens is (on average) the same within the Google+ population as in the global population. So: you take, say, 200 surnames, and count how many US Google+ subscribers there are with these surnames ($USG_s$). Given assumption (2) (say the rate is $r_s$, found by dividing the number of US citizens with these surnames by the total number of US citizens), an estimate for the total number of US subscribers is found like this: $USG\sim USG_s/r_s$ Then, using assumption (1) you can use the same 'trick' to find an estimate of the total number of Google+ users. Simply put: if there are less people that are Google+ subscribers, there will be less US citizens that are Google+ subscribers (assumption (1)). By this and assumption (2), there will also be less US citizens with a given surname that are Google subscribers.
