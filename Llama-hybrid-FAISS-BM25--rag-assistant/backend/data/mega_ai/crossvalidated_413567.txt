How to classify time series trends into 2 groups: “contain seasonality” and “doesn't contain seasonality”

I'm optimizing prediction model for time series data trends. Each trend may have seasonality effect or may not. I want to classify each trend into one of the following groups: "seasonality" or "no seasonality". What is the best way to classify trends into those group? I have tried already to calculate the variance of each trend but it is not good enough. More complex solution is to use Kmeans or PCA but maybe there can be another solution.
