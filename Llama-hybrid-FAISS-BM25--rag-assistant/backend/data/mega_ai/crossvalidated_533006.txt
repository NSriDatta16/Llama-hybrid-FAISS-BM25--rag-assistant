You'd have to be careful what you mean by more likely. To make a traditional z interval with confidence $1-\alpha$ for normal mean $\mu$ $(\sigma$ known), you can begin with $P\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}L where $L$ and $U$ cut probability $\alpha/2$ from the lower and upper tails of standard normal distribution. So the highest density (likelihood) is between $L$ and $U.$ Then 'pivot' to get the $1-\alpha$ CI $\left( \bar X- \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}U,\; \bar X -\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}L \right)$ for $\mu.$ But be careful with the terminology: A 90% CI is shorter than a 95% interval, Similarly, if I am making a $1-\alpha$ nonparametric quantile bootstrap CI for $\mu$ for a sample from a distribution with mean $\mu,$ but unknown shape, I will re-sample of many values $\bar X^*$ ( a.re in the R code) based on re-samples of size $n$ with replacement from my sample x of $n$ observations from such a population. Consider the sample with numerical and graphical summaries below. summary(x); length(x); sd(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 29.31 61.85 69.10 67.71 75.80 106.72 [1] 50 # sample size [1] 13.87644 # sample SD boxplot(x, col="skyblue2", pch=20, horizontal=T) The data are pretty clearly not normal: Their normal probability plot is distinctly non-linear, and a Shapiro-Wilk test rejects normality. shapiro.test(x)$p.val [1] 0.03938396 qqnorm(x, datax=T); qqline(x, datax=T, col="blue") So, I decide against a t confidence interval, in favor of a bootstrap CI for $\mu,$ which has point estimate $\bar X = 67.71.$ A basic 95% quantile nonparametric bootstrap Ci $(63.8.\, 71.5)$ is obtained as shown below. [Bootstrap resampling is a random process, so results may differ slightly among runs, if you use a different seed (nor none). Three additional runs gave $(63.4, 71,4),$ $(63.7, 71.6),$ and $(63.6, 71.6).]$ set.seed(701) a.re = replicate(3000, mean(sample(x, 50, rep=T))) CI = quantile(a.re, c(.025, .975)); CI 2.5% 97.5% 63.84828 71.50980 The bootstrap distribution of re-sampled means is shown below, along with vertical lines for the confidence limits. The most commonly occurring resample averages are between the confidence limits, and near the point estimate $\bar X = 67.71.$ (For other, more sophisticated types of bootstrap CIs, similar arguments might be made that, in some sense, the "most likely" possible values of $\mu$ lie near the center of the CI.) hist(a.re, prob=T, col="skyblue2") abline(v = CI, col="red", lwd=2, lty="dotted") Notes: The data x used above was sampled in R from a Laplace distribution as follows: set.seed(2021) x = rexp(50, .1) - rexp(50, .1) + 70 Although I wouldn't have wanted to rely on it, the legendary robustness of t methods is evident here: A t confidence interval for $\mu$ is $(63.8, 71,7);$ not much different from the bootstrap CI above. [In this case with fictitious simulated data the 95% nonparametric CI does happen to contain the population mean $\mu = 70.$ Of course, in most real applications one never knows the true value of $\mu.$ ] t.test(x)$conf.int [1] 63.76484 71.65212 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95
