I'm not going to post code as this looks like homework. Buffer Overflow happens when you try to access a location of the buffer beyond its size. for example, in your hello(...) function this would be trying to access an element of the array inp larger than 15. You ask for the user to provide an index into the array and then gives back the value of that location of the array. Inorder to prevent an overflow you invariably need to make sure that the range of the index user specified is below the size of that array. I can't comment on the second code fragment because it's incomplete.
