Maybe a couple of examples will help to illustrate some of the issues. Suppose the two populations are $X \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 500, \sigma =30)$ and $Y \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 501, \sigma = 20.)$ If both sample sizes are $150,000,$ then there is sufficient power to detect the small difference in means. set.seed(422) x = rnorm(150000, 500, 30) y = rnorm(150000, 501, 20) t.test(x, y) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x and y t = -10.983, df = 261530, p-value If we use only the first 30,000 values in the first sample, results are very nearly the same for most practical purposes. t.test(x[1:30000], y) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x[1:30000] and y t = -6.3728, df = 35463, p-value = 1.879e-10 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -1.5126269 -0.8010336 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 499.8455 501.0023 Here is a boxplot of the data used in the second t test (the wider box indicates a larger sample): Issues of minimal concern: Even though labeled as 'Welch t tests', sample sizes are sufficiently large that these are essentially t tests. Unless the data are very far from normal, we would still detect the small difference in means. The power of the test is heavily dependent on the smaller sample size. But power is not a concern here. Issues warranting attention: With such large samples in the real world (not the simulation world), one is entitled to wonder whether data are truly simple random samples from their respective populations. Could smaller, more carefully collected samples provide better information? Although we did not do a formal test to confirm that variances differ, it seems clear from the boxplot that they do. In the Welch test, it is OK for variances to differ. But would different variances have important practical implications? Although the null hypothesis that the two population means are equal is soundly rejected with minuscule P-values, it is important to realize that "statistically significant" differences (by whatever definition) are not necessarily differences of practical importance or interest. For what purpose are you taking the effort of check whether means are different? And what do the results of the t test actually contribute to that purpose?
