R: Rolling rank of multivariate time series?

I want to rank a set of variables every day (starting with a zoo series). Here's an example: set.seed(1) x The only way I know to do this is with rollapply , but this is quite slow. > rollapply(x, 1, rank, by.column=FALSE) a b c 2010-01-01 1 3 2 2010-01-02 1 2 3 2010-01-03 1 2 3 Any other suggestions?
