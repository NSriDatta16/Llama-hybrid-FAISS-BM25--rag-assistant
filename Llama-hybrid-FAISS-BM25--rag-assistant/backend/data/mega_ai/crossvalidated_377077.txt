It is not correct to say that a sample size of 30 or so makes the central limit theorem apply. Take for example a sample from a log-normal distribution with n=50,000. The CLT when used to construct a confidence interval for the unknown mean yields very inaccurate limits. Use a method that does not assume normality, e.g. a nonparametric test. But note that none of this applies directly to time series when the multiple observations within a series are correlated.
