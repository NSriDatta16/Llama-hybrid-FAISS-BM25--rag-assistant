I think you may have a wire crossed - there is no such thing as _root in AS3. In AS1/AS2, _root was basically a global variable pointing to the stage (it's actually a little more complicated, since AS2 had a slightly messy way of organizing display objects). In AS3, the closest analogy is the stage property, but actually due to AS3's robust way of managing the display hierarchy you don't actually need to use stage very often. Anyway, for AS3 programming the only time you ever need to think about a _root is if you load in an AS2 SWF (which you should probably avoid if you can).
