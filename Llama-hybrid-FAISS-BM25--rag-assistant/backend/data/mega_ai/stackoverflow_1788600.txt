Given the choice between what you've proposed and fighting a hungry crocodile while covered in raw-beef-flavored marmalade and both hands tied behind my back, I'd choose the ... Well, OK on a more serious note, if you have data that doesn't abide by the any "sane" structure, you have to study the data and find frequencies of quirks in it and correlate the data for the given context (i.e. how it was generated) Print to OCR to get the data in is almost always going to lead to heart break. The company I work for employs a veritable army of people who manually read such documents and hand "code" (i.e. enter by hand) the data for known problematic OCR scenarios, or documents our customers detect the original OCR failed on. As for leveraging "Parsing Frameworks" these tend to expect data that will always follow the grammar rules you've laid out. The data you've described has no such guarantees. If you go that route be prepared for unexpected - though not always obvious - failures. By all means if there is any way possible to get the original data files, do so. Or if you can demand that those providing the data make their data come in a single well defined format, even better. (It might not be "YOUR" format, but at least it's a regular and predictable format you can convert from)
