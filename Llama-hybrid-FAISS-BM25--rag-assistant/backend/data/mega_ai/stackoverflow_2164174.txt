Surround them with #region MyInterface Members as Visual Studio does for you. It reduces readability if you use #region only for interface members. If on the other hand you use it for private variables, properties, methods, events and different interface members the code will become much more readable. You can also group members by functionality. One more option is to use a tool that does it for you. For example you can use NArrange - .NET Code Organizer/Formatter/Beautifier
