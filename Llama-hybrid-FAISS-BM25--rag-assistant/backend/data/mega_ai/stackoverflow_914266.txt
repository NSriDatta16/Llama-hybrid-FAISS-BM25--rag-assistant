what is worse for speed when loading CSS, a second LINK element or @import?

need to add a 2nd css stylesheet to a page. do i add a 2nd link line and load it by url, or add a @import to the original? what is worse for page load times? what is worse for server load? what is better for client side caching? what is better/more accepted 'in general'? (note: assume no cdn or memcache, just a normal regular average LAMP webserver setup)
