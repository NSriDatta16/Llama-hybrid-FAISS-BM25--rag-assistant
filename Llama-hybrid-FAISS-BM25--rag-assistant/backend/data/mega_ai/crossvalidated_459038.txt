Multiple Time Series in one Auto_arima code

I hope you can help me with the following. I am using the Auto_ARIMA function ( pmdarima library) to calculate my p, d and q values. For example, to calculate my p, d, q for "Product 1" I would run auto_arima(df['Product 1'], seasonal =True, m=12).summary() Is there a way I can "add" Product 2 and 3 to the same line of code? I tried the following, but it doesnt work auto_arima(df['Product 1' , 'Product 2', 'Product 3'], seasonal=True, m=12).summary() Any suggestions? My goal is to forecast the sales for multiple products.
