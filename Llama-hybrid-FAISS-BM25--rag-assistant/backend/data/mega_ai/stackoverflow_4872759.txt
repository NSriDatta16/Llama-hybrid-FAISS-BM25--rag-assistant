This can't work. this: for(String key:vector1){ } is a shortcut for this: for(Iterator it = vector1.iterator();it.hasNext();){ String key = it.next(); } And it works with one iterator only. Here's some code that gets close to what you want: // don't use vector, it's ancient and unofficially deprecated final List keyList = new ArrayList (); final List valueList = new ArrayList (); //... // add keys and values here final Map map = new HashMap (); for( Iterator it1 = keyList.iterator(), it2 = valueList.iterator(); // this works even if the lists have different sizes it1.hasNext() && it2.hasNext();){ map.put(it1.next(), it2.next()); } I also took the liberty to address some flaws in your code: Don't use Raw Types in new code (use generics) Don't use Vector , Hashtable or Enumeration , use ArrayList , HashMap , Iterator (respectively) instead. Many questions here cover this, including this one
