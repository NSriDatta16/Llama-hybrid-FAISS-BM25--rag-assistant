I've been using QCodo since beta 2, and am now a core contributer of QCubed, so yes, I've heard of it. What initially drew me to the framework was the code generation. I came from asp.net, and codesmith, and was very pleased to find a framework that gave me both the event-driven approach of asp.net and the code generation of codesmith. I also love that it's all pure OO PHP, which means I don't have to learn a new language to develop my PHP app, and customizing any aspect of the framework that doesn't behave like I want is simple. All of this has resulted in us being able to produce an easy to maintain and robust Learning Management System that we have sold to and host for numerous Fortune 500 companies. There are some downsides, such as the runtime overhead of an ORM approach, but the readability and clean layout of the code results in the ability to more easily streamline other aspects of the application, and significantly reduces both development time, and the number of bugs produced. Since QCubed is a community driven project, anyone is able to submit tickets, suggest improvements or discuss changes, it's very clear where the project is going, and very open to constructive feedback. In defense of some of the negative things said here, I will simply point out that tickets for most of the supposed "problems" simply have never been created. And I would encourage anyone that does encounter any of them to please create a ticket for us to look at at http://qcu.be .
