A more elegant solution may be to check the user's headers. Most browsers will allow users to set their preferred language in preferences. This in turn sends an HTTP header with the request. The header looks like this. Accept-Language : en-us,en;q=0.8,ar-ly;q=0.5,id;q=0.3 The value is a comma-delimited list of accepted languages, ordered by preference ( the q=x part is the preference). This way, you can automatically detect what language the user has opted to see the web, and display it if you have it.
