Eric, broadly speaking, your problem sounds severe enough that a search for off-the-shelf solutions seems misguided. Rather, you almost surely need recourse to bespoke modeling to exploit your special domain knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease. Unless you use a modeling approach that enables you to bring such knowledge to bear, you might not stand a chance against the formidible 'opponent' you are facing! Your best first step might be figuring out just what 'special domain knowledge' you actually possess. Can you simulate the process that generated your data (i.e., the data-generating process or DGP ), including the (left-truncation) process governing the entry of individuals into your data set? Once you can simulate the DGP, Bayesian methods should enable you to 'challenge' your simulation model with data—e.g., to estimate your model's parameters. Notwithstanding Odd Aalen's fin de siècle skepticism about Bayesian methods for survival analysis [1], I note that there is now at least one text on such approaches [2]. If I were faced with such a problem, I would be inclined first to explore it through simulation and Bayesian inference. Perhaps I would learn enough in that process to formulate simpler process models that might yield to more traditional frequentist estimation approaches. The interplay between simpler models and richer simulations might indeed yield its own valuable forms of insight and understanding. I hope you will eventually update us all here on what approach you eventually adopt, and how it works out! Aalen OO. Medical statistics - no time for complacency.
