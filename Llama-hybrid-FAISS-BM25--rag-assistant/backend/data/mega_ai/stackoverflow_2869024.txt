I think you might need a space after attachment; : header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$filename"); If that doesn't work, check out some of the points in this article , including: On IE 6.0, things mostly work, but if you ALSO setup Cache-Control: no-cache, your suggested filename (and type!) will be IGNORED. A bummer if you have to choose between security and convienence. Of course, security wins. On nearly all versions of IE, including 6.0, sometimes the browser will use the filename in the address bar instead of the Content-Disposition Header, and with IE5.5SP2 you're expected to change the UseCDFileName registry key, see Q303750. This was fixed with IE6.0SP1. EDIT : Here's the code I use, directly copied from my application's source. Let me know if this works any better... function forceDownload($filename,$mime=false,$downloadName=false) { if(file_exists($filename) && is_readable($filename)) { if(!$mime) $mime = DFStdLib::determineMimeType($filename); if(!$expire) $expire = DFStdLib::HOUR_IN_SECONDS; if(!$downloadName) $downloadName = basename($filename); header('Last-Modified: '.gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s', filemtime($filename)).' GMT', true, 200); header('Cache-Control: no-cache',true); header('Pragma: Public',true); header('Expires: ' . gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s', time()) . ' GMT',true); header('Content-Length: '.filesize($filename),true); header("Content-Type: {$mime}",true); header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$downloadName",true); readfile($filename); exit(); } else { header('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found',true,404); echo " Not Found The file was not found. "; exit(); } } Usage for your case would be: forceDownload('/example.pdf','application/pdf','quickquote.pdf'); Also you'll need to change DFStdLib::HOUR_IN_SECONDS to 3600 and write your own determineMimeType function, or delete that line and make the $mime argument required...
