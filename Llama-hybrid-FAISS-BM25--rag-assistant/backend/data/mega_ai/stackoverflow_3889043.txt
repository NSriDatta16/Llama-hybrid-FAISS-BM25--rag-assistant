NSControl subclass can't read the target?

The following code: - (void) setTarget:(id)anObject { NSLog(@"anObject: %@",anObject); [super setTarget:anObject]; NSLog(@"Target: %@",[self target]); } has this output: anObject: Target: (null) This is in a subclass of NSControl. So what am I doing wrong? What I'm trying to achieve: I have an NScontrol that accepts dragging objects. When the dragging ends, I'd like to send the control's action to its target. But how do I get the control's action & target if this above doesn't work?
