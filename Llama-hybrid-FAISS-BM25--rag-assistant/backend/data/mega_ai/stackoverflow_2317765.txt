Get an automated build machine (or at the very least one dedicated person doing builds), and deploy only from that machine. Then your code doesn't get deployed until you commit, and it helps ensure that nothing was left out of the repository. Additionally, having at least a few members of a team committing early and often usually encourages others to keep up too, because the slow committer has to deal with more local merge conflicts.
