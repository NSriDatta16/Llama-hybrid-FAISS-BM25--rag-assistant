It sounds like there is a mix up of the definition of online learning with the more general definition of machine learning. Online learning is an that area concerns itself with how to update a model when you don't necessarily receive all the data upfront, but rather want to update your model as data becomes available. But this is a subfield of machine learning, rather than a requirement. I presume Tom Mitchell simply means that as the sample of data you use gets larger, your machine learning model should be able to predict better; i.e., a model built from 1,000 samples should predict better than a model built from 100 samples.
