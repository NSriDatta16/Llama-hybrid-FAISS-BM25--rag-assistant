The meaning of having the same number of principal components as the number of predictive features and using it in my ML model

I have 4 predictive features and 4800 observations. I did PCA fit like this: pca = PCA(n_components=X_train_scaled.shape[1],whiten=True) pca.fit(X_train_scaled) and I got I have a few question regarding this: Does this mean that the first feature, which is age in this case, is the most important? I know that this is the variance of principle components, but why are there 4 PCs just like the features? what can I infer from this plot about my predictive features? In other words, how can this help me in the down-stream analysis in regards to choosing maybe the best features from the 4?
