it is nothing like Wordpress , I can assure of that! I bought a book, called Magento 1.3. Theme Design and it helped me creating a new theme, as well understanding the bits that are put together in magento. The book explains how to install themes, images, how things work as well it passes several chapters changing the Blank Theme in order to be able to give the read a good approach to the Theme feature in Magento. Go to the Magento chat room as well (WHAT? IRC? is that thing still alive??) you can find pretty good guys that can help you when you get to a wall, but don't expect that they will do everything for you. Hope it helps.
