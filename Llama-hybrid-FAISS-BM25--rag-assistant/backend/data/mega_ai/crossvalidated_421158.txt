Here is how I interpretted MMD. Two distributions are similar if their moments are similar. By applying a kernel, I can transform the variable such that all moments (first, second, third etc.) are computed. In the latent space I can compute the difference between the moments and average it. This gives a measure of the similarity/dissimilarity between the datasets.
