PL/SQL parser to identify the operation on table

I am writing a PL/SQL parser to identify the operations(Select,Insert,Delete) performed on the Table when I run Procedure, Function or Package. GOAL:I Goal of this tool is to identify which all the tables will be affected by running the procedure,Fun to prepare with better test case. Any better ideas or tool will really help a lot. INPUT: some SQL file with procedure or proc file. OUTPUT required is: SELECT from: First_table, secondTable -> In procedure XYZ --This is if the procedure is calling one more procedure INSERT into: SomeTable INSERT into: SomeDiffTable -> END of procedure XYZ --End of one more procedure. DELETE from: xyzTable INSERT into: OnemoreTable My requirement is When I am parsing porc1 if it calls another proc2. I have to go inside that proc2 to find out what all the operation is performed in that and come back to proc1 and continue.: For this I have to store the all procedure some where and while parsing I have to check each token(word with space) in the tempStorage to find out if it is procedure or not. As my logic's takes lot of time. Can any body suggest better logic to achieve my GOAL.
