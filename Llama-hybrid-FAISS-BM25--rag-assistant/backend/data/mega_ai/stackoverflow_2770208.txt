Full disclosure: I'm a core developer for MongoDB. (Also, I'll full-disclose for jbellis: he is a core developer for Cassandra.) I prefer Mongo to the other databases out there because it's not only the easiest one to use, but it also has tons of features (geospatial indexing, easy file storage, secondary indexes, on and on) and is incredibly fast. Horizontal scaling is ~1 month from production-ready, but people are already using it successfully. I just saw a talk at MongoSF where a developer set up a cluster of 25 EC2 instances handling 8 million operation per second! The MongoDB mailing list is very active and helpful if you have any questions.
