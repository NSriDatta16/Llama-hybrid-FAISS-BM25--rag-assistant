Sublime Text 2 with Pandas for Excel (Combining Data) & Data Visualization

I'm new to programming with Python, and so far it's been a headache to create a build environment- and need your support and expertise in this area. Background I'm running a MacBook, and using Sublime Text 2, and needing to learn python. I'd like to finish this tutorial on youtube on Data Science (manipulating excel files really "aggregating data on excel"- i'll post the link below and need to import pandas- but apparently I can't. Also, worth mentioning; I'll also be using Numpy, Xlrd, Matplotlib in the future, and not sure if these modules are available on Sublime Text 2. The Challenge: When I run this line, I get an error. import pandas as pd I have researched the problem, and it seems that I don't have package control on my sublime text and found this site with the package control addition- so here's the website that I found with a long code to download the package. https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st2 1) Is this a legit site to download this software? 2) Can I even add these modules to Sublime Text 2 to do Data Science & view excel documents 3) If I add this installation "package control", will this package allow me to download pandas, and other modules into Sublime Text 2 4) If Yes, where can I find instructions for installing the Pandas/Numpy/Xlrd modules? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BPNnKEMn8
