Seems to me that asio::write requires the stream class to have write_some implemented. IIRC, When writing to UDP sockets you want to write everything at one time in order to reduce fragmentation (unless your data + UDP header + ip header size is > PMTU, then you've got some work ahead of you). Do you have code on the receiving side that reorders/reassembles the UDP packets? You will get UDP packets out of order and fragmented no matter how good your network is.
