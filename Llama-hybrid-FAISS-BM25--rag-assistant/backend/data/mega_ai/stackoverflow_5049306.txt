I would suggest using SQL CLR to write a stored procedure where the lookup can be saved to the address table. Generally this s easy using google web service. If you require high volume there is a fee but the free limit is quite high. Then you could run an agent job to call the sproc which would on process adressez that were not prevously geocoded.
