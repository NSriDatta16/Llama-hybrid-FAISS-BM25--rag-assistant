So there is a student Joe. Student Joe has a deal with his mom that he will get a good allowance as long as he keeps a grade of a B or better. Joe is graded based on tests and quizzes. His scores are as follows: Quizzes: 8:10 - 80% 9:10 – 90% 9:10 – 70% 10:10 – 100% Tests: 50:100 – 50% 70:100 – 70% 85:100 – 85% When Joe’s mom asks how hes doing in school he says, “Good, I have an 80.7% average!!”. His Mom says “Great, here is your allowance”. A month later Joe’s mom gets his report card and sees a 70.9%. Furious, Joe’s mom gets a meeting with Joe and the teacher. Joe explains he was averaging his test percents and Joe’s teacher shows him how the “weighted average” is calculated. Coincidentally Joe's teacher also lowers Joe’s grade to a D.
