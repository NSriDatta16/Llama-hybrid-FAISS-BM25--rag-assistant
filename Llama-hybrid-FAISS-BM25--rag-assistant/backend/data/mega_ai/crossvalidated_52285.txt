How to interpret a log transformed (X+1)?

Assume that I have a log transformed model as follows: Model 1: $Y = a + b\ln(X)$. Interpretation: a 1% increase in $X$ is associated with an average $b/100$ units increase in $Y$. If I add $1$ to $X$ to avoid having $0$ values and get: Model 2: $Y = c + d\ln(X+1)$ Should I interpret the model as "a 1% increase in $(X+1)$ is associated with an average $d/100$ units increase in $Y$?" Or there are some better ways to interpret the model? Thanks.
