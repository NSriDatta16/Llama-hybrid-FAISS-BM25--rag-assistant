Both Flash and Alternate Displaying In Firefox, Nothing but Errors in IE (sIFR)

I've just installed and setup sIFR on my Magento store. An example page can be seen here: http://www.mint-creative.co.uk/shop And you can see it loads the heading brilliantly, but still displays the alternate text-only headline. I've quadruple checked the .css files and everything's loading ok I think. Also, in IE it doesn't display at all and every .css and .js file has an error according to the error log in IE8. Any help on this would be great as it's an urgent project! Cheers.
