Linear regression for classification

Suppose, I have a classification problem with 2 classes (0 and 1) and evaluation criteria is AUC. I used the following method: fit a linear regression and then pass its predictions through the logistic function. As far as I understand, it is not equivalent to logistic regression, because estimates of coefficients will be different. And strangely, it works better than logistic regression for my problem. Does this linear regression method have any theoretical justifications? Have you seen it before? Thanks a lot!
