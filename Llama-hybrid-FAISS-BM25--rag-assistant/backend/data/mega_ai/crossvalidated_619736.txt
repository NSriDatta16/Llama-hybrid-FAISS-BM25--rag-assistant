Does this design indeed raise concerns about pseudoreplication?

We want to test the effect of dietary supplement on two groups of cows (randomized and controlled for starting weight and age). Group 1 (6 cattle) receives supplement 1 and group 2 (6 cattle) receives supplement 2. They are housed in the same pen but groups are isolated from each other. Animals are weighted once a month for 3 months, being fed a high energy and high protein ration (+ supplement 1 or 2 depending on their group). A colleagues states that we should absolutely split the groups and go Group 1a (3 cattle) - group 2a (3 cattle) - Group 1b (3 cattle) - group 2b (3 cattle) to avoid pseudoreplication, since If the supplements are applied to the group, although measurements are taken individually they should be averaged to the pen (smallest unit upon the supplement is applied). By consequence, you do not have replicates to run the statistical analysis. In my opinion as the groups are independent and there are no variables that could influence significantly the outcome other than the supplement, using only two groups is still appropriate. So is the original design (Group1 & Group2, 6 cattle in each) correct here?
