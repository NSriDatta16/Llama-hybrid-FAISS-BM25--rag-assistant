I was thinking about this a little more and realised that while dynamic proxies will work (it's how RMI (used?) to work), if you really want this sort of functionality you would be better off looking at aspect oriented programming (AOP) using something like AspectJ (eclipse.org/aspectj). This way you can get several different aspects into a class, giving you pseudo mixin inheritance, without the hideously fragile inheritance heirarchies. As everyone else has pointed out, wanting/needing multiple inheritance generally indicates you aren't approaching the problem from the right perspective. Remember the GoF principle of "prefer composition over inheritance" for a start!
