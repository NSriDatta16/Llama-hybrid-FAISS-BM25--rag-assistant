Embedding Facebook in an IFrame

I have an app that has an IFrame with a page flash overly allowing you to draw on webpages. When I go to Facebook with the application, an overlay pops up covering everything at 50% opacity (Which is fine). The problem is that the overlay is all black in some installations of IE7. Can anyone advise on how to get around this? Here is my code: Here is the code that they generate that does this. Is there something I can do with meta tags or something to get the filter alpha to work correctly?
