As a simple start, convert your percentages to counts, then you get an contingency table and can use a chisquare test. I show below how to do this in R: > x x [,1] [,2] [1,] 9 1 [2,] 4 6 [3,] 6 4 [4,] 7 3 [5,] 5 5 [6,] 9 1 [7,] 5 5 [8,] 10 0 [9,] 9 1 > chisq.test(x) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: x X-squared = 18.93, df = 8, p-value = 0.01524 Warning message: In chisq.test(x) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect > chisq.test(x, sim=TRUE, B=10000) Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 10000 replicates) data: x X-squared = 18.93, df = NA, p-value = 0.0148 So, yes, you can conclude that there are really some differences in success probabilities. To investigate that further you could try logistic regression.
