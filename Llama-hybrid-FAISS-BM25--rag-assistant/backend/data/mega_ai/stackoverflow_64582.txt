C++/Java Performance for Neural Networks?

I was discussing neural networks (NN) with a friend over lunch the other day and he claimed the the performance of a NN written in Java would be similar to one written in C++. I know that with 'just in time' compiler techniques Java can do very well, but somehow I just don't buy it. Does anyone have any experience that would shed light on this issue? This page is the extent of my reading on the subject.
