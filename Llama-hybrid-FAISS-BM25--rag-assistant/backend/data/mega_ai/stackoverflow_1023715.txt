Client-Server (web-server) app in LAN - should proxy be taken care of?

Within a LAN, an ASP .NET web application acts as the server. It is hosted internally on the organization's web server. It can be accessed - say like this - http://192.168.0.23/myApp The clients are desktop applications which need to constantly interact with the server (the web app residing on the intranet) Considering it's a LAN setup and the requests from client are not exactly going out to the internet - should the client be capable of handling proxy based connections? Meaning - suppose the client uses a proxy to connect to the internet and if the app at the client sends a WebRequest to http://192.168.0.23/myApp , should the request use the proxy settings?
