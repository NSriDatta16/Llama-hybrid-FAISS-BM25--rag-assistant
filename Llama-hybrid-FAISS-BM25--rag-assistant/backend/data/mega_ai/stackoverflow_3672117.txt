1: static means "local linkage" when used for a function declaration/definition outside a class-declaration. Local linkage means that the particular function can only be referenced from code inside this particular file, and that doesn't make much sense with a method in a class. 2: Since your class declaration can be included multiple times, the actual storage for the static member should be defined in the cpp-file: #include "Timing.h" Timing* Timing::_singleInstance; Timing *Timing::GetInstance() { //the first error if (!_singleInstance) { _singleInstance = new Timing(); //the second error } return _singleInstance; }
