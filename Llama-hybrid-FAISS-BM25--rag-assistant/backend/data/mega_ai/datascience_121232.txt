What are effective ways to merge different parts of a document to form a single document?

I have a dataset where I have 3 different columns (Title, Keyword and Abstract) representing a document. I have to build a text classification model using TextGCN, where documents and words will be presented as graph to a neural network. A basic approach that I am using is to concat all 3 columns into 1 to represent a single document. Are there any better strategies that we can apply to represent a single document ?
