Recommendation for a small DBMS for use as a local datastore for a small .net app

I am looking for a local, relational datastore for a .net application. The datastore should ideally behave as a basic database with SQL for data retrieval and definition and transaction capability. It should not need a server and be easy to redistribute (i.e. only need a dll in the app to access a single db file). No support for access over the network is needed. It should provide a .net data provider and support linq-to-sql, as the purpose for this app is too deepen my skills in .NET 3.5. Any ideas / recommendations for libraries / technologies that worked well for you in similar circumstances?
