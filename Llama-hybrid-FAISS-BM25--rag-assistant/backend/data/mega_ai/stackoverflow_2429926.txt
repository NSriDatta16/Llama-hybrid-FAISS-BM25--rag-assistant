This fragment from documentation: - (id)copy Return Value The object returned by the NSCopying protocol method copyWithZone:, where the zone is nil. Discussion This is a convenience method for classes that adopt the NSCopying protocol. An exception is raised if there is no implementation for copyWithZone:. NSObject does not itself support the NSCopying protocol. Subclasses must support the protocol and implement the copyWithZone: method. A subclass version of the copyWithZone: method should send the message to super first, to incorporate its implementation, unless the subclass descends directly from NSObject. Special Considerations If you are using managed memory (not garbage collection), this method retains the new object before returning it. The invoker of the method, however, is responsible for releasing the returned object.
