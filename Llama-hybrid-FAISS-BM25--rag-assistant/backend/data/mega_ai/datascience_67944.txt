Your model probably overfits. This articles provides an easy to read intro to the topic. As a very first step I suggest to plot your learning curves and look for epochs with lower validation loss. Also, this helps to properly diagnose your model in terms of model capacity. Training a model for less epochs is one way to reduce model capacity and avoid overfitting (others are, for example, to increase the number of training samples or introduce dropout but that is not the first thing to do here). Section 11.4.1 of the Deep Learning Book provides a good overview on this, too. Moreover, I would double check the training and validation sets for a similar class distribution to make sure it is not related to your data split.
