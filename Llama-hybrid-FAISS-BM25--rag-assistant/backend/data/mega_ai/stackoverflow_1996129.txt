Mapping IP addresses to geolocations is done via tables, where an IP maps to a particular location. This location, however, doesn't need to be accurate, since IP addresses don't carry any information about their locations, these are approximated . From Wikipedia's article on Internet geolocation : The primary source for IP address data is the regional Internet registries which allocate and distribute IP addresses amongst organizations located in their respective service regions: African Network Information Centre (AfriNIC) American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry (LACNIC) RIPE Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) Secondary sources include: Data mining or user-submitted geographic location data: Website-submitted, e.g. a weather website asking visitors for a city name to find their local forecast or pairing a user's IP address with the address information in their account profile. Wi-Fi positioning system through the examination of neighborhood Wi-Fi BSSID. E.g. Mozilla Location Service. Examination of neighborhood Bluetooth devices. Pairing a user's IP address with the GPS location of a device that's using such an IP address. Data contributed by Internet service providers. Guesstimates from adjacent Class C range and/or gleaned from network hops. Network routing information collected to the end point of IP address. Analysis of linguistic data from the device, using pretrained models that show that some term is frequently mentioned in a certain location (e.g. "the T" vs "the El" vs. "the subway"). Accuracy is improved by: Data scrubbing to filter out or identify anomalies. Statistical analysis of user submitted data. Utilizing third-party tests conducted by reputable organizations.
