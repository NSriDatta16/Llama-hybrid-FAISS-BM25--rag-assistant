Complex JavaScript. What called me?

Project I'm working on uses jQuery. I have a series of Ajax calls being made that load() other HTML fragments which in turn load() other fragments. The whole thing is confusing. I didn't write the code. Is there any tool which will allow me to walk the callstack so I can figure what is calling a method? any browser tools that would help me figure this out? Resolution: In the end this was being caused because a $.ajaxSetup({ async: false });
