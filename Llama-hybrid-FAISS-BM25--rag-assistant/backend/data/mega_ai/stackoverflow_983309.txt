Flash/ActionScript Memory Fragmentation

In addition to mark-and-sweep, the garbage collectors for .Net and Java both also run a compaction phase to cut down on memory fragmentation. I am not able to find any documentation on a compaction/defragmentation phase for the Flash 9 garbage collector - does Flash not have any compaction phase?
