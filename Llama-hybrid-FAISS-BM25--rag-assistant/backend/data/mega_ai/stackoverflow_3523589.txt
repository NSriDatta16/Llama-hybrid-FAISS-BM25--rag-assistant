This is really a fundamental question and a full explanation will take along time. Basically, you need to understand the concept of MVC (Model-View-Controller). In this case, the "View" will be your UIButton created in Interface Builder. It needs to have a target/action setup to point to some "Controller". This will be a custom class you design that performs some action when the UIButton is released. This controller can also track finger up/down/move/drag and what not. This Controller will store the fact the button was pressed in a "Model" class.
