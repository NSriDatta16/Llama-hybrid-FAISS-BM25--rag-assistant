Regarding your update (which probably should be another question). You should use an array of these objects instead an ArrayList, so you can simply check the value for null: Object[] array = new Object[MAX_ENTRIES]; .. if ( array[ 8 ] == null ) { // not available } else { // do something } Best-Practice If you don't have hundred of entries in your array you should consider organizing it as a class to get rid of the magic numbers 3,8 etc. Control flow using exception is bad practice.
