Mathematical notation for number of samples of a predicted class that exceeds threshold of total number of samples

(The title may be somewhat confusing.) In my machine learning problem, I want to classify an individual based on the samples I have of each individual (i.e. each person has multiple samples). Once I have made the prediction, I get the predicted class for each of the samples , but what I want is a global classification of the individual to one of the two classes. My first idea (surely improvable) is to count the number of samples that have been assigned to each class, and depending on this establishing a threshold, k , where an individual will be classified as Class 1 if the number of samples classified as Class 1 for an individual exceeds that threshold. My problem is that I don't have much knowledge of formal mathematical writing, and I would like to translate the above into mathematical notation. I have come up with the following but I don't know if it is correct. $$ Y=1, \sum_{i=0}^{n}\hat{y_{i}}\Leftrightarrow \hat{y_{i}}=1 > k\sum_{i=0}^{n}\hat{y_{i}} $$
