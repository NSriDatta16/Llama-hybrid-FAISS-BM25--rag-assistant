Android : How to use flurry API

I am using flurry in my app, and I am new to that. I have some doubts. My requirement is, In my main activity I will start a session, and calling onevent method in some activities. And I am not calling endSeesion method anywhere. I want to know when the FlurryAgent will hit the flurry site. So do I need to call endSession then where should I call that method? How FlurryAgent maintains the session. In case if I call like this FlurryAgent.onEndSession(this); FlurryAgent.onStartSession(this, Constants.FLURRY_API); FlurryAgent.setLogEnabled(true); will it work like this - previous session will be closed and new session will be started. I can track only http urls using fiddler, when I try to track https calls then its getting crashed, I have modified ssl settings in fiddler, I dont know how to configure my emulator. Thanks in Advance.
