Unbiasedness of Bayesian Posterior Mean Under Bayesian and Frequentist Models

This is an extension to this previous question, and is related to exercise 4.7 from Gelman et al.'s BDA3 . When is the Bayesian posterior mean $m(y) \equiv E[\theta \mid y]$ unbiased for $\theta$ , considering theta either as a random variable (Bayesian perspective) or fixed (Frequentist perspective)?
