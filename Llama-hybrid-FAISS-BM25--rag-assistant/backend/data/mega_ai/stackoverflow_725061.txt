Is Safari a webbrowser for you? If it is, the same engine you got in many applications, just to say those using QT QWebKit libraries. So I would say, no way to recognize it. User can forge any request one wants - faking the headers like UserAgent any they like... One question: why would you want to do what you ask for? What's the diffrence for you if they request from browser or from anythning else? Can't think of one reason you'd call "security" here. If you still want to do this, for whatever reason, think about making your own application, with a browser embedded. It could somehow authenticate to the application in every request - then you'd only send a valid responses to your application's browser. User would still be able to reverse engineer the application though.
