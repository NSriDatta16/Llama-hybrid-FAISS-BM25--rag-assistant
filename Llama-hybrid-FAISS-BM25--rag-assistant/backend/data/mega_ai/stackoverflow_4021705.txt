You could start a bounty on your previous question to get more attention for it. But as for this question, I would recommend "Don't." It does sound a little crazy, and you'll spend months (probably years) creating something that delivers only incremental improvement over an existing solution. It might be worth posting some more details of the project and explaining why you have these requirements. It's possible that you could meet all of your requirements through a different combination of solutions (eg: why #2? Why can't you use caching instead of having to run in memory?). If this is for a commercial product then I'm assuming you have a really interesting project with lots of money to burn. If it's for a personal project then good luck, and you're a lot braver than I am! ;-)
