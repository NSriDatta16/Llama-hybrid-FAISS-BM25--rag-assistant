The pairwise distances also form a square matrix just like the co-variance matrix. PCA is just SVD ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition ) applied to the co-variance matrix. You should still be able to do dimension reduction using SVD on your data. I'm not exactly sure how to interpret your output but it is definitely something to try. You could use clustering methods such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. Also take a look at other dimension reduction techniques such as multidimensional scaling. What are you trying to get out of your clusters?
