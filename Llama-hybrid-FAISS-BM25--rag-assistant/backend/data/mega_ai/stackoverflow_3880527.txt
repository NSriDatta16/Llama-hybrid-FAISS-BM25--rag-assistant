As Rup statet there are two ways of doing the tests: A: Leaving your settop-box as is and faking the inputs to your settop-box by interfacing with an external device which does the fake inputs and test the output. This is, as far as I know, sometimes referred to as black box testing B: When you have can modify the source code of your settop-box you can instrument this code to do automatic test. This is referred to as Unit Test or white box test A good starting point to get an idea of unit testing is FitNesse or JUnit. If you need to do unit testing in C and it is requiered that your tests run on the target you may be interested in Maestra from MacroExpressions which is free and also does code coverage analysis, which is required mostly, but not only, in safety critical systems.
