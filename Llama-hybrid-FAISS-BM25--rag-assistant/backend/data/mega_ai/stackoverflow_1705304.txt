how to configure java.xml.transform.transformer in spring

How can i configure java.xml.transform.Transformer in spring framework ? I need instance of transformer to transform xml to text via xslt. Hence it is critical that the configured transformer should have knowledge of xslt stylesheet. I am not using this in a web project, rather i am using this in a standalone java program.
