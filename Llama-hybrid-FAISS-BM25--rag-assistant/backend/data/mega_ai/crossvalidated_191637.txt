In cases where you cannot perform permutations, for example when the sample size creates millions of possibilities, another solution would be Monte Carlo resampling. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the speed between $ext4$ and $xfs$, for $nocrypto$ and $crypto$. Therefore, the average ratio $\frac{ext4}{xfs}$ of all $nocrypto$ samples does not differ from that of $crypto$. $H_{0}:T_{observed}=\frac{\sum x_{nocrypto} }{n_{nocrypto}}-\frac{\sum x_{crypto} }{n_{crypto}}=0 $ where $ x=\frac{ext4}{xfs} $ and $ n=sample\, size $ If $H_{0}$ is true, randomly picking results for ratios of $nocrypto$ or $crypto$ would also result in $T_{observed}=0$. One would calculate: $ T_{resampling}=\frac{x_{1}^{random}{+ x}_{n}^{random}}{n_{nocrypto}}-\frac{x_{1}^{random}{+ x}_{n}^{random}}{n_{crypto}} $ and perform, say, 10,000 rounds of resampling. The resulting distribution of $T_{resampling}$ values is the confidence interval for $H_{0}$. The difference between $nocrypto$ and $crypto$ ratio is significant if the calculated $T_{observed}$ value lies outside the range of, e.g., 95% $(p
