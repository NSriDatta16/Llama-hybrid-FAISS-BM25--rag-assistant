Also, note that you need labels to perform LDA, which is not always available (or relevant). That's why PCA is usually preferred because it's class-agnostic. The number of output dimensions in LDA is linked to the number of degrees of freedom in the dataset, which is linked to the number of classes $c$ : eigenvalues above $c$ will be zero and bear no information (same as with PCA and explained variance).
