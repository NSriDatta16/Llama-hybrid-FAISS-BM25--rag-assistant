How do you validate your machine learning models?

I am wondering what approaches are commonly used for validating machine learning models designed for classification or prediction tasks: Approaches that am using at the moment: Using truth-sets: - ROCs, Bootstrapping, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Cross-validation Orthogonal validation: - Use a different class of algorithm that can perform prediction or classification task and compare results Any other suggestions ?
