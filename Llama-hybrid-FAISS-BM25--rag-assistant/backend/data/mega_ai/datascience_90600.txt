Your model will become less accurate. For example, let's say you have features A and B, and you have 51 observations. For 50 of those A=10 and B=20 correspond to dependent value of 5, and you have 1 observation for which A=10 and B=20 correspond to dependent value of 100. Without removing duplicates when making a prediction for a new observation with A=10 and B=20, Random Forest will give roughly the average of 51 values mentioned above, which is close to 6.86. If you remove duplicates you will get an average of 5 and 100 or 52.5. And assuming your test data has the same distribution as the original data, the model will be far off on many observations. Therefore, unless you have a good reason to believe that the test data will have a different distribution, don't remove the duplicate values.
