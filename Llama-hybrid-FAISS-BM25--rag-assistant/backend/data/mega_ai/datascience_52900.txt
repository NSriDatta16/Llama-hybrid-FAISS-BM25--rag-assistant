Keras Embedding Layer main paper

I need to explain the word embedding layer of Keras in my paper, mathematically. I know that keras initialize the embedding vectors randomly and then update the parameters using the optimizer specified by the programmer. I want to explain my architecture in an academic paper, therefore I need to explain each layer with a formal formula. Is there a paper that explains the method in details to reference it? or can you please guide me to how to compose the method formally? Thanks a lot
