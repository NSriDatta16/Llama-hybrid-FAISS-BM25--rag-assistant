How to output a string attribute on an object that may be be null

As part of a dataTable in a seam JSF page, one column requires the output of a name: The problem is that "staffMember" may be null on some listings, so I get the error: javax.el.ELException: /xxxxx.xhtml @42,67 value="#{listing.staffMember.name}": Error reading 'name' on type xxxx.model.AgentStaff_$$_javassist_152 If the value is null, I don't want any text rendered. I tried this: But the same error comes up. How can I output a property on an object that may be null?
