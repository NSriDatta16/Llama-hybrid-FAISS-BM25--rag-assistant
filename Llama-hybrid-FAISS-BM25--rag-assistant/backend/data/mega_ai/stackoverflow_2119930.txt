SQL Server 2005 SSIS - How to get special information from the first line of a file

Say I have a text file that looks like this: date 1/1/2010 a,b,c a,b,d ... I want to import it into a table so it looks like this: 1/1/2010,a,b,c 1/1/2010,a,b,d ... What is an elegant way to do that? My best idea so far is to use a data flow package, and use a flat file source to read in the file (ignoring the first line) and load it into the table. When that is complete, have a script task open the file again, read out the date, then pass that date to a sql task to update the table with the date. But surely there is a less convoluted way?
