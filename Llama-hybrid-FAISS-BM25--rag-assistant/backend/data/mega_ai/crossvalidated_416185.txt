It doesn't matter. A mean is just a sum divided by the number of items. The substantive conclusion will be the same. The choice depends on what substantively makes more sense. If it's a Likert scale, it probably make more sense to compute an average. If it's a symptom scale, it makes more sense to compute a sum. Note that the fact that this is taking place in a mediation analysis is irrelevant.
