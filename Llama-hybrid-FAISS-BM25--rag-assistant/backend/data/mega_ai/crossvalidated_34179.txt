I only add remark about modeling the shape of daily average number of users per minute - you can decompose that curve using sum of two gaussian functions, such sum will have 6 free parameters to fit. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function or father sum of one rescaled gamma/beta distribution function and gaussian function. Gamma or beta seems to be batter choice for that first very flat peak around 14:00. And ahter fitting sum of two functions you can observ how they parameters change depending on the day of weak. For fitting you can try BGFS algorithm, but the problem will be finding staring values of parametres, but in tis case it can be resolved very easy - just cut daily profiles of number of users into two sets - first for 10:00-15:00 and second 15:00-2:00 m then fit one gaussian or rather gama/beta to first set and one gaussian function to second one, then use fitted parametres as starting values for BFGS for fitting sum of two choosen distributions. But I don't see the point of modeling daily average numbers of users. The written-on-the-knee model for forecasting number of users is to take weighted average of number of users and daily profiles of average number of users... I can write more in this topis if you want.
