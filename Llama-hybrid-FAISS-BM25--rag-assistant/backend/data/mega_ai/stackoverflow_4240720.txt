I've never worked with cookies in javascript, but looking at the w3c exampple you provided, wouldn'nt it be fine to use that technique and just store the url instead of the username? And then set the img:src or background-url or what ever you are using to that url from the getCookie function? (or later, whenever the dom is ready). An alternative could be to use local storage, but it might be overkill for what you are trying to do.
