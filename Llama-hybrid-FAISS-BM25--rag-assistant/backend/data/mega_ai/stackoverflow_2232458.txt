How to use jQuery to select XML nodes with unique text content?

I'm attempting to pull a list of unique text entries from an XML document "the jQuery way" and am hitting a wall. From this XML: Category 1 Category 2 Category 2 Category 3 I'd like to generate a select list like: Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 So far all of my attempts produce a duplicate "Category 2" option node. I attempted to make use of the $.unique() method, but the results make me think it's only comparing the node name, not the text content. Here is my latest hackery that does not work: var filters = $("cat",xmldoc); filters = $.unique(filters); $(filters).each(function() { $("select").append(" " + $(this).text() + " "); }); I can think of a number of standard javascript tricks to make this happen, but am hoping there's a nice, elegant jQuery way to pull this off. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
