How do you create an effective web site map?

We've got a non-profit site that's been up for over 10 years; though it's gone through various redesigns, it's showing its age and needs to be revamped -- inside and out. This includes the layout of the pages as well as the internal structure of the site. As part of rebuilding the site and designing it structure, we'd like to create a site map that's effective and efficient. In other words, we want to be able to follow best practices for building a site. The site will ultimately reside in a Magnolia CMS, and so we need to know what pages are top-level, what are secondary, etc., while also ensuring that we provide the fastest/most intuitive route to our content. We have literally thousands of static pages that were created using Dreamweaver templates; many of these pages are "dead" -- nothing points to them anymore. The current site was designed and built piecemeal: A hundred different people put in requests for links and other items to appear on the home page, so there's no coherent vision -- more a collection of links anywhere and everywhere, along with various modules that were added over the years anywhere the developer could fit them. We'd like to start fresh -- leave the past behind, design the site with brand new links and structure to effectively meet our users' needs. This is in an organization where people hate and fear change, rather than embrace it even if it helps them. Any advice or recommendations you have will be much appreciated as we undertake this process. Thanks.
