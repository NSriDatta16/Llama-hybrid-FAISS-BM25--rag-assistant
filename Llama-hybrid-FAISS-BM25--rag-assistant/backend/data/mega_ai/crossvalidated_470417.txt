No intercept term in ordered logistic regression - how do I incorporate dummy variables for three categories?

With OLS regression, when we have three categories (e.g. married, unmarried, divorced) and want to use dummy variables, we use something like this: Where if the two d's = 0, beta1 represents e.g. the value for married; when the first d = 1 and the other 0, gamma1 represents the unmarried group, and when the first d = 0 and the other = 1, gamma2 represents the divorced group. However, when we use ordered logistic regression, the output in statistical software does not include an intercept term. E.g. you get something that looks like: So, my question is how do I represent a three category situation with dummies as the independent variables when using ordered logistic regression since there's no intercept term? Thanks!
