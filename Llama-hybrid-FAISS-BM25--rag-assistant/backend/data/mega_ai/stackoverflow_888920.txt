You might want to look at some Qt Solutions, which will do at least part of what you want. For example, see the Color Picker solution, which they note is now available as an LGPL-licensed library also. As an alternative (and probably less-supported) approach, I recall some work in the Qt-Labs about embedding Qt widgets, including QDialog s, into a QGraphicsScene . You could potentially do so, then change the view on your graphics scene so that only the portion of the color picker dialog you are interested in was visible to the user. It sounds very hackish, however.
