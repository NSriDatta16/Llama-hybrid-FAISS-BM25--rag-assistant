Table-Valued Parameters to CLR Procedures in SQL Server 2008 - possible?

This page from SQL Server 2008 BOL , talks about CLR Stored Procedures and has a section labelled, "Table-Valued Parameters", which talks about how they can be advantageous. That's great - I'd love to use TVPs in my CLR procs, but unfortunately this seems to be the only reference in the universe to such a possibility, and the section doesn't describe what the syntax would be (nor does the further information linked at the end of the paragraph) Sure, I can easily find descriptions of how to use TVPs from T-SQL procs, or how to do CLR procs in general. But writing a CLR proc that takes a TVP? Nothing. This is all highly unusal since the passing of multi-row data to a stored proc is a popular problem. This leads me to wonder if the presence of the section on that page is an error. Somebody please tell me it's not and point me to more info/ examples. [EDIT] I was about to post this to one of the MS forums too when I came across this, which seems to be the final nail in the coffin . Looks like it can't be done.
