Build Server - install external control libraries (DevExpress) on build server

what's the right way? We have one build server for our projects. We have different projects, wich reference different versions of DevExpress. Should we install every DevExpress Version on the build server or should every project have its own folder with DevExpress assemblies. Exists an other possible way? In my opinion: Advantage 1: It is easier for every developer to maintain his local copy of the project. Disadvantage 1: DevExpress version hell on build sever because every new release must be installed. Advantage 2: Every project could be builded without prerequisite. Disadvantage 2: Every developer must manually put his dlls in a separate Libs folder. If you have dragged a DevExpress control from the toolbox, you must reorganize your references for this dlls.
