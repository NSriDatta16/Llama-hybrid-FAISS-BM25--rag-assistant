A challenge with multiple imputation is that it usually makes use of Rubin's Rules to pool regression models fit on simulated datasets, or rather datasets with randomly generated imputations. The "between" model error summarizes both the uncertainty of the imputation model as well as the MCMC error. Since it is computationally inexpensive to fit potentially 100 or 1,000 fixed effects regression models, it's possible to consider a cumulative series of imputations and use a logarithmic plot to project the extent of MCMC error. In the mice package in R, the b slot from a returned mipo (multiple imputation pooled outcome) object supposedly summarizes the between-imputation error. Interestingly, such a logarithmic plot tends to show an increase in such error over time, but converging to values at 30 imputations or more, which befuddles me slightly. If I took anything away from this, it suggests that more imputations may be safer bet. In this example, increasing the imputations led to a pooled fit which had less precise inference relative to the complete case analysis. set.seed(123) library(mice) imp
