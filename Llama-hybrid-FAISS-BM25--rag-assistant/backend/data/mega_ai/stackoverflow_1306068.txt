First, don't use update panels. They are the second most evil thing that Microsoft has ever created for the web developer. Second, if you must use update panels, try setting the UpdateMode property to Conditional. Then add a trigger to an Asp:Hidden control that you add to the page. Assign the change event as the trigger. In your dragstop event, change the value of the hidden control. This is untested, but the theory seems sound... If this does not work, you could try the same thing with an asp:button, just set the display:none style on it and use the click event instead of the change event.
