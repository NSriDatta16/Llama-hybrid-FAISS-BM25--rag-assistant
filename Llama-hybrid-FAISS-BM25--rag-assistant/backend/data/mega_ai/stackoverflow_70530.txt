The bean convention is to write code like this: private int foo; public int getFoo() { return foo; } public void setFoo(int newFoo) { foo = newFoo; } In some of the other languages on the JVM, e.g., Groovy, you get overridable properties similar to C#, e.g., int foo which is accessed with a simple .foo and leverages default getFoo and setFoo implementations that you can override as necessary.
