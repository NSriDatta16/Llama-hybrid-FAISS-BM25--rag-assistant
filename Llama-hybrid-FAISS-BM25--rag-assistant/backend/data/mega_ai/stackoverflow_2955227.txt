jQuery Drag and Drop Checking Question

i am new to using jQuery and I just want to know how I can check whether a draggable object has been removed from the droppable object. Example, i have a dog and I dragged it to a doghouse which has a lightbulb that will light up indicating that the dog is there. When i drag the dog out of the doghouse, the lightbulb should go off again indicating the dog's absence. Help me please coz I really don't have any idea how to do this. Thanks in advance. :)
