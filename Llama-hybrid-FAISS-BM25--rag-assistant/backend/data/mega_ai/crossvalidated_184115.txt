You have to define "regular". If regular logistic regression means fitting a well-thought out completely pre-specified model, then logistic regression requires a lower sample size. If you are doing feature selection (usually not recommended) then the penalization that is part of lasso keeps the method honest, whereas stepwise regression with unpenalized ordinary logistic regression doesn't work very well. But some of the apparent advantages of lasso are illusory: bootstrapping may reveal that the list of features "selected" by lasso is very unstable.
