How do I get clientX and clientY to work inside my "drag" event handler on Firefox?

Mozilla Firefox 3.x seems to have a bug when listening to the "ondrag" event. The event object doesn't report the position of the object being dragged, clientX , clientY , and other screen offsets are all set to zero. This is quite problematic as I wanted to make a proxy element based on the element being dragged and using of course, clientX and clientY to adjust its position. I know that there's cool stuff around such as setDragImage in HTML5 but I want to provide a generic abstraction for native DD between browsers. Faulty code: document.addEventListener('drag', function(e) { console.log(e.clientX); // always Zero }, false); Note: This problem doesn't happen on other events ( dragstart , dragover ) and the mousemove events cannot be captured while dragging something.
