You might consider storing your elapsed time in 2 columns (a 32-bit int for the seconds, and a 16-bit smallint for the milliseconds). That will cover a range of some 68 years and take 6 bytes per row. Alternatively, storing your elapsed time in the money data type, as seconds, is convenient. It stores 4 decimal places of precision and has a range of c. -2^3 to +2^63 - 1, or more precisely, -922,337,203,685,477.5808) through +922,337,203,685,477.5807. Discounting negative values, +922,337,203,685,477.5807 seconds covers some 29m years. Using money will take 8 bytes per row. Or the decimal(p,q) datatype. Choose your overall precision p and number of decimal places q . Storage required is is 5, 9, 13, or 17 bytes depending on the value of p .
