By definition (see e.g. Jun Shao "Mathematical Statistics", 2nd edition, chapter 6, first paragraph) of statistical hypothesis tests, the null and the alternative hypothesis must be disjoint. Moreover, both hypotheses together must contain all possibilities. If you are interested in the probability of $H_0$ compared to the probability of $H_1$ , you might want to approximate the density and then integrate it over both $H_0$ and $H_1$ .
