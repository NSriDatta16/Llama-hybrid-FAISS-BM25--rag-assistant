Well this is still not a full match of the features of JNLP but maybe esky is closer to what you want. It's not browser based but once your app is installed on the client it can update itself. It might also lack something in the cross-platform department so depending on your environment YMMV. Another alternative might be the Dabo framework at dabodev.com. It's been a few years since i looked at that but it still looks like it's alive :-)
