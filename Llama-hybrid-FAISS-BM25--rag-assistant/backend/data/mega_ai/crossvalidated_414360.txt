What statistics can I use to describe the shape of a time series?

I want to apply a clustering algorithm to some time series datasets. I've tried DTW, but it hasn't quite achieved what I want (which is to cluster similarly behaving series such that I can tune fbprophet once per cluster and have the model perform within acceptable error rates). So, what I want to try is to create a new dataset that has features describing the seasonality and trend of each time series and then apply more traditional clustering to that, but I'm not quite sure what statistics to use for those features. For example, I could perhaps have the R^2 of the trend as one feature, the min, max, mean and standard deviation of the seasonal component as others. fbprophet's parameters control the sensitivity to change in trend over the course of the time series; I've no idea how to capture that kind of thing really. Maybe have $Y$ be the trend of the time series and simply count the times $Y_{n} - Y_{n-7}$ is above a particular threshold? Any suggestions very welcome
