Arithmetic operations work just fine on unsigned char , although you may occasionally be surprised by the fact that arithmetic in C always promotes to int . In C++'s Standard Template Library, #include template T accumulate(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, T init); To calculate the sum of unsigned char arr[] , you may use accumulate(arr, arr + sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]), 0) . (0 is an int here. You may find it more appropriate to use a different type.) Without STL, this is trivially computed with a loop. The average is the sum divided by the length ( sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]) ).
