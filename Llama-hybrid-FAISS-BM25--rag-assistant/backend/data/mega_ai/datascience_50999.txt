Interesting question. What you are asking for is if a neural network is able to represent and/or approximate functions. The answer is: Yes, the Neural Networks can represent derivatives of functions. In this paper, the possibility is explained. Approximation of functions and their derivatives: A neural network implementation with applications Other author take the same conclusion: Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators Generalization and Approximation Capabilities of Multilayer Networks Approximation Capability of Layered Neural Networks with Sigmoid Units on Two Layers
