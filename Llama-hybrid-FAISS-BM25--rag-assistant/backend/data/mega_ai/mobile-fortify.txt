Mobile Fortify is a mobile app used by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on their government-issued phones. The app allows for agents to point their phones remotely in order to gather biometrics including contactless fingerprinting and faceprinting. History In June 2025, incorporation of the Mobile Fortify for use by the ICE was uncovered through leaked emails and the user manual covered by several 404 Media reports. The app is an internally developed app and details of the parent company and developer are unknown. Later in that same month, several senators wrote a letter demanding transparency of the app and its origins, including for cease of use. Technology Unlike other facial recognition software like Clearview AI which uses public social media databases for biometric scanning, Fortify uses federally linked databases. Such databases include the DHS’s automated biometric identification system (IDENT), containing more than 270 million biometric records, Customs and Border Protection’s Traveler Verifciation Service, The State Department’s visa and passport photo database, the FBI’s National Crime Information Center, National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems, and CBP’s TECS and Seized Assets and Case Tracing System (SEACATS). Controversies Several senators have expressed concern, urging ICE to stop using the app for fear of infringing on first amendment rights, but also requesting more details on who developed the app, when was this first deployed, whether the app was tested to be accurate, current policies and practices governing the use of the app and whether they will commit to end using the app. On June, 2025, this was sent as a letter to Todd Lyons, the acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement department, signed by senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Bernie Sanders, Adam Schiff, Edward J. Markey, Ron Wyden and Tina Smith. == References ==
