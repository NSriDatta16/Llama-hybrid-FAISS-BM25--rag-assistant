No IDs when creating a new object in Rails with PostgreSQL as database

My setup is the following: I am using Rails 3.0.1 with a PostgreSQL 9.0 database. I have my models organized in submodules. When I'm using the console to create a new object of any kind ( c = ::Physical::Base::Contact.new ) and save it, the id of the object is not automatically filled in. It is written to the database, but my object that I have just created does not take note of the ID that is generated by the sequence in PostgreSQL. My migration script for creating the table is below. I write them myself and am not using the standard rails generation feature to have more control over my tables. Is this a standard PostgreSQL+Rails behaviour, or am I missing something by writing the migrations myself? class Contact 0), value text not null check (length(value) > 0) ) " end def self.down execute " drop table contacts; " end end
