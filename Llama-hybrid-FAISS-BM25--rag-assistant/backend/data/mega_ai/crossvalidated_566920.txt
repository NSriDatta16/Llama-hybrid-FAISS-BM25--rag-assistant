How to choose a good model for classification?

I have some data that I would like to use to do some predictions. The data is some value over time and I want to predict the occurrence or not of some behavior. So for example I have the data d_t1 , d_t2 , d_t3 , d_t4 and treating these as four features I would like a binary classification: A happens , A does not happen . Now, the first thing that came to my mind was logistic regression but then I found that LR applies to problems were the data can be linearly separable. I can't be sure my data is like this. So how can I choose a good model for this binary classification?
