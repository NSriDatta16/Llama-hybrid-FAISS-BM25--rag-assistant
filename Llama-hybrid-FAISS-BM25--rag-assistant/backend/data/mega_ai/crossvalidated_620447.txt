Is there a Machine Learning Frame in R rather than caret?

I was using caret for years. I was wondering if there is a similar ML framework like caret. Like in python they have several systems in deep learning (keras, pytorch, tensorflow, etc). Just want to open my mind and to see a bigger world. Any books or links will be fine, I could read my self. And a detailed answer is also welcomed, but if you don't have time, throw me a link or book well be appreciated.
