You'll be subclassing UIScrollView and overriding the touchesBegan:withEvent: method, touchesMoved:withEvent: method, and the touchesEnded:withEvent: method. You'll use those methods, along with the start and end points of a touch, to calculate what kind of touch event took place: was it a simple tap, or a horizontal or vertical swipe? If it is a horizontal swipe, you cancel the touch event. Take a look at the source code here to learn how you might get started.
