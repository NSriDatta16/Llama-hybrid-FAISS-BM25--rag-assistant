Replace nan with sequence of values

I have the dataset for covid tests in Ireland. In May the data just stops. To continue the trend, I took the average mon-sun during the last stable period. So I have 7 different mean values. Now I want to edit the dataset to insert these values in sequence from the row indexed '47545'. I don't get any error and it doesn't change the dataset. ireland_df3 = ireland_df.copy() ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47545]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df1_mean ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47546]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df2_mean ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47547]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df3_mean ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47548]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df4_mean ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47549]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df5_mean ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47550]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df6_mean ireland_df3[ireland_df3.reset_index().index % 7 == 47551]['new_tests_per_thousand'] = df7_mean Any ideas?
