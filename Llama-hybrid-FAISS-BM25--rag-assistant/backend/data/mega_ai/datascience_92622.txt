What would cause regression to focus on a few values?

Hi I have a neural network for a regression problem but the results seem to be heavily focused on a few values. I added an image, y axis is predicted values and x axis is real values. What could be causing my problem? Edit: Shapes of my train set is (5192, 383) and I used 4 dense layers with 512,256,128,64 units with dropout layers in between. I used %15 of the set for validation. I used the epoch with the best validation score. Trained the network for 300 epochs but it does not seem to get better with more.
