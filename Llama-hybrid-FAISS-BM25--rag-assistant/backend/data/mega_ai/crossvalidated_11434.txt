Whatever variable selection technique you use, be sure to cross-validate it to keep from overfitting. It seems that you may have overfit your initial model, so this step is very important. One idea would be to use the elastic net or lasso for regularization and variable selection. You can use the package glmnet in R to run a logistic regression using the elastic net for regularization and variable selection. It's pretty straightforward and could improve your results.
