We have folk here who tend to do that. They also tend to proceed to use "using" clauses to get rid of the cruft. The silly part is that just leaves them right back where they started. Generally what I like to see is one, and in rare cases two, levels of namespaces. What you should do is the following: every time you are tempted to stick foo_ on the front (or back) of a bunch of identifiers, instead put them all together into namespace "foo" and call them with foo:: That way the wart you were going to put on there anyway now has some syntactic signifigance. Even better, in the internal code for the "foo_" stuff, you no longer have to use the leading "foo". It is understood, since you are already working on an item in the "foo" namespace. This makes the internal code much easier to read and the client code marginally easier to understand.
