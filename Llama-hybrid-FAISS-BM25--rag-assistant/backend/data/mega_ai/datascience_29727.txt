Okay, first I would tell you that deep learning is very easy as compared conventional machine learning so you don't have to panic with your 2-month deadline provided you have a thorough understanding of machine learning algorithms that you have mentioned above. Now here is a course by Andrew NG that is free if you would audit it. Once you open this course just go through it you don't' even have to do the assignments just understand the concept which is very easy to grasp. After you have gone through the course. Setup python environment for windows use this . For linux use this . After that search for keras tutorials from kerasGitHubb page which can get you going.
