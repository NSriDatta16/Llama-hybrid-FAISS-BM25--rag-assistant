What are some examples of non-Von Neumann architectures?

If I understand correctly modern computers are modeled after the Von Neumann architecture. I have sometimes seen reference to alternatives, but haven't really seen any very good descriptions of how non-Von Neumann architectures would be organised and function. Does anyone have any examples? What are the advantages/disadvantages of alternative computer organization?
