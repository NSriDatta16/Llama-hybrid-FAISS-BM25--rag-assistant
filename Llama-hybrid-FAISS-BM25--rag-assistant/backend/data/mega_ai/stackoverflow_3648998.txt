So, if I understand your example correctly, you are creating a set of Selection objects and then using them to generate the code? First of all, why not just write the code in C++? As it is, you're embedding C++ expressions in Python as string variables, and using overloading mathematical operators to construct boolean expressions (the fact that you felt the need to comment that * means AND is an indication that this is a poor choice)? That's just plain ugly! That being said, you have all the information you need -- in the Python code, selectionA knows its name is "selectionA" and selectionB knows its name is "selectionB". The only thing is, you don't provide enough context to know what type of object selectionC is. I'm assuming it's something like AndExpression, and holds references selectionA and selectionB (maybe as param1 and param2?). Just have it output "(" + self.param1.name + " && " + self.param2.name + ")" .
