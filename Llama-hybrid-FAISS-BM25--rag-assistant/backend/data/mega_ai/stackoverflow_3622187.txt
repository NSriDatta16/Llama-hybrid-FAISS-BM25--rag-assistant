Mootools cross domain, YQL proxy

I've been trying to make ajax cross domain scripting with YQL as proxy. It works great, but can i somehow change the data format? Im trying to extend the JSONP class like this: http://fragged.org/cross-domain-ajax-calls-via-yql-as-proxy-and-mootools-jsonp_1028.html And im getting data as text/html, but would like it to be as xml. In standard Mootools: new Request({ method: 'get', url: this.options.url, onComplete: function(text, xml) { Here i can fetch the text AND xml. UPDATED: My solution: Instead of making request with Mootools class, just use the callback function that YQL allows.
