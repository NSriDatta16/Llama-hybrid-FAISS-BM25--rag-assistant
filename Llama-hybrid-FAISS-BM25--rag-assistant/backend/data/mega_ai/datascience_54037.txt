Features Vectors in embedding space

I have a bunch of users, each of them with about 100 features. My goal is to create an embedded space to compute the "distance" between users. Also, I want to be able to visualize it with Tensorboard (look this example with Word2Vec http://projector.tensorflow.org/ ) However, I only find example and articles about NLP, whilst my I am not dealing with sparse matrix or "vocabulary sizes". Since I am new to this problem, could you suggest some approaches and some papers/articles/tutorial I can start with?
