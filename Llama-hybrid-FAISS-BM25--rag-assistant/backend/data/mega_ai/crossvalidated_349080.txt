Covering the unit sphere with sparse vectors

I'm looking for references for covering the $d$-dimensional unit sphere $$ \mathbb{S}^{d - 1} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d : \| x \| = 1 \right\} $$ I'm trying to cover $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ with vectors with $k$ nonzero coefficients (ideally at most some multiple of $\log d$ or even $\sqrt{d}$). In other words, i'm looking for a set $\mathcal{N}$ such that $\bar{x} \in \mathcal{N} \Rightarrow \| \bar{x} \|_0 \leq k$, and $$ \forall x \in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}, \; \exists \bar{x} \in \mathcal{N} : \| x - \bar{x} \| \leq \varepsilon $$ for some small constant $\varepsilon > 0$. Hence: Question : What is the minimum number of $k$-sparse vectors required to cover $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ with distance at most $\varepsilon$? Edit : I'm not even sure a covering with sparse vectors that has logarithmic or square-root dependence on $d$ exists. If it exists, then its minimum cardinality definitely has to be exponential in $d$, since we know (e.g. from Corollary 4.2.13 in [1]) that any $\varepsilon$-net of the unit sphere has covering number at least $\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \right)^d$.
