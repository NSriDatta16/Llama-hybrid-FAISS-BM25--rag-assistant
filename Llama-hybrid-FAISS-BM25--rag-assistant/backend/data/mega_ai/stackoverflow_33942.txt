@Robert what if you put the ellipses in a div with a low z-index so that when it moves to the left (for shorter lines) they get covered up by a background image or something? it's pretty hacky I know, but hey worth a try right? edit Another idea: determine the position of the div containing the ellipses with javascript and if it's not pushed all the way right, hide it?
