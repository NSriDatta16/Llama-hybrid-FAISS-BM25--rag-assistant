You do not need to reshape your data to create "sliding windows". There are many deep learning approaches to time-series data, including recurrent networks (e.g. LSTM) , one-dimensional convolutional networks , hybrids of the above, or architectures using attention. Neither of them needs re-shaping the data. In each case either you use some kind of for loop to loop through the time, either case by case (RNN's), or with sliding window (convolutional networks, attention), but this all can happen on-the-fly. There's also no problem at all with training the model in batches, this is actually the most common approach. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of tutorials online, and dozens of books, so I'd strongly encourage to check them before trying to figure out things by yourself, this would be much more efficient. So I'd say that the problem you are describing is non-existent, already solved.
