If you have not already implemented TFS, then you should look at TFS 2008. It is much improved and a VS 2005 client can connect to it just fine. To download an 90-day trial version of TFS 2008 visit the following link: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b0155166-b0a3-436e-ac95-37d7e39a440c If you just wanted to play with TFS and Team System, then I would encourage you to download the pre-configured Virtual PC image as it will save you the time of installing the pre-requisites required for a full TFS installation. You can get the VPC here which will run until the end of the calendar year: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=72262ead-e49d-43d4-aa45-1da2a27d9a65 Is there any reason why you wanted TFS 2005 rather than the latest version?
