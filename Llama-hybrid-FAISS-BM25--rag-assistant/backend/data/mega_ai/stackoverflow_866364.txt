Does this do what you want? The anchor ensures the text starts with www. But obviously this will fail with other subdomains. text = text.replace(/^www\.\w+\.\w+$/ig, "http://$&"); EDIT: Fixed thanks to Chris Lutz's comment. I did test earlier, but a strange combo of bugs (missing anchor, unescaped dot, etc.) made it seemingly work. I should reiterate that this is fragile anyway.
