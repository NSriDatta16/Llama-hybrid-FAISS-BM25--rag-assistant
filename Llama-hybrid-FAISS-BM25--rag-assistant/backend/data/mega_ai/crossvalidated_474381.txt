You can compute posterior probabilities using linear discriminant analysis under a strong assumption of multivariate normality of the predictors, e.g., you can't have a binary variable as one of the predictors. Since multivariate normality implies that the polytomous logistic model also fits the data, but logistic regression does not require normality, I'd suggest switching to polytomous (multinomial) logistic regression for your problem. It is a direct probability estimation method.
