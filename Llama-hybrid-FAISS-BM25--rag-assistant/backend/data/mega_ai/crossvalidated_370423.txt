There are several algorithms/methods for measuring similarity between two time series. A first possible step in deciding which one will work best is comparing the two time series meta features: Length, frequency, scale. If I understand correctly, in your questions the two time series to be compared should have the same frequency and scale, and might differ a bit on the length(due to some missing points in the central system). Given that this missing points rate is low and random, and that you can align the two time series(starting at the same point). It makes sense using Euclidean distance or other 'standard' distance metrics. You can look into the Earth moving distance too, this distance is less sensitive to one time differences. If number of missing points is meaningful, or aligning time series is hard. You can try using Dynamic time wrapping - this algorithms takes into account the possibility that the two time series indices are not aligned/ their alignment changes through the series. This 10 pages paper explains some of what I've suggested and introduces another method for comparing time series. Hope this helps.
