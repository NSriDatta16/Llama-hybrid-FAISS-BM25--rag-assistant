E2L: How do you handle Foreign Keys that participate in multiple relationships?

I have a Database model like this FlowObject FlowObjectID (PK) Description Active ProcessObject FlowObjectID (PK, FK) HasSubmit DecisionObject FlowObjectID (PK, FK) YesFlowObjectID (FK) NoFlowObjectID (FK) YesCaption NoCaption When I try and use create my Entity model I get this warning in my project. Foreign Key constraint 'FK_ProcessObject_FlowObject1' has been omitted from the storage model. Column 'FlowObjectID' of table 'Investigations.Store.ProcessObject' is a Foreign Key participating in multiple relationships. A one-to-one Entity Model will not validate since data inconsistency is possible. ??? Why did it drop my foreign key? Because "A one-to-one Entity Model will not validate since data inconsistency is possible." So it sounds like it is saying it dropped the FK because of data inconsistency but dropping the FK actually reduces date consistency? Should I redesign my database? Is there anyway for L2E to handle FK's that participate in multiple relationships? Is it considered bad database design to have FK's that participate in multiple relationships?
