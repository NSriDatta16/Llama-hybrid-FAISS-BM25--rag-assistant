UIWebView - Can't Scroll Horizontally

Hi when I load a certain webpage in a UIWebView , for some odd reason, it does not allow me to scroll horizontally, only vertically. Other websites that I load into the UIWebView allow me to scroll fine horizontally and vertically. This specific webpage scrolls fine when I visit the webpage in mobile safari but not when I load it in UIWebView . I was able to successfully change the user agent of the UIWebView to that of "Mozilla/5.0" and still it did not let me scroll horizontally. What is the problem and how can I fix/bypass this? Thanks. EDIT: Nevermind, fixed it by setting the UIWebView to "Scale Page to Fit" in the UIWebView attributes within the interface builder.
