Will removing one support vector affect others?

Supppose we have SVM trained on a dataset and the support vectors are $SV=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\}$ . Then, we know that the decision plan is decided by $SV$ . My question is that if we remove one support vector (say $x_1$ ) from the dataset and train the model again. Will the other support vectors $\{x_2,\cdots,x_n\}$ still be the new support vectors after we training on the new dataset?
