As for the question about if you an architecture astronaut: If you are aware of the danger that puts you ahead of a lot of people. You don't want to go the way of your cow-orkers either, it sounds like some of them have become crusty old whiners. Over-engineering is the result of a problem with prioritization that resulted in some part of the system getting too much attention. So the most apparent symptom of over-engineering would be that you can see all around other parts of the system that are hurting for lack of attention. (There is also a tendency for over-engineering to expose the system to increased risks of bad design, because of increased complication and the amount of error-prone speculation involved in deciding what aspects to over-engineer, but as a comment points out, that doesn't automatically follow.)
