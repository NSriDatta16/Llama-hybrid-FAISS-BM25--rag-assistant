How can I normalize my output data for neural network?

I have a dataset consisting of 5 numerical variables, like the sample in the following image: In this dataset the first four variables are the input and the GDP is the output. I am trying to build a neural network for regression of the GDP variable. For the input variables, I have used PCA to normalize the data, while for the GDP variable I have used a MinMax normalization algorithm. However, the accuracy of the results of the neural network is very low and I guess that the problem is on the normalization of my output variable. Any suggestions on how I can improve the accuracy of my neural network?
