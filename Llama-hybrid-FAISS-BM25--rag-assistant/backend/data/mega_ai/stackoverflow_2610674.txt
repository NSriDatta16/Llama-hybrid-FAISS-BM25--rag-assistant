W3C dom api in Java

Take a look at the example code... NodeList folderNodes = document.getElementsByTagName("Folder"); DocumentFragment node = (DocumentFragment) folderNodes.item(0); It was very easy to do "getElementsByTagName" on the document but when I want to do this again on the DocumentFragment it seems I cannot. How do I go about furthering this query?
