Commenting on: "...quite interested to find benchmarks such as TPC-H performed with and without SSD drives." (FYI and full disclosure, I am pseudonymously "J Scouter", the "pretty big naysayer when it came to SSD technology in the enterprise" referred to and linked above.) So....here's the first clue to emerge. Dell and Fusion-IO have published the first EVER audited benchmark using a Flash-memory device for storage. The benchmark is the TPC-H, which is a "decision support" benchmark. This is important because TPC-H entails an almost exclusively "read-only" workload pattern -- perfect context for SSD as it completely avoids the write performance problem. In the scenarios painted for us by the Flash SSD hypesters, this application represents a soft-pitch, a gentle lob right over the plate and an easy "home run" for a Flash-SSD database application. The results? The very first audited benchmark for a flash SSD based database application, and a READ ONLY one at that resulted in (drum roll here)....a fifth place finish among comparable (100GB) systems tested. This Flash SSD system produced about 30% as many Queries-per-hour as a disk-based system result published by Sun...in 2007. Surely though it will be in price/performance that this Flash-based system will win, right? At $1.46 per Query-per-hour, the Dell/Fusion-IO system finishes in third place. More than twice the cost-per-query-per-hour of the best cost/performance disk-based system. And again, remember this is for TPC-H, a virtually "read-only" application. This is pretty much exactly in line with what the MS Cambridge Research team discovered over a year ago -- that there are no enterprise workloads where Flash makes ROI sense from economic or energy standpoints Can't wait to see TPC-C, TPC-E, or SPC-1, but according the the research paper that was linked above, SSDs will need to become orders-of-magnitude cheaper for them to ever make sense in enterprise apps.
