The smooth trend should cope with economic effects without any trouble. Using robust=TRUE in stl makes sense here (and I've changed my original function to do the same). Unless you have more than ten years of data, I would stick with periodic seasonality. It is unlikely to change fast enough to detect with shorter time series. Pre-processing the data for working days makes sense as it removes known causes of variability. I suggest you try the stl approach and look at where it gives very different results from your existing method. Then look at those cases and see which method is giving the most sensible results. I would not go the ARIMA route as it is nowhere near as robust as stl.
