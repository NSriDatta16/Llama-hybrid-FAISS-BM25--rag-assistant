Statistical Computing with R - Maria L. Rizzo covers a lot of the topics in Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists - basic probability and statistics, random variables, Bayesian statistics, Markov chains, visualization of multivariate data, Monte Carlo methods, Permutation tests, probability density estimation, and numerical methods. The equations and formulas used are presented both as mathematical formulas as well as in R code. I would say that a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, calculus, and maybe discrete mathematics would be advisable for anyone who wants to read this book. A programming background would also be helpful, but there are some references for the R language, operators, and syntax.
