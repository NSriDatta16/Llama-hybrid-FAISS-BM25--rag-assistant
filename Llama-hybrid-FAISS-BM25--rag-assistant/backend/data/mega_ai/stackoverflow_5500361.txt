Xcode 4 does everything for you now. Choose Archive from the Product menu. This will build and archive your app into the Organizer. Now select submit. Choose your app store provisioning profile for the code sign and click submit. Xcode will upload and submit your app to iTunes connect. The app is forever archived in Xcode now, with its debug symbols. Ace.
