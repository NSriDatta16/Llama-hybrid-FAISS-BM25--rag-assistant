Might be better to restructure this loop as: static String checkDocId(String docId) { String temp = "no"; while (queryResult.next()) { String result = queryResult.getString("ID"); if (result.equals(docID)) { temp = "yes"; break; } } return temp; } Some people don't like using break (I usually don't) so you can use a boolean in your while (I find that it reads more like english and you can tell the terminating condition right from the while instead of looking for an if inside): static String checkDocId(String docId) { boolean found = false; while (queryResult.next() && !found) { String result = queryResult.getString("ID"); found = result.equals(docID); } return found ? "yes" : "no"; } You're performing a needless comparison otherwise. Remember, a while is just an if with a goto at the end ;) As far as your problem is concerned, what Paul said is correct. Eitherway, I would still restructure the loop so that it's more elegant.
