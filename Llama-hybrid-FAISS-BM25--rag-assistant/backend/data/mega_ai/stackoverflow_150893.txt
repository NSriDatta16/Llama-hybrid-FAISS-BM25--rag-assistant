The problem is not with the regexes themselves, but rather with their treatment as a black box. As with any programming language, maintainability has more to do with the person who wrote it and the person who reads it than with the language itself. There's also a lot to be said for using the right tool for the job. In the example you mentioned in your comment to the original post, a regex is the wrong tool to use for parsing HTML, as is mentioned rather frequently over on PerlMonks. If you try to parse HTML in anything resembling a general manner using only a regex, then you're going to end up either doing it in an incorrect and fragile manner, writing a horrendous and unmaintainable monstrosity of a regex, or (most likely) both.
