Suddenly, all covariates and factors become very significant

I am running a multinomial logistic regression model in R using the command multinom. My response variable, $y$, is a factor with three levels of length 40, 25 and 5 each level. I have several factors and covariates to model it, say $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. At a first step, I wrote $y\sim x_1+x_2$ in the multinom function. As a result, I obtained some "usual" p-values for the levels of $x_1$ and $x_2$: 0.05, 0.61, 0.92... Then I added a third factor/covariate, $x_3$: $y\sim x_1+x_2+x_3$. Suddenly, nearly all p-values were exactly 0, even for levels of $x_1$ and $x_2$ that had not been significant before adding $x_3$. What is the reason for that? If I keep adding more factors in the model, then all p-values become $0$. I joined the second and third levels of $y$ (the ones of length 25 and 5) to have a dichotomic variable, so that I could use the glm function with family binomial. In this glm model, I started writting $y\sim x_1+x_2$, $y\sim x_1+x_2+x_3$, etc, and the problem I mentioned above did not appear. So, is this a problem of the multinom function? Is this a problem of the third level of $y$, which has a very small size? Edit : Here is an example: y p_values (Intercept) x12 x13 x14 x22 x23 2 8.350025e-05 1.315633e-05 0.9798046 0.06366562 0.6952859 0.9892148 3 9.169932e-01 9.957820e-01 0.9753906 0.99891637 0.9992514 0.9889991 # Three explanatory factors/covariates: model p_values (Intercept) x12 x13 x14 x22 x23 x3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.004544893 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.700799167
