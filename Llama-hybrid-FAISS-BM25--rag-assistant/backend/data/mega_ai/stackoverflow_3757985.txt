"Users can be able to edit their own records" What does it mean for you? A database in which records are not editable, that is a Read/Only database, is not very common. You'll have to think about the general architecture of your software. You just don't select a database like a new car. I'd suggest that you won't be focused on the database choice, but take a look at the whole picture. Here are some advices: Separate your database storage, the User Interface, and your software logic. This is called 3-Tier, and is definitively a good idea if you're starting a new project in 2010. It will save you a lot of time in the future. We use such an architecture in our http://blog.synopse.info/category/Open-Source-Projects/SQLite3-Framework Use a database connection which is not fixed to one database engine. Delphi comes with DBX, and there are free or not so expensive alternatives around. See http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39500 for dbx and http://www.torry.net/pages.php?id=552 for alternatives Think about the future: try to guess what will be the features of your application after some time, and try to be ready to implement them in your today's architecture choices. In all cases, you're right asking for advice and feedback. The time you're spending now before coding will spare your time during future maintenance. For example, if one of your request is that "All records will be string", with some BLOB, your database size won't never be bigger than a few GB. SQLite3 could be enough for you, and there is no size limitation in the TEXT fields in this database.
