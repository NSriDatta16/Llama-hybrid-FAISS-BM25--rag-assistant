Higher correlation within subject gets you more power when the test being done is a differencing, equivalent to a paired t-test. The standard deviation used in calculating effect size is multiplied by $\sqrt{1-\rho}$. The standard deviation for difference scores (for a one-sample test) is $SD\sqrt{2-2\rho}$. This also applies where it is appropriate to model using random intercepts, because that means a chunk of variability is being accounted for by individual random effects, and not being counted as error. The opposite happens when the test is strictly between subjects. There you are in the world of increasing your effective sample size (as indicated by "Onestop" earlier). By repeating measurements, you increase your sample by the degree to which the observations are uncorrelated. The standard deviation for an average of independent (uncorrelated) numbers drawn from the same distribution is the standard error: $SD\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}$. For averages of correlated numbers, it is roughly $SD\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}+\rho\frac{N-1}{N}}$. Note that as correlation approaches $1$, you get back the original $SD$, and as it approaches $0$, $SD$ approaches the $SE$ for independent observations. Paul
