You can't style file fields with CSS. But with a little help of javascript you may. The idea is simple: Create an input: #Now place in image Now give both position absolute (in my case I had them in a block with pos relative) Drag input over button and give it bigger z-index then button so button would be under input. Now fade the input with opacity: 0 (not working in IE so use javascript to fade) Gues the idea is understood.
