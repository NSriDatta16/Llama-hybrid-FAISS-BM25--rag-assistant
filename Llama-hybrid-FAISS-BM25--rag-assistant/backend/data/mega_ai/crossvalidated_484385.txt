One of the most difficult problems in image recognition is feature extraction. When the image is very large, you can't take every pixel as a feature. For SVM, it is very difficult to directly process the image without feature extraction, because the data dimension is too high(too many pixels). For neural network, more precisely, convolution neural network, its convolution layer is actually doing feature extraction. Through convolution layer, the original image will be mapped into a low dimensional vector, so the dimension of image data will be reduced, and then the classification can be easier through the full connection layer behind the convolution layer.
