Do you think that you could quantify all those attributes? If yes, I would suggest performing a principal component analysis. In the general case where all the correlations are positive (and if they aren't, you can easily get there using some transformation), the first principal component can be considered as a measure of the total importance of the expert, since it's a weighted average of all the attributes (and the weights would be the corresponding contributions of the variables - Under this perspective, the method itself will reveal the importance of each attribute). The score that each expert achieves in the first principal component is what you need to rank them.
