Returning XML from a JSP page in Struts

I'm developing an enterprise application whose main purpose is data retrieval. The user enters a URL ".../GetData.do" and the application returns an XML based on a schema containing the data. Where is the best place to write the XML that would allow my to validate against the schema? In the Action class, the .jsp file, or somewhere else? I'm using Struts 1 as my web application framework. Thanks.
