Arima and Sarima in python

I wanted to ask I am usually using R when I do time series but I am trying out python now. When doing the Arima model I use ARIMA function But Can I also use SARIMAX function for just Arima models? When I do SARIMAX order $= (2, 0, 4)$ (noseasonal parametrs) and then when I do ARIMA order $= (2, 0, 4) $ Outputs are not the same even thou the model should be the same? What am I missing?
