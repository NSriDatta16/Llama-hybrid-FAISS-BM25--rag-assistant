The AccountManager class is integrated with your phone accounts. So if you follow all the guides and get it working correctly you'll see your accounts under the menu "Settings->accounts and sync". From there you can customize them or even delete them. Furthermore the accountManager has a cache of the authentication tickets for your accounts. This can be used also if you don't plan to synchronize your account (as far as I know). If you don't want your accounts to appear under that menu you shouldn't use the AccountManager and store the accounts data elsewhere (maybe in the shared preferences) http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html
