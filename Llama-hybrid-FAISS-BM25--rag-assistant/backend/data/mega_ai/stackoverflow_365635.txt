From what I gather: "top-down deletion" avoids traversing the same node in a path more than once during the operation. So, given the simple path from the root to a given node, if you're going to do some thing to a node that's in that path anyway, why not just do it on the way down? It avoids having to traverse over parts of the path more than once. Therefore, this saves time. A similar principle is employed for multiple operations (including insert) in 2-3-4 trees (a special sub-case of a,b-trees) Does top-down deletion minimize the number of re-balancing operations? Think that, in the average case, it does. Because you make it potentially easier to insert something afterward with few re-balancing operations. Could it be possible that top-down deletion pro-actively does too many re-colorings and re-balancings on the way down? Maybe, but that depends on the data set. However, as mentioned above. This may reduce the number of re-colorings and re-balancings overall.
