vering more consistent, 24/7 service. However, critics warn of potential compliance pitfalls, such as the risk of unintended bias in algorithmic decision-making. History In the 1980s, AI started to become prominent in finance as expert systems were commercialized. For example, Dupont created 100 expert systems, which helped them to save almost $10 million per year. One of the first systems was the Pro-trader expert system that predicted the 87-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1986. "The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism." One of the first expert systems to help with financial plans was PlanPowerm and Client Profiling System, created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX). It was launched in 1986. It helped create personal financial plans for people. In the 1990s, AI was applied to fraud detection. In 1993, FinCEN Artificial Intelligence System (FAIS) was launched. It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week, and over two years, it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering equal to $1 billion. These expert systems were later replaced by machine learning systems. Outside finance, the late 1980s and early 1990s also saw expert systems used in technical and environmental domains. For example, researchers built a fishway design advisor to recommend fish passage structures under varying hydraulic and biological conditions using the VP-Expert shell. Transportation researchers applied the same shell to balance airport capacity with noise-mitigation plans. In agriculture, a potato insect expert system (PIES) supported pest management decisions for Colorado potato beetle. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s CORMIX system for modeling pollutant discharges combined rules with Fortran hydrodynamic models. AI can enhance entrepreneurial activity, and AI is one of the most dynamic areas for start-ups, with significant venture capital flowing into AI. Regulatory developments in the EU In the European Union, the Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) classifies several finance‑sector uses of AI as "high‑risk", including systems used to evaluate the creditworthiness of natural persons or to establish a credit score and AI used for risk assessment and pricing in life or health insurance. These systems must meet requirements on risk management, data governance, technical documentation and logging, transparency, and human oversight. The Act's obligations are phased in: prohibitions and AI‑literacy rules apply from 2 February 2025, governance and most GPAI duties from 2 August 2025, the bulk of obligations from 2 August 2026, and certain safety‑component high‑risk obligations from 2 August 2027. Health Healthcare AI in healthcare is often used for classification, to evaluate a CT scan or electrocardiogram or to identify high-risk patients for population health. AI is helping with the high-cost problem of dosing. One study suggested that AI could save $16 billion. In 2016, a study reported that an AI-derived formula derived the proper dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to transplant patients. Current research has indicated that non-cardiac vascular illnesses are also being treated with artificial intelligence (AI). For certain disorders, AI algorithms can aid in diagnosis, recommended treatments, outcome prediction, and patient progress tracking. As AI technology advances, it is anticipated that it will become more significant in the healthcare industry. The early detection of diseases like cancer is made possible by AI algorithms, which diagnose diseases by analyzing complex sets of medical data. For example, the IBM Watson system might be used to comb through massive data such as medical records and clinical trials to help diagnose a problem.
