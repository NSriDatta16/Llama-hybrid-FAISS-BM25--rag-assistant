If the proportion of missing on $X$ is not low (for example, >10%), you can create two variables: $X_1 = X$ if $X$ is not missing, = 0 if $X$ is missing. $X_2 = 0$ if $X$ is not missing, = 1 if $X$ is missing. Then fit the model with $X_1$ and $X_2$ as covariates (other covariates have no change and still in the model). The meaning of coefficient of $X_1$ is the same, the change of response variable when $X$ increase by 1 unit. The meaning of coefficient of $X_2$ is average change of response variable comparing $X$ is missed and $X=0$ . If the proportion of missing on $X$ is low, maybe delete them from the analysis is good approach.
