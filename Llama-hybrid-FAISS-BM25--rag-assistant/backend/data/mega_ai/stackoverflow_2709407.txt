Overriding 'require' in Clojure?

Would it be possible to override the 'require' command so that it will try to download a certain resource if it was not found on the local machine. For example: (require 'examples.introduction) ; if not found => download from the net ; (url: http://media.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/code/examples/introduction.clj)
