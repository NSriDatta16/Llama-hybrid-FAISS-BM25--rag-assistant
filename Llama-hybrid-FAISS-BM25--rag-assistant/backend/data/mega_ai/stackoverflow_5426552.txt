Is it clean to have conditional statements within Codeigniter views?

I am currently trying to separate my Views as much as possible from my Controllers. Ideally I would like to have minimal PHP in my view, except variable names, etc. These variables are being passed in from the controller. But is it clean to have IF statements (or the like) within a view? For example // Controller $data['status'] = 'pass'; $this->load->view("Status Page", $data); And .. Pass Fail The closest thing I found to an answer on SO was Conditionals in Views This was for ASP, and I guess the principles still apply. I could bring the conditional statements back into the controller, but then the controller would be creating HTML and sending it to the view, which isn't right either. Is there any way to avoid this cross over? Or will there always be fragments of PHP in views?
