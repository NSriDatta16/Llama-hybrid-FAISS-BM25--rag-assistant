which tables are affected by the Catalog URL Rewrites index in Magento?

Pretty straightforward question, which tables are affected by the Catalog URL Rewrites index in Magento? Each time I run this index it takes a long time to run and the admin status for the index gets stuck on PROCESSING. I have tried to find lock tables with SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST and have TRUNCATED core_url_rewrite and now I am waiting for the rebuild to run again, while I listen for error in system.log. It would be nice to know exactly which tables are used and if it is just core_url_rewrite and catalogsearch_fulltext, which I have also truncated.... Just found these files: magento/var/locks/index_process_1.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_2.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_3.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_4.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_5.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_6.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_7.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_8.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_9.lock magento/var/locks/index_process_10.lock They seem to match times when I tried to run the index, but do they stop the index creation like a mysql lock file would do?
