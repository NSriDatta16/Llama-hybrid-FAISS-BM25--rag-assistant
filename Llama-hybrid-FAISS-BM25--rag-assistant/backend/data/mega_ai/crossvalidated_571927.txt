What statistic would I use to explain the discrepancy between two binary variables?

I have 3 variables in a large dataset: whether students passed their multiple choice portion of their final (binary: pass-fail), whether they passed qualitative portion (binary: pass-fail), and student test taking preference (unordered categorical: multiple choice, written, no preference). The point-biserial correlation between final exam variables is .78, and I'm interested in exploring how much student reason explains the discrepancy between these exams (e.g., passing one portion but not another), not exam performance itself. Is there a statistic to account for the discrepancies between two categorical variables to explain the variance in why there isn't a perfect relationship between the two binary variables (e.g., the .22 in this example)? If not, how would you recommend to structure this problem to see how much student test preference explains them passing one section but failing another? My intuition says to set up a logistic regression with two outcomes (no discrepancy - discrepancy) and try to predict the outcomes. If I did that though and found that the pseudo-R squared was .2, would I be justified in saying that "student test preference explains 20% of the variability between students passing just one section of the test"?
