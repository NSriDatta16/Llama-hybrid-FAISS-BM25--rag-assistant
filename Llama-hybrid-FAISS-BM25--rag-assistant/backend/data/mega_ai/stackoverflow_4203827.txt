If you're willing to give up having another message serializer injected into your own serializer and just wrap the concrete XML serializer, it would be easier. You'd also need to expose additional properties (the ones on the XML serializer) and then pass those through. I know that this isn't particularly elegant and that's why we're improving the extensibility story in the next version to allow you to plug in encryption without fiddling with the serializer. All that being said, it's likely that you don't need encryption between all endpoints, but rather only between those communicating outside the LAN. For those cases, you can use the Gateway process that comes with NServiceBus which enables HTTP-based communication which can then be configured to go over HTTPS. This solution would require less coding but would involve another process in your deployment.
