Using Open-URI to fetch XML and the best practice in case of problems with a remote url not returning/timing out?

Current code works as long as there is no remote error: def get_name_from_remote_url cstr = "http://someurl.com" getresult = open(cstr, "UserAgent" => "Ruby-OpenURI").read doc = Nokogiri::XML(getresult) my_data = doc.xpath("/session/name").text # => 'Fred' or 'Sam' etc return my_data end But, what if the remote URL times out or returns nothing? How I detect that and return nil, for example? And, does Open-URI give a way to define how long to wait before giving up? This method is called while a user is waiting for a response, so how do we set a max timeoput time before we give up and tell the user "sorry the remote server we tried to access is not available right now"?
