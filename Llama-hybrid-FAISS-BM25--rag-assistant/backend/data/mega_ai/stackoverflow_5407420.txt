Hibernate - beyond Object/Relational Mapping?

Looking at http://www.hibernate.org/ it has this introduction text: Historically, Hibernate facilitated the storage and retrieval of Java domain objects via Object/Relational Mapping. Today, Hibernate is a collection of related projects enabling developers to utilize POJO-style domain models in their applications in ways extending well beyond Object/Relational Mapping. In other words: originally it was about ORM, now it's about more than ORM. Reading between the lines: ORM isn't the only game in town - there are newer ways of approaching these things that may work better. When I go into the documentation, it still just describes it as an ORM library. Are there any good blog posts that give an overview of specifically any new "post-ORM" approaches that have been taken, and how those features work and are intended to be used (and how/why they might be better than "traditional" ORM)?
