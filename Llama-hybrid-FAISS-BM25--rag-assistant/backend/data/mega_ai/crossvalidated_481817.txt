Nonparametric theory textbook(s)?

I am looking for a nonparametric statistical theory textbook that does not avoid tools from measure-theoretic probability and covers proofs on topics outside of rank-based hypothesis tests: e.g., kernel density estimation, nonparametric estimation, and resampling methods (i.e., bootstrapping, jackknife). The closest textbook I can find to this is Tsybakov's Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation . What can I use to supplement this textbook? Wasserman's All of Nonparametric Statistics has the appropriate topic coverage, but does not really cover proofs.
