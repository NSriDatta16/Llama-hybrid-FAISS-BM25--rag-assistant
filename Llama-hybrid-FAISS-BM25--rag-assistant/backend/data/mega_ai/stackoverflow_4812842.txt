So what is happening is that your event is bubbling up the dom. Click occurs on div2 div2 click function is called it changes the colour of div1 it assigns a click event to div1 div2 click function ends (with an implicit return true ) event bubbles up to parent in DOM div1 receives bubbled click event div1 click function is called if you dont want this to happen then you need to return false in your click handler for div2 EDIT: Please note that the way you are organising your JS may not be the best because if I click div2 100 times that means that div1 now has 100 click events that will run. I suggest that you do it this way (keep in mind that I don't know what your requirements are): $("#div2").click(function() { $("#div1").css("background-color", "green"); return false; }); $("#div1").click(function() { $("#div1").css("background-color", "red"); });
