Using esellerate SDK in xcode problem

I'm trying to use the Esellerate SDK in my cocoa application, i dragged the "EWSMac.framework" to the frameworks folder in xcode 4. But when compiling i get: ld: framework not found EWSMac clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) Command /Developer/usr/bin/clang failed with exit code 1 Theres not much documentation on the subject in the esellerate SDK DMG. Please help
