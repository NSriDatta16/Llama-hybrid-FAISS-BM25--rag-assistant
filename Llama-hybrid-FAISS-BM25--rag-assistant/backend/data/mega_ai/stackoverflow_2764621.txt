Answer one: A relevant, if not particularly encouraging, qoute from the Vim docs (see :help put-Visual-mode ): When using a put command like |p| or |P| in Visual mode, Vim will try to replace the selected text with the contents of the register. Whether this works well depends on the type of selection and the type of the text in the register. With blockwise selection it also depends on the size of the block and whether the corners are on an existing character. (Implementation detail: it actually works by first putting the register after the selection and then deleting the selection.) The previously selected text is put in the unnamed register. If you want to put the same text into a Visual selection several times you need to use another register. E.g., yank the text to copy, Visually select the text to replace and use "0p . You can repeat this as many times as you like, the unnamed register will be changed each time. Answer two: R (the capital 'R') puts you in replace mode. I'm missing answer three, I'm afraid. Answer three: Not quite matching the "uniform yank history" spec, but "+y yanks to clipboard and "+p pastes from clipboard if a clipboard is available.
