not a standard way.. but from my experience, I come up with this structure: root/ -> images/ -> -> upload -> js/ -> css/ -> data/ -> docs/ -> download/ -> mme/ -> subpages/ -> temp/ -> siteadmin/ root: all 1st level file located there images: all images. if images for subfolder, then another level there with the same name. upload is for uploaded images. js: javascript css: css data: some raw data if needed docs: word doc or pdf for download download: something that for ppl to downlaod... mme: other multimedia files. e.g. flash, movie.. soudn clips.etc. subpages: 2 or subsequent level pages. organized in different folders temp: any testing page store there. private, not public. siteadmin: if you have an admin site.
