Technically removing the string before # would leave you with "#test". Anyway, use - [NSString componentsSeparatedByString:] : test = [[test componentsSeparatedByString:@"#"] lastObject]; Note that this approach is fragile: if you you have 2 # you will end up with just the last part, e.g. "foo" from "abc#bar#foo". Using lastObject instead of objectAtIndex: means if there is no # in the string then you get the original string instead of crashing.
