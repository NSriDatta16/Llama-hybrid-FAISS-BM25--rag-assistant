Cross-loaded indicators in factor analysis (before regression analysis)

I performed exploratory factor analysis, and extracted two underlying factors out of eight indicators. Then, I used confirmatory factor analysis for some theoretical fine-tuning. After minor revisions, the model yielded significant results, as far as CFI, TLI, RMSEA and SRMR are concerned. But I ended up with two indicators that are cross-loaded on two factors as follows: F1 F2 i1 i2 i3 i4 i4 i5 i5 i6 i7 i8 Under the circumstances, is it a problem to compute a mean score out of the indicators under each construct for use as predictors in a regression analysis? That is, if I average i1-i5 , and i4-i8 , to use as predictors in a subsequent regression analysis. More precisely, how much of a problem, if at all, is it that indicators i4 and i5 are represented in both predictors F1 and F2 ?
