Not knowing your whole situation, here's what I would recommend on the face of it. If you don't have SSIS, and you don't want to deal with the BULK INSERT/bcp format file, I would venture to say that the most elegant way to import the file would be to write your own small .NET-based console application to do it. Note that if you can load data into a DataTable, you can use the SqlBulkCopy class in .NET.
