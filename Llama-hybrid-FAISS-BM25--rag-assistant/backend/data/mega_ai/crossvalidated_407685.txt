Your question is spot on. The frequentist approach is based on amassing evidence against an assumption that an effect is absent, when point null hypotheses are used. Bayesians generally disdain hypotheses (and Bayes factors) in favor of quantifying evidence for all possible levels of an effect. The most basic evidence if the posterior probability that the effect is in the right direction. Then you can move onto the probability that an effect is greator than $\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ . There are two reasons why the impressions you get from frequentist p-values and Bayesian posterior probabilities will differ: Bayesian probabilities are directional, whereas most frequentist tests are two-sided so as to penalize you for possibly making a false claim that the effect is backwards (something that most investigators are not interested in) Evidence for an effect given the data (Bayesian posterior) is different from evidence for extreme data given no effect (p-value) For these reasons, Bayesian posterior distributions are more consistent with optimal decision making. If one were playing the odds and cost was not a factor, one would make money by betting on the effectiveness of a procedure if the posterior probability of it working in the right direction were > 0.5, given a reasonable prior distribution.
