What can make the Framerate drop while CPU is not roofing in Silverlight?

We have implemented a drag and drop feature that shows a nice simple representation of what we are dragging. The drag and drop happens on a view that has a lot of elements While dragging, the CPU doesn't go to the roof it stays steady below 10 no matter how long or how fast you try to drag the item, but the framerate drops dramatically from above 60 to less than 10. EnableRedraw clearly shows that only the item we drag is being redrawn, not the entire page. How can I find out what is causing that performance issue?
