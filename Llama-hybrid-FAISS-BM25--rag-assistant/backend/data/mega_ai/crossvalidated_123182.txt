If you can be sure that the words in your paragraph are correct, you could take the likelihood over words instead of letters, for example using the conditional $P(w_2|w_1)$ where $w_i$ are words. These probabilities you could get from Google: https://books.google.com/ngrams . If I got your question wrong, I am sorry and you may want to specify it a little more ;)
