Nathan L is right that the HPDI is one reasonable answer to this question. But it seems worth pointing out that there is no single perfect answer to your question. The posterior is a probability distribution, and there is no perfect way to summarize all the information in a generic probability distribution with just two scalars. One reasonable way to describe a distribution using an interval is to give the HPDI, one way is the 5%-95% interval, and there are other possibilities. None is perfect. But one nice feature of Bayesian statistics is that the problem of giving a plausible interval for a parameter is divided into two parts, one of which generally has a unique answer, and one of which does not. The unique answer is the posterior, which specifies everything you know about the parameter after you've taken the data into account. If you want to summarize the posterior with an interval, that's fine, but (as I hope is clear now) there's no one true answer to that part of the problem.
