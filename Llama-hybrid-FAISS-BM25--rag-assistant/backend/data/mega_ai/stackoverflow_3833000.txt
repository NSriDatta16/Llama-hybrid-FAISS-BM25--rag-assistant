Large Prism/Silverlight application - multiple modules talking to single data service

I am developing the framework for what will be a large data-driven Silverlight application using Prism. I am creating multiple modules for different pieces of the application, but all modules need to access data from the same REST webservice. So my initial plan was to create a separate module for the data retrieval and use EventAggregator to then pass results to the other modules that subscribe to the result event. The data module will not have a ViewModel since there is no View. So a couple of questions: 1. Is the way I have described a good way to do this - one module feeds the others? 2. Where in the data module can I publish events if there is no ViewModel? Any tips or advice are much appreciated.
