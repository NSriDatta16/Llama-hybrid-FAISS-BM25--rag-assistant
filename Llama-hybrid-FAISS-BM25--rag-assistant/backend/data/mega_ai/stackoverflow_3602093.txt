Flex Best Practices - Multiple Flex Projects or 1 Project, multiple Application MXML files

Having seen several different ways of setting up larger projects in flex, I'm wondering what your opinions are of how to organize projects that are going to require 2 or more different applications. For example a public and private site within the project. The two main ways that I know of would be first, creating one flex project, and then adding different mxml application files. Both applications would be able to share code. The other way (which I currently like, but have no way of justifying), would be to create a different flex project for each application, and any code that needs to be shared could be part of a shared flex library. I guess something about the separation of the applications I like more, especially since I'm either working on one or the other at a time. What are your opinions, and do you have any reasons for doing it one way or the other?
