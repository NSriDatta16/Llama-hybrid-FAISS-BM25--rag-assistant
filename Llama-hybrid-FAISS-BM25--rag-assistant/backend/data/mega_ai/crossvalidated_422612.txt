I would say you are (potentially -most likely) mistreating time series data. Regression methods and the underlying assumptions of no auto-correlation within the series are well developed here http://users.stat.umn.edu/~helwig/notes/mvlr-Notes.pdf . BUT since you have time series data play close attention to this (well-written If I must say so myself) web-gem https://autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf . Don't try and go back and criticize your teachers or your text , they told you the assumptions but perhaps you didn't hear them.
