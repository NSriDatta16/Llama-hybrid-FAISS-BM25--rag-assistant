VS2008 added an "Organize Usings" context menu, which has a Sort, Remove, and "Remove and Sort" option which will do what you want per file. The Visual Studio Power Commands add-in adds a context menu in the solution explorer for projects and solutions which is a "Remove and Sort" for all files in the project and all projects in the solution, respectively.
