Remaining heap size

I know this might be an oversimplification - but I need to know the amount of free memory I could allocate in my program. It's a windows mobile project (c++) and it seems like I might have a memory leak hiding somewhere. Calling a function which returns the remaining size (or remaining chunks) of heap storage I could access would be perfect. Is there some way to traverse the available chunks of memory the operator new uses? Or a built-in WINAPI (or winmobile) function that does it?
