Conditional Inference Random Forest

I use cforest, a function of the R package Party, to realize a conditional inference random forest. However I don't understand how this function compute the predict variable for a regression problem. Could you explain me how this work please ? Can I get in output the median of the mean final tree nodes ? Can I get the more significant explanatory variables with this function ?
