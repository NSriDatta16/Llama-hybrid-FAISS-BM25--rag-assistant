Given that the ordering of students is arbitrary, I don't see why a (2D) convolutional neural network makes sense. However, a 1D convolutional layer would be quite a good idea--based on the question it sounds like you're looking for a feature that is a shift-invariant convolutional feature in the time domain, after all. However, neural network training is finicky and it's hard to interpret results, so I wouldn't really suggest it. Logistic regression is much more reasonable, though I'm assuming there are quite a lot of students per dataset and so I'd suggest you average over students but keep the years intact. It sounds like you're not really interested in any individual student (because each student only went to one school) but rather average trends -- this also helps because now you should have the same number of features per data point (each data point here corresponding to what you refer to as a data set).
