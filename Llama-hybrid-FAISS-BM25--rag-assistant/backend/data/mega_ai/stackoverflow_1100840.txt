IRC Python Bot: Best Way

I want to build a bot that basically does the following: Listens to the room and interacts with users and encourages them to PM the bot. Once a user has PMed the bot engage with the client using various AI techniques. Should I just use the IRC library or Sockets in python or do I need more of a bot framework. What would you do? Thanks! Here is the code I'm currently using, however, I haven't gotten it to work. #!/usr/bin/python import socket network = 'holmes.freenet.net' port = 6667 irc = socket.socket ( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM ) irc.connect ( ( network, port ) ) irc.send ( 'NICK PyIRC\r\n' ) irc.send ( 'USER PyIRC PyIRC PyIRC :Python IRC\r\n' ) irc.send ( 'JOIN #pyirc\r\n' ) irc.send ( 'PRIVMSG #pyirc :Can you hear me?\r\n' ) irc.send ( 'PART #pyirc\r\n' ) irc.send ( 'QUIT\r\n' ) irc.close()
