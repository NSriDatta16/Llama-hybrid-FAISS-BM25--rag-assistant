you should really read a bit about Object Oriented programming. you don't organize little guys in bigger guy do get work done. Classes in hold some data and provide method to manipulate that data in meaninful ways. Data usually are variables of some other Class, you must declare where from do you get those. You do this declaration by specifying import statement. BTW you should explicitly create a class instance to use it, i.e. invoke class constructor method package com.foo; import com.foo.Bar; public class StackOverflow { private Bar myBar; public StackOverflow() { //this is a constructor of StackOverflow class myBar = new Bar(); //i'm invoking constructor of Bar class } }
