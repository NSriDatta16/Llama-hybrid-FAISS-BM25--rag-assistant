Call a JavaScript function by hitting enter in a textbox without global events of jQuery

I am working on a project with the goal of learning, and I am avoiding jQuery thus far to learn as much JavaScript as possible. I have been successfully using onkeypress to determine whether or not enter was hit in a textbox or textarea, but after adding a searchbar on me website, I discovered that events like onkeypress are global (ie. hitting enter in the search bar activates my 'send message' textarea). I am also using AJAX, and thus I do not want a simple form submit. I am also hoping to use a textarea, since I am after multiple lines (so that more text is visible). Under these constraints, is this reasonable to do without using jQuery? If so, how can I do it? Other answers on the site simply point to jQuery. Thanks, Paragon Edit: I was asked for code, so here is the relevant HTML and JavaScript. Here is one of the inputs: Here is the javascript to go along with it: function activate(e, message) { if (isNotEnter(e)) { return true; } else // ie. enter was pressed { // only proceed to search() if message is not empty if (message.length >= 1) { search(); } return false; } } And the function isNotEnter(): function isNotEnter(e) { if (e.keyCode == 13) { return false; } else { return true; } }
