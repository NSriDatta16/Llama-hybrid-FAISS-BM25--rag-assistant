An interaction term is usually quite correlated with its main effects variables - in your case sim index and years patenting. Therefore significance of the single coefficients may be gone but what you actually want to know is the joint significance of the main and the interaction coefficients. You can do this with an F-test. Also be aware that interactions in logistic regressions don't have the same interpretation as in linear models. See here for example under the heading "Logistic interactions are a complex concept". For the interpretation of your regressors on the outcome you also need to calculate the marginal effects in order to make an effective statement. Since the logistic regression line is non-linear it has different slopes at different points (unlike OLS where the partial effect of your variables is linear) you have to choose where you want to evaluate the slope. Often the mean is chosen for this but it depends on your research question.
