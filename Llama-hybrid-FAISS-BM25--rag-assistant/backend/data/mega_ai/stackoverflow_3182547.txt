What's the best way to organize data on my embedded system?

I haven't done much programming for Embedded Systems before, and now I have to create some scripts for something relatively tiny ( I will be programming the prototype in Perl, and will likely need to re-write the scripts I create in c for better performance later on down the road. I'd like to be able to reuse the data structures I create when I re-do it later on. Most of my experience thus far has been in MySQL, so it would be great if the syntax was simliar to that. Any suggestions? Sorry I can't be more descriptive about the platform I'm working on.
