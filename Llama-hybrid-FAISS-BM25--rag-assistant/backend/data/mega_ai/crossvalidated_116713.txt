Correlation on mean values

Please note: the variables named in this example do not correspond with actual variable type values, but are simplified for clarity purposes. I have 13 groups, each containing values X of, say, the weights of individuals of a country. So each of the groups contains data of a different country. Now, for each country we have a known value Y, e.g. how many neighbours the country has (which is fixed, not an average). X for each group can contain a high number of samples from 1000 to up to 150000, such that all individuals within the population are measured, the sample is thus not a subsample. Now, I want to correlate the mean value of each group, |x| , with Y. In this example, to see if the mean weight correlates with how many neighbours the country has. My question is: can I correlate mean values? Or do I need to do the correlation on all values X with Y?
