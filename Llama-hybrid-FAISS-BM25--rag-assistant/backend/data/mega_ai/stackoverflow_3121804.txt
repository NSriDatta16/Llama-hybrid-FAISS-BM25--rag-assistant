See also this related (though not identical) thread on Python 3.0. While I think the case for 3.x is more compelling than it was a year ago, it still doesn't have the breadth of third-party library coverage of 2.x. I would suggest developing for 2.6 and making use of the migration utilities when the time finally comes (e.g. some dependency is forcing you) to move to 3.x.
