The reason why it doesn't work is because the comparison does not compare strings, but character pointers. The reason why it may work when you use char* is because the compiler may decide to store the literal string "opt" once and reuse it for both references (I am sure I have seen a compiler setting somewhere that indicates whether the compiler does this). In the case of char opt[], the compiler copies the string literal to the storage area reserved for the opt array (probably on the stack), which causes the pointers to be different. Renze
