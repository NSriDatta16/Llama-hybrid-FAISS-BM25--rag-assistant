Creating a JSNI method returning a DocumentFragment is dead simple.. you just return document.createDocumentFragment(); :) The JSNI method should either return JavaScriptObject or some other type that you know will work (like Node - I'm not sure were you are going with this, but JSOs work that way - you can cast () any subclass of JavaScriptObject to any other JavaScriptObject ).
