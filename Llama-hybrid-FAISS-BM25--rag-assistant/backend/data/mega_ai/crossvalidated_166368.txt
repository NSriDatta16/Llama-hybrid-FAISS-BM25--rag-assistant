Jailin Ai gives a fairly nice presentation of RJ MCMC together (though it hews very closely to Green's original paper) with attendant R code as part of his master's thesis at Leeds. Also gives an in-depth example of change-point problems, which are also included in Green's 1995 paper. Find the thesis and the code here: http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~voss/projects/2011-RJMCMC/
