You have 11 variables, and if PCA was useless, you'd have 2/11 (18%) of variance explained by PC1 and PC2. In your case it it's 34%. So, the PCA is not completely useless, but it doesn't have a lot of power. Consider, for instance, interest rate modeling, where two components usually explain 80-90% of variance of the vector.
