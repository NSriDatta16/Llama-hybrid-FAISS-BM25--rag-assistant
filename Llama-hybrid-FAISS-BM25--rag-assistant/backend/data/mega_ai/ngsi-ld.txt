NGSI-LD is an information model and API for publishing, querying and subscribing to context information. It is meant to facilitate the open exchange and sharing of structured information between different stakeholders. It is used across application domains such as smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, and more generally for the Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, systems of systems and digital twins. NGSI-LD has been standardized by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standardization Institute) through the Context Information Management Industry Specification Group, following a request from the European Commission. Its takeup and further development are spelled out in the EU's "Rolling plan for ICT standardization". NGSI-LD builds upon a decades-old corpus of research in context management frameworks and context modelling. The acronym NGSI stands for "Next Generation Service Interfaces", a suite of specifications originally issued by the OMA which included Context Interfaces. These were taken up and evolved as NGSIv2 by the European Future Internet Public-Private-Partnership (PPP), which spawned the FIWARE open source community. The NGSI-LD information model represents Context Information as entities that have properties and relationships to other entities. It is derived from property graphs, with semantics formally defined on the basis of RDF and the semantic web framework. It can be serialized using JSON-LD. Every entity and relationship is given a unique IRI reference as identifier, making the corresponding data exportable as linked data datasets. The -LD suffix denotes this affiliation to the linked data universe. Design Information model The NGSI-LD information model can be considered as the first formal specification by a de jure standards organization of the property graph model, which has emerged since the early 2000s as an informal common denominator model for graph databases. The core concepts are: A property graph (a.k.a. "attributed graph") is a directed multigraph, made up of nodes (vertices) connected by directed links, where nodes and arcs both may have multiple optional attached properties (i.e. attributes) Properties (similar to attributes in object models) have the form of arbitrary key-value pairs. Keys are character strings and values are arbitrary data types. By contrast to RDF graphs, properties are not arcs of the graph. Relationships are arcs (directed edges) of the graph, which always have an identifier, a start node and an end node The NGSI-LD meta-model formally defines these foundational concepts (Entities, Relationships, Properties) on the basis of RDF/RDFS/OWL, and partially on the basis of JSON-LD. An entity is the informational representative of something (a referent) that is supposed to exist in the real world, outside of the computational platform using NGSI-LD. This referent need not be something strictly physical (it could be a legal or administrative entity), nor self-contained (it may be a distributed system-level construct). Any instance of such an entity is supposed to be uniquely identified by an IRI, and characterized by reference to one or more NGSI-LD Entity Type(s). In property-graph language, it is a node. A property is an instance that associates a characteristic, an NGSI-LD Value, to either an NGSI-LD Entity, an NGSI-LD Relationship or another NGSI-LD Property. Properties of properties are explicitly allowed and are encouraged e.g. to express the accuracy of a particular measured value. A relationship is a directed link between a subject (starting point), that may be an NGSI-LD Entity, an NGSI-LD Property, or another NGSI-LD Relationship, and an object (end-point), that is an NGSI-LD Entity. A NGSI-LD Relationship from a Property to an Entity can for example be used to express that the Property was measured by that Entity (Provenance of the measurement). A value is a JSON value (i.e. a string, a number, true or false, an object, an array), or a JSON-LD typed valu
