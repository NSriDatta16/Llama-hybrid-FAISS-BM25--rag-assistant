Imputing missing observation in multivariate time series

Suppose I have a dataframe consisting of six time series. In this dataframe, some observations are missing, meaning at some timepoints all time series contain a NA-value. In R, one possible imputation package that can be used to impute time series data is Amelia. However, this package does not work for observations that are completely missing. Are there other ways to impute my data? For what it's worth, the amount of missing observations is less than 20% of all observations.
