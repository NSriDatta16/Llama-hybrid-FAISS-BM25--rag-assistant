When to Log/Exp your Variables when using Random Forest Models?

I'm doing regression using Random Forests for predicting prices based on several attributes. Code is written in Python using Scikit-learn. How do you decide whether you should transform your variables using exp / log before using it to fit the regression model? Is it necessary when using an Ensemble approach such as Random Forest?
