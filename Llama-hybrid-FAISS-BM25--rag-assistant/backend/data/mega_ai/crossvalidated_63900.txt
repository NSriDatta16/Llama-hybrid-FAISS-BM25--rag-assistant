No bites so I'd thought I'd post + accept what I've come up until someone, hopefully,can do better. I think that this new fold_in() function will do what I want: fold_in2 fold_in2(train.lsa,test) docs [,1] [,2] D1 -0.37404506 0.5325658 D2 -0.06960317 0.7690764 D3 -0.58860967 -0.1680743 My only hesitation with it is that I'm not 100% on the linear algebra behind it so I will likely just use straight up PCA via prcomp() - after looking at the actual code used for lsa() I'm not seeing anything special that makes it better than PCA to begin with.
