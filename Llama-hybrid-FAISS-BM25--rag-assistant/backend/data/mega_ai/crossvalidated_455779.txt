How to analyze clinical outcomes after propensity matching

Suppose I have two propensity matched groups whose covariates are balanced. How do I analyze clinical outcomes between the groups. I would be interested in overall survival, one year survival, and incidence of adverse events such as stroke. Can I use standard generalized logistic regression models and kaplan meier curves with log rank test? Do I need to treat the clinical subjects as paired and adjust my analysis appropriately (i.e stratified log rank and Mcnemar test) Thank you!
