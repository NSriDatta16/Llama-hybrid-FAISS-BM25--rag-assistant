Looking through that paper, it does not seem clear what features they are using as input. However, a related paper gives some indication of a technique they used with multi SOM. They implemented 19 different frequency domain, time domain, or phase space transformations, then used some method to narrow it down to a subset of those features that were used. They described their approach to feature engineering more specifically than the paper listed in the question, but I think it leaves plenty of questions. Scherbart, A. and Goerke, N. Unsupervised System for Discovering Patterns in Time-Series http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.92.69 If you have moved past the feature engineering issue already, then the question must be a general one about SOM. I'd say the usual approach is to use time windows, so you may use the features from each time window as the input vectors. The codebook that you're creating is in the same feature space as the input. The codebook is made of codebook entries, one for each cell. If you compare any input to the codebook, the codebook entry that most closely matches the input is the winner. To label the map, you can show a set of inputs with known labels, then see which labels are mapped to which cell, i.e. the labels that correspond to the winning data for each cell.
