xgboost with 3500 features

I'm trying to make a solution for: https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news/ This question relates to using only market price data to predict future prices (i.e. not news data, as specified in the kaggle problem). I've used xgboost to determine that the most important factor for predicting the return is the recent return. I've hypothesised that the prices of stocks may be related, so I have created a feature table with every stock's recent returns in it (including the target stock we want to predict). It's about 3500 columns wide. When I train it, no matter what target stock I choose, the features it ranks as important are those near the left column of my features table - implying that stocks that begin with 'A' have special predictive power. I expected that if I had picked Apple, I'd have gotten other tech companies' recent returns ranked as most important. What can I try?
