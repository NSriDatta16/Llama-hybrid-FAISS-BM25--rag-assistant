The term "probabilistic approach" means that the inference and reasoning taught in your class will be rooted in the mature field of probability theory. That term is often (but not always) synonymous with "Bayesian" approaches, so if you have had any exposure to Bayesian inference you should have no problems picking up on the probabilistic approach. I don't have enough experience to say what other approaches to machine learning exist, but I can point you towards a couple of great refs for the probabilistic paradigm, one of which is a classic and the other will soon be, I think: Jaynes, E.T. (2003) Probability Theory: The Logic of Science . Cambridge University Press, New York. Murphy, K. (2012) Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective . MIT Press, Cambridge.
