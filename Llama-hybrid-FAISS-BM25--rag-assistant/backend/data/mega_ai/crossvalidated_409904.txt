I read the article diagonally, so maybe I understood it wrong. But, I think the reason for not adding 1/2, 1/3, is just for penalizing even more those delayed true positives. Because this Average Precision measures "how soon you get your True Positives", or in the words of creator of the post, "quantify the goodness of the sort based on the score function d( , )". So, if you get all your TPs at the beginning, everything is perfect, and your score is 1. But if the TPs do not arrive at the beginning, the score starts to decrease, and returns a number which assess precisely how "late" the TPs come. So, that said, it could be used in a cumulative way as you say: (1+1/2+1/3+2/4+3/5+4/5)... but it would penalize less the delayed TPs than using it as the author explains
