Is it worth to install the Compact Framework on storage card?

Since our application grows, we need more space on our Windows CE devices. We installed SD-Cards. Running our applications from the sd card is slow and there are some heavy issues with demand-paging if you run the apps from persistent paths. The only option we see is to install the Compact Framework on the SD cards to free some memory. Is it worth to install it there? Will we get performance problems?
