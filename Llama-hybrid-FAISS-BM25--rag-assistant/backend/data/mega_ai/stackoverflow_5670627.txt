This looks like JSONP . It is a retrieval technique to allow JavaScript code to call for and receive JSON data from an external domain. thejson is the callback function, which you will need to define in your JavaScript code (it is the absence of this function that is causing the error). Then, that JSON/JavaScript you are getting back needs to be inserted in script tag into the DOM. At that point the thejson function will be called with the JSON object as a parameter. jQuery can make JSONP easy to handle . You probably want something like this: function thejson(response) { var x= response["catalog.exists"]; $("#results").append(x); } $('.clicky').click(function(){ $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: 'http://myjsonfile.com', data: 'req=exists,json', dataType: 'jsonp', }); });
