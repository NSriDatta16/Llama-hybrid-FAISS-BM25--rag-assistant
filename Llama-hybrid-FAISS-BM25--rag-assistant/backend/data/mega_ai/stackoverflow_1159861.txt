Silverlight Runtime Error 1001

So I have a deployed Silverlight app that works fine on most client machines. However, I have 1 client machine (Windows Vista / IE8) that throws the following javascript error: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30618; OfficeLiveConnector.1.3; OfficeLivePatch.0.0) Timestamp: Tue, 21 Jul 2009 14:38:15 UTC Message: Sys.InvalidOperationException: Runtime error 1001 in control 'Xaml1', method : 1001 An error has occurred. Line: 453 Char: 17 Code: 0 URI: www.DOMAINNAME.com/ScriptResource.axd?d=DYlfEE5ljRCaoM7uReLHHn6ek5uYaOA1UhTw1oJkABzHek2FGpt_ylvF5NNjuH26VVA5njj6q3r4MlWsNnz7ag2&t=1f1ca10 This is working fine on other Vista / IE8 machines and I cannot reproduce on my dev machine. I am assuming this is a generic error message and the real details are not being displayed. Based on the following link there is probably a way to access what is really going on, but I have no idea how. https://silverlight.net/forums/p/99022/226122.aspx#226122
