I took your 24 values . One of the assumptions underlying using the ACF to identify a useful model is that there are no pulses or unusal values in the data. Visually one can "see" three different regimes 1-7 ; 8-19 ; 20-24 suggesting non-stationarity of 1 sort or another. Now using AUTOBOX , the tool of my choice a robust model is identified pointing to three exceptional values i.e. three values that were no predictable simply using the past of the series. This is Data Exploration applied to time series data. and and . The ACF of the residuals clearly suggests adequacy an the residual plot here . The Actual and Outlier-Adjusted Series plot is interesting as it points to the periods that were deemed "unusual" . Finally the Actual/Fit graph is here In summary the 24 values are driven NOT by the past but by some exogenous effect , like driver's patterns reflecting work schedules etc. ARIMA modelling without intervention detection is to be studiously avoided as one of the assumptions oF an ARIMA MODEL is that memory is sufficient. The good news is that assumption validation/checking is available by examining the residuals of a potentially deficient model based upon a bad assumption i.e. no pulses , no level shifts , no seasonal pulses and no time trends. Continued allegiance to bad software leaning on AIC or whatever to form a model suggests either ignorance of the pitfalls or inablilty to correctly employ statistical methods. Good analysis has effectively "seen" the three different regimes by detecting three anomalies 7,9 and 18 ... roughly 1-7 ; 8-19 ; 20-24 20 in terms of homogenous groupings. In ARIMA terms the presence of an AR structure means that a "pulse" is an indicator of a new level or a change in level. Your 24 values has three levels before the work day, during the work day and after the work day. Following is a 1 period simulation via boot-strapping (penalized by future possible pulse outliers) A plot of the forecasts for the next 24 values is here suggesting wide uncertainty even though 6 (necssary) parameters were used to separate signal from noise. Note convergence and lack of instability often a clue to a bad model. Any software yielding (1,1,1) is a good example of bad software. In summary "a model should be as simple as possible BUT not too simple" ..originally ascribed to Einstein but should be repeated daily by statisticans.
