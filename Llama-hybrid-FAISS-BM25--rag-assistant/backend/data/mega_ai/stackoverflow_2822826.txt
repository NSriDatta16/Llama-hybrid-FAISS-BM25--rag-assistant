The foreground task doesnt time out unles you starve it for 4 seconds. Surely one could increment a variable and update a textview in a 500mhz processor in microseconds. I think its inconceivable to have to spawn a task to increment a variable. Its not a cpu intensive task. I was hoping to see a small elegant and understandable solution. The only part of java that I'm understanding is that its just like c but no pointers... I aint getting a lot of the subtle nuances yet...
