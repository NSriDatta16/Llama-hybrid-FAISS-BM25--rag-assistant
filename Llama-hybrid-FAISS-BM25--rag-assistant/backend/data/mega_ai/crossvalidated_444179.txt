Detecting the dependency of a probability distribution

I have this joint probability distribution between the two binary values $A$ and $B$ $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline A& B& P(A,B)\\ \hline 0& 0 &.40\\ 0& 1 &.30\\ 1& 0 &.20\\ 1& 1 &.10\\ \hline \end{array} $$ It's clear that $P(A,B) \neq P(A)P(B)$ but if I wanted to draw a Bayesian belief network, how can I derive which variable is dependent on the other? i.e. which of these two would be the correct belief network
