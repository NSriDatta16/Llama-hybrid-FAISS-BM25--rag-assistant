Are there general parameters in which a traditional machine learning algorithm will outperform a Neural Network?

I know this is a loaded question given the infinite number of circumstances surrounding what kind of machine learning algorithm to implement. I was just wondering if there is a general framework that can hint at a situation in which "regular" machine learning algorithm will certainly outperform a neural net.
