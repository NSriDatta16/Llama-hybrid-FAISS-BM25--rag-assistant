It can be difficult (sometimes impossible) To convert an existing project to some new pattern/framework. It also depends on how you are implementing an MVC framework. You say that keeping track of files is hard. While you may end up with more files, they shouldn't be hard to keep track of if you have a good organization and naming system, i.e. keeping models, views, and controllers in 3 separate folders, or have some kind of naming convention that tells you what is what I also don't understand why you see the code as more 'unflexible'. Having code properly seperated into Models, Views, and Controllers is that it is more modular, and it can prevent code duplication. The most important thing about having this seperation of concerns is Maintenance . One of the biggest benefits of an MVC framework is that is easier to pick out what code is misbehaving and fix it. The seperation of concers = a seperation of problems & bugs.
