If you have access to the IIS logs, you can use a log analyzer to interpret the data. An example is the free AWStats analyzer: http://awstats.sourceforge.net/ An alternative (and one I recommend) is Google Analytics ( http://www.google.com/analytics ). This relies on you embedding a small chunk of Javascript in each page you want tracking, then Google does the grunt work for you, presenting the results in an attractive Flash-rich site. I'd suggest trying both and seeing which suits your needs. I'd definitely recommend against rolling your own system, as the above solutions are very mature and capable. Best of luck!
