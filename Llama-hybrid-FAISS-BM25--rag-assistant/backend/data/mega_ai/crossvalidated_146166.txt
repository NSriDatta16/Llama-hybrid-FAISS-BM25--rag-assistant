Counter intuitive result from logistic regression

I am looking at how well test scores can predict disease status (case/control). There are 6 tests total, A, B, C, D, E, F. And for tests A-E, a higher score is worse (i.e, a higher score is associated with increased risk of disease). For test F, a higher score is better (i.e., a lower score is associated with increased risk of disease). I constructed a logistic regression model and looked at the odds ratios. However, a few of them are counter-intuitive. For tests A and B, where higher scores are associated with higher disease risk, the odds ratios are For test F, where higher scores are associated with lower disease risk, the odds ratios are > 1, meaning that for a one unit increase in score, the odds of having the disease increases. Is there a possible explanation for why this is the case?
