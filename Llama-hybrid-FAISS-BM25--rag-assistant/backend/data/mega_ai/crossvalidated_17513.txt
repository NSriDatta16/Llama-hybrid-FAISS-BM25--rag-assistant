Roman gave you the best advice possible. In addition, I'll take a shot at it. But remember : Learning statistics is like learning any other thing : There. Are. No. Shortcuts. 1) know what you are talking about. It's no use to ask questions about concepts you don't know. So indeed, reading a book and -even better- following some courses to get a thorough understanding of the basics is a necessity. 2) Once you have a problem, check that it fulfills following requirements : it is defined (about a particular case) it can be described in at most two short paragraphs it is isolated (so no "I have this dataset whadoIdonow?") 3) If all the above is done, take it to somebody at your departement/faculty/whatever with a thorough background. Discussing problems face to face is always better, as it is more interactive. 4) If the problem persists, you can ask a question here following the guidelines in the FAQ . They will tell you all of the above as well by the way. In any case, if you fail to understand this, you will be reminded about fortune('brain surgery') I wish to perform brain surgery this afternoon at 4pm and don't know where to start. My background is the history of great statistician sports legends but I am willing to learn. I know there are courses and numerous books on brain surgery but I don't have the time for those. Please direct me to the appropriate HowTos, and be on standby for solving any problem I may encounter while in the operating room. Some of you might ask for specifics of the case, but that would require my following the posting guide and spending even more time than I am already taking to write this note. -- I. Ben Fooled (aka Frank Harrell) R-help (April 1, 2005) EDIT : some further explanation of my point You're a researcher and you have a dataset and want to find out which techniques there are to tackle this problem. That's what your question is about. But : 1) before you formulated an hypothesis and can formulate what you want to know, forget searching. I get people at my desk daily asking me "what would you do with this dataset?" and my first question is always "What do you want to find out?". In more than 90% of the cases, the asker fails to answer this question. Stop looking and start thinking. 2) If they answer the question, I often get an answer like "find a relationship.". "Between...?". "I don't know, what can you get out of it?" Wrong answer again. How many people ask a question like "I have this huge dataset with this and that counts and 400 other variables and I want to summarize this data." That's not a question, that's a lack of understanding the concepts of data mining. If you can specify that you want a score indicating the amount of ... and have a scientific reason to do so, then we're talking. 3) Check the amount of papers in statistical journals. You need somebody who's following this in order to know which methods are available to date. And I kid you not, I've been studying Generalized Additive Models (one small method) for two years before I understood all aspects of it. So you need experts. In one of my consultancies, the firm asked to deliver a 2-day course for applying my models to the new data. After I explained them about model building, model checking, spline bases, circular splines, penalty versus no penalty, confounding and a bit more, they understood that even a 2-day course by a trained statistician is not enough to do this correctly. 4) SE has some professionals around. They are willing to help you out with troubles when applying a method. Reason why I, as a professional, answer only few questions here, is because : I don't have time to waste on questions where it's obvious the OP has absolutely no idea of what he's doing. I don't have expertise in all available methods, and I tend to shut up about things I don't know enough. I hope this clarifies my answer, and also clarifies why the approach you're asking for will be impossible to find. There are no shortcuts.
