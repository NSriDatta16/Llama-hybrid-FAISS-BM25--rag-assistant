What methods can I use to validate my source/input data?

For example, a ticker's price coming from a stock exchange or earnings from a company's financial statements. How can I validate that it's trustworthy as an input into a model? In my career, I've just plugged into companies' data sources then leveraged the data but I spoke with someone today who challenged me on how can I trust self-reported data into a model. I'm new to this area, and I'm wondering if there is an approach people take with this problem(i.e. I'm thinking of std dev of mean? anomaly detection? etc but all these assume the time series is correct, to begin with). I clean the datasets I use for features, but what can do to inspire confidence around the labelled data? Any advice would be helpful!
