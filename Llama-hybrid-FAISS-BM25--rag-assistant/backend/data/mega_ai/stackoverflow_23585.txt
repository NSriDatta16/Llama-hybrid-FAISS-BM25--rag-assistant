According to the Pro*C/C++ Programmer's Guide (chapter 5 "Advanced Topics"), Pro*C silently ignores a number of preprocessor directives including #error and #pragma, but sadly not #warning. Since your warning directives are included in a header file, you might be able to use the ORA_PROC macro: #ifndef ORA_PROC #include #endif For some reason, Pro*C errors out if you try to hide a straight #warning that way, however.
