You can just drag and drop the files in the solution window, then use ReSharper to automatically add the references and fix any namespace issues. I've done it - it's not as 1-operation as the move type operation, but it's still very fast. FYI - ReSharper 5.0 Beta 2 now supports this, directly, by right clicking on a file in the solution window, and choosing Refactor > Move.
