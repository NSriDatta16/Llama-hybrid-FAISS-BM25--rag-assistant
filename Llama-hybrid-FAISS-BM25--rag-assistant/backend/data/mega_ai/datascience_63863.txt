Hypothesis Testing and Independent variables Importance

I am learning Data Science and I have a confusion in one topic. I would like to describe my approach. I have understood the problem statement. I have used snowflake schema to join tables that have the attributes required for the job. I have formulated the dataset. Now, I am facing a question that how would I know which independent variables are actually significant for the problem. I got a hint that hypothesis testing procedures are used for determining the variable importance. Can someone please tell me that why do we use p-value, z-test, ANOVA test if we can easily find the correlation through the correlation-matrix in python?
