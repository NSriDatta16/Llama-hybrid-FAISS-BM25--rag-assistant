.Net based Content Management System for marketing department

I need to set up a CMS for our marketing dept. Basically they need a system that they can sharing documents with multiple users editing documents with multiple users tracking changes tracking/keeping multiple versions storing and organizing files The types of documents are : Illustrator, Photoshop, Pdf, MS word and Excel. I am in the process of evaluating different CMS to use. Since we are a .Net shop so the first requirement is Windows based. I know we can use Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 or DotNetNuke. Could anyone give me some suggestion? Thanks a lot!
