For the sake of an example, I'm going to step into some quicksand and suggest you compare it with applications allocating memory (RAM). Why don't programmers ask for/allocate all the memory they need when the program starts up? Because often they don't know how much they'll need. This can lead to apps grabbing more and more memory as they run, and perhaps also releasing memory. And you have multiple apps running at the same time, and new apps starting, and old apps closing. And apps always want contiguous blocks of memory, they work poorly (if at all) if their memory is scattered all over the address space. Over time, this leads to fragmented memory, and all those garbage collection issues that people have been tearing their hair out over for decades. Jump back to databases. Do you want that to happen to your hard drives? (Remember, hard drive performance is very, very slow when compared with memory operations...)
