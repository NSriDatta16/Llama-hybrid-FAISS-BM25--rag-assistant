Problem provisioning iPhone with 3.0.1 after it worked before

After I installed iPhone OS 3.0.1 on my iPhone I followed the instructions on Apple's website (see this question ), created the symbolic links, and everything worked fine. That is, I could test my application on the iPhone. Now it stopped working. I verified that the symbolic link is still there. I also tried deleting and recreating it and I also tried naming it 3.0.1 (7A400) instead of just 3.0.1. None of this worked, my iPhone is still showing up as "Could not support development" in the Xcode organizer. Here are the contents of /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Device Support on my computer: Macintosh:~ thm$ ls -la /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/ total 40 drwxrwxr-x 12 root admin 408 13 Aug 22:42 . drwxrwxr-x 7 root admin 238 22 Jun 20:43 .. lrwxr-xr-x 1 root admin 11 21 Jun 20:17 2.0 (5A345) -> 2.0 (5A347) drwxrwxr-x 5 root admin 170 21 Jun 20:17 2.0 (5A347) lrwxr-xr-x 1 root admin 11 21 Jun 20:17 2.0.1 (5B108) -> 2.0 (5A347) lrwxr-xr-x 1 root admin 11 21 Jun 20:17 2.0.2 (5C1) -> 2.0 (5A347) drwxrwxr-x 5 root admin 170 21 Jun 20:17 2.1 lrwxr-xr-x 1 root admin 3 21 Jun 20:17 2.1.1 -> 2.1 drwxrwxr-x 5 root admin 170 21 Jun 20:17 2.2 drwxrwxr-x 5 root admin 170 21 Jun 20:17 2.2.1 drwxrwxr-x 5 root admin 170 21 Jun 20:17 3.0 (7A341) lrwxr-xr-x 1 root admin 12 13 Aug 22:42 3.0.1 -> 3.0 (7A341)/ I wonder if this is caused by my recent upgrade to Mac OS 10.5.8? I'm not sure whether I tested anything on the iPhone after the upgrade. Did anybody else have a similar problem? Any ideas what might be causing this? Any help is greatly appreciated.
