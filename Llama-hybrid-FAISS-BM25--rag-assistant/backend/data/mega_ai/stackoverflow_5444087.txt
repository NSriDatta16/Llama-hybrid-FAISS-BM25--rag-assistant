The size of the color table is determined by bV5ClrUsed . An ICC color profile is present in the file only if bV5CSType == PROFILE_EMBEDDED . The documentation here provides all that information. Then, 24-bit color means 8 red, 8 green, 8 blue, 0 alpha. You'd have to convert that to 32-bit RGBA in order to have any alpha channel at all. Finally, the alpha channel DOES affect the display of the image, so you can't use it freely for steganography. You really are better off using the least significant bits of all channels (and maybe not from all pixels).
