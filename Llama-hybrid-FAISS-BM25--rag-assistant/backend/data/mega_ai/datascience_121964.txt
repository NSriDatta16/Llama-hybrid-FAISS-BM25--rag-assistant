Causal Inference is a theoretical discipline, Econometricians apply the theory Econometricians apply causal inference methodology to economic questions, just as they apply other tools from statistics or mathematics. Tools from causal inference are also applied in fields such as Medicine, Epidemiology, Finance, or Machine Learning. Causal inference is more general than econometrics, so it makes sense to draw a distinction.
