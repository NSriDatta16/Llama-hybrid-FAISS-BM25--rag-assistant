Reliability is about continuity of correct service. The best approach to assess reliability of a software is by dynamic analysis, in other words: testing. In order to reduce your testing time you may want to apply input profiles different from operational one. Apply various input distributions, measure how much time your software runs without failure. Then find out how far your input distributions are from operational profile and draw your conclusion about how much time the software would have run with operational profile. This involves modeling techniques such as Markov chains or stochastic Petri nets. For further digging, useful keywords are: fault forecasting and statistical testing .
