Needs suggestions and help for my study

My research question is 'to what extent does patient-provider trust impact African American males' compliance to prostate cancer screening recommendation? This is an exploratory study. I have no hypothesis. My goal is to see if there is association between trust in health care providers and compliance to prostate cancer screening using logistic regression. The study is a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample of 67. I am using questionnaires a total of 19 to collect my data, one of them is a scale to assess trust while the other is to assess prostate cancer screening. I have problem with the screening questionnaire as it has multiple responses and i don't know how to code the responses into SPSS. This questionnaire is from national cancer institute' HINTS' STUDY so I cannot adjust the responses. Here is an example: Question: when did you have your most recent prostate specific antigen test? answer options: 1 = a year ago, 2 = more than 1 but not more than 2 years ago, 3 = more than 2 but not more than 5 years ago, 4 = over 5 years ago. As for the trust scale, here is an example: How often does your healthcare provider discuss options and choices with you before health care decisions are made? Participants must answer questions with these response options: 0 = none of the time, 1 = some of the time, 2 = occasionally, 3 = most of the time, 4 = all the time. this scale consists of 6 questions. My questions are: Is there a way to code these responses? How do I code these responses, especially the multiple response one into SPSS and how should I combine the scores of both questionnaires to run the analysis? Is the logistic regression appropriate to use?
