iPhone/iPad stretchy, resizable buttons - subclassing UIButton

I want to be able to make custom buttons which have an image background using a scale9 type background image meaning the width of the button can be dynamic. I have seen example on the web of people doing this on a per button basis but it seems to me that wouldn't it be better to create a new object which subclasses UIButton which you can then use in Interface Designer as the class for any custom button (round rect button set to custom). Here is what I have so far. #import @interface LargeButton : UIButton { } @end #import "LargeButton.h" @implementation LargeButton - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) { self.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 170.0, 48.0); // Center the text vertically and horizontally self.contentVerticalAlignment = UIControlContentVerticalAlignmentCenter; self.contentHorizontalAlignment = UIControlContentHorizontalAlignmentCenter; UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"btnBigPurple.png"]; // Make a stretchable image from the original image UIImage *stretchImage = [image stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:15.0 topCapHeight:0.0]; // Set the background to the stretchable image [self setBackgroundImage:image forState:UIControlStateNormal]; // Make the background color clear //self.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]; } return self; } @end This doesn't however seems to work. When I run this im simulator I see the button text but the button has no background. I have placed a breakpoint and I know its running and check the console and have no errors. Can someone help? fix this or is my way of thinking wrong? Thanks
