JQuery ajax for pdf loading in object tag

I'm embedding a PDF in a web page with the following html " /> " width="1024" height="600"> The PDF's can be a little slow to load so I'd like to hide the object and display a loading message / gif until it's fully loaded so the user isn't looking at a blank screen. can someone suggest a way to do this using jquery ajax
