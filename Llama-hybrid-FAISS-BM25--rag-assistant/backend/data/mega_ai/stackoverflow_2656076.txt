how to detect touch on UIView with UIimage ontop of it?

i want to use a UIview and a UIImage ontop of it with a text box and button i want the user to drag it when the UIview or anything in the view is touched, what would be the best way to implement this method? the UIView is on a single View Controller and using Interface Builder to make my UIviews and UIimages.
