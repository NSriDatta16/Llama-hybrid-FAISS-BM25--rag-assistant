I hope I am not misinterpreting your question, as my answer is going to change somewhat the wording of how you phrased your subject. I think what you are trying to do is build your regression model by adding one independent variable at a time. And, you do that by observing which prospective variable has the highest correlation with the residual of your first regression between Y and X1. So, the variable with the highest correlation with this first residual will be X2. So, now you have a model with two independent variables X1 & X2. And, you continue this exact process to select X3, X4, etc. This is a stepwise forward process. You can do the exact same thing with Logistic Regression for the simple reason that Logistic Regression is pretty much an OLS Regression where the dependent variable is the log of the odd (or logit). But, whether Y is a logit or not does not affect the stepwise forward process mentioned above. OLS minimizes the sum of the square errors to fit the actual data. Logit regression uses a maximum likelihood process that generates a fit that is not all that different than OLS. And, that too (the fitting mechanism) should not affect the stepwise forward process that allows you to build your multiple regression model, whether the latter is an OLS Regression or a Logit Regression.
