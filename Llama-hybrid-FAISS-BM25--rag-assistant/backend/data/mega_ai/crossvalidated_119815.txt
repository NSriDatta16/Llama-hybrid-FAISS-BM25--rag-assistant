Cosma Shalizi's textbook Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View has an excellent coverage of causation. (The textbook is still in draft form, and is available online as a pdf, so it has the added benefit of being free.) You should decide, though, whether you are interested in methods for (a) estimating the size of causal effects , or (b) learning the structure of causal networks (i.e. learning which variables influence which others). There are many references for (a), I think Pearl's Causality is the best. There are few introductory references for (b); I think Cosma's textbook is the best, but it is not comprehensive. CMU hosted some great introductory talks on causal structure learning in 2013. Richard Scheines presented a tutorial on causal inference using Tetrad , a long and gentle introduction to the basic concepts. Frederick Eberhardt presented All of Causal Discovery , a fast-paced overview of the state of the art. One or both of them may be helpful; Frederick's talk should give you plenty of ideas about where to go next.
