RNN exploding/vanishing gradient, hidden cell formulation

I was reading a RNN paper that discuss vanishing/exploding gradient: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/pascanu13.pdf and when they present Eq. 2, they assume that $$ x_t = W_{rec} \sigma(x_{t-1}) + W_{in} u_t + b $$ And $$ x_t = \sigma(W_{rec} x_{t-1} + W_{in} u_t + b) $$ Are two equivalent formulations. I tried to prove they were equivalent but wasn't able to. Someone has any hints regarding that? Thanks!
