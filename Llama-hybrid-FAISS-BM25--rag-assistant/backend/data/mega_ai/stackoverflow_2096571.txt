How is C++ std::vector implemented?

I have been using std::vector a lot, and recently I asked myself this question: "How is std::vector implemented?" I had two alternatives: 1) Linked list, and then making the API feel like random access (i.e. overloading operator[] ). 2) Using new , e.g. Foo* temp = new Foo[20] : I believe they do something like this, but then it raises one more question. Do they always allocate a maximum ( uint32_t ) storage to give random access? (This is inefficient in terms of memory.) Or is there something else that I should be aware of?
