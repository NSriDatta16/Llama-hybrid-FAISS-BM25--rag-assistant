Things have evolved, not necessarily changed. Now there is great emphasis in Boltzmann Machines (BMs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs ) that are stochastic, generative counterparts to Hopfield networks. It would also be important to mention Markov Random Fields (MRFs) in this list although it is a relatively more general concept. Boltzmann Machines have received a lot attention recently because they are an important building block for Deep Learning . So, to answer your question, are they pertinent? Yes, definitely. Are things the same than back in the 90s? No, absolutely not, things have evolved quite a bit.
