How to improve a Fraud Classification Model?

I built a classification model (Logistic Regression) in order to classify data in Fraud or Not Fraud. This data is related with online CNP (Card Not Present) transactions and after choosing some parameters that seemed to be related with fraud, I tested the model. For this I used a training set of 225000 examples, and a test set of 75000. I conducted two different tests, in the first one I had 7 parameters and managed to obtain a 96% accuracy in classification. The problem is that the number of Fraud cases is much lower than the Not Fraud ones, and so regarding the Fraud cases I got an accuracy of only 11% while on the Not Fraud 90 and something %. In the second test I included more parameters, making a total of 15. Same training and test set size, and although the overall classification dropped to 92%, regarding the cases of Fraud I got an improvement to 30%, and Not Fraud still around the 90s%. I would like to maintain the overall classification accuracy around 90%, and improve the accuracy on Fraud cases to something like 65~75%, but I can't find more parameters that seem to be relevant, to include in my model and I am stuck as other than that, no more ideas come to mind... Can someone please give me some hints or ideas on what to try next in order to try to achieve these goals? Also, I have another doubt. Because the values of the parameters that I am using, have a very wide range, I applied Feature Scaling and Mean Normalization over them. I have 300000 example samples (Training set - 225000 and Test set - 75000). My question is, for each of these sets should I calculate the respective Average of each column and the Max - Min, in order to convert the values to a smaller scale, or should I calculate the average and max-min, based on the whole sample (the 300000 examples)?
