You say "interact with an outside system" - what is the interface to this system, and how does a person use it? Is it over the web? If so, you're wasting your time thinking about GPU optimisations and the like since your performance bottleneck will be the network, even over a LAN. In such circumstances you may as well just run the agents sequentially. Even if you could effectively spawn 1000 agents simultaneously (perhaps across multiple machines), chances are high that you'll just cripple the target server in an accidental denial of service attack, so it's counterproductive. However if you have the ability to change that interface to allow direct interprocess communication, you could go back to considering the massive parallelism approach. But then 1000 is not a big number in computing terms. It's likely you'd spend more time making the algorithm run in parallel than you'd save by having it that way. As for 'artificial intelligence frameworks', I don't think there is anything quite so vague that would help you. AI and intelligent agents is a massive field - the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach which is a standard introductory text on intelligent agents is over 1000 pages long and contains maybe 20 or 30 totally independent techniques, many of which could apply to your problem, many of which won't. If you can specify more clearly what tasks the agent has to perform, and which inputs it has on which to make those decisions, picking a decent technique becomes possible. In fact, it may turn out that your problem doesn't require AI at all, if you have a clear mapping between agent demographics and decision making - you just look up the answer to use from the table you made earlier. So it's important to work out what problem you're actually trying to solve first.
