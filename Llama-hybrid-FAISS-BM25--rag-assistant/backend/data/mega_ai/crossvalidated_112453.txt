Integrating multiple tests Bayes factors

I have been using an Bayesian-centric R package for some genomics analysis to detect mutations in 3 individuals from the same family. I have to do each analysis for each individual separately due to how the package is written. All 3 individuals test positively when I apply the Bayesian test, and I get a Bayes factor of say 4, 7 and 9 for the three separate tests, which is in the realms of 'substantial' evidence as far as I can tell (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Interpretation ) My question is, as these 3 individuals all carry the mutation (which was also our prior hypothesis), can I integrate these independently tested Bayes factors to provide a sort of 'meta-analysis' Bayes factor, which would presumably be > 10 for the whole family?
