I think this sort of thing should probably be done in a graphics editor and output to a lightweight image (png or similar). I think this is the only simple and reliable way to control the visual output of the text to this extent. Make sure you repeat the text in the alt attribute on the img tag for accessibility. This approach has issues with localization - in that you need a version for each locale - but this is still doable. There are also going to be issues if you wanted to keep this text in-line with some other text - e.g. in the middle of a paragraph. But if that's what is being done, it sounds like "squished up text" may not really be a good UI.
