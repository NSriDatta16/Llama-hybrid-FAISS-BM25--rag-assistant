Another mainly solo developer here. I recommend using a bug/issue tracker. I use TRAC (although I'm looking at alternatives). It might seem strange, since you're the one creating, assigning, and closing all tickets, but it really helps to plan out/prioritize development. I also use the wiki to organize my thoughts on the roadmap, main goals of each release, etc.
