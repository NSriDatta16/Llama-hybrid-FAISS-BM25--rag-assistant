Can we report a Two-way ANOVA with count data? Of course you can , the bigger question is whether you should . In general, you should not - but instead you should do a similar analysis suitable for the particular kind of count data you might have. If No, Why? Because they don't satisfy the assumptions of anova. You have heteroskedasticity (variance is related to mean), skewness (counts can't be negative, and in small average counts the skewness will be substantial), and discreteness (again, with small average counts the impact can be substantial). our responses are number of patients "number of patients" doing what? Is this number of patients having some characteristic out of some total (like number out of the total exposed who responded to treatment or showing some symptom, say) or something else? You may need some binomial or Poisson GLM (or perhaps negative binomial or some other model would be more suitable), or it may be you can set it up as a chi-square test. That said, sometimes an ANOVA can work fairly well. If the counts are large enough that the above issues with skewness/closeness to 0 don't impact much, and you're mostly just interested in whether you can reject the null, the test should have close to the desired significance level under the null (heteroskedasiticity should only crop up under the alternative).
