How to reuse fieldlength in form, validation and ddl?

I'm working on an Spring application with lots of input forms. I'd like to reuse the field length in the UI-form, validation and JPA annotations. Is there an elegant way to solve this. My solution at the moment is, to use constants to declare the length: public class Person { public static final int FIRSTNAME_LENGTH = 25; @Column(length=FIRSTNAME_LENGTH) private String firstName; ... } and then reuse the constant in the Validator and the Jsp ... "/> ... which is pretty verbose. Is there any more elegant solution to this problem?
