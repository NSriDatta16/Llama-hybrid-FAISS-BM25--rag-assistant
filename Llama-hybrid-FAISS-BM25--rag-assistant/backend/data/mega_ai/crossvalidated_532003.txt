Unfortuantely, the interpretation of logistic regression coefficients is difficult. The change in probability will depend on the values of the other features, or, in other words, where on the logistic curve you start. You thus cannot tranform an odds ratio into absolute odds for logistic regression models. A workaround to interpret a logistic regression coefficient $\theta_i$ is to set all features to their average values and compute the increase in probability for changes in its associated variable $x_i$ , e.g. when it doubles.
