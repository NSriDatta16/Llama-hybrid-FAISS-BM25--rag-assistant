Double clicking in web apps is like drag and drop: everyone has already learned that you can't do that. Then, newer browsers arrived, and added this and more. So it's up to you: you either allow double clicking, and drag and drop, or you don't. But if you do, you must realize and take into account that 1. you will need to teach those non-standard things to the users with good clues on the interface (more work) and 2. there will always be a portion of your users who will never realize that they can do that, so they may be missing features.
