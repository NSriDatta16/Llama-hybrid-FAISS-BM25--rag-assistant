Logistic regression: anova chi-square test vs. significance of coefficients (anova() vs summary() in R)

I have a logistic GLM model with 8 variables. I ran a chi-square test in R anova(glm.model,test='Chisq') and 2 of the variables turn out to be predictive when ordered at the top of the test and not so much when ordered at the bottom. The summary(glm.model) suggests that their coefficients are insignificant (high p-value). In this case it seems that the variables are not significant. I wanted to ask which is a better test of variables significance - the coefficient significance in the model summary or the chi-square test from anova() . Also - when is either one better over the other? I guess it's a broad question but any pointers on what to consider will be appreciate.
