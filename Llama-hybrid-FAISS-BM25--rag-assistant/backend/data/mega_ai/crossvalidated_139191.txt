Dependent or Independent...a little intuition

I have a time series that describe the power consumption of a building. For every hour of the day I have a measurement (e.g Hour 0 = 2.3 kWh, Hour 1 = 4.2 kWh etc). Do you believe that the measurements for different hours are dependent or independent variables?
