What I'd do, is start with a pool of threads (say 10), and let each thread do an import. When done, it will take the next item from the queue. You leverage the existing ThreadPool class and queue all your import requests to that threadpool. You can control the max number of threads for this ThreadPool. Creating thousands of threads is a bad idea for several reasons, it used to be too much for the windows OS, and as you indicate yourself, you might flood the network (or perhaps the paypal service). For extreme scalability, you can do asynchronous IO that does not block a thread while a request is in progress, but that API has a steep learning curve, and is probably not needed for your scenario.
