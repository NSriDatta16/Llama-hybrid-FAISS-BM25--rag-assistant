Thanks to @learner, I am using the paper by Lin . The paper approximates the svm posterior using a sigmoid model. $$Pr(y=+1~|~x) \sim \frac{1}{1+exp[Af(x)+B]} $$ Parameters A and B are learnt from a labelled dataset. To avoid overfitting an out-of-sample model is used. Also, to avoid bias, instead of using the training dataset, an independent dataset is used for calibration. For details, refer my thesis .
