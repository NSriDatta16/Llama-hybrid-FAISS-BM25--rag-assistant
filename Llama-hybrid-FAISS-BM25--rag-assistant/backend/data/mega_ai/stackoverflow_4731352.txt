Have different initial_data fixtures for different stages (testing v. production)

I have an initial_data fixture that I want to load everytime except for production. I already have different settings file for production and non-production deployments. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this? Clarification : I do not want test fixtures. Basically, I just need the fixture to be loaded based on a setting change of some sort. I'll be digging into the Django code to see if I could figure out an elegant way to accomplish this.
