best content on how to deploy and share a VSTO solution

with the push to leverage visual studio and dotnet with office based solutions, especially excel, where is the best article or information on how having office sheet with additional binaries and assemblies is sharable. Do this external code get packaged with the spreadsheet what if people start emailing the spreadsheet around. Is there any overhead of this additional assemblies. Is there risk of the binaries getting detached from the spreadsheet It seems like microsoft has been pushing VSTO for over 5 years now but you read lots of mixed reviews and issues. Are we at the point where companies that do large VBA excel solutions can fully migrate over to dotnet without any real worries?
