I'd do it the other way around. Create a multi - module project: root / | \ mini extra everything mini contains the core stuff extra has a dependency to mini and defines the additional classes everything has a dependency to both and uses the maven-shade-plugin to create a combined jar from the two other projects (you can also do that from inside the extra project, but I'd call that less elegant) Reference: shade:shade mojo Selecting Contents for Uber JAR
