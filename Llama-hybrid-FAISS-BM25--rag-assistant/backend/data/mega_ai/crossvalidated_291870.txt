When it comes to the residual variance, a model selected via best subset will trivially better, because the best model is the one which minimizes the residual standard errors for a specific model size. Thus it is pretty clear that the authors are referring to the variability in which model is selected. This variance is not well defined in the paragraph. Intuitively, but subset selection considers a larger set of models and therefore is more variable to the step-wise procedure which only considers a single model of every size. On the other hand, step-wise selection might not have the correct model in its solution path which is where the bias would come from.
