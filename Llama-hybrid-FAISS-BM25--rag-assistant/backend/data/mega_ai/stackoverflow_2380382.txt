If your question is how to start researching this feature I'd start with: JQuery to get started with fancy yet easy javascript functionality JQuery UI : Draggable , Dialog , etc To actually develop the feature, if you don't know where to start, start small. Create a very basic web page with maybe just an icon and a button and then write some javascript to do something minor like display a dialog and show the result. Slowly start adding things like dragging something around, etc. The JQuery UI stuff has lots of demos that you can start out with as a base to start customizing. Warning: The first time I hit the JQuery UI Demos page I wasted at least a couple of days playing with all their cool stuff. It's so easy because the source is right there and you can also see it working in the browser on the demo page.
