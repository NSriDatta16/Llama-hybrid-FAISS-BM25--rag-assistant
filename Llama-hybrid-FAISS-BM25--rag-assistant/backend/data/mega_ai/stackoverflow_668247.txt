UITouch movement speed detection

I'm trying to detect the speed of touch movement and i'm not always getting the results I'd expect. (added: Speed spikes around too much) Can anyone spot if i'm doing something funky or suggest a better way of doing it ? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ self.previousTimestamp = event.timestamp; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; CGPoint prevLocation = [touch previousLocationInView:self.view]; CGFloat distanceFromPrevious = distanceBetweenPoints(location,prevLocation); NSTimeInterval timeSincePrevious = event.timestamp - self.previousTimestamp; CGFloat speed = distanceFromPrevious/timeSincePrevious; self.previousTimestamp = event.timestamp; NSLog(@"dist %f | time %f | speed %f",distanceFromPrevious, timeSincePrevious, speed); }
