We all have a good sense of what "model" might mean, although its technical definition will vary among disciplines. To compare this to DGP, I began by looking at the top five hits (counting two hits with the same author as one) in Googling "data generation process". A paper on how the US Air Force actually creates data in logistics support. Abstract of a paper published in Environment and Planning A concerning how "synthetic micropopulations" are created via computer "simulation models." A Web page on "synthetic data generation"; that is, simulation "to explore the effects of certain data characteristics on ... models." Abstract of a conference paper in data mining, asserting that "data in databases is the outcome of an underlying data generation process (dgp)." A book chapter that characterizes the data of interest as "arising from some transformation $W_t$ of an underlying [stochastic] process $V_t$ ... some or all [of which] may be unobserved..." These links exhibit three slightly different but closely related uses of the term "data generation process." The commonest is in a context of statistical simulation. The others refer to the actual means by which data are created in an ongoing situation (logistics) and to a probability model for an ongoing data creation procedure, intended not to be analyzed directly. In the last case the text is differentiating an unobservable stochastic process, which nevertheless is modeled mathematically, from the actual numbers that will be analyzed. These suggest two slightly different answers are tenable: In the context of simulation or creating "synthetic" data for analysis, the "data generation process" is a way to make data for subsequent study, usually by means of a computer's pseudo random number generator. The analysis will implicitly adopt some model that describes the mathematical properties of this DGP. In the context of statistical analysis, we may want to distinguish a real-world phenomenon (the DGP) from the observations that will be analyzed. We have models for both the phenomenon and the observations as well as a model for how the two are connected. In regression, then, the DGP would normally describe how a set of data $(\mathbf{X}, Y)_i$ = $(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \dots, X_{pi}, Y_{i})$, $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$ is assumed to be produced. E.g. , the $X_{ji}$ could be set by the experimenter or they could be observed in some way and then be presumed to cause or be related to the values of the $Y_i$. The model would describe the possible ways in which these data could be mathematically related; e.g. , we might say that each $Y_{i}$ is a random variable with expectation $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}$ and variance $\sigma^2$ for unknown parameters $\beta$ and $\sigma$.
