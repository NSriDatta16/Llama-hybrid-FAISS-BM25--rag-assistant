Let's start with the definition of a "Java package", as described in the Wikipedia article : A Java package is a mechanism for organizing Java classes into namespaces similar to the modules of Modula. Java packages can be stored in compressed files called JAR files, allowing classes to download faster as a group rather than one at a time. Programmers also typically use packages to organize classes belonging to the same category or providing similar functionality. So based on that, packages in Java are simply a mechanism used to organize classes and prevent class name collisions . You can name them anything you wish, but Sun has published some naming conventions that you should use when naming packages: Packages The prefix of a unique package name is always written in all-lowercase ASCII letters and should be one of the top-level domain names, currently com, edu, gov, mil, net, org, or one of the English two-letter codes identifying countries as specified in ISO Standard 3166, 1981. Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization's own internal naming conventions. Such conventions might specify that certain directory name components be division, department, project, machine, or login names. Examples: com.sun.eng com.apple.quicktime.v2 edu.cmu.cs.bovik.cheese
