HSQLDB 2.0 and later stores the BLOB (and CLOB) data is a separate file ending with .lobs. The theoretical capacity of this file is 2^31 units of 32KB (total 64TB). Internal tables store the directory information for the lobs. These tables are stored in memory by default and are therefore limited to a few hundereds of thousand individual lobs (100000 is a safe limit). If you plan to store millions of lobs, you can change the lob tables to CACHED tables in the latest versions. http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/deployment-chapt.html#dec_lob_mem_use Therefore it is practical to store several million lobs. With typical files and pictures, the lob access performance is related more to OS file access and caching than any other factors. Average access speeds of over 20MB per second are typical for multi-gigabyte lob databases.
