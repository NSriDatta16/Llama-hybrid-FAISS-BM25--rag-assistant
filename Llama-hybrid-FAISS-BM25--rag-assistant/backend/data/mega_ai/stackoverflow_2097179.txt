Section 23.2.4, Â¶1 of the standard requires that arithmetic on pointers into a vector work the same as with pointers into an array. The elements of a vector are stored contiguously, meaning that if v is a vector where T is some type other than bool, then it obeys the identity &v[n] == &v[0] + n for all 0 This guarantees that the storage is in an array. Of course, if you resize the array to be bigger, it might get moved in memory.
