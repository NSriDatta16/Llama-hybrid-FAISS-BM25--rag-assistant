I don't use a Mac so I don't know what is causing the problem. A JInternalFrame without the title bar loses its ability to be dragged. You should be able to accomplish the same goal by just adding a JPanel to the desktop. You would need to set the bounds of the panel. You might also want to use one of the internal frame custom borders on the panel: UIManager.getBorder("InternalFrame.paletteBorder"); UIManager.getBorder("InternalFrame.optionDialogBorder"); Or maybe another option is to use: internalFrame.putClientProperty("JInternalFrame.isPalette", Boolean.TRUE); This will replace the title bar with a small palette that can be used to drag the internal frame without the buttons or title.
