I disagree. Scrum is better in a situation where you can depend on the "players"; and, the requirements might very well be changing underneath you. A college type project generally has pretty good requirements AND the potential of flaky team members. Further, you have to think about the purpose of even doing the project in that setting. The students need to think, plan, and discuss how things are going to work before they start diving in. Finally, scrum works best in a close knit, fast paced environment with constant communication. Which is unlikely to happen on a school assignment. Scrum encourages a "let's just start" programming attitude which, again, is fine when you have experienced professionals working on it that through experience know the pitfalls to avoid up front.
