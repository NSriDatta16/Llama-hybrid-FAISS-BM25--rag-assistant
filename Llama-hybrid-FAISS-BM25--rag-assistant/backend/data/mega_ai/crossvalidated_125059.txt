How can one go about recognizing a kind of motion using 3D depth data?

I'm using a Kinect device, and I'm currently extracting Joints, and Depth data unto probably a buffer data of 15 frames. This is done at 30 frames per second. The whole point of it is to try and recognize an arm motion, like a punches. What I currently have in mind is have a multidimensional feature vector of 15 frames x {joints, depth data}, or possibly even calculate an optical flow for a sparse feature set using the iterative Lucas-Kanade method with pyramids to reduce it to 14 frames x{joints, depth data} Then maybe apply a PCA, but I'm not sure what kind of classifier to use, and if I use a neural network how to build one to train it Any advice?
