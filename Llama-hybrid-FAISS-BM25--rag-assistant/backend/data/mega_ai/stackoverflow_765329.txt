What is the best Rails caching option for largely static pages with a dynamic header

I have a set of largely static pages which I'd be happy to page cache for relatively long periods apart from the fact that their layout includes a much more dynamic header. The most promising idea so far seems to be using action caching without layout :- class SomethingController false end Then at least the main content of the page is cached. Does that make sense? Or would I be better off doing something else, e.g. fragment caching, server-side include, etc...?
