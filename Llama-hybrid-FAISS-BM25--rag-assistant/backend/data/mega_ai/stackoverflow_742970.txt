A strange Problem about gdi+ bitmap!

I am using the following code to get a Bitmap point, (width = 800, height = 600); Bitmap* m_BitmapCanvasCore = new Bitmap(width, height, PixelFormat32bppARGB); but the m_BitmapCanvasCore always is NULL... Is there any thing wrong about gdi+? Or any namespace polution I need to avoid? Why?
