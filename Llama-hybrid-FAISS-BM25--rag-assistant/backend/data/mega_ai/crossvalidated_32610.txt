I think it depends on the situation. If you don't expect any particular problems you can probably check these in any order. If you expect outliers and might have a reason to remove them after detecting them then check for outliers first. The other issues with the model could change after observations are removed. After that the order between multicollinaerity and heteroscedasticity doesn't matter. I agree with Chris that outliers should not be removed arbitrarily. You need to have a reason to think the observations are wrong. Of course if you observe multicollinearity or heteroscedasticity you may need to change your approach. The multicollinearity problem is observed in the covariance matrix but there are specific diagnostic tests for detecting multicollinearity and other problems like leverage points look at the Regression Diagnostics book by Belsley, Kuh and Welsch or one of Dennis Cook's regression books .
