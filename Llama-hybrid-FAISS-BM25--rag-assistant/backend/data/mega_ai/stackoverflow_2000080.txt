The book here is Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation by Hopcroft, Motwani and Ullman (Ullman is one of the dragon book guys). (I recommend finding an older edition in your library if you can; the older editions were shorter and I don't see much value in the additional material in the new editions). Another great book is Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser. You can not go wrong with one of those two.
