do you know the pilot to the tv series "num3ers" in which the FBI tries to locate the home base of a serial criminal who seems to choose his victims at random? the FBI's mathematical advisor and brother of the agent in charge solves the problem with a maximum likelihood approach. first, he assumes some "gugelhupf shaped" probability $p(x|\theta)$ that the crimes take place at locations $x$ if the criminal lives at location $\theta$ . (the gugelhupf assumption is that the criminal will neither commit a crime in his immediate neighbourhood nor travel extremely far to choose his next random victim.) this model describes the probabilities for different $x$ given a fixed $\theta$ . in other words, $p_{\theta}(x)=p(x|\theta)$ is a function of $x$ with a fixed parameter $\theta$ . of course, the FBI doesn't know the criminal's domicile, nor does it want to predict the next crime scene. (they hope to find the criminal first!) it's the other way round, the FBI already knows the crime scenes $x$ and wants to locate the criminal's domicile $\theta$ . so the FBI agent's brilliant brother has to try and find the most likely $\theta$ among all values possible, i.e. the $\theta$ which maximises $p(x|\theta)$ for the actually observed $x$ . therefore, he now considers $l_x(\theta)=p(x|\theta)$ as a function of $\theta$ with a fixed parameter $x$ . figuratively speaking, he shoves his gugelhupf around on the map until it optimally "fits" the known crime scenes $x$ . the FBI then goes knocking on the door in the center $\hat{\theta}$ of the gugelhupf. to stress this change of perspective, $l_x(\theta)$ is called the likelihood (function) of $\theta$ , whereas $p_{\theta}(x)$ was the probability (function) of $x$ . both are actually the same function $p(x|\theta)$ but seen from different perspectives and with $x$ and $\theta$ switching their roles as variable and parameter, respectively.
