What does the size of the Wilcoxon rank sum test 'W statistic' indicate?

I wish to see whether the average meal masses of two species are significantly different, and I have sample sizes of >800 for both. My Wilcoxon rank sum test returns a W = 330520 value - how should I interpret such a high value?
