Coincidence, we had some similar discussion a while ago. We came up these points that should be taken in concern before decision: How much time by average a step takes? -> If each step takes minimal amount of time then, in general it's better to have one thread doing all steps or context switch becomes an overhead Is each step highly domain specific? -> If so then it's better to keep them in separate threads. Though people may argue that just separating the execution code is enough, but I thing it's not always so. For e.g. a particular thread might need some special prioveleges or higher priority. Cost of context switches? -> No need to explain Threading model and resources -> For e.g. your system ran out of threads and a higher priority request has come. Will you leave low preiority taks to serve this request? There are some more points which I will add in comments as I remeber!!
