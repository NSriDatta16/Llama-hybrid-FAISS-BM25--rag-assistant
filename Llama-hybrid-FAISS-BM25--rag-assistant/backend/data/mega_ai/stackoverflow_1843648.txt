How to implement a cache with binary array as key and binary arrays as values in Java

I have a requirement to create a java cache which holds all the cities and airports. So, if i query the cache for a location, lets say a city, it should return all the airports in that city and if I query a location which is an airport, i should get back that airport. Also, each location has to be stored as a byte array in cache.(as the exposed interface for querying the cache has byte[] as the parameter for location) Other considerations are: The retrieval has to be very fast, as fast as possible The cache is loaded only once at system startup.It doesn't change after getting loaded. As its loaded only once, we can keep it sorted if that speeds up the retrieval. What I have got so far: Approach 1 Create a thin wrapper over byte[] array, lets say ByteWrapper. Put each location(both airports and cities) as a key in map(TreeMap?). Use lists of ByteWrapper(containing airports where ever applicable) as values. Approach 2 Create multi dimensional byte[] array which is sorted on location. Its essentially a map. Then use binary search to locate the key and return results. What approach would you suggest? Please let me know in case you have better ideas Thanks
