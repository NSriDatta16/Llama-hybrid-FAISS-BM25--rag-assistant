GET is only safe and idempotent with regards to the resource identified by the request - that is all the client needs to, and should, be concerned with. The easiest way to think about this is to consider any mechanism performing such counts as an intermediary (i.e. you are leveraging the layered constraint) which monitors the request/responses and updates some other view count resource, rather than the actual resource itself.
