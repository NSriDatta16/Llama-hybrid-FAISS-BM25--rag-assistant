Normalizing probabilities across different classification models

Let's say I have a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Model (multi-class) with different features selected for each model but from the same data source. I want to use the predict_proba() to get the predicted probabilities for each class. The initial thought is that the probabilities are not comparable and that I would need to normalize or regularize the values in order to make them comparable. I'm not sure if I can use a probability calibrator: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html Any thoughts on this? Is there another way to establish a confidence interval that is comparable across all models?
