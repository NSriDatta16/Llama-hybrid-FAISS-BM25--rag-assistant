How to add icons\thumbnails to wpf listbox

I want to have two list-boxes which contain icons\thumbnails and then drag and drop items between the two. Each list represent a folder and the drug and drop represents moving the file. I need some help on how to create the list of icons... it seems different from the winforms. I need help with drag and drop of the icons. (just nice to have...) Thanks
