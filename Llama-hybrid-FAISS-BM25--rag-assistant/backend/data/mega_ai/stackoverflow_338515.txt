"Is version control about deployment history or development history?" Both. Revisions/file versions for developers and branches/tags/labels for deployment. Much of it depends on the policies of your organization. As for local working copies and revisions - if you have a VCS that allows either private work areas/branches and then promotion or a distributed system it really doesn't matter if you check in bad code and you can use the VCS for private stuff all you want. For a centralized system you probably don't want to check in untested/uncompilable code... again, this is dependent on your organization.
