Mike, I hear you. But no matter where I look, everything looks correct. I've checked and rechecked that the ResponseTableId is an int and that Id is an int. They're defined as such in the designer and when I go look at the generated code, everything again appears to be in order. I've examined the associations. Here they are: [Table(Name="dbo.tblResponseCode")] public partial class ResponseCode : ... ... [Association(Name="CodebookVersion_tblResponseCode", Storage="_CodebookVersion", ThisKey="ResponseCodeTableId", OtherKey="Id", IsForeignKey=true)] public CodebookVersion CodebookVersion { ... } [Table(Name="dbo.tblResponseCodeTable")] public partial class CodebookVersion : ... ... [Association(Name="CodebookVersion_tblResponseCode", Storage="_ResponseCodes", ThisKey="Id", OtherKey="ResponseCodeTableId")] public EntitySet ResponseCodes { ... } And a screenshot of the association in case that will help: Any further thoughts?
