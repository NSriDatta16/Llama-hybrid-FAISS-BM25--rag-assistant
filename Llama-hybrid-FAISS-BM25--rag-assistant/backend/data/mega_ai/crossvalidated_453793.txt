Markov chain discrete-time queue example

I have the following Markov chain example: Items arrive for processing during intervals $(0, 1), (1, 2), \dots$ $A_n$ is the number of arrivals during $(n - 1, n), n = 1, 2, \dots$ Assume the $A_n$ are i.i.d. with pmf $a_j = P(A_n = j), j = 0, 1, \dots$ Let $$b_i = P(A_n \ge i) = \sum_{j \ge i} a_j .$$ Arriving items queue in order of arrival in a buffer with capacity $K \ge 1$ , with arbitrary ordering for simultaneous arrivals. Arrivals to a full buffer are lost. A single server dispatches one item at a time $n$ , if any are waiting. Let $X_n$ denote the buffer level at time $n$ , just before dispatch. $S = \{ 0, 1, \dots, K \}$ Checking the Markov property If $X_n = 0$ , there is no dispatch at $n$ , and the number in the buffer at time $n + 1$ is the number of arrivals during $(n, n + 1)$ that can fit into the buffer. i.e., $X_{n + 1} = \min(A_{n + 1}, K)$ I don't understand how it makes sense to have $X_{n + 1} = \min(A_{n + 1}, K)$ . I would greatly appreciate it if someone would please take the time to clarify this.
