I think the answer to your question is best answered by focusing on what it is, precisely, that you want to know. You're correct that the typist's average words-per-minute is only a meaningful inference on that particular typist. But measuring the typist's performance at many intervals will, hopefully, randomly mix in those other states and therefore average over them. The mean value can be seen as the weighted average of all of these different states. If you wanted, you could construct a model to incorporate other explanatory information which might improve or degrade the typist's abilities -- headaches, poor sleep, etc. But this is probably only necessary if you need to measure the importance or effect size of some circumstances on the typist. If you're interested in inferences across the universe of typists, you would clearly have to collect information on more than that one typist. Using a large random sample the typing pool, you could describe the rate of the typical typist, their dispersion, etc. Even though their rate is likely a complicated function of biological, physical and environmental factors, and therefore deterministic rather than stochastic, if we are not interested in those features, and we believe that our random sample is representative of these characteristics, our inferences will effectively "average over" these characteristics. Likewise, if some typists have hands tied behind their backs, then random sampling will capture this phenomenon and reflect it in whatever statistics you computed using that random sample. If our research is instead concerned with the covariates of typing, then it would be essential to collect information on the typists' condition -- maybe their headache status, whether they have arthritis, their age, etc. I hope that this provides the context to understand the logic underlying statistics and addressed the questions you've raised. Let me know if you would like further elaboration, and welcome to Cross Validated.
