Why do you want to do this? I believe runtime.LockOSThread() is necessary if you are creating a library binding from C code which uses thread-local storage. Otherwise, just let the scheduler multiplex the goroutines for you. And note that runtime.LockOSThread() only prevents other goroutines from running in that thread until you call runtime.UnlockOSThread() .
