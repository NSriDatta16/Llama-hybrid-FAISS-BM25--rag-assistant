Principal component analysis and statistical significance

I've been drawn into a discussion at work on interpretation of principal component analyses. My "adversary" claims that the PCA score plot shows "statistically significant" differences (separation) and/or similarities (clustering). From my understanding, statistical sigificance is something that can be inferred from statistical tests. PCA is not a statistical test and tells us nothing about statistical significance. It really only tells us how our samples/points may correlate to each other. Am I wrong?
