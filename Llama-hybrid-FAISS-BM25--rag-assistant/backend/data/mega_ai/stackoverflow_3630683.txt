VB.NET Drag Drop If Object Implements Interface

I have to be missing something simple, but my brain is about to bleed on this. I have an interface, for the sake of argument called MyInterface. I Have a Control Class, lets name it "Parent" that implements MyInterface. I have another Control Class that inherits Parent, called "Child" I have a final Control Class lets call it "Container", that accepts dragging the parent onto it. The code in Container for Dragover is simple, like this: Protected Overrides Sub OnDragOver(ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) If e.Data.GetDataPresent(GetType(Parent)) Then e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Move End If MyBase.OnDragOver(e) Refresh() End Sub I want to modify this not to only accept Parent, but to accept ANYthing that implements MyInterface. I can't figure out how the heck to get it to work. Even more confusing, if I drag the child onto Container, with the code as it is above(checking to see if a Parent was dropped), GetDataPresent always returns false. I would figure it would work, since Child inherited parent. Ideally, I would have something like this: Protected Overrides Sub OnDragOver(ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) If e.Data.GetDataPresent(GetType(MyInterface)) Then e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Move End If MyBase.OnDragOver(e) Refresh() End Sub But it bombs and GetDataPresent returns false whether I dragged a Parent or a Child. I'm being an idiot somewhere...but I cont know where. Help?
