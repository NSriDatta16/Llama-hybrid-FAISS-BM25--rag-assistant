phpdaemon (phpdaemon.net)

Im playing around with a script that should be used as an invocationscript for my service. It uses MongoDB for datastorage. Right now im using Apache as webserver, but im not satisfied with the perfomance. I have been looking at phpdaemon from http://phpdaemon.net , and wants to try that out. But i cant figure out how to make a simple example run. I have installed phpdaemon and are using the example config. I can run phpd and i tells that FastCGI is up. But from here im stuck. If i try to call the server from browser on port 9000 nothing happens. Could someone help me setup a simple example setup that will be working? BR/Sune
