It is hard to underestimate the contribution of Andrey Kolmogorov , for putting probability theory on a rigorous mathematical footing during the Soviet era. Also, Andrey Markov , for his contribution to stochastic processes and Markov chains in particular, though most of his work was in the pre-Soviet era. Possibly worth mentioning, though he was pre-Soviet Russia, Pafnuty Chebyshev for the Chebyshev inequality.
