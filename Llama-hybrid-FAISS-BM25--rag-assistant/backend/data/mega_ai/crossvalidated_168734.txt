Ranking of categorical variables in logistic regression

I am doing some research using logistic regression. 10 variables influence the dependent variable. One of the aforementioned is categorical (e.g., express delivery, standard delivery, etc.). Now I want to rank those categories based on the "strength" of their effect on the dependent variable. They are all significant (small p-value), but I think I can't just use the value of the odds for ranking purposes. I somehow need to figure out, if each category is also significantly different from the other categories. Is this correct? I read about the possibility of centering the variable. Is this really an option? I do not want the rest of my model to be affected. Stata output in order to support my comment to @subra's post: Average marginal effects Number of obs = 124773 Model VCE : OIM Expression : Pr(return), predict() dy/dx w.r.t. : ExpDel ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | dy/dx Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- ExpDel | .1054605 .0147972 7.36 0.000 .0798584 .1378626 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
