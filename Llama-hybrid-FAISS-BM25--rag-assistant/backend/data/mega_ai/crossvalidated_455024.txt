How you structure your data depends on the type of analysis you're doing and the software you're using. If you are running a standard logistic regression predicting a single outcome at one time point from several covariates, you should have one row per patient. That row should contain all the information about a patient. The first table would be used if you were taking different measurements at different times for each patient, and at each occasion, one of the covariates could be active. For example, in a sequential trial, you might give one treatment at time 1 and record the response to that treatment, then another treatment at time 2 and record the response to that treatment, etc. Then you would have one row per time point per patient. The key is that you are measuring the outcome multiple times; when you do this, you should have a row for each time the outcome is measured. You would fit a mixed effects logistic regression to this kind of data. You haven't indicated that your data are like this.
