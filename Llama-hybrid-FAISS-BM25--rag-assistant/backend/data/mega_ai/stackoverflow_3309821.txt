Multidimensional indexing of images

I would like to know if there is a good way for indexing multidimensional objects (i.e. images). More precisely, I have a large collection of images on which I calculate n-dimensional feature vectors. There is a distance metric (i.e. L2-norm) defined over those feature vectors d(u,v). Given a key (an n-dimensional) k , the index should allow fast retrieval of feature vectors that are "close" to k (that is, their distance is small). MATLAB code reference would be great...
