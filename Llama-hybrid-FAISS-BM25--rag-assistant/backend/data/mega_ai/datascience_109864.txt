From the data I suppose this is a timeseries problem and assuming you have continuous data, "since its a radar" Generally the most used "best" approach is using stacked Long-Short Term Memory "LSTM" or some of its variants like GRU etc.. if you want to predict some specific cell in the future "e.g. row-column".. This might help get you started: https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/ If you are trying to predict the whole row, I would suggest using LSTM/variants AutoEncoders that would "supposedly" give you a better result in that case Thats also an introduction to that approach: https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-understanding-lstm-autoencoder-layers-ffab055b6352 If your data is not continuous, I would suggest to use Convolutional Neural Networks "CNN" -AutoEncoders- to extract the features then feeding that to some fully connected layers to either outputs some categorization "e.g. distance from 1-5 or 5-10" or even the actual distance, but an important remark, this approach needs a lot of data points. it can be something like this: https://keras.io/examples/audio/ There are some research papers suggesting to convert your data points into 2D using fft or continuous wavelets then feeding that to a CNN to extract features from, but I haven't got any good results from that in different sets of problems. P.S. Scaling the data beforehand "e.g. between the range of [0,1]" is essential in this case because apparently you have different units for each column.
