The only real limitation is that view state explodes the page size (up to many megabytes if not paid attention to). The more stuff you put into view state, the more convenient you do it for yourself, the less convenient it becomes for the users, especially those with dial-up connection. There may be some networking issues if network components are configured to restrict submission size. I've heard something about proxy servers imposing limits on hidden fields (where the view state is stored).
