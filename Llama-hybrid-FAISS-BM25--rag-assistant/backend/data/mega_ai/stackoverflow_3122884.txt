I always recommend .NET Domain-Driven Design with C#: Problem-Design-Solution sample code - SmartCA project. It is extremely elegantly laid out and I find myself going back to it whenever I have doubts about my architecture. You should also download and check out ASP .NET MVC source code . It's got good examples of unit testing and mocking (which is something you will find yourself wanting to use).
