You can rewrite the query in various ways to see if it speeds things up: SELECT a.articleId, a.pubDate FROM Articles a WHERE a.articleId in ( select articleId from ArticleTopics where topicId = 3364 ) ORDER BY a.pubDate DESC LIMIT 30; Or: SELECT a.articleId, a.pubDate FROM Articles a INNER JOIN ArticleTopics t ON t.articleId = a.articleId WHERE t.topicId = 3364 ORDER BY a.pubDate DESC LIMIT 30; The important index for both queries is on Articles, and contains articleId as first field. If article is a large table, with say the entire PDF in binary, you can create an index that fully covers the query. Full coverage means all selected fields are part of the index. For this query, a fully covering index would be (articleId, pubDate).
