Calculate the probability of a variable on a Bayesian Network

Let's assume we have a bayesian nework with discrete variables like shown below. For simplicity, assume all variables are binary. Assume we know the states for V1 and V2 and we want to calculate the probabilities for V3 being in either of its states. Is it sufficient to just observe the values in V3's CPT, given that we know the state of its parents or do we have to calculate the joint probabilities over all network variables?
