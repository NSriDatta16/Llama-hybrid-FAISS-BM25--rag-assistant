Whether covariates that are balanced at baseline should be put into propensity score matching

I am performing a logistic regression under propensity score matching. Before matching, the baseline characteristics of intervention group A and intervention group B are statistically described, where the covariates with clinical significance are “age, gender, whether or not have diabete, whether or not have hypertension, etc.” We found that the covariates "age" and "diabete" are balanced before matching (p>0.05 and SMD >0.1). But I am sure both they are clinically significant confounders to outcome with references evidence. So I am not sure whether I should put in such covariates that are balanced at baseline when calculating the propensity score? Or should covariates be taken into account in the PSM regardless of whether they are balanced (without satistical difference) at baseline or not? Confusingly, if these variables that are balanced at baseline are not put into PSM, there is a very high probability that they will not be balanced any more after matching (p 0.1).
