This my answer after I tried to figure it out this for about a day. In DayRender Event you have to paste this code or create a Sub() and call it from there Private AdditionaleText Sub(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.DayRenderEventArgs) dim text as string = "MyText" e.Cell.Text = " "" 'Here you also can customize the style of the Text e.Cell.Text += text & " " & e.Day.DayNumberText e.Cell.Attributes.Add("OnClick",e.SelectUrl); End Sub You could use only the last sentence but is not going to show you the text as a Clickable on, but it works The hole code it looks much better the e.SelectUrl give you the same ref you could retrieve invoking "javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ctl00$MainContent$ContentPlaceHolder1$CalendarSailingDay$Calendar','" & ID & " style=""color:#663399"" > ....that is acctually very confusing. GOOD LUCK!!!
