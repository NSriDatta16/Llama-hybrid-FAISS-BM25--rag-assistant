MVC controller jobs?

My MVC controller is in charge of passing desired onload javascript to my view object which inserts it into the bottom of my main page template. My question is...should I store the actual onload js scripting in my controller, or should i store it in my model, and have the controller pull it from there? My confusion is rooted in the fact that its not really business logic... Option 1: /* --- js store in my controller --- */ $page->add_js_onload('various jquery scripting'); Option 2: /* --- js fetched from my model --- */ $page->add_js_onload($this->model->fetch_onload_js()); Which is cleaner and more scalable (or just more elegant)?
