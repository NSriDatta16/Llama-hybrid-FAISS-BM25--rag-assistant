EJB 3 is completely different to EJB 2 - they really have very little in common, and so using an EJB 2.0 tutorial to learn modern EJB isn't going to be of any help. Also, EJB 2 was just terrible, it's best to try and forget it ever existed. I suggest you start with the official JavaEE 5 tutorial instead.
