It seems that an ordinal model makes more conceptual sense. A cumulative logit is a standard as is an ordinal logit model (there are slight differences in approaches). In Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies , section 4.4 p. 73, the author presents a few considerations for sample size. He says that the number of variables in the model should take into consideration a limiting factor. $p$ , the number of variables in the model should be less than $m/20$ where $m$ is the limiting factor. Just for clarification, in the case of a continuous variable, $m$ is the total sample size, so with 100 in the sample, a model should have at most 5 parameters estimated. Remember that a categorical variable with 7 categories entails 7-1 parameters estimated. For the case of an ordinal outcome, the sample limiting factor $m$ is given by: $$ n - \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i^3 $$ where there are $k$ categories in your outcome and $n_i$ is the sample size of category $i=1,...,k$ . Here you have a good tutorial for ordinal response modeling in a Bayesian setting.
