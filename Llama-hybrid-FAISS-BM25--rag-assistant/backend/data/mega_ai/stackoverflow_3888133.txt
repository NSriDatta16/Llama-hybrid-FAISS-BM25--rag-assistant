Serving Java Applets from a Queue?

I'm looking for a elegant way to create a queue for serving up batch compiled applets. I have hacked together a SQL and PHP script to handle this but it chokes under mild loads. is there an existing system that can handle taking a list in SQL and serve the applets in descending order each time it is requested. I'm also trying to handle this all server side as well. The trick would be getting file001, then file002 ++ ect. to get served each time a web page is loaded. I'm batch creating applets that has a slightly modified background and I'm trying to serve a never been used applet waiting in the queue to load each time the a page is requested. Is there a applet server I can tweak or does look like something that needs to be built?
