Here is an implementation for a system I proposed in an earlier question : MAGIC = []; 29.downto(0) {|i| MAGIC It's just a cheap hash function, but it makes it difficult for an average user to determine how many orders have been processed, or a number for another order. It won't run out of space until you've done 2 30 orders, which you won't hit any time soon. Here are the results of convert(x) for 1 through 10: 1: 302841629 2: 571277085 3: 34406173 4: 973930269 5: 437059357 6: 705494813 7: 168623901 8: 906821405 9: 369950493 10: 638385949
