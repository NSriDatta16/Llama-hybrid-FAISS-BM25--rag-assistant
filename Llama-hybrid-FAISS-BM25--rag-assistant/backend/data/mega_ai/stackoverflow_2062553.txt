Java object creation and memory size

I am trying understand about the size that a Java object will be allocated with when created using a new operator. Consider that i am creating a class public class NewClass { NewClass() { } } when i create an instance of NewClass using NewClass nc = new NewClass(); . what is the size of the NewClass that gets created in the heap? ~ Jegan
