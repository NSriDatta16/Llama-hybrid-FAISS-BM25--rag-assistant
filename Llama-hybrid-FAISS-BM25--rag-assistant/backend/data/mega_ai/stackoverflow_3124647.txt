I see you make several mistakes that are typical for beginners: Don't use the standard classes for generic documents ( article , report , book ), they are too inflexible. Use the KOMA-Script classes ( scrartcl , scrreprt , scrbook ) or the memoir class instead. Don't change the default settings until you have read books or articles about typography. In particular, the default page margins are OK, there is no need to change them. Margins of 2 cm would be way too narrow. When it comes to fonts, the answer depends on which engine you use: pdfTeX-based documents require specially-crafted packages, whereas modern engines (XeTeX and LuaTeX) can access system fonts. Like before, don't switch fonts light-heartedly. Only very few fonts of high quality are available to normal users. In particular, never use Arial or Times New Roman. On Mac OS X, you could use Hoefler Text, on Windows Cambria, for example. Don't include formatting commands in token lists that are intended for plain strings like \title or \abstractname ; use the formatting commands that your document class provides. \paragraph is a sectioning commands that creates a heading; use blank lines to separate simple text paragraphs. Load the inputenc package (only necessary in the case of pdfTeX) so that you can enter non-ASCII characters directly. The \documentclass command must come first. Don't use the geometry package unless you have very specific and unavoidable requirements. Avoid the parskip package; modern document classes already include its functionality; and normally, paragraphs should be marked by indents, not by vertical space, so no changes to the default are required. Never use the fullpage package, it's completely outdated. Like the others said, start by reading some introductory material about LaTeX like the Short Introduction . Read the document Obsolete packages and commands .
