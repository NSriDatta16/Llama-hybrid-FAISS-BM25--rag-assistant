I interpret it to mean that Bayesian inference doesn't require the same assumptions of normality that classical frequentists tests do, ie, the t-test. For the t-test, it is a requirement that the population be normally distributed. This can also be thought of that the means of your data must be normally distributed. (I think it is a misconception that the data themselves must be normally distributed, so long as the departure isn't too strong. See here ) From the linked paper: First, data do not need to be normally distributed in order to apply the t test. Only the means need to be, and that property is assured by the Central Limit Theorem, even for relatively small samples, for all but the most perverse data. This is exemplified in Fig. 1, which shows at the upper left a very nonnormal (in fact, a uniform) distribution of original data. Random samples of size N = 2, 4, and 8 demonstrate that the distribution of averages based on even those small sample sizes rapidly approaches normality. In Bayesian inference, you aren't running some out-of-the box test. Well, you can in programs like JASP or some R packages where people have constructed them, but by and large, Bayesian inference in modern practice is centered around model building. If your data are distributed funny, use a distribution to describe the data that fits better. For instance, in brms you can use a skew normal distribution or t-distribution when your data are skewed or have outliers as part of your prior distribution. The prior provides information. While one can certainly proceed with flat priors or other uninformative priors, the results asymptotically resemble the frequentist results. Ie, the credible interval will be like the confidence interval. In this case you can lose a lot of benefits the Bayesian approach allows and arguably frequentist concerns more relevant. Priors allow you to model the data and make your assumptions completely explicit. If you have information about the data from other studies, model it! It can help provide context to your collected data and allow you to make inferences in the context of existing knowledge. Also check out this pdf which has slides about frequentist properties of Bayesian inference. One is what they call the Bayesian CLT, which is that with increasing sample size the posterior becomes more similar to the MLE & normally distributed. Frequentist Properties of Bayesian Methods
