Data & Object Factory has a sample application that they publish ( Patterns in Action ) to showcase design patterns in .NET. The application shows implemetation of the design patterns from the Gang of Four and .NET versions of the patterns from Head First Design Patterns . It's all done in C#, and shows UIs done in ASP.NET, WPF, and WinForms. I don't regret the subscription one bit (and it wasn't much at all). If you don't mind spending a few bucks for something that gives you lots of really useful, heavily documented, working code that models a real-world application (a shopping cart for an online store), it's worth it (at least, in my opinion). I heartily recommend them. Data & Object Factory
