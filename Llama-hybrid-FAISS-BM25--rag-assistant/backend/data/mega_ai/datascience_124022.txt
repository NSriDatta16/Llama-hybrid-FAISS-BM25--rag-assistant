Note: this answer assumes that the question is about a scenario were there is no output data available. The Transformer model is typically trained using supervised learning , that is you train the model to generate certain output when receiving certain input. If you don't have input and output data to train, then you can't use supervised learning, not only not for the Transformer, but not for any ML model. There are other ML paradigms that don't require output data. For instance, reinforcement learning , where you need a "reinforcement signal" that tells the model "how well" it's doing instead of requiring you to provide the expected output. You can review how reinforcement learning has been applied to Transformer models in the survey A Survey on Transformers in Reinforcement Learning . This way of training, however, usually leads to much worse results than supervised learning setups.
