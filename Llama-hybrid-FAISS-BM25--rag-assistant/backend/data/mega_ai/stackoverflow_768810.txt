Remapping Mouse Controls with Zedgraph?

I am using ZedGraph and I want to zoom to a selected area by holding down Ctrl and dragging the box with the left mouse button instead of clicking and dragging with the middle mouse button. The default behavior is to zoom with just the left mouse button and to pan with the middle mouse button, but I have switched these two operations already. Does anyone have any idea how to make panning be called by clicking and dragging with the left button (without holding down Ctrl) and zooming be called by holding down Ctrl and then clicking and dragging with the left button?
