Is there any way to 'highlight' code?

I'm currently using Visual Studio 2010 (and also have a copy of Visual Studio 2005 which I'm also happy to use if the functionality is available in it but not '10) What I'm wondering is if there is any way to highlight pieces of code? For instance, I'm currently working on an assignment to take a piece of code, and change the stack implementation. It would be really useful if I could highlight the stack implementation specific pieces of code so that it's easy for me to just glance at the screen and know which pieces need my attention rather than having to visually wade through it. (I am using comments to highlight the stack implementation specific code - but they get a little lost amidst other comments - and this seems like a better idea.)
