SVM coordinate descent alpha

In the dual formulation of SVM without slack, the final objective function is as follows which can be optimized via coordinate ascent. My question is, Do I evaluate the the value of the objective function at $\alpha = 0, 1$ then pick the max ? Or do I compute the derivative wrt $\alpha$ and move towards the gradient ? If the answer is not (1), then why ? Dont alpha only take 0 or 1 for the dual formulation without slack ?
