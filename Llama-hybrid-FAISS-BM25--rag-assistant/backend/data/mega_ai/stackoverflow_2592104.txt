Hudson is great, it is also available as MSI setup . Users of older Delphi versions (pre MSBuild), can create build scripts with the popular Apache Ant and NAnt build script environments. Simple command line (batch script) builds are possible too of course. One of the highlights of this installer is that it comes with a JRE, to be fully self-contained. This is because Windows users don't normally know what to do with the *.war file, and they generally don't like going to the command prompt and running Java command manually. So it is easy to try without going through too many installers and command lines first. And after installation make sure to visit the plug in page in the administration app, there are many extensions available which are also useful for Delphi developers. A plugin overview is online here . Hudson tools for Delphi: there is also a Code Coverage tool for Delphi with Hudson support here . TeamCity is another very nice CI system. It is a commercial product, but offers a free license for up to 20 users and 20 build configurations on 3 build agents. Bamboo is a CI system for any language. It is available from Atlassian. Its price starts at $10 - this includes all features and unlimited users, but limited to 10 plans, running builds only on the server where it is installed. It can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances as remote agents. Automated Build Studio from SmartBear. With Automated Build Studio Server, it introduced CI some time before FinalBuilder.
