You should read this guide Basically, if you want support 1.5 devices you should build your project against SDK >= 1.6 with the minSdkVersion setted to 3: On this way you will be able to have differents drawable resources for differents screen size/density without breaking the compability with Android 1.5 which assumes all screens are "mdpi". obviously you can't use any api released after sdk version 3
