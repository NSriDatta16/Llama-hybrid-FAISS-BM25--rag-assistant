Parental Markov Condition

I asked this on math.stackexchange.com with no luck.. any thoughts? I'm currently reading a text on Bayesian networks and the text is giving some very crude interpretations of what appear to be some of the most important foundations of the subject. It states the following: Theorem 1.2.7 (Parental Markov Condition): A necessary and sufficient condition for a probability distribution P to be Markov relative a [directional acyclic graph] G is that every variable be independent of all it's nondescendants (in G), conditional on it's parents. I understand the premise of what is happening here. Given some point X in the graph, if you condition over all parent nodes, it should be independent of all non-descendants. I guess the confusion for me arrises around how this makes the process Markov relative. Maybe that is the weak part of my understanding. Could someone please provide a example of graph which fails this condition and hence fails being Markovian relative to this graph? I've done some study on Markov Chains and I feel like maybe their definitions differ in some way that's been lost on me. Thanks
