As you and Matt Parker both noted, there can be a big difference in the preparation of a survey script that is digested by your client and how you prepare the script for your programmers. In a professional setting, "client" friendly scripts generally win focus and the programmers are left to put the pieces together as they go along. However, there are some things you can do to make your programmer happy. The scripts we generally develop are Word based so my tips are related to Word, but should be fairly transferable to other platforms. A few tips or suggestions: Include "preamble" for your script that outlines what is conveyed in the document. This may include question text, question answers, branching logic, programmer notes, etc. How you differentiate that in the document is a style preference, but for example all of our notes to the programmer are in <> tags and reviewers are instructed to ignore them for their purposes. To the extent you can, try and list any intermediate variables or calculations that are needed for future questions. Refer to questions by some identifiable name and not something generic such as Q3, Q7, Q19. Not only does this prevent you from having to change a bunch of references downstream when you decide to move or add a question, but is just generally more meaningful to say something like "Branch over this question if purpose is vacation" then "Branch over this question if Q4.A is XX". Try and include the programmer in the questionnaire design phase. If this is a complicated survey, having the programmer on board as a sounding board for different techniques may open your eyes to something you would have otherwise overlooked. Finally, tell the programmer up front they have the liberty to change flow / etc as it makes sense in a programming context. As long as they are able to develop the final product as the client envisions it, any intermediate changes they make to what they program will come out in the wash.
