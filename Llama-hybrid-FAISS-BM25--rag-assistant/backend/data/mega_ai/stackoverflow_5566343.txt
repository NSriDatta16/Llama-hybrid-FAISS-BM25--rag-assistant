Objective-C is a superset of C. #pragma directives are part of the C standard, so they also exist in Objective-C also. There are only a handful of #pragma directives that are actually standardised, but, any conforming compiler is supposed to ignore #pragma directives that it doesn't understand. The problem though, is that “legally” the same #pragma directive can cause two conforming implementations to behave differently. In any case, if you are writing C code using Xcode, then you can use #pragma mark for organisation; just keep in mind that it may decrease portability.
