INT will be faster - here's why: SQL Server organizes its data and index into pages of 8K if you have an index page with INT key on it, you get roughly 2'000 INT entries if you have NVARCHAR(128) and you use on average 20 characters, that's 40 bytes per entry, or roughly 200 entries per page So for the same amount of index entries, the NVARCHAR(128) case would use ten times as many index pages. Loading and searching those index pages will incur significantly more I/O operations. So to make things short: if you can, always use INT .
