How to calculate a location prior in CT's based on atlas segmentation?

I'm working myself through the paper "Anatomical Priors in Convolutional Networks for Unsupervised Biomedical Segmentation" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03148 ) I lack to understand how the atlas based prior is calculated in 4.3, any hints for me? I've spent some time on research about this, but unfortunately couldn't find a satisfying answer for myself.. The decoder is a mirror of this design, but upsamples instead of downsampling and ends with a sigmoid activation. In addition, we use a final layer that implements a pixelwise spatially-varying voxel-wise (location) prior ploc(s), which is multiplied with dec(z) (in practice, we add the logarithms). As is common in the atlas-based segmentation literature, the prior ploc(s) was computed as the frequency of labels in the held out prior dataset, in affine-normalized coordinate system. This layer discourages any extreme decodings of z but does not capture shape properties, which is encoded in dec(z). Thanks!
