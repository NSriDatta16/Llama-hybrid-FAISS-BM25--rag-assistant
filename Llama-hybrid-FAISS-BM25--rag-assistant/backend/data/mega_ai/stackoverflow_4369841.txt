What I have found useful is to just use generic raw storage (where byte[] is passed), and pre-serializing things on client side. This is trivial to use (I use Jackson ): ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(); // to store: byte[] data = mapper.writeValueAsBytes(myMap); // and when retrieving back: Map data = mapper.readValue(data, Map.class); While Voldemort does support its "JSON-like" storage (it's not JSON but simple binary dictionaries, as far as I know), there isn't much benefit to using it in my opinion, since you can not query on it or request subsets of document.
