There's certainly no supported way using the NPAPI APIs, but depending on what OS you are targeting you could try using OS-level calls to simulate a keyboard event matching the browser's full-screen mode. That will of course be fragile since it depends on every browser you are targeting a) having a full screen mode, and b) never changing the shortcut. If your goal is to have your plugin content be full-screen, perhaps you should instead consider opening a full-screen window from your plugin, which is how other NPAPI plugins go full-screen.
