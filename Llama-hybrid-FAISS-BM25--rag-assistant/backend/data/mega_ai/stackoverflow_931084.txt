1) Any time I'm about to duplicate (or substantially duplicate) a piece of code: "oh, i could just cut/paste into this other controller . . . " 2) Any time I write code that is very obviously going to be reused in the future. 3) Code of substantial size that has a specific purpose, where that purpose is fairly distinct from the main purpose of the controller/model. This is somewhat related to (2), but sometimes code won't get reused but a module helps for organization.
