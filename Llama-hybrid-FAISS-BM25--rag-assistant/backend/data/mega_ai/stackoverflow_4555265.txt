How to turn ASP.NET pages into static pages as part of the build?

I have a few pages that are completely static. They only change at build time. But they are expensive to create. For the ones that are kind of expensive to create, I cache them for very long times using the ASP.NET output caching. But for one page, I really want it cached forever and ever or until the the next build. What is the most expedient way to make this happen? Is there a build in feature that achieves this or a third party tool? (yeah, for the moment I plan to do the "view source" and copy paste thing, which isn't a very elegant build step)
