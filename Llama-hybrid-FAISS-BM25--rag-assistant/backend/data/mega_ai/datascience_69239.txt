How to create a feature vector given final set of feature maps?

I've got a faster-rcnn (resnet-101 backbone) for object detection, and am extracting feature tensors for each detected object, which is a 7x7x2048 tensor (basically 2048 feature maps, each 7x7). For object tracking, I want to turn this into a Nx1 vector. What is the standard way to do this? I have a few ideas that all seem reasonable: Flatten each feature map, and then concatenate all these together (so each feature vector would be 49*2048 x 1 )? Do the same after doing some max pooling operation to decrease dimensionality. Take the mean or max of each feature map, and end up with a 2048x1 feature vector.
