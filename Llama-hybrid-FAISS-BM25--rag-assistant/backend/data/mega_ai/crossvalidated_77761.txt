AdaBoost is indeed susceptible to mislabeled data (aka noise). Friedman et al's paper "Additive logistic regression: a statistical view of boosting" offers an explanation. However, C5.0's boosting is somewhat different from AdaBoost, e.g. additive rather than multiplicative weight adjustment of misclassified cases, with the goal of improving performance in the presence of moderate noise. C5.0 was released under GPL in Jan 2011.
