The best way of preventing duplicate posts is having only signed in users vote. That way you can store their vote in some data storage (DB). If you want to allow for users to vote anonymously, use the browser session. The downside of this is that they can just close/reopen the browser and revote. I would not recommend using IP for restricting votes, since many users can be behind a proxy, so it will look like they have the same IP. If one of those users vote, the others could not vote anymore.
