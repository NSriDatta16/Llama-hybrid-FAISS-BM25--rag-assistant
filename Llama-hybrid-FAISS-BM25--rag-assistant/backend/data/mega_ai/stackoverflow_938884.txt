IEnumerator extends IDisposable , so you should have it in a using statement. foreach does this automatically. (The non-generic IEnumerator doesn't extend IDisposable but the C# compiler still generates code to call Dispose conditionally. This was one of the (few) changes between C# 1.0 and 1.2, where 1.2 is the version shipping with .NET 1.1, for some reason.) Here's an article explaining why this is important in the context of iterator blocks. As for what the method does: If the sequence is empty, return the fallback item If the sequence has exactly one item, return it If the sequence has more than one item, throw an exception PS: Nice to see MoreLinq is getting some attention :)
