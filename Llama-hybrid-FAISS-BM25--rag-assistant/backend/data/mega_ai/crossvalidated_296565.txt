I use four methods in case of excesses of zero: Double Hurdle (the first step is a logit or probit) Zero Inflated (for discrete distribution as your case would be a ZIB Zero Inflated Binomial) - you could add an EM algorithm to improve accuracy. Tweedie Distribution (with a case that in my opinion is not applicable to your problem) Bayesian -> MCMC
