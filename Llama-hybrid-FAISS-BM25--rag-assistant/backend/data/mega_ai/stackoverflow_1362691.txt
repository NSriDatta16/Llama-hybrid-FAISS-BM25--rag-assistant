Getting all the child records

I am using SQL Query and below are the tables. Organization OrgID Name RAOID SubGroupID 1 Org RAO1 2 NULL 2 Org RAO2 NULL 2 3 Org Sub Group1 3 NULL 4 Org RAO3 NULL 1 5 Org RAO4 1 NULL 6 Org Sub Group2 NULL 3 RAO RAOID RAOGID 1 1 2 1 Sub Group SubGroupID RAOID 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 I have three tables Organisation, RAO, SubGroup. I can have organisations either of type RAO or SubGroup. However if you see the subgroup table it is having multiple RAOID. I want all the subgroup organisation name under rao when any rao orgid is passed to query.
