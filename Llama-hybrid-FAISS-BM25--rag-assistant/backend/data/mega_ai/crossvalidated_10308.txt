How to remove trend with no look ahead bias?

I would like to explore the different ways one can detrend a time series without look ahead bias . I wanted to use the Hodrick Prescott filter, which seems like a quite good frequency filter, but it is based on an optimization method, and I understand that it may give strange and volatile results at the border. Wavelet smoothing on a rolling window would be another option, but again border effects can be huge (the data is copied by symmetry which is horrible for the precision of the technic at the edge). Any idea or comments? PS: The subject has already been discussed here, I know. But I would like to dig a bit more on a more precise question.
