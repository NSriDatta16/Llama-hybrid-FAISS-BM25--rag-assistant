R: calculate time elapsed between 2 numeric times, e.g 944 and 1733 is 469 minutes

I'm trying to write an elegant function in R to calculate the elapsed time between two timestamps, which are stored as integers with the format hmm or hhmm. I would like to return the elapsed time as an integer of minutes. Here's my solution so far, which can probably be greatly improved: #Treatment of varous length inputs: #1 digit = m #2 digits = mm #3 digits = hmm #4 digits = hhmm #5+ digits = failure elapsedtime 4) {S[i] 4) {E[i] I'm not too wedded to the need to deal with the 1 and 2 digit cases, but I need to be able to handle input with 3 or 4 digits. I'm running this on a lot of dates, and doing 3/4 digits quickly is much preferable to doing 1,2,3 or 4 digits slowly. /edit: Changed code to work properly on vectors of times
