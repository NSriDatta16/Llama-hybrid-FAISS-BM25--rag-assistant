If you build everything as extensions (modules, components, and plugins), they should include any database changes required. I would set it up so each developer is working off their own local database. If you need test data loaded, I would just create MySQL scripts that can be run after you install all the extensions. Since all of this can be checked into a repo, you should be good on everyone sharing code. Using PHP, you should be able to write up a quick script that will start with an empty server, install Joomla!, install all your extensions, and then dump in any test data. Having this will also be good for developers to get back to a "clean" state. I would encourage developers to reset back to the golden state before they start any new work. Another idea would be to use mysqldump to dump all of your tables. If a user makes a database change on their local machine, they also need to dump out the change and check it in.
