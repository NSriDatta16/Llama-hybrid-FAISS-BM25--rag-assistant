Confidence interval before or after target variable transformation?

I created a machine learning model where I normalized the target variable in the training set before fitting the model. I then used a package which produced a standard deviation of eqch prediction. If I calculate the bound for a confidence interval of a prediction then transform the result I get a different value than if I transform the sd and the point estimator then calculate the bound. Why does it matter when I perform the inverse transformation or am I totally incorrect and they should be the same?
