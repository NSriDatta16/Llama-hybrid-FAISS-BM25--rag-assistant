JQUERY-UI Draggables - Seralize is running before the Draggable is complete

I'm using the JQUERY-UI draggable plugin. As a setting, when the Draggable is done, using the STOP setting I run a function to serialize a list of LIs to get their order in terms of their IDs. For example, if I have an UL, with a list of LIs with the following IDs: 1,2,3,4,5 If I then move 5, between 2&3, the seralize is returning: 1,2,5,3,4,5 Which makes me think that the jQuery UI-Draggable STOP is running before the page is finished rendering, or the DOM isn't update? Any ideas on how I can fix this from happening. Is there something I can do in my Serialize function to say, wait till jQuery animations are all done, or stop all that are going on to ensure the DOM is accurate?
