Checking for seasonality in data set

I'm working on housing data set for a project for a undergraduate time series course. I'm trying to see if there is seasonality in the data. I used the following commands but do not know how to read the graphs to see if there is seasonality. spec.pgram(data) #non-parametric estimate of the spectrum spec.pgram(data, log="no") This is the data set I'm working with. http://www.quandl.com/FRED/HOUST-Housing-Starts-Total-New-Privately-Owned-Housing-Units-Started
