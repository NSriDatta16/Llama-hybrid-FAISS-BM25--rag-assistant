How to persist ViewState for reuse later?

Is it possible to save ViewState information, e.g. to session, so that when you navigate away from the page it is persisted somehow? Then when you return to that page you can reload the view state and the choices you've made are preserved. Background I have two pages, a report page, where you can pick data, do some filtering and sorting etc. and a chart-page, where the data you picked from the report page can be presented in different ways, with different choices for presentation. If the user has tested different presentations, simply using the back-button could mean quite a few clicks before the user's back at the report page. I'd like a direct link to the report page. Using QueryString to save control states is not an option. I can't customize the ViewState storage for the whole application.
