I recommend Redmine for issue tracking/project management, and Git for version control. Redmine supports most SCM:s like CVS, Subversion, Git, Darcs, Mercurial, and Bazaar. Redmine features: Multiple projects support Flexible role based access control Flexible issue tracking system Gantt chart and calendar News, documents & files management Feeds & email notifications Per project wiki Per project forums Time tracking Custom fields for issues, time-entries, projects and users SCM integration (SVN, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Darcs) Issue creation via email Multiple LDAP authentication support User self-registration support Multilanguage support Multiple databases support For extremely easy installation, Redmine can be installed using Bitnami , available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Bitnami will install all required dependencies for you and everything may be uninstalled just as easily. Edit: For Windows, Subversion + TortoiseSVN is probably your best bet for version control.
