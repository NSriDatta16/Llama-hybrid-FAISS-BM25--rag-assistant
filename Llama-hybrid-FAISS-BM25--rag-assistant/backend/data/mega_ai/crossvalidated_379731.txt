As it turns out, just training a ordinary object detection network with a bunch of data augmentation will get you some decent results. I took the "coca cola" logo from your post, and performed some random augmentations on it. Then I downloaded 10000 random images from flickr and randomly pasted the logo onto these images. I also added random red regions to the images so the network wouldn't learn that any red blob was a valid object. Some samples from my training data: I then trained an RCNN model on this dataset. Here are some test-set images I found on google images, and the model seems to do pretty ok. The results aren't perfect, but I slapped this together in about 2 hours. I expect with a bit more care spent with data generation and with training the model, you could get far better results. I think ideas from papers such as Learning to Model the Tail could be used to allow learning of new object categories with just one or a few examples, instead of needing to generate a bunch of data like I did, but I'm not aware of them doing any experiments with object detection.
