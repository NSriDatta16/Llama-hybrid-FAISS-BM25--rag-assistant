htaccess, Main Site Directory change

I use lunarpages for my hosting, and can have multiple websites added on. When I add a new website, it creates a directory in where my current site exists ie my site is jeffkilroy.com, if I make a domain for hello.com, it now also exists at jeffkilroy.com/hello This is fine except I would like to organize it a bit better so that the site directories don't mix with my jeffkilroy.com files If I put all my jeffkilroy.com site files in something called "main", Is it possible to put something in htaccess where: jeffkilroy.com/home really goes to jeffkilroy.com/main/home but still be able to easily access my stuff from the root (other sites): jeffkilroy.com/hello
