The only solution I can think of is to use regexes; something like this: $('subnav').getElements('a').filter(function (element, index) { return /work\.aspx\?subsection=24&project=1(?:$|&)/.test(element.href); }); That regex will match project=1 and then either a & or the end of the string. It uses MooTool's (or the native browser's) Array.filter to remove all non-matches. It isn't the most elegant solution, especially if you are using this dynamically, since then you'd have to write some code to create a new regex.
