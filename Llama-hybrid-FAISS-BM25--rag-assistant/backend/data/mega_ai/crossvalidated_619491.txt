Does the null distribution matter when choosing between goodness-of-fit tests?

There are multiple goodness of fit tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and Kuiper's. Which one shall one use? There are threads (e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 ) and a nice textbook chapter (García-Portugués "Notes for Nonparametric Statistics" section 6.1 ) discussing that and related questions. My takeaway is that none of these tests uniformly dominates any other one in terms of power over all possible alternatives. Therefore, we cannot eliminate any of them right away. Still, if we have an idea about what the alternative is likely to be, we can choose a test that has the highest power against it. Meanwhile, I am interested in a different aspect of comparing these tests and choosing between them. Does the null distribution of the random variable of interest $W$ (not of the test statistic) matter at all for the comparison? E.g. does it matter whether $\text{H}_0\colon \ W\sim\text{Uniform}[0,1]$ or $\text{H}_0\colon \ W\sim\text{Normal}(0,1)$ ? Concretely, I am interested in testing whether the probability integral transform (w.r.t. my model) of a given time series is Uniform[0,1]. (If not, that indicates my model is inadequate.) Should this knowledge influence my choice between the goodness-of-fit tests in any way?
