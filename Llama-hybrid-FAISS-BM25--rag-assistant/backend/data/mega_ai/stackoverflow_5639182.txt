Don't use the stack. If you compiler uses the stack for auto variables, you can either change the way your compiler deals with auto variables (unlikely) or use some other kind of variable. Usually, compilers put static storage variables in a different area than auto variables. You may want to try that. Or, try dynamic memory allocation.
