Python: divide an array into section

Update: I managed to fix the issue with the help of Jeremy's function that break my data set in to 50 chunks. I have posted the final answer. I have the following code the reason I want to break the array into chunks is that I am trying to use an api that only allows 50 requests at a time. Also I am java developer who is trying to move to python. What I want to do is break the array into 50 chunks and feed them to the api. I have a text file that has long list of Ids, I and based on the Id that i read in I am constructing the URL. import simplejson as json import sys import urllib import traceback, csv, string # "base" API URL URL_BASE = 'Some URL' # set user agent string urllib.version = "Data Collection Fix it" page_ids = [] def divide_list(list_, n): for i in range(0, len(list_), n): yield list_[i:i + n] def issue_query(): iFile = open('ReadFromThisFile.txt', "r") lines = iFile.readlines() #print len(lines) for line in lines: ids = string.split(line) ids = ids[0] page_ids.append(ids) url = URL_BASE indicies = range(len(page_ids)) File = open("WriteToThisFile.csv", "w") for indicies in divide_list(page_ids, 50): count = 0 fiftyIds =[] url = URL_BASE for id in indicies: str(id).strip url += str(id) + '|' print url fiftyIds.append(str(id)) count += 1 print count rv = urllib.urlopen(url) j = rv.read().decode("utf-8") #sys.stderr.write(j + "\n") data = json.loads(j) for id in fiftyIds: try: s = int(data["query"]["pages"][id]["revisions"][0]["size"]) sys.stderr.write("%d\t%d\n" % (int(id), s)) File.write("%d\t%d\n" % (int(id), s)) #print ("%d\t%d\n" % (int(id), s)) # do something interesting with id and s except Exception, e: traceback.print_exc() File.close() iFile.close() issue_query() I know many experience python developers might give me negative points for asking a simple question like this but I couldn't find any good examples on google or here. So sorry for any trouble if in case I have repeated a question. Thanks,
