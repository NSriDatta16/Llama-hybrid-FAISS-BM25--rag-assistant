I'm not sure of a tool that will do exactly what you're looking for, but I do have a couple of options. 1) I'm pretty sure SCOM can grab those errors and alert whoever needs to be alerted. I've had some problems with this in the past, though, so it may not be your best bet. 2) For basic Failure handling, you can write code to scrape the EventLog for any warning or error from BizTalk and pass that down the line (my current client does this- it's not super elegant, but it works well). 3) What I would encourage- if you don't want orchestrations- is to set up custom pipelines which simply implement your error handling/monitoring in addition to your normal operations. Then, for non-critical messages, you can still use the standard pipelines (reducing overhead/latency) and for critical messages you can use your "GuaranteedDeliveryPassThruPipeline" or your "GuaranteedDeliveryXMLTransmitPipeline" or whatever.
