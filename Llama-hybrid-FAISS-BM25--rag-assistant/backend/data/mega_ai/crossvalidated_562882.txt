You're missing a step: fitting some kind of predictive model. Once you transform your PCA feature space into the original features (which need not be unique unless you use all of the PCs), you have to have some way of interpreting that. For the MNIST digits to which you allude, that could be a convolutional neural network, through which you pass the $28\times 28$ picture you derive from your point in the PCA space. For other data, you might prefer another model. Ditto for UMAP.
