Drag a bezier curve to edit it

You will understand what I mean if you use graphic editing programs like Gimp or Photoshop. To edit a curve on those programs (which probably is Bezier Curve), we can click on the curve, drag the mouse and the curve is changed accordingly. I suspect all the things behind this mechanism are concerned with vectors, but I couldn't find any document mentioning how to do it. Could anybody tell me how I can do that? Thank you very much. [edit] What I meant was to select-the-curve itself to change (edit) it (click on the curve, and drag the curve to edit it). In the usual way, we select the control points to change the curve. I know to change the curve, I need to edit the control points, but how do I interpret a change on a curve into a change into a change to control points?
