Math needed for Sql Server

I've been working in Sql server jobs since 2 years now. Although I like it, sometimes I get the feeling that at certain times, I stall too much on some tasks, and I seem to be discouraged easily from things that involve relatively simple logic. It's like, at some point I must repeat a logical condition inside my head more than 2 or 3 times in order to understand it completely. I have the feeling that this might be of my lack of math knowledge. Can anyone please let me know what area of mathematics I can study, that would improve my Sql server coding skills? Thank you.
