$\beta_4$ seems to be the coefficient for the interaction between $X_1$ and $X_3$ , not between $X_1$ and $X_4$ as stated in the question. Anyway, putting that asside, when you have a small p-value it is telling you that the probability of observing these data, or data more extreme, IF the null hypothesis is true (that the true parameter estimate is actuall zero) is small. It is good that you are paying attention to the effect size. It is telling you that allthough the interaction is statistically significant, it is clinically/practically small. If it is so small to be meaningless in the context of your study, then the statistical significance is largely irrelevant.
