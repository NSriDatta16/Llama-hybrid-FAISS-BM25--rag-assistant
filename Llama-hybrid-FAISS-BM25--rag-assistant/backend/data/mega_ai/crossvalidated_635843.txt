very low hosmer and lemeshow goodness of fit in logistic regression

I am currently working on my masterthesis. Therefor i want to perform a logistic regression (with logit link funtction) to predict the degree of encoded registrations in gp practices (coded registrations/total registrations) with practice characteristics. I have 1800 enteries and thus a big data set. in the analysis of maximum likelihood estimates every parameter is significant and need to be retained. if i perform an Hosmer and lemeshow goodness-of fit test the chi-square = 5002 and the p-value proc logistic data = thesis11; class CD_PRACT_TPE (ref='WGC'); model AMNT_CDED_DIAG / AMNT_DIAG = MEAN_AGE_CREGVR MDISCIP PERC_FEMALE_CREGVR AMNT_PC_ALL AMNT_CREGVR_ALL CD_PRACT_TPE CD_ASST / link=logit selection=stepwise lackfit; output out = predict pred=prob; run;
