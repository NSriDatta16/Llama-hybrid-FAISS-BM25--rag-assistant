Paired t-test when each data point was repeatedly measured different number of times?

I have an existing data set that comes from the same group of people before and after they received a treatment. The data set comes from when participants tested their blood sugar values over a 30 day period before receiving an insulin pump and a 30 day period after receiving an insulin pump. This data was obtained from user logs (archival data) and was not controlled to ensure that they were tested at fixed intervals. Participants tested themselves when they needed to test throughout the day for a period of 30 days. My goal is to determine whether the average blood sugar across 30 days was different for the before vs after group. Normally this would be a paired samples t-test but unfortunately the before and after group have an unequal number of data points with the after group having significantly more. People are testing more often after receiving an insulin pump. What is the correct way to handle this? I can collapse the data to find a mean for each participant before treatment and after treatment (across all participants) so that the data matches up and then run a paired samples t-test on this data but I think this is not the ideal solution. Would a one way within subjects ANOVA be the appropriate test to run in this case?
