WinForms: How do I make a collapsible UI region on the form, like Visual Studio's toolbox?

I want to add a collapse/expand capability to a Windows Form. Is this built into the splitter control? Is there a tutorial for this UI technique? The immediate project I'm thinking of is a simple UI, Windows Forms. It has 3 panels, one oriented at the top, one in the middle and one at the bottom. I want to be able to collapse the middle panel completely, but yet keep it available for expansion. I saw the SO question, Looking for a Visual Studio toolbox style navigation for desktop applications ..and that's more about a toolbox with draggable components . I don't care about the draggable capability. What I want is a collapsible form region, the way the toolbox and other elements in VS are collapsible, the way the IE8 favorites panel is pinnable or collapsible.
