Draggable to drop once only on greedy droppable

I have two droppable divs that are very close to each other on the screen (note: they are not nested). A large draggable div is dragged on top of the two divs; when the mouse is released, the draggable happens to fall on both droppable divs (i.e. two droppable events are fired). What I would like to happen, is that in this scenario, the draggable will fall on only one droppable and nother other. Order does not matter at all. What is the best way in doing this? One inefficient way that came to my mind is keep track of all droppable event timestamps, and reject a droppable event if it has a timestamp that was already stored before in some array.
