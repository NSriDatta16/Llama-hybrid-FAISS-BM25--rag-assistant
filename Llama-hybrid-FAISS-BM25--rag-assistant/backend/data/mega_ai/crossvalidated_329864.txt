Machine learning in Time series analysis

I will like to do classifiaction with unsupervised learning where the input is a time series. Each sample consisting of 5000 datapoints. Most people doing time series analysis are interested in forecasting, but I am primarly interested in unsupervised classification (Later I will introduce labels to do supervised classification). Any good suggestions to how to do that. Does not look smart to feed these 5.000 values into a K-mean clustering
