Inference in Time Series: Prophet vs. ARIMA

I read through Prophet's white paper and they mention that their algorithm, "gives up some important inferential advantages of a generative model such as an ARIMA." (page 7) So now I'm curious, what advantages does an ARIMA have for inference? In my opinion, the parameters/posterior from Prophet's Pystan implementation are relatively clear - are there any bold assumptions that Prophet's algorithm is making that may bias inference that I should be aware of?
