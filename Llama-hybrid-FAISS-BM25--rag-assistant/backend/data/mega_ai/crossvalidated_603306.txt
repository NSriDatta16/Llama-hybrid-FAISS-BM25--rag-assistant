How to find the variance of an independent variable across the big number of linear regression equations?

Question I have a big number of linear regression equations with known dependent variables and coefficients, in a form of: T = Aa + Bb + Cc + Dd where T - known dependent variable; A , B , C , D - known coefficients; a , b , c , d - are random variables. Each of them is normally distributed across all equations. Their distribution characteristics (mean and variance) is different between each other, but the same across other equations. How to find the variance of each variable's distribution across all equations? Real world example T - total time spent on a task A , B , C , D - number of different steps in a task (e.g. "checked 2 emails", "answered 4 calls", "walked 0 kilometers") Data: T,A,B,C,D 8.01,0,1,2,0 7.94,4,2,0,0 12.06,0,4,0,1 8.08,1,2,1,0 8.03,6,1,0,0 12.09,0,1,2,1 7.94,4,2,0,0 8.06,0,4,0,0 15.91,1,2,1,2 8.03,6,1,0,0 8.01,0,1,2,0 7.94,4,2,0,0 11.97,0,4,0,1 8.08,1,2,1,0 8.03,6,1,0,0 8.01,0,1,2,0 7.94,4,2,0,0 20.01,0,4,0,3 8.01,1,2,1,0 8.03,6,1,0,0 12.07,0,1,2,1 7.94,4,2,0,0 8.06,0,4,0,0 8.08,1,2,1,0 8.03,4,2,0,0 We need to answer the question whether our definition of steps (calls/emails/kilometers/...) is good or not. It's good when it's stable and predictable (variance is low) across any task. "Kilometers" step is much better then "calls", because it's always takes 10-15 minutes per 1 kilometer, while calls can take from 1 second to 1 hour per 1 call easily. What I've tried I tried a LINEST spreadsheet function, and I was able to get an average time for each step. For the data above, it's about 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 for A , B , C , D respectively. But the average time for a step (e.g. 12.5min for "kilometers", and 30minutes for "calls") doesn't answer the question, if it's a "good" step or not. Somehow I need to understand how value is changing across different tasks.
