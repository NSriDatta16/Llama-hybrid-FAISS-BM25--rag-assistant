R - how can I use neural networks for a binary dependent variable in R?

I have a dataset from a bank with demographic data and one variable telling if the customer is a good customer or not (binary variable). I would like to do prediction on if the customer is good or not based on this demographic data. I managed to do it with a logistic regression, but would like now to compare the result (classification rate) with neural networks. I found 2 functions from different packages doing that: nnet() neuralnet() But those functions seem to be conceived for numerical dependent variables. Is there a possibility to use these functions for a categorical numerical variable (by estimating a posteriori probabilities for instance) or is there another function doing that?
