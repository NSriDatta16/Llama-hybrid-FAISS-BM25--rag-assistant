There are no special facilities for working with non-Cocoa Python projects with Xcode. Therefore, you probably just want to create a project with the "Empty Project" template (under "Other") and just drag in your source code. For convenience, you may want to set up an executable in the project. You can do this by ctrl/right-clicking in the project source list and choosing "Add" > "New Custom Executable...". You can also add a target, although I'm not sure what this would buy you.
