There are two categories of programming languages (which WinBUGS definitely is): procedural (or imperative) languages - they specify how the thing should be done - they specify the algorithm, the sequence of steps declarative languages - they specify what should be done - they just declare the principle The WinBUGS model code is a declarative language and your "problem" is that you are looking at it as if it was a procedural language. The genial thing on WinBUGS is that you just write formulas as if you were writing it in a paper :-). You just specify the model, you specify what , and you don't solve how the thing is computed (this is some MCMC magic you don't need to understand). So don't bother about calculating likelihoods - you just specify the facts about variables! This will make your head a lot lighter :-) So particular answers to your questions: the order of commands does not matter (but the indices do - it is different to write m from m[i] ) there is no difference in syntax because the principle is in fact the same! The variable m[i] or pop.mean is having the particular distribution of given parameters and it doesn't matter if they are derived from another distribution (like in hierarchical models) or they are fixed constants. This is the beauty of the language - don't be scare of it, enjoy it :-)
