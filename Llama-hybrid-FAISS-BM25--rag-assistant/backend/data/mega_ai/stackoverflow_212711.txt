To fear the C preprocessor is like to fear the incandescent bulbs just because we get fluorescent bulbs. Yes, the former can be {electricity | programmer time} inefficient. Yes, you can get (literally) burned by them. But they can get the job done if you properly handle it. When you program embedded systems, C uses to be the only option apart form assembler. After programming on desktop with C++ and then switching to smaller, embedded targets, you learn to stop worrying about “inelegancies” of so many bare C features (macros included) and just trying to figure out the best and safe usage you can get from those features. Alexander Stepanov says : When we program in C++ we should not be ashamed of its C heritage, but make full use of it. The only problems with C++, and even the only problems with C, arise when they themselves are not consistent with their own logic.
