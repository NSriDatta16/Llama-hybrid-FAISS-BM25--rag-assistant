This sounds like your web server's mod_security module denied access to a client that had the string "SurveyBot" in its USER_AGENT header. Looks like just a rule to block useless robots - nothing to worry about, everything worked out as it was supposed to. Edit : The rule indeed seems to be in mod_security's bad robots list .
