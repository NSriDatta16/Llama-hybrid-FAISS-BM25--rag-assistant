Aggregating Stats When Some Results Are Ignored

This is more of a methodology question than anything. Scenario: you are trying to report average stats between two different groups responding to a variety of optional survey questions. But, (this is the annoying bit) somebody says "if the number of answers for a group on a specific question is too small (say, less than 2), the result for that question/group should be n/a". So, Group A has 5 people respond with their ages. The average age is 65. Group B has only 1 person respond with an an age of 10. According to the stipulation above, the results for average should be presented/reported as: Group A: 65 Group B: n/a Here is my question. Given the stipulation above, if you are then going to report on the average age of both groups, should the data from Group B be included? Sorry if this is too basic a question, but it's bugging me. I keep changing sides.
