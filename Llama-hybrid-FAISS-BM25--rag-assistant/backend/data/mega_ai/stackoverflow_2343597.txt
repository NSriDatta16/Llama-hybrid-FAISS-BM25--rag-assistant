This default scrolling behavior comes from the keydown event . In order to prevent it, you must handle the keydown event and prevent the default behavior, either by returning false from the event handler or calling event.preventDefault() . As a rule of thumb, think carefully before you prevent default behavior like spacebar scrolling . I use it all the time and I get extremely annoyed when it doesn't work in a page. But if you want to eat the key... window.onkeydown = function(e) { return e.keyCode !== 32; }; According to the MDN web docs for KeyboardEvent#keyCode , keyCode is a deprecated property. Although it still works in most browsers, you are encouraged to use #KeyboardEvent #key ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key ) going forward, which is a more standardized string representation of a key. The key value for spacebar is literally the input value: " " (single space string). So if you wanted to be very careful to support all browsers, you could write: window.onkeydown = function(e) { return e.keyCode !== 32 && e.key !== " "; }
