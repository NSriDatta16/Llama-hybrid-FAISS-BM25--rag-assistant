I agree with lhunath to discourage use of which , and his solution is perfectly valid for Bash users . However, to be more portable, command -v shall be used instead: $ command -v foo >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "I require foo but it's not installed. Aborting." >&2; exit 1; } Command command is POSIX compliant. See here for its specification: command - execute a simple command Note: type is POSIX compliant, but type -P is not.
