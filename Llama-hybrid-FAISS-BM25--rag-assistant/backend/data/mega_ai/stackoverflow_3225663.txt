I don't understand the purpose of the src folder and separate packages

I've been using Eclipse only for Python over the last few months, and I'd like to start using it for Java. However, according to the tutorials I've looked at, the proper way to organize your Java project is to create a package in the source folder named, for example, com.project , and have all the classes and such be named com.project.class . You can also make sub-packages that work similar to sub-directories such as com.project.utilities.* . With this convention, I don't see why I would create more than one package per project. Since all the code is contained within this structure, what purpose does the src folder serve? I hope I'm just wrong about this being the normal way to structure a Java project, because it seems pretty inconvenient. Also, I haven't fooled with this yet, but wouldn't this make loading external dependencies a pain? If I have an img folder placed next to the src and bin folders, wouldn't I have to use ..\img\* to access it?
