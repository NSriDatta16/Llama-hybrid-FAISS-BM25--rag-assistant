I have been using Org-mode with Remember the Milk quite nicely. here is my setup: (require org-feed) (setq org-feed-alist '(("Remember The Milk" "https://www.rememberthemilk.com/rss/jonnay/" "~/org/GTD.org" "Remember The Milk" :template "* TODO %title\n %a\n " ))) ;;* rtm feed timer (run-at-time 3600 3600 'org-feed-update-all) The only problem is that I get asked for authentication the first time I start up emacs. With a bit of elisp this could be fixed, I just haven't had time yet. Just as an update, there is a new package shaping up that might handle syncing a little better: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/gsoc2012/student-projects/org-sync/index.html
