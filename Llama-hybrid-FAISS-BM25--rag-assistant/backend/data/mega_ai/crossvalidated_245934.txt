Exact amount of data to avoid overfitting with convolutional neural networks

Say that I want to train a CNN model that consists of $\sim1.5M$ hyperparameters (i.e., total number of filters weights and fully-connected layers coefficients) where the input layer is a $256\times256$ grayscale image. So I am wondering is there an exact minimum number of training images that I can use to claim that my model is not overfitting regardless whether I use dropout layers or not.
