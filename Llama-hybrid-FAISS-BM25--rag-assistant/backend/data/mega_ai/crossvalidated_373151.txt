Treating a column containing null values for random forest when they should be null (not missing)

Suppose I have columns like this date_ago happened_or_not 0 3.0 1 1 1.0 1 2 NaN 0 3 NaN 0 4 3.0 1 5 5.0 1 6 NaN 0 7 NaN 0 8 2.0 1 Now the first column contains null values when they should be null, how do I treat this column and eventually pass it into RandomForestClassifier ? Any idea is appreciated! I tried to search for this but everything is concerning when the data is actually missing, where as in this case it's not missing but rather just null and unable to pass into RandomForestClassifier.
