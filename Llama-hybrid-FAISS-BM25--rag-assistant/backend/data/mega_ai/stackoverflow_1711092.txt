Please observe that according to the rfc2396 , the colon character is reserved within the URI format. The SAXException that you are getting is a validation exception and it could be that Oracle JDev and SOAP UI skips validation of URIs while SONIC Workbench does not. The hash (or sharp) character is a delimiter between a URI and a fragment, and is as such disallowed in the URI syntax. This could more likely be the reason for the validation exception. If you have access to the schema which the xml is validated against, I suggest you run your own validation with eg. xmllint or a similar XML tool.
