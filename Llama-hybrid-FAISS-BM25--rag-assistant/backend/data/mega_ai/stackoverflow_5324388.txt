Errors when building the cross compiler on debian

I want to cross compile the kernel for powerpc. I've tried doing it on a x86_64 Ubuntu 10.04, and on a i386 Debian Lenny, and I get exactly the same problem. I follow the instructions at http://wiki.debian.org/BuildingCrossCompilers , and when I try to build the binutils by giving the following command: fakeroot debian/rules binary-cross I get this result: [snip] make[3]: Entering directory `/home/anthony/cross-toolchain/binutils-2.20.1/builddir-powerpc-linux-gnu/libiberty' if [ x"-fpic" != x ]; then \ gcc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -g -O2 -Wno-format-security -I. -I../../libiberty/../include -W -Wall -Wwrite-strings -Wc++-compat -Wstrict-prototypes -pedantic -fpic ../../libiberty/regex.c -o pic/regex.o; \ else true; fi In file included from /usr/include/stdlib.h:320, from ../../libiberty/regex.c:128: /usr/include/sys/types.h:100: error: two or more data types in declaration specifiers make[3]: *** [regex.o] Error 1 [snip] (This is because types.h attempts to typedef pid_t, which, however, has been #defined to int. If I hack around this problem by #undef pid_t inside types.h, I get a similar problem elsewhere with intptr_t, and so on and so on.)
