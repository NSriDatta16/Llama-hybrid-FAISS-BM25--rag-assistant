I just had a project where this happened and I was banging my head trying to get it to update properly in IB 3.2 (732). I really did not want to redo the xib from scratch. I tried drag/drop of the *.h files, restarting, reloading everything and it didn't work. I also tried File->Read Class Files which didn't work. Strangely though, File->Reload All Class Files worked like a charm.
