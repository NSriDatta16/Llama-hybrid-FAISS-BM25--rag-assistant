Something that might be helpful in unifying these two views is the Hewitt-Savage(-de Finetti) representation theorem. The theorem says that $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are exchangeable precisely when they are independent and identically distributed conditional on some additional information. This is important in Bayesian statistics, because it means that an exchangeable sequence (which seems a reasonable thing to assume) can be modelled as an iid sequence plus a prior (which is convenient mathematically). For binary variables the extra information is just the probability. If $P$ is a random variable between 0 and 1, and $X_i|P\sim \mathrm{Bern}(P)$ , then $X_i$ are exchangeable, and they are conditionally iid given $P$ . That's the de Finetti result. Hewitt and Savage showed this was true generally, not just for binary sequences: a sequence is exchangeable if and only if it's iid conditional on some extra information, in this case the 'tail $\sigma$ -field'
