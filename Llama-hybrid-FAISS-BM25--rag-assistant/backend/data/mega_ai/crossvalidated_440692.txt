Results of logistic regression look odds

When doing a logistic regression, $y = x_1+x_2$ , it gave an odds ratio for $x_1$ of $3.1$ . When doing another logistic regression, $y = x_1+x_2+x_3$ , it gave an odds ratio for $x_1$ of $5.1$ . Does this make sense? I thought when increasing the number of adjusted variables, odds ratio for $x_1$ should be reduced. Any suggestions for interpreting why odds ratio for $x_1$ got increased after adding another covariate?
