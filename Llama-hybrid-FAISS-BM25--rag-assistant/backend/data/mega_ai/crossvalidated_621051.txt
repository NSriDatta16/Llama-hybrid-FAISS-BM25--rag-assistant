Output of discrete-time survival model interpretation

I have a question regarding the output from a discrete-time survival model that I have previously asked questions about [here][1]. The code looks the following (see link further up for more info): mod Anova(mod) Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) Response: as.factor(Mating_time) LR Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) Round 35.094 8 2.571e-05 *** A 3.749 2 0.15343 B 9.024 2 0.01097 * A : B 10.424 4 0.03385 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > multcomp::cld(emmeans(Mating_time, ~A|B), Letters = letters, reversed = T) # Post-Hoc test > multcomp::cld(emmeans(Mating_time, ~A|B), Letters = letters, reversed = T) # Post-Hoc test B = Metabolite: A emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL .group Normal -1.87 0.218 Inf -2.29 -1.44 a Metabolite -1.98 0.192 Inf -2.35 -1.60 a Low -1.99 0.217 Inf -2.42 -1.57 a B = Normal: A emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL .group Low -1.49 0.213 Inf -1.91 -1.08 a Normal -2.35 0.249 Inf -2.84 -1.86 b Metabolite -2.59 0.264 Inf -3.10 -2.07 b B = Low: A emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL .group Normal -2.26 0.230 Inf -2.71 -1.81 a Low -2.55 0.265 Inf -3.07 -2.03 a Metabolite -2.62 0.236 Inf -3.09 -2.16 a Results are averaged over the levels of: Round Results are given on the cloglog (not the response) scale. Confidence level used: 0.95 Note: contrasts are still on the cloglog scale Results are given on the as.factor (not the response) scale. P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates significance level used: alpha = 0.05 NOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol, then we cannot show them to be different. But we also did not show them to be the same. I know that ANOVA and post-hoc tests such as Tukey's test can give different output since they are different tests that answers different questions. However, the output I get is somewhat confusing to me. I do see significance of B and A : B interaction (also round but that's less important to what I'm actually interested in, I'm interested in how A and B and their interaction influences mating_time). Due to the way we structured our research question, we do pairwise comparisons by B (three comparisons for the three groups formed). However, the output I get from the ANOVA says that there's significance for B and the interaction A : B. However, when I do the post-hoc test I would suspect all comparisons being the same because of this. Although I see differences in the "B normal" group, this I would expect to be the case if A on ANOVA showed significance. I can't wrap my head around how this could be the case if just B and A : B interaction showed significance. EDIT: When I try to run type 1 SS anova (either with anova() command or aov()) on the model I run into the following error that I can't find no correction for online. > test summary(test) Error in levels(x)[x] : only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts Works with Anova type II and III though. Any thoughts?
