Visual Web Developer 2010 How to use absolute positioning on a asp.net Web Form

I'm just starting with using VWD and asp.net to create web sites. I can't get a handle on how to use absolute positioning of asp server controls like the label, textbox, dropdown, etc. on a web form. I've set the option in settings under CSS styling to change positioning to absolute when dragged from toolbox. I've set the web form to use absolute positioning at every tag and property I can find. When I first add the web form, I select absolute positioning. For each control I set absolute positioning and so on. I can see the tags in the source have the style property setup with position: absolute. But the controls on the form will not move on the page to a absolute position. Sometimes I can get a button or textbox to move, but not always. I'm used to designing windows forms and this has been very frustrating. It is not very intuitive. Is there a step by step set of instructions on how to use absolute positioning on a web form in msdn/help, etc.
