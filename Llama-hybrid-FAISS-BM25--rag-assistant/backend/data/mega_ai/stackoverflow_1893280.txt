Image preloading isn't working for images in FireFox

I'm dynamically switching background images. Naturally, they need to be preloaded to display promptly. I am preloading them, am able to following in FireBug as the images load. When the background image switches, I see the images download again in FireBug. Here's my url: http://www.morganpackard.com/siteRoot/ Strangely, if I reload the page, everything works as expected. The steps I'm taking are as follows: 1) clear FireFox cache 2) reload page Images load slowly, and, apparently are neither being preloaded nor cached. Every time there's an image swap, the image downloads again. 3) now reload the page again without clearing the cache Images load and swap instantly, everything works as expected. So it looks like I'm having to RELOAD before FireFox will read images from the cache. This is kooky. Any ideas? Note: My images are ENORMOUS. I'll compress them, of course, but want to get this preloading this sorted first.
