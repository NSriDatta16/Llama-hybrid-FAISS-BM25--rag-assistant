MS SQL server 2005 lock requests/sec rising linearly non-stop

While running an application load test, I am observing some weird behavior. Lock requests/sec counter is increasing in a linear fashion throughout the whole test (duration 12 hours, load levels off to a constant level within first 10 minutes). The value reached 6 million at 12 hours. There was no apparent impact to the response time of the application. There was also no impact to lock wait time (200ms average). Database CPU slowly increased from 20% to about 30% at 12 hours. What could be causing such behaviour?
