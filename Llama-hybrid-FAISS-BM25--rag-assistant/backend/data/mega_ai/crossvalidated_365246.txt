What would be a good sampler from pymc3 for highly skewed data

I have a gamma distributed data which is highly skewed - alpha=0.15, beta=0.001. I would like to perform mcmc to find the delta between two gamma distributions. I get the following error: I suspect the reason is that my data is highly skewed. What would be a good sampler to catch the skewness of my data?
