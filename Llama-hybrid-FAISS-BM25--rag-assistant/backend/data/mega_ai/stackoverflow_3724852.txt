I know you said that you don't want to over-complicate things by persisting it to disk, but it's definitely going to much more complicate to persist stuff into shared memory or any of the solutions listed here. The reason why so many applications use databases or file storage is because it's the simplest solution. I would recommend you keep all the state in a single object or object hierarchy, serialize this object to XML and write it to a file. It really doesn't get much simpler than that.
