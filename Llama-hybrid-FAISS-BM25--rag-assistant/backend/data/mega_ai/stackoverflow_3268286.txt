Notify me when the Flash movie is done playing

I'm new to working with flash and have a quick question about embedding Flash with the SWFObject.js file. I can successfully embed an object and play it, but what I'd like to know now is if there is a way that I can be notified when the movie is done being played without editing the flash file itself, since I have no real way to do that. Is there a callback or an event that I could somehow connect to?
