I would stuff it in the session variable at login time - storing data in the client is intrinsicly insecure. If you do not expire your sessions but create them so they can be serialized to storage instead and use a web container supporting that, you never have to reload them. If that is not interesting then create a cache around the web service so the results are kept there, and expired after some inactivity. That will require active cleaning up though.
