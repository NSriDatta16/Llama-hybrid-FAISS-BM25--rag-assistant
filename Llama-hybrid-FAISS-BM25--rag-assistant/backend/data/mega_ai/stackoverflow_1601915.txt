I don't have a MIPS system lying around, but on my x86 loonix box I tried #include and discovered that # is the comment character, so I tried .include and that worked as soon as I quoted the file name: .include "something.i" . Now, if you have header files and an organized infrastructure for assembler code, I have to wonder why you want to do this with inline asm in the first place, though. Why not just make a real .s or .S file, include the assembler header file, and make it a first-class module in your system? I've seen small masterpieces done with asm even in projects that already had a locore.S in their Makefile , go figure...
