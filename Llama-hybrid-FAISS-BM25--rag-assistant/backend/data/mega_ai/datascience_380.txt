I suspect this will get closed since it is very narrow, but my 2 cents... Data Science requires 3 skills: Math/Stats Programming Domain Knowledge It can be very hard to show all three. #1 and #2 can be signaled via degrees, but a hiring manager who may not have them doesn't want to trust a liberal arts degree. If you're looking to get into Data Science, position yourself as a domain expert first. Publish election predictions. If you're correct, cite them. That will get you noticed. If you're Domain knowledge is A+ level, you don't need A+ level programming skills, but learn programming enough so that you don't need someone else to fetch data for you.
