Like most holes in core PHP functionality, one option is to fill it with a Zend Framework class. The Zend Framework lets you pick and choose which pieces you use, so dependencies will be minimal. Zend_Mail looks like it will handle your plain text/html/attachment requirement. As for a queue system, this is only an opinion, but that's not really PHP's job. If you're getting to the point where email is serious enough to you to consider throttling, you'll want to become familiar with sendmail, postfix, or whatever Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) you're using. Almost all PHP classes that wrap mail functionality are actually just sending the message off the the MTA to handle. Any system that implements throttling in PHP is (likely) just going to throttle sending it off the the MTA, and the MTA still ends up being a point of failure.
