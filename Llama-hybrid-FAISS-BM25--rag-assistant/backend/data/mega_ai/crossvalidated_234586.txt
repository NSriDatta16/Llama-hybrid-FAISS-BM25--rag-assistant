I think it does make sense to use the approach that you mention and append at the end the points from the other tests. This is because PCA looks to find correlation between columns. So for any given time, if there is a correlation, this correlation should hold for other times and other tests. So you data matrix would look like: (p1t1, p2t1, ... pNt1)q1 (p1t2, p2t2, ... pNt2)q1 . . . (p1tM, p2tM, ... pNtM)q1 (p1t1, p2t1, ... pNt1)q2 (p1t2, p2t2, ... pNt2)q2 . . . (p1tM, p2tM, ... pNtM)q2 . . . where q1 refers to test 1 and q2 refers to test 2. there is a question here on interpreting the meaning of PCA on times series data EDIT: I haven't looked at this in a while, but I guess it should be mentioned- why do you want to run PCA on this data? You mention And this resulted in getting principle components which basically gave me an answer which of the N parameters are the most important. but PCA does not do this. After running PCA you do not get, as an output, which of the N parameters are most important. It is possible, with some investigation, to do this, but if you want to know which parameters are most important (and it is not exactly clear what that means either) then there are other better approaches than running PCA. It really depends what is your goal.
