Embedding PDF documents into websites

I need to embed some PDF documents into a website. The last time I did this, I used a jQuery lightbox to popup an iFrame with the PDF document as the URL. The client's PDF viewer would then take care of the rest. Apparently though, that was a bit buggy on some other peoples browsers. I guess it was due to the large PDF file sizes and the effort it took for their computers to fire up Adobe. So I'm after ideas on how to go about this. How do you guys embed your PDF's into websites? Or do you just stick to adding a download link?
