Given a time series $\{y_t\}=(y_1,\dots,y_t)$ , you can obtain both price changes $d_t:=y_{t}-y_{t-1}$ and price returns $r_t:=\frac{y_{t}-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}}$ . For any model of $d_t$ , you can write an equivalent model of $r_t$ by dividing both sides of the model's equation by $y_{t-1}$ . For any model of $r_t$ , you can write an equivalent model of $d_t$ by multiplying both sides by $y_{t-1}$ . Therefore, there does not have to be a difference. Consequently, any difference between the models for $d_t$ and $r_t$ is your choice rather than a necessity. And if the models are telling different stories, it is by the modeller's choice, not by necessity.
