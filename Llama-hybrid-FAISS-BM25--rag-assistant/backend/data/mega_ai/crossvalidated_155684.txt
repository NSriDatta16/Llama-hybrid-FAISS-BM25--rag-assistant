What visualizations do people use to debug a machine learning model?

Imaging I am refining a model. What visualization can I rely on to help me identify an error, e.g. feature deficiency, data bias? A few graphs I am aware of include: confusion matrix, ROC, learning curve. Anything else? Or is there a visualization tool/framework developed for such purpose?
