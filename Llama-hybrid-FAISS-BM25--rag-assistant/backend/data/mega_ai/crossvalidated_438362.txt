Different models always the same loss

I am trying to predict a time series using LSTM. My problem is that no matter how complex my network is, how many layers I use, what the batch size is, dropout, the number of time steps, the loss always ends up being the same value. I haven't found anything regarding this topic. What could be the problem? Thanks for the help in advance!
