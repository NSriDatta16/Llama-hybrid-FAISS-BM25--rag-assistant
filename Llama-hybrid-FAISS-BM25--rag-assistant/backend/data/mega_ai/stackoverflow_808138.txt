The code I gave you previously listened for the first two clicks, and added a marker for each. The problem is that when you drag the first marker, it's calling the "click" event again - and thus adding another marker at the same location. Fortunately, the click event lets you know whether an overlay was clicked. So only execute the code that adds a new marker if overlay is null. Note that overlay is not a boolean. var listener = GEvent.addListener(map, "click", function(overlay, latlng) { if (overlay == null) { // code to add new marker } });
