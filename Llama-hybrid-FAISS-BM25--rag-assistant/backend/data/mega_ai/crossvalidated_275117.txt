undersampling in machine learning

I have imbalanced dataset and I want to perform undersampling. I have 2000 instances out of which 150 are positive and 1850 are negative. I have performed undersampling i.e., I have randomly selected 150 -ve instances. Now, I have total 300 instances. After applying machine learning classifiers on these 300 instances, I am getting 79% accuracy. Please let me know if these results will be valid and acceptable. Thanks!
