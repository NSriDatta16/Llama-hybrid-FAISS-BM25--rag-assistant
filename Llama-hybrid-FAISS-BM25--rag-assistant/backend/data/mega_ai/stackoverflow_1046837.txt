Actually your example works because checks.py is in the same directory as agent.py, but say checks.py was in the preceeding directory, eg; agent/agent.py checks.py Then you could do the following: path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')) if not path in sys.path: sys.path.insert(1, path) del path Note the use of __file__ .
