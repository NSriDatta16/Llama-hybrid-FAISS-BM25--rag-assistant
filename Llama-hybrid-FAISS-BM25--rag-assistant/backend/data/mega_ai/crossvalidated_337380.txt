This is a non-trivial task. Reason is that even if you would store all models fitted by MissForest, it is not obvious how to apply them to fill gaps in more than one variable. One possibility would be to initially fill all gaps univariately (hot-deck or mean imputation e.g.) and then replace these by predictions from the originally fitted random forests until stabilization. Another problem is that if your first data set is large, then tons and tons of disk space will be necessary to store a random forest for each variable.
