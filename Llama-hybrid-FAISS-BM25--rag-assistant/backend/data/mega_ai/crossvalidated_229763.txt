PCA always explains all the variance, if you include all the components. Therefore, I am guessing that what you mean is that the first (or perhaps first several) components explain less of the variance than you think they should. What this means is that the variables do not "go together" as well as you think they do. This might simply mean that you were overly optimistic. A higher sample in one area will not, by itself, make the first (few) principal components lower.
