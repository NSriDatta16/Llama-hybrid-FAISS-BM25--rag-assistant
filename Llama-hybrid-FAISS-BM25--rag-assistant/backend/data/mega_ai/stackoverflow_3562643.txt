When would my Python test suite file coverage not be 100%?

We are using Hudson and coverage.py to report the code coverage of our test suite. Hudson breaks down coverage into: packages files classes lines conditionals Coverage.py only reports coverage on files executed/imported during the tests, and so it seems is oblivious to any files not executed during the tests. Is there ever an instance where files would not report 100% coverage?
