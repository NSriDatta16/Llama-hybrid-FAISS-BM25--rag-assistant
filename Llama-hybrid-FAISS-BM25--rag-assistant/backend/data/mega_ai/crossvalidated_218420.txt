How to handle missing values in a Random Forest model?

I have a data with a binary target variable and some predictors. I tried running a random forest model and failed. First of all, I found it hard to enter all predictors to the model. I did: randomForest(Target ~ P1 + P2 + P3, data = dataset), however, I have more than 3 predictors, and I do not know how to declare them all together. Can I say to R to take P1 to P30 ? Secondly, the model did not run. After some research I realized, that random forest cannot handle missing values. I wanted to ask you, how can I set a random forest if I have missing values in my data ? Can you please guide me, or give me a package that will actually work? (I tried the randomforest package). Thank you !
