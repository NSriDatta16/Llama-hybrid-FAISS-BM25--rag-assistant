"Beware of bugs. I have proven the above algorithm correct, but have not tested it yet." Some people don't understand the above quote (paraphrase?), but it makes perfect sense when you think about it. Tests will never prove an algorithm correct, they only help to indicate whether you've coded it right. Write tests for mistakes you expect might appear and for boundary conditions to achieve good code coverage. Don't just be picking values out of the blue to see if they work, because that might lead to lots of tests which all test exactly the same thing. For your example, just hand-select a few primes and non-primes to test specific conditions in the implementation.
