Users in Active Directory is not a group - it's a container. That's why you can't enumerate it like a group - you'll have to enumerate it like an OU (Organizational Unit). Something like: // bind to the "Users" container DirectoryEntry deUsers = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://CN=Users,DC=yourcompany,DC=com"); // enumerate over its child entries foreach(DirectoryEntry deChild in deUsers.Children) { // do whatever you need to do to those entries }
