How to drag and drop an email, from Outlook, into a .NET application?

I am trying to figure out how to drag and drop an email from Outlook 2010 into my .NET application. I've seen quite a few articles, most with very complex solutions. My thought is it shouldn't be that complex ... but I could be wrong. Any help would be much appreciated!
