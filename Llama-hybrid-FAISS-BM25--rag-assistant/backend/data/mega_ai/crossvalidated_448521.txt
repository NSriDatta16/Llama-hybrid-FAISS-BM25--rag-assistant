Is it appropriate to select an ARIMA model without having statistical significance of all the parameters?

I am trying to identify an ARIMA model for the following time series: According to the ADF test, it is stationary (p-value = 0.0144). When I use the ACF and PACF, both show correlation without a typical pattern: After using auto arima with tracking, all the options that come out show autocorrelation of the residuals, except for one that shows not much autocorrelation and a Ljung box test with a P=0.08: Nonetheless, not every parameter in the model shows statistical significance: z test of coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) ar1 -0.466242 0.146513 -3.1822 0.001461 ** ar2 0.153763 0.131994 1.1649 0.244048 ar3 0.071273 0.131992 0.5400 0.589212 ar4 0.017179 0.130615 0.1315 0.895361 ar5 -0.318828 0.117431 -2.7150 0.006627 ** ma1 0.833638 0.108197 7.7048 1.311e-14 *** intercept 15.836490 0.328744 48.1727 I was wondering if in this case, it is better to select this model given the lack of final autocorrelation over others that show the statistical significance of the parameters but with a correlation of the residuals. Or if I am doiing something wrong with this series? Here is a link for the file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lHJx-sR32ZQW-3FVnu45jHiVtneSF44Y Thank you in advance!
