There is no way to do this in C#. The closest you could get is to make your ns1.cs file and fill it with partial class .... , but that is really pointless. At that point you should just write a document as you won't really get any compiler help in enforcing the structure. I would say this is a case of "forget how you did it in C++". Usually it's not important to find out what's inside a namespace, but more important to figure out what namespace a certain class is in, and C#'s organization will show you that perfectly. Just a small last thing: is there a practical reason you don't want to rely on an IDE, or is it just a nitpick? It's OK to rely on the help of an IDE for much development.
