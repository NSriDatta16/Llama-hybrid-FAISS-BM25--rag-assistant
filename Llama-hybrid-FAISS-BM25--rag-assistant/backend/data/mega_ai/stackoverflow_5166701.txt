Splitting app's parts in their own assemblies when using Prism

The MVVM approach encourages (or just gives the possibility to) splitting a WPF or Silverlight application into Model , ViewModel and View projects so all three could exist in their own assemblies. Using Prism (and, in my case, MEF as a Dependency Injection Container), on the other hand, one can build a modular application that is divided into a set of functional units (named modules) and each unit, in this case, is a seperate assembly. Am I right that in this case we can separate only a Model in an its own assembly, but View and ViewModel should sit in one assembly, representing one functional module?
