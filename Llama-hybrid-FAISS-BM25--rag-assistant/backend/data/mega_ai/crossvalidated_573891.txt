There's no problem with a "continuous" predictor having only a fixed set of values. That happens all the time in designed experiments. What you won't be able to do is include both Lake and your PCs as predictors, as when you know the set of PCs you also know the Lake --that set of predictors isn't linearly independent. That said, I also agree with the interpretability issue raised in a comment by @danlooo. Principal components can be hard to interpret, although I appreciate that PCA is often used in this type of study. Consider, perhaps, a model that uses ridge regression on the environmental variables while keeping the other predictors unpenalized. That's basically a weighted principal-component regression rather than an all-or-none selection of components, and would more directly provide (penalized) coefficients for each of the environmental variables. With respect to coding Sex ( V7 ): the 1/2 coding you show might lead to trouble when interpreting the intercept of your model; the intercept might be the predicted outcome value when Sex = 0 . The model and predictions from it will still be OK, but you and your readers might be less confused if you use 0/1 coding for dichotomous predictors.
