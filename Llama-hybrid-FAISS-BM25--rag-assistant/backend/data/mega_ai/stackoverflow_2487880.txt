First, you need to change somehow your classes in order to have a name for members ! So let's assume that your classes are: class Organization { hasMany = [members:Member] } class Member { belongsTo = organization String name } Then you have two ways of sorting the members in alphabetical order. First method : you can retrieve all members and then sort them as shown below: Second Method : You retrieve members directly from GORM in alphabetical order def members = Member.findAllByOrganization(organizationInstance, [sort: "name"])
