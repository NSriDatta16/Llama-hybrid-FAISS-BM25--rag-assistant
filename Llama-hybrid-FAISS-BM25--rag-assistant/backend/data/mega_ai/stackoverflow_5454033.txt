How do I use an xsl variable to get the child id of a record i need to update?

I am trying to update a nested record using csharp and xslt. I want to be able to get at the TopicAnswerID for each TopicAnalysisbyTopicAnalysisID Here is my xslt code: Here is the XML data: EditAnalysis 124 none Topics 6 Privacy Testing this out... 27 36 124 asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd 4 4 How can you best compete with your competitors? 71 asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd 6 Privacy Testing this out... 27 42 124 asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd 4 3 How do you forsee this topic impacting your financial institution in the next year? 72 asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd 1 true true Remote Deposit A wave of banks has adopted RDC, and others consider it every day. Has it been profitably for your bank? What best practices have you learned? Which vendors are the best? Is Consumer RDC on your agenda? Share your RDC content, articles, and more. 6 false false Privacy Testing this out... 5 false false BSA/AML Testing this out... 3 false false Reg E ODP The forced opt-out and opt-back-in for ODP is around the corner. Many banks will lose significant revenue, even if they implement a plan. What are your peers doing to soften the blow? What vendors have emerged to help solve this problem? How much revenue can you expect to save? Share your Reg E experiences, and learn what your peers are doing. 2 false false Social Media Unless you don&#39;t have a radio, TV, computer or any friends, you cannot avoid the exaggerated hype about &quot;social media&quot; and community banks. Should a bank embrace it or block it? Is it all sizzle and no steak? What resources are required to make it work? What are the risks? What are the gains? Share your perspective and learn from what your peers and consultants think. Here is the c sharp codes: else if (Request.Form["SaveExistingAnalysis"] != null) { cbancWS.TopicAnalysis tan = new cbancWS.TopicAnalysis(); int topicID = Convert.ToInt32(Request.Form["TopicID"]); if (tan.TopicAnswers == null) { tan.TopicAnswers = new string[15]; } for (int i = 0; i (ta); tan.TopicAnswers[i] = swta; } } } //thisSessionC.BO.AddAnalysis(tan); XmlData.Append(thisSessionC.BO.GetTopicAnalysis((int)Session["AdminUserID"]).GetXml()); }
