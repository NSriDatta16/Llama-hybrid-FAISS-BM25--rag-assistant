I think it would be better to calculate variance as this is a much more standard statistic. Additionally, if you know or assume that the data is distributed a certain way (eg. It comes from a Poisson distribution), you will be able to easily calculate confidence intervals. Variance also has nice mathematical properties. For example, it is additive, so Var(A) + Var(B) = Var(A+B). The variance is the average squared difference of each value from the mean.
