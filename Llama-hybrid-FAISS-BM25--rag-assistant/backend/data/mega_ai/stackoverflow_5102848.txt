The problem is that everything you add into your tinymce editor instance needs to be verified by the browser. Inserting i.e. more than 200-300 Paragraphs into your editor will result in highly increased computation time (consumed by the broweser). 2,5 MB filesize does not sound that much, but keep in mind that this is much text. You might want to think about spliting your huge file into many smaller chunks in order to make them editable using a textarea or a tinymce editor.
