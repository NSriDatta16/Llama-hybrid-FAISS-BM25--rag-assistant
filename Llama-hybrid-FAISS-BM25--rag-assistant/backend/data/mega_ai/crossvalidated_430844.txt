Sampling and Standardization of data before applying dimentionality reduction?

I'm trying to solve a classification problem with 4 parameters , next_action - binary variable(0/1) total_visits- numerical value days_Since_last_visit - numerical lead_source- categorical variable (5 categories) Target variable: status (0- lost customer,1- active customer) DONE steps: converted lead_source into dummy variables. A dataset of 7 features- next_action,total_visits,days_since_last_visit,851,852,853,854(removed 850 as drop_first in dummy variable) Question: Should I apply standardization on all the variables together i.e without removing the binary variables oR should I scale categoical features as well? I have to apply data balancing because in training data 3400 active customers are there and 300 lost so I need to normalize data as well. So should I apply sampling before PCA? what is the flow of all 3 - standardization, sampling and PCA? Let me know If I need to provide any more information! EDIT: I tried with different sequences and calculated results using knnclassifier! This was a stupid attempt of trying with every possible combination but there is no way to know which case is better! :/ FYI: ar_value and 50% value are from CAP curve graph. accuracy is calculated from confusion matrix.
