How to detect lack of position:fixed in a generic way?

On mobile devices such as the iPad, I would like to disable a feature that only works if position:fixed is supported. Is there a way to detect these devices without using the user agent string? The reason is that I would like to avoid searching for iPad, iPhone, iPod, Android, etc if possible.
