What you mention in the second paragraph, i.e. looking for treatment effect over repeated measures on different subjects, is what repeated measures ANOVA is intended for. However, you should still worry about whether the assumptions of repeated measures ANOVA is met; the one that comes to mind right away to me is sphericity. Given that you have more than 2 measurements over time, you should question whether you are willing to assume that within a subject, all measurements are equally correlated, or is it possible that measurements that are taken closer together in time are more highly correlated than measurements that are further away?
