My ideas: The average waiting time is then the sum of the service time for all customers ahead him. It is known that the number of customers ahead have a poisson(a) distribution, that means the service time (for serving a single customer) will have an exponential distribution with expected value of (1/a). Then the average waiting time is = (#of customers)*(the expected service time for one customer).
