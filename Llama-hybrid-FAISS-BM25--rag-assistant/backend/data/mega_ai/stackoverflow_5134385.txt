Specifying Message Persistence for JMS client

I'm reading this section of Java EE tutorial. http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bncfu.html#bncfy And have a question: If I have a JMS client (not Server) that produces messages and sends them to a destination queue that is on the server, does this producer.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT); still applies? I mean does JMS client support any mechanism to persist messages or that is only comes with the provider/sever software? Thanks
