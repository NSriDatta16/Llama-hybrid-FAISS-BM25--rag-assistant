Some suggestions: Your ideas in solutions were basic but solid. For example the fluctuations in second idea can be smoothed out with a simple moving average and then applying your idea makes sense. Another idea is to set the value of first day as threshold and calculate the total negative (drop from threshold) and positive (raise from threshold) through the month. Let's say in a constant month (a month in which all 30 days have exact same values) the percentage of change is 0%. It means that sum of above-threshold values and under-threshold values can give you an estimate of change in percentage according to the first day. An example is [5, 10, 50, 100, 5, 1] visits during 6 days. we set the value of first day ( $5$ ) as threshold. Then you will have [0%, 100%, 900%, 1900%, 0%, -400%] are the raises and falls (why?!) and you can use any numerical calculation to come up with a final number e.g. 2900% raise and 400% fall which can be 2500% raise at the end. Playing with the idea above gives many different methods of doing this. Instead of comparing each day to first day, as you also mentioned, compare it to only previous day and come up with a final change rate. Or consider a penalty for negative changes e.g. if in one case values are strictly raising and final change is +3000% and in another case values fluctuate but finally the change is 3000% again, you can consider a weight for the second one so the difference between them is preserved.
