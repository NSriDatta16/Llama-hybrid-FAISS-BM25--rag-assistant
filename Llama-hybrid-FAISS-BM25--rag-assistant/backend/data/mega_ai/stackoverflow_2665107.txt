If all you are looking for is a good estimate, you might first measure the width of a representative string to determine the average character width of your font once. A good representative might not be just the alphabet; you might look for a character frequency histogram to get a better average width. string Representative = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"; float CharacterWidth; using(Bitmap b = new Bitmap(0, 0)) using(Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(b)) using(Font f = /* some font definition */) { CharacterWidth = g.MeasureString(Representative, f).Width / Representative.Length; } Then use that to estimate how many characters would fit within N pixels. string Text = ... int DisplayWidth = 100; int FitLength = Math.Min(Text.Length, (int)(DisplayWidth / CharacterWidth)); string FitText = Text.Substring(0, FitLength);
