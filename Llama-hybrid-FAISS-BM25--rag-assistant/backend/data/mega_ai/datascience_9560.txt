Research in random forest algorithms able to switch data sets

I'm curious as to whether research been done into random forests that combine unsupervised with supervised learning in a way allowing a single algorithm to find patterns in, and work with, multiple different data sets. I have googled every possible way to find research on this, and have come up empty. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
