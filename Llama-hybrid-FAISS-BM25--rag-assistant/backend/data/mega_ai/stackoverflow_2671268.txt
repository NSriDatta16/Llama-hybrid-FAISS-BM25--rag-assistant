ASP.Net How to enforce the HTTP get URL format?

[Sorry about a messy question. I believe I am targeting .Net 2.0 (for now)] Hi, I am an ASP.NET noob. For starters I am building a page that parses a URL string and populates a table in a database. I want that string to be strictly of the form: http:// : /PageName.aspx?A=1&B=2&C=3&D=4&E=5 The order of the arguments does not matter, I just do not want any of them missing, or any extras. Here is what I tried (yes, it is ugly; I just want to get it to work first): #if (DEBUG) // Maps parameter names to their human readable names. // Used for error checking. private static Dictionary paramNameToDisplayName = new Dictionary { { "A", "a"}, { "B", "b"}, { "C", "c"}, { "D", "d"}, { "E", "e"}, { "F", "f"}, }; [Conditional("DEBUG")] private void validateRequestParameters(HttpRequest request) { bool endResponse = false; // Use foreach var foreach (string expectedParameterName in paramNameToDisplayName.Keys) { if (request[expectedParameterName] == null) { Response.Write(String.Format("No parameter \"{0}\", aka {1} was passed to the configuration generator. Check your URL string / cookie.", expectedParameterName, paramNameToDisplayName[expectedParameterName])); endResponse = true; } } // Use foreach var foreach (string actualParameterName in request.Params) { if (!paramNameToDisplayName.ContainsKey(actualParameterName)) { Response.Write(String.Format("The parameter \"{0}\", was passed to the configuration generator, but it was not expected. Check your URL string / cookie.", actualParameterName)); endResponse = true; } } if (endResponse) { Response.End(); } } #endif and it works ok, except that it complains about all sorts of other stuff: http://localhost:1796/AddStatusUpdate.aspx?X=0 No parameter "A", aka a was passed to the configuration generator.

Is there some way for me to separate the implicit and the explicit parameters, or is it not doable? Should I even bother? Perhaps the philosophy of get is to just throw away that what is not needed. Thanks!
