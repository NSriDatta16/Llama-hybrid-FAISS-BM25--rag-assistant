Have I correctly simulated data from Multilevel Logistic Distribution? Well, maybe, but I don't think so. Think of it this way: You want to simulate the case where you have a sample of individuals, and each individual belongs to a group. The individuals have covariate values and the groups have covariate values. The article is a little confusing at first. If you check out Maas and Joop (2004), you will see that Moineddin et al (2007) are following a very similar line of development. That might clarify some of their decisions. Maas and Joop (2004) examine the situation in the multilevel regression situation. The model is quite similar, with the same exact structure for the $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$. And there on page 131 we find the following statement: To simplify the simulation model, without loss of generality, the covariance between the two u-terms is assumed equal to zero. So, Moineddin et al (2007) are just following along. There is no reason you have to assume that $\sigma_{01} = 0$. Of course, to reproduce the results in the paper, you would. They also are following the same line of development with respect to evaluating the effect of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on estimation. In the logistic model, the ICC is computed a little differently than in the linear regression situation. But, the bottom line is the same --- specifying an ICC equates to specifying a variance for $\sigma_0^2$. Here is a revision of your code: ## Simulating data from multilevel logistic regression require(mvtnorm) set.seed(1234) # Set up various parameters. J At this point, you are all set to simulate. Notice that your original variance value was actually the standard deviation ($0.36^2 \approx 0.13$). That variance value was driven by the desire to have the ICC $=0.04$. # Generate (u_0j, u_1j) from a bivariate normal. mu Maas, Cora JM, and Joop J.
