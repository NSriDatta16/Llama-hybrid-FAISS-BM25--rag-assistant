I've run into a php class semantics conundrum

I have two classes, one of them is a configuration class. Inside of this class I have a variable called "theme". This is called config::theme . I have another class, but I can't be sure on the name as It's theme dependant. For instance, if the PHP sites theme is set to "nebula", I need to access the nebula theme, e.g: nebula::navigation . The farthest I've gotten is: public static function nav( ) { $temp = config::theme; return eval( $temp . "::navigation" ); } which outputs the error: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected $end in C:\Dropbox\Colzdragon\Colzdragon\Site\internal\theme.php(54) : eval()'d code on line 1 Is there any way to do this? Thanks!
