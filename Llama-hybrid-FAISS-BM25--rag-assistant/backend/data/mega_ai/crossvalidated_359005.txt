Summarizing a multi-dimensional distribution

I have an empirical distribution of observations along a number of dimensions. The dimensions are either categorical or ordinal (low frequency, equally spaced time steps from 0 to cut-off). At the moment there is no interdependence along the dimensions so clusters would be rare or uninformative (presumably some orderings of the categorical dimensions will generate peaks). My problem is that I want to summarize this distribution into a fixed number of regions that represent the dimensions as good as possible. The goal is not to directly compress the description of the distribution so I don't foresee a limit to the description of the regions, I'm mostly interested in subdividing the curve in a number of representative regions). Ideally the regions will be convex but this is not a hard requirement. For example, if the number of regions is set to 1, the region would be the entire support and be the average of the density.
