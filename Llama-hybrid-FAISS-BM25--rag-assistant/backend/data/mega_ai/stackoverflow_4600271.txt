I ran into issues with NAnt and decided to just use MSBuild. MSBuild was easier to work with and gave very descriptive error messages. (I also found our license for NCover so used that as well). Here is my script for anyone interested. I found the code for it from various spots on the net. .\Tests\Output\Coverage .\Tests\Output\Coverage\files Testing\bin\x86\Release C:\Program Files (x86)\NCover C:\Program Files (x86)\Gallio\bin
