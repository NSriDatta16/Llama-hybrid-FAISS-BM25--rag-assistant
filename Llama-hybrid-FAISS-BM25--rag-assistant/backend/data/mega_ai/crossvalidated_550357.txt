The question is a bit of a moot point, because the frequentist analysis assumes one of two things: the variances are exactly equal and the distributions are normal, or the variances may be arbitrarily different and the distributions are normal. Neither of these is a reasonable assumption. That's why a Bayesian t-test is preferred. It allows for non-normality while favoring normality, and allows for unequal variances while favoring a variance ratio that is not too far from 1.0. As N gets larger these favoritisms vanish. All uncertainties are taken into account and exact inference is obtained for any sample size.
