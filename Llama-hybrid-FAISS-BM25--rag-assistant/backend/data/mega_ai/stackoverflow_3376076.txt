MVC FW is less than 5% of average project code base, so I strongly recommend building MVC for every project and adapt it to the project specifications. If someone has enough knowledge about MVC pattern and some experience in using and building MVC frameworks, it can be built in some days. General arguments are speed and performance given by the custom FW.
