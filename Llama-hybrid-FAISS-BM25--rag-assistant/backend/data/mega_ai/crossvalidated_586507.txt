Are the classical moments consistently estimated from a single realization drawn from a given PSD?

Given a sequence $\{x_k\}_{k=-N}^{N}$ having power spectral density $S(f)$ , we know that that "single realization PSD" $$ \frac{\Delta t^2}{T} \left| \sum_{k=-N}^{N} x_n \exp(-2\pi i f n \Delta t) \right|^2 $$ is not a consistent estimator of the true PSD, which is defined as an expectation over this "single realization PSD" from difference sequences $\{x_k^{(j)}\}_{k=-N}^{N}$ . However, I now want to know what else is not consistently estimated. In particular, are the sample mean, variance, and skewness consistently estimated from a single realization, or do these also need to be averaged over realizations?
