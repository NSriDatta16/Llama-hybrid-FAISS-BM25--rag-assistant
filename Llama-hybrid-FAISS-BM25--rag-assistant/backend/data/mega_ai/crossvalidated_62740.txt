Many of your questions (1) are about terminology and (2) seem to presuppose that there is, or should be, a single, simple, correct answer. This attitude is especially optimistic given that use of terminology is usually problematic. Numerous different statistically minded people in overlapping communities often use the same word in different senses and different words in the same sense. Somehow we manage to communicate, but that communication is based largely on realizing that terminology can be tricky, not by identifying unique correct senses for each word. Once past student phase, we don't all go round ingesting dictionaries or learning definitions; we tend up to pick up terminology just from hearing about research (and asking questions when someone else's terms don't seem to match ours). That's a bit inefficient, and misunderstandings often arise, but the alternative of some grand committee deciding what terminology we should all be using is not really practical, or even attractive if they made recommendations that people disliked, which would be inevitable. In this case, your examples seem easier to discuss concisely than your general assertions. Is Poisson regression used for classification? That's a factual question, but requiring knowledge of many literatures to answer well. I'd say that's not impossible, but it sounds very unusual. If the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ is a Poisson distribution, is the task of predicting the value of $Y$ from the value of $X$ still classification? Given your definitions, that would be defensible use of terminology, but I'd guess that most people using Poisson regression for prediction do not think of it as classification and would regard that as very odd usage of terms. The particular case of Poisson regression is very interesting because although the raw data are often integer counts, predicted values typically won't be. Even more, a quiet revolution is slowly extending the use of Poisson regression as a very general method often suitable for non-negative response variables, so if you are presuming that Poisson automatically means a discrete response, that is not a universal assumption. Much more can be added, as your questions are concise, but reasonable answers have to be longer to take in qualifications. For example, I would not even agree that the main point of logistic regression is classification. Even with 0,1 data it is often as or more fruitful to think of logistic regression as predicting a probability. Whether the analyst wants to use that probability for predicting whether an outcome is 0 or 1 depends on the circumstances. Moreover, logistic regression extends fairly easily to continuous proportions as a response and then the question of classification may never arise.
