Saying that a function “raises faster then linear” essencialy means that its derivative increases, meaning, its second derivative is positive. The way you approximate the second derivative of a function is with a parabola. This is true for Taylor decomposition, when you want to approximate a function starting from a point evaluation of the function and its derivatives, but it works also for least squares. When fitting a straight line to your data, you are imposing a model with constant first derivative, but this can be amended adding a quadratic term, then the second derivative is constant, and you can allow it to vary adding a cubic term now, and so on. But don't worry about how that (second) derivative varies, just settle with a mean estimate, it's the best thing you can use for testing. When you consider a null model, that's the average $y$ value. When you have a linear model, the slope measures the average increment, when you include a quadratic term, that's the average second derivative. Simply test that for being positive.
