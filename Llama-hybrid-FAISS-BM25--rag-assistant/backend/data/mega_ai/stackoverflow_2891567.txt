A good class structure for cleaning and using input?

I want to be helpful to the users of a system, so I'll clean up the input a bit before testing if it can be used. So I have a flow like this: Input: aa12345b Clean input somehow: 12345 Test if clean input is valid Use input if valid Now I want to do this in a beautiful OO-fashion (IoC, interfaces, testable, no statics, you know). Any ideas how to organize a class structure for this? Is it good to have a Cleaner and a Parser/Validator class separately, or put them as methods in the data class itself? Thanks for any help or discussion about this, and extra thanks if the answer is in C#!
