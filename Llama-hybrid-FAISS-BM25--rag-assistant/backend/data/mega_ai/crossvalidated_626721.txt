Which regression model would you choose?

Which regression model would you choose to model the following flood damage data? The variables are x1=water height, x2=dike height and x3=flood damage. The following plot shows how the flood damages depend on the water height, the zcolor is the overtopping of the water (x1-x2). You can see two linear lines, in fact, if you zoom into the lower one you would find that this is not a linear relationship as it seems like from this perspective. Apparently the overtopping variable splits the dataset (below or above zero). Flood damage plotted over the dike height looks like this: and here is damage over overtopping: Due to the next worksteps I need one regressor that models the flood damages of this dataset that I can later use to do an integration to determine the annual flood damages. I would like to have the following monotone constraint fulfilled: increased water height leads to equal or higher flood damages and an increased dike height leads to equal or lower flood damages. I concluded that a linear model (or other nonlinear regressions) is not suitable as I have two lines in the first plot and no linear relationship in the second. I thought that a random forest or regression tree would be good to handle this data. I tried to setup a random forest with lightGBM to add the monotone constraints, but unfortunately did not succeed, yet. How would you model this dataset?
