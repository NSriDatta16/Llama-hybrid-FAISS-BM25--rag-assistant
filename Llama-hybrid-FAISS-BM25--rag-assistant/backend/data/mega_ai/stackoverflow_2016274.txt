If your adversary has the ability to run arbitrary code on your target machine (with the debug privileges required to dump a process image), you are all sorts of screwed. If your adversary has the ability to read memory at a distance accurately (ie. TEMPEST ), you are all sorts of screwed. Protect the data in transit and in storage (on the wire and on the disk), but don't worry* about data in memory. *Ok, there are classes of programs that DO need to worry. 99.99% of all applications don't, I'm betting yours doesn't.
