In my view in working with neural networks the key is getting the training set right not so much how the network itself is actualised in code. I would choose a language based on the type of problem you are trying to solve using the network. For the network itself c++, c#, python and java are all viable. Are you using this in connection with a problem requiring image processing? In which case you will probably want something that hooks up to an image processing library like OpenCV easily. Or is there some audio processing involved? You may need to easily visualise the training sets so how easy would this be with the language of choice? Can you work with either OpenGL or DirectX libraries either directly or using a wrapper of some kind? For DirectX the choices are C++ and C#. Will a higher level of abstraction say using WPF work? I have used C# because I am familiar with it and can leverage the numerous data handling technologies in .net and use wpf for any visualisations needed.
