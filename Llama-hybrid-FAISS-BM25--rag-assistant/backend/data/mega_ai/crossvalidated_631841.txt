An elementary argument solves this without relying on heavy theory... The fact that each person has $12 is something of a red herring. Imagine that each person has 12 children; they hand out a dollar coin to each child. The children then bet, so that you (the tournament organiser) see 24 bets of 1 dollar each. You hand out rewards to the children who choose the correct month. The parents then gather up their children's winnings. It would be bizarre if your payouts to the children depended on who their parent was. Indeed, intuitively speaking, you should not have access to that information. From your perspective, all you see is that 24 people bet $1 each and you need to pay each of them fairly. So in the case you describe, 13 people correctly bet $1 on October. By symmetry, the only fair way to reward them is to split the reward pool between them, so that each receives $24 / 13. A will then receive 12x that quantity, and B will receive 1x that quantity.
