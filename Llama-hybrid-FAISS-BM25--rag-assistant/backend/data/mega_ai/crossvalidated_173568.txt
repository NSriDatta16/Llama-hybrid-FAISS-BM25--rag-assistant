Logistic Regression in R and How to deal with 0 and 1

In helping us understand how to fit a logistic regression in R , we are told to first replace 0 and 1 in the response variable by 0.05 and 0.95, respectively and second to take the logit transform of the resulting response variable. Last we fit these data using iterative re-weighted least squares method. Then we are asked to use 0.005 and 0.995 instead of 0.05 and 0.95. Then the resulting coefficients are quite different . My question is in glm function, how are 0 and 1 dealt with? Are they replaced by some numbers as above? What numbers are used by default and why are they used? How sensitive is the choice of these numbers?
