When is it incorrect to compute factor scores by summing (or averaging) raw variable scores?

I understand that a problem will be inevitable if the variables have different scales of measurement. My inclination is to think that even if the variables have the same scale of measurement it would be incorrect to simply sum (or to simply average) the raw scores of the variables that are "enough loaded" by the factor, since doing so would weight each variable equally, while in fact the factor loads some of those variables more and some of them less. Is my reasoning correct? Are there any other circumstances in which it is incorrect to compute factor scores just by summing (or averaging) the raw scores of the factor's variables? The factor scores are being computed with a view to them being used as predictors in a subsequent regression analysis.
