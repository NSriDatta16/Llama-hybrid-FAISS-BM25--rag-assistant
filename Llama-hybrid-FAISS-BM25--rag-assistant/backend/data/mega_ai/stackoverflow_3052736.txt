I think the best way would be to restrict user input as much as possible, so that they may only enter valid data. Have the user separate the data in tokens for you, instead of you trying to account for every single possibility. Use as many textboxes/drop downs/etc as necessary to force the user to populate the data correctly. I think it would be desirable to minimize the amount & variations of text parsing you will be doing. What format do the users get their data in? If it is just a decimal lat/long e.g(50.32,123.55) then just simply have two numerical inputs they can fill out, and possibly include an example value in the box. If the users get their data in degree/minute/second format then have exactly these fields that they need to fill out for each latitude and longitude. If you allow for both decimal & degree representations it should cover all your users. Have as many inputs as needed to break down the data in enough tokens that ensures consistency when interpreting it in your program! EDIT: A funky idea if you find it acceptable for your site would be to have a Google Map where the user drags a marker to their desired location. You can then get the GPS coordinates in a consistent manner from that marker, and use that for whatever further work you need to do!
