You could give this a whirl: SELECT device.mac, reseller.name, agent.name FROM device JOIN ( SELECT global_user_id FROM reseller WHERE id = '200' UNION SELECT global_user_id FROM agent WHERE reseller_id = '200' ) r ON device.global_user_id = r.global_user_id LEFT JOIN global_user ON device.global_user_id = global_user.id LEFT JOIN agent ON global_user.id = agent.global_user_id LEFT JOIN reseller ON global_user.id = reseller.global_user_id OR agent.reseller_id = reseller.id Clarification: Always a good idea to try out different variations of a query to make sure you end up with the best performing query (although often, different variations result in the same execution plan being generated by the query optimiser). Speaking from SQL Server point of view, the order in which the query is processed in means the JOINs are processed first before the WHERE clause. So in theory, this JOIN approach should scale the resultset down earlier.
