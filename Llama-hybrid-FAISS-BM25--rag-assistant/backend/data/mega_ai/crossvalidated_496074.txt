How to test if a process is poisson, if there are a lot of zeros

I have foot traffic data for how many people entered a building for every hour, for several days. This SOUNDS like it should follow a poisson process. Problem: I need to statistically confirm that my process is poisson, so that I can estimate utilization by looking at lambda (average arrival rate in time t ) divided by service rate, mu . Data Issue/Nuance: The data is fairly sparse so there are a lot of zeros. What I have: I have the average number of arrivals per hour, i.e. lambda I also have the inter-arrival time, and average inter-arrival time. Where I'm stuck: I'm not sure how to go from what I have now, to confirm this process is poisson. I read in one article to do a chi-square, goodness of fit test of my inter-arrival times, and compare that with sampling from an exponential distribution with my lambda as the parameter. Especially given that my data has a lot of zeros I'm not really sure how to adapt. Trying to do this in either Python or R Any help is appreciated
