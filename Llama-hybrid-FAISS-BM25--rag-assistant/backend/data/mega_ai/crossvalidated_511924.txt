Analysis approach: time-series or multiple models?

I have data which (I think) does not warrant a time series analysis, but I am note sure whether my alternative analysis approach is acceptable: The data consists of a numerical and a categorical predictor at time-point 0 and a predictand at time-point 0, 1, and 2. I want to test whether there is a relation (especially an interaction between the predictors) for the development of the predictand (predicted decline over time). In a time series model this would generally look like this $$y_t=X_t β + u_t$$ but in my case like this $$y_t=X_0 β + u_t$$ My alternative approach would be to have three separate models, one for each time-point and somehow compare them. However, this does not feel right to me. Any comments or suggestions on how to approach this analysis? Edit: Data example: mydata cond is factorial, x and y are numerical. 1 Case per condition just as example, in reality, I have 3 conditions with ~70-80 cases each. P.S. It would be nice to use something that would be able to handle missing data in $y_t$
