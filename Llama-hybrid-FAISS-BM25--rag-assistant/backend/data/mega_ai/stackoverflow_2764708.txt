As I don't see an anwer, I'll post what I found, which is not very encouraging. All references to ServiceHostFactory point to the svc file and the Factory attribute, which is not what you are looking for. This thread on MSDN even tells that it is not possible to do what you are trying to achieve. Sorry...
