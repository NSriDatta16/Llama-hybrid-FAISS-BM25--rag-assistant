How should I use TransE for the knowledge graph embedding?

I'm trying to get the node embeddings in the knowledge graph using TransE. But there are some confusing concepts for node embedding using TransE. I found the general TransE code, and it contained a dataset split for training and testing. But when I need to get the embedding vectors for the overall nodes in the knowledge graph, should I not split them into training/test datasets? How can I obtain the embedding vectors for 'all' nodes in the knowledge graph for the downstream tasks?
