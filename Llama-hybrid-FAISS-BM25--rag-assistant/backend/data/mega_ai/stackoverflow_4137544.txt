Web Mining Via Search Engines

I was apartment-shopping via Google Maps, copying various listings into a spreadsheet so I could more easily compare and attach notes, when I realized how unnecessarily repetitive and inefficient this was. I could easily write a script to automatically query Google and extract the data I need, but to get some of the data (e.g. contact phone number) requires that I follow a link to a listing-specific site and hunt-around for the data, and I've never written a web-crawler that dynamic. What are the common data-mining and/or machine learning techniques and tools for extracting a "best-guess" for a piece of info given arbitrary HTML?
