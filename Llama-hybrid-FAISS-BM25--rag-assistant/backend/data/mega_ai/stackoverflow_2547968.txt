In PostgreSQL you can't. Data is stored in blocks (normaly 8kb each) and you have no idea in what block the records with "organisation_id=1" are stored. When all records are in one block, it's 8kb. When 100 records are stored in 100 blocks, it's 800kb, but that includes other records as well. You could do some magic with the hidden column "ctid", but that's a lot of work, not accurate and not very usefull as well. Just use pg_relation_size() to get the entire table, that's what you need. If you need the TOAST-table includes, use pg_total_relation_size().
