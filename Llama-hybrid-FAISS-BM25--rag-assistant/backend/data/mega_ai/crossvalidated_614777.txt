Do we need preprocessing before applying a sophisticated undersampling method?

My question is around applying undersampling methods to an imbalanced, and highly dimensional dataset, with mixed data. Lets say as an example, I have 150 features, also a highly imbalanced binary target variable. I want to apply a sophisticated undersampling method, not random undersampling. Lets say something like OSS, Tomek, CNN from Imblearn. I have 2 questions for applying undersampling to this dataset: 1-) Do I need to run PCA to reduce number of 150 features before undersampling? 2-) Do I need preprocessing? Like scaling to numerical features and one-hot encoding to categorical ones etc? Thanks
