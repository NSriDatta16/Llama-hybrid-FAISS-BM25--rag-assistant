Storage of Unicode Characters in MySql and Oracle

Scenario: A database in MySql and Oracle. Both have same table and same columns. In one of the table I have a Column, 'FullName'. Oracle Datatype used is VarChar2(64). MySql Datatype used is VarChar(64). To Support Unicode Character UTF 8 is used as the default character set. I'm getting a error in Oracle, which says "value too large for column", where as in MySql it works fine. I would like to know, what's the difference between these two dbases? Note: For japanese Character in UTF 8 encoding take 3 bytes. Thanks in Advance. Pavan
