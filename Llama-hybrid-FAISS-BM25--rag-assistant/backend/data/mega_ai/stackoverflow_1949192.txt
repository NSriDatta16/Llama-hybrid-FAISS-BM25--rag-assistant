This is extremely fragile and should be avoided, but you could match the string literals. Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\"((?:[^\"]+|\\\\\")*)\""); String test = "[\"String 1\",\"String, two\"]"; Matcher m = p.matcher(test); ArrayList embeddedStrings = new ArrayList (); while (m.find()) { embeddedStrings.add(m.group(1)); } The regular expression assumes that double quotes in the input are escaped using \" and not "" . The pattern would break if the input had an odd number of (unescaped) double quotes.
