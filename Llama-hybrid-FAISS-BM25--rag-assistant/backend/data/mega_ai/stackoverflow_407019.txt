My one: Long switch statements are your friends. Really. At least in C#. People tend to avoid and discourage others to use long switch statements beause they are "unmanagable" and "have bad performance characteristics". Well, the thing is that in C#, switch statements are always compiled automagically to hash jump tables so actually using them is the Best Thing To Doâ„¢ in terms of performance if you need simple branching to multiple branches. Also, if the case statements are organized and grouped intelligently (for example in alphabetical order), they are not unmanageable at all.
