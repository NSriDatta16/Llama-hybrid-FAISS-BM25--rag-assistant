What is a data scientist?

Having recently graduated from my PhD program in statistics, I had for the last couple of months began searching for work in the field of statistics. Almost every company I considered had a job posting with a job title of " Data Scientist ". In fact, it felt like long gone were the days of seeing job titles of Statistical Scientist or Statistician . Had being a data scientist really replaced what being a statistician was or were the titles synonymous I wondered? Well, most of the qualifications for the jobs felt like things that would qualify under the title of statistician. Most jobs wanted a PhD in statistics ($\checkmark$), most required understanding experimental design ($\checkmark$), linear regression and anova ($\checkmark$), generalized linear models ($\checkmark$), and other multivariate methods such as PCA ($\checkmark$), as well as knowledge in a statistical computing environment such as R or SAS ($\checkmark$). Sounds like a data scientist is really just a code name for statistician. However, every interview I went to started with the question: "So are you familiar with machine learning algorithms?" More often than not, I found myself having to try and answer questions about big data, high performance computing, and topics on neural networks, CART, support vector machines, boosting trees, unsupervised models, etc. Sure I convinced myself that these were all statistical questions at heart, but at the end of every interview I couldn't help but leave feeling like I knew less and less about what a data scientist is. I am a statistician, but am I a data scientist? I work on scientific problems so I must be a scientist! And also I work with data, so I must be a data scientist! And according to Wikipedia, most academics would agree with me ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science , etc. ) Although use of the term "data science" has exploded in business environments, many academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and statistics. But if I am going on all these job interviews for a data scientist position, why does it feel like they are never asking me statistical questions? Well after my last interview I did want any good scientist would do and I sought out data to solve this problem (hey, I am a data scientist after all). However, after many countless Google searches later, I ended up right where I started feeling as if I was once again grappling with the definition of what a data scientist was. I didn't know what a data scientist was exactly since there was so many definitions of it, ( http://blog.udacity.com/2014/11/data-science-job-skills.html , http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/data-scientist/ ) but it seemed like everyone was telling me I wanted to be one: https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/ http://mashable.com/2014/12/25/data-scientist/#jjgsyhcERZqL etc....the list goes on. Well at the end of the day, what I figured out was "what is a data scientist" is a very hard question to answer. Heck, there were two entire months in Amstat where they devoted time to trying to answer this question: http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/ http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/11/01/statnews2015/ Well for now, I have to be a sexy statistician to be a data scientist but hopefully the cross validated community might be able to shed some light and help me understand what it means to be a data scientist. Aren't all statisticians data scientists? (Edit/Update) I thought this might spice up the conversation. I just received an email from the American Statistical Association about a job positing with Microsoft looking for a Data Scientist. Here is the link: Data Scientist Position . I think this is interesting because the role of the position hits on a lot of specific traits we have been talking about, but I think lots of them require a very rigorous background in statistics, as well as contradicting many of the answers posted below. In case the link goes dead, here are the qualities Microsoft seeks in a data scientist: Core Job Requirements and Skills: Business Domain Experience using Analytics Must have experience across several relevant business domains in the utilization of critical thinking skills to conceptualize complex business problems and their solutions using advanced analytics in large scale real-world business data sets The candidate must be able to independently run analytic projects and help our internal clients understand the findings and translate them into action to benefit their business. Predictive Modeling Experience across industries in predictive modeling Business problem definition and conceptual modeling with the client to elicit important relationships and to define the system scope Statistics/Econometrics Exploratory data analytics for continuous and categorical data Specification and estimation of structural model equations for enterprise and consumer behavior, production cost, factor demand, discrete choice, and other technology relationships as needed Advanced statistical techniques to analyze continuous and categorical data Time series analysis and implementation of forecasting models Knowledge and experience in working with multiple variables problems Ability to assess model correctness and conduct diagnostic tests Capability to interpret statistics or economic models Knowledge and experience in building discrete event simulation, and dynamic simulation models Data Management Familiarity with use of T-SQL and analytics for data transformation and the application of exploratory data analysis techniques for very large real-world data sets Attention to data integrity including data redundancy, data accuracy, abnormal or extreme values, data interactions and missing values. Communication and Collaboration Skills Work independently and able to work with a virtual project team that will research innovative solutions to challenging business problems Collaborate with partners, apply critical thinking skills, and drive analytic projects end-to-end Superior communication skills, both verbal and written Visualization of analytic results in a form that is consumable by a diverse set of stakeholders Software Packages Advanced Statistical/Econometric software packages: Python, R, JMP, SAS, Eviews, SAS Enterprise Miner Data exploration, visualization, and management: T-SQL, Excel, PowerBI, and equivalent tools Qualifications: Minimum 5+ years of related experience required Post graduate degree in quantitative field is desirable.
