How to show that any Gaussian time-series is linear one?

In this paper I saw the following statement: If the time series is Gaussian (i.e., normally distributed) then the best linear forecast is in fact the best of all possible forecasts: No nonlinear forecast can do better in terms of mean squared prediction error. Thus, as long as the series is Gaussian, we need look no further than the linear methods (e.g., ARMA forecasting) already presented. I think it is a very strong, general and interesting statement. Is it easy to prove, that a time-series whose values are normally distributed are given ("generated") by a linear model? Or, alternatively, any nonlinear time-series should have a non Gaussian distribution of values.
