What are some useful data augmentation techniques for deep convolutional neural networks?

Background: I recently understood on a deeper level the importance of data augmentation when training convolutional neural networks after seeing this excellent talk by Geoffrey Hinton . He explains that current generation convolutional neural networks are not able to generalize the frame of reference of the object under test, making it hard for a network to truly understand that mirrored images of an object are the same. Some research has gone into trying to remedy this. Here is one of the many many examples . I think this helps to establish how critical data augmentation is today when training convolutional neural networks. Data augmentation techniques are rarely benchmarked against each other. Hence: Questions: What are some papers where the practitioners reported exceptionally better performance? What are some data augmentation techniques that you have found useful?
