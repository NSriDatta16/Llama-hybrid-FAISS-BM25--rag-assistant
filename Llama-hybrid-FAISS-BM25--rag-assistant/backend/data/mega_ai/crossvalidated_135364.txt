Stata Margins tool

How does Stata create their margins dy/dx output? I would like to recreate some Stata output in SAS. The results of a logistic regression give a coefficient of 1.4921 for my dummy variable, and an odds ratio of 4.447 (or the exponentiation of 1.4921). Stata has a margins dy/dx tool that gives a value of 0.1309 for this variable. I interpret this to mean there is a 13.9% difference between the probability of each outcome for this 0 1 indicator. How can I generate this 13.9% difference outside of Stata?
