Incoherent time series in gretl

This is my first research using Gretl. I have a panel of 197 people for 66 months stacked as time series. One person has values for the months of January, February, Mars, April, November, December. For the summer months of May, June, July, August, October and September there is no data available. so my data goes from 2005-11 to 2016-04 with 6 months missing every year. It is not surprising, that Gretl does not recognize, that the summer months are missing. It strings the data together and recognizes my data from 2005-11 to 2011-04. Does any of you have an idea how to solve that problem and make Gretl realize i only have 6 months per year? My first idea was to include missing values for the summer months. Is this possible in Gretl or do I need to do it in Excel? I already checked in the manual and various internet plattforms, but could not find a solution. So I am greatfull for any suggestion. Kind regards, x739Green
