Subversion: good practices to administrate users and groups with the repositories

How should I administrate users and groups with the repositories? Until now users can access the server repositories through http. The tag configuration it inside /etc/apache2/mods-available/dav_svn.conf DAV svn SVNPath /srv/svn/projecX #SVNParentPath /srv/svn #if I have more the one repository inside the folder AuthType Basic AuthName ”ProjectX” AuthUserFile /etc/subversion/passwd Require valid-user My doubts: For each repository should I have a passwd file containing all users and pass? When is more appropriated to use SVNPath or SVNParentPath ? How do I manage groups? Until know I know how to work with individuals but not with groups in a more optimized way. (EDIT) Users and Group repositories control should be always made through apache2 ? I'm using Ubuntu server edition for the server repositories. Thanks for the attention3.
