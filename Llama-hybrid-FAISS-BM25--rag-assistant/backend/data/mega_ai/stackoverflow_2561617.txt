filter that uses elements from two arrays at the same time

Let's assume we have two arrays of the same size - A and B . Now, we need a filter that, for a given mask size, selects elements from A , but removes the central element of the mask, and inserts there corresponding element from B . So the 3x3 "pseudo mask" will look similar to this: A A A A B A A A A Doing something like this for averaging filter is quite simple. We can compute the mean value for elements from A without the central element, and then combine it with a proper proportion with elements from B: h = ones(3,3); h(2,2) =0; h = h/sum(h(:)); A_ave = filter2(h, A); C = (8/9) * A_ave + (1/9) * B; But how to do something similar for median filter ( medfilt2 or even better for ordfilt2 )
