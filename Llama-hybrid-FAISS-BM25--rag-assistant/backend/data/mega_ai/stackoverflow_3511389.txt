@Laurențiu Dascălu's answer explains how / why you get a ClassCastException. Your exception message looks rather suspicious to me, but it might help you to know that "[Lcom.rsa.authagent.authapi.realmstat.AUTHw" means that the actual type of the object that you were trying to cast was com.rsa.authagent.authapi.realmstat.AUTHw[] ; i.e. it was an array object. Normally, the next steps to solving a problem like this are: examining the stacktrace to figure out which line of which class threw the exception, examining the corresponding source code, to see what the expected type, and tracing back to see where the object with the "wrong" type came from.
