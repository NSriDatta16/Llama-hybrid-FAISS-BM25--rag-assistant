Comparing two distributions with different biased sampling criteria

Suppose you are running an experiment with two conditions, A and B . At the beginning of the experiment, both populations are the same, and of equal size. After a (teaching) intervention, both groups receive a post-test. Then the students that succeed on the post-test come back later and do a review, (the reviews are identical), which they either pass or fail. The post test and the review are similar, so a student might fail the post test but would have passed the review if they had seen it - perhaps they slipped up, perhaps they learned in the intervening time. However, if they miss the post-test they won't get a chance for review. Now, suppose that condition A people pass the post-test more often, without necessarily learning more long-term (maybe they did, maybe they didn't). Now more participants from condition A will be doing the review. However, on average, they'll perform worse because it was easier to pass the post-test in condition A . So the absolute number of people to pass review in condition A is higher than in condition B , but the relative increase in people passing is lower than the relative increase in people failing. For instance, let's say the numbers are: $$\begin{array}{c|cc}&{\rm Group\ A}&{\rm Group\ B}\\\hline {\rm To\ begin}&{\rm 100\ people}&{\rm 100\ people}\\ \text{Passing post-test}&{\rm 60\ people}&{\rm 40\ people}\\ {\rm Passing\ review}&{\rm 40\ people}&{\rm 30\ people}\end{array}$$ How can I tell what intervention was more effective at teaching, if 75% of the people I sample from condition B pass, but only 60% of the people from condition A , when there was also a sampling bias causing the condition B people to be higher caliber? It's worth noting that I have hundreds of thousands of samples, and additional demographic information about the samples.
