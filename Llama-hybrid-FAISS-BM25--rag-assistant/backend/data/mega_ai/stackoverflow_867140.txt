Drag a WPF Form around the desktop

i am trying to make a c# WPF form where i can drag it around the screen by clicking on it and moving with the mouse. the forms characteristics include being completely transparent and containing only one image. This being said the window style is none and it is not displayed in the taskbar. So essentially all you can see when the app is running is a little image - and ideally i want to be able to drag it around the desktop if i click and hold the left mouse button and move it about. Does anyone know a simple way i can accomplish this or have i overlooked a build in function? Thanks.
