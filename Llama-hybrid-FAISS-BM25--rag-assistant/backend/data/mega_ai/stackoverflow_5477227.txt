Unfortunately it looks like that version 0.9.8 of libpcap doesn't support these functions. Versions >= 1.0.0 contains them. So right now you have 2 possibilities. Compile newer version of libpcap by modification Android.mk for old version a little to include new files. Or downgrade jnetpcap to version that support old libpcap. Libpcap 0.9.8 if from 2007 so you should choose jnetpcap from around this year as well.
