How do I apply a stylesheet just to the iPhone (and not IE), without browser sniffing?

I’d like to apply a stylesheet exclusively to the iPhone, without doing browser sniffing (via the user-agent string) on the server or via JavaScript. I particularly don’t want Internet Explorer to apply the stylesheet. Apple’s suggested code for applying an iPhone-specific stylesheet, i.e.: seems to cause the stylesheet to be applied by IE 7 and 6.
