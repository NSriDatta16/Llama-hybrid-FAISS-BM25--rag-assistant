Images on Buttons

I have a app that has multiple buttons that are all assigned images in the interface builder. I then change there images during the application. What i want to know how would you is to change the images back to the original image....I did it by the following code but it keeps crashing the app - (IBAction)resetCards { NSString *cardImage = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"CardBackground.png"]; UIImage *buttonImage = [UIImage imageNamed:cardImage]; [holdCardOne setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [holdCardTwo setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [flopCardOne setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [flopCardTwo setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [flopCardThree setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [turnCard setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [riverCard setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [cardImage release]; [buttonImage release]; }
