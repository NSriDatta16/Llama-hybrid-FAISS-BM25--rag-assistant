I found this question while searching in Google and looking for a way to remove unused "Using" statements from my code. Refactor is great, but it isn't available to me. However, as it turns out Visual Studio 2008 does this on its own. Here are the steps: Load the code in Visual Studio. Right-click anywhere on the code page. Click "Organize Usings" from the menu. Click "Remove Unused Usings" Done. I realize this doesn't answer the original question (doing this en masse for an entire project) but it does answer my question.
