You won't solve multicolinearity that way, it is just a linear transformation. However, you do improve the interpretation of the main effect of sex. Without centering it will be the effect of sex for someone without a brain (brainsize=0), which is not really useful. If you center your brainsize variable you will get the effect of sex for someone with an average size brain.
