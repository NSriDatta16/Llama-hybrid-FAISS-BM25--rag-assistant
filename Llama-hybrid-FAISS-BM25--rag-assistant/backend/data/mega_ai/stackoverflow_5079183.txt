TreeView fires DragEnter, DragOver and DragLeave events, but won't fire DragDrop

Hail Stack! I'm having a hard time trying to figure out why my treeview (or any other component, even the form itself) won't fire the event DragDrop. I've settled my form like this: A Form with a Panel inside. The Panel have a TreeView , and this TreeView ( MyTree ) has the following code: MyTree.AllowDrop = true; MyTree.DragDrop += new System.Windows.Forms.DragEventHandler(onDragDrop); MyTree.DragEnter += new System.Windows.Forms.DragEventHandler(onDragEnter); MyTree.DragLeave += new System.EventHandler(onDragLeave); MyTree.DragOver += new System.Windows.Forms.DragEventHandler(onDragOver); The handlers looks like this: private void onDragEnter(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(" === DragEnter === "); } private void onDragLeave(object sender, EventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(" === DragLeave === "); } private void onDragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(" === DragOver === "); } private void onDragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(" === DragDrop === "); } When I test my app, dragging a *.txt file (or anything) the output are something like: === DragEnter === === DragOver === === DragOver === ... === DragOver === === DragLeave === The last line ( === DragLeave === ) wasn't meant to be a leave event. In fact, this line is printed when I release the mouse button over my TreeView. I'm I doing something terribly wrong?
