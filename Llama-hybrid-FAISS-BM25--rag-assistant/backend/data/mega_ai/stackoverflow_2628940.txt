Does Google Maps API v3 allow larger zoom values?

If you use the satellite GMapType using this Google-provided example in v3 of the API, the maximum zoom level has a scale of 2m / 10ft , whereas using the v2 version of another Google-provided example (had to use another one since the control-simple doesn't have the scale control) yields the maximum scale of 20m / 50ft. Is this a new "feature" of v3 ? I have to mention that I've tested the examples in the same GLatLng regions - so my guess is that tile detail level doesn't influence it, am I mistaken ? As mentioned in another question , v3 is to be considered of very Labs-y/beta quality, so use in production should be discouraged for the time being. I've been drawn to the subject since I have to "increase the zoom level of a GMap", the answers here seem to suggest using GTileLayer, and I'm considering GMapCreator , although this will involve some effort. What I'm trying to achieve is to have a larger zoom level, a scale of 2m / 10ft would be perfect, I have a map where the tiles aren't that hi-res and quite a few markers. Seeing that the area doesn't have hi-res tiles, the distance between the markers is really tiny, creating some problematic overlapping. Or better yet, how can you create a custom Map which allows higher zoom levels, as by the Google Campus, where the 2m / 10ft scale is achieved, and not use your own tileserver ? I've seen an example on a fellow Stackoverflower's GMaps sandbox , where the tiles are manually created based on the zoom level. I have seen the codebase for a custom Map on mapki , but this involves having a tileserver, can't you just use Google's tiles for a specific zoom level and then swap some of them (depending on tile.x and tile.y) with custom tiles, when the zoom level is higher than 19 ? I don't think I'm making any more sense, so I'm just going to end this big question here, I've been wondering around trying to find a solution for hours now. Hope that someone comes to my aid though ! Thank you in advance !
