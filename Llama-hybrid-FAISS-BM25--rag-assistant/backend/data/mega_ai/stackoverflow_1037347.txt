Does ASP.NET MVC Has Anything Equivalent To WPF's DataTemplate Feature?

In my ASP.NET MVC project, I have a polymorphic collection that I wish to render - say, an IEnumerable where the individual items may be a mix of different implementations of ISomething . I'd like that list rendered, where each concrete type renders according to its own template (perhaps a strongly typed ViewUserControl). In WPF, I'd be able to specify DataTemplates that would automatically bind concrete types to specific templates. Can I do something similar in ASP.NET MVC? Obviously, I can iterate through the list and attempt a cast using the is keyword and then use a lot of if statements to render the desired control, but I was hoping for something more elegant (like WPF).
