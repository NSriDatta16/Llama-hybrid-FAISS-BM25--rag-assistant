the parameter values just simply dependent on the data This is the key part of your question. This is where you are confused. Yes, the parameter values depend on the data. But the data are fixed when we fit a model. In other words, we fit a model conditional on the observations . It does not make sense to compare the complexity of different models that were fitted to different datasets . And in the context of a fixed dataset, a model $$ 2 + 5x + x^3$$ is indeed closer to the simplest possible model, namely the flat zero model, than $$ 433+ 342x + 323x^3,$$ and this holds regardless of the scale of your observations. Incidentally, the intercept ( $2$ and $433$ in your example) is frequently not penalized, e.g., in most Lasso formulations, because we are usually good with letting it vary freely to capture the overall average of the observations. In other words, we shrink the model towards the average of the observations, not a complete zero model (where the zero would often be arbitrary). In this sense, a flat $2$ and a flat $433$ model would be considered equally complex.
