How do I handle two assemblies with the same filename during a TFS 2010 RC build?

I am following the CSLA.NET for Silverlight pattern of using the same filename for the business objects assemblies. For example: CSLA.dll // .NET assembly MyProject.Entities.dll // .NET assembly CSLA.dll // Silverlight assembly MyProject.Entities.dll // Silverlight assembly This is done so you can use a single code file in the .NET project, "file link" it to the Silverlight project and have both assemblies use the same code (compiling out the .NET and Silverlight functionally as needed). The reason for the same Assembly file names is so that WCF serialization bindings just automatically work. The issue I am having is that my build server seems to be putting both assemblies in the same output directory (the Binaries folder on the build server) and using that directory for resolving project references, but it is getting the wrong file (the Silverlight one instead of the .NET one). Does anyone know how to deal with this situation? EDIT: I am running TFS 2010 Beta2, VS 2010 RC1, Build Agent 2010 RC1
