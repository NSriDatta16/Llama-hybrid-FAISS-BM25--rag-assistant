Predict only the first N principal components in a PCA analysis

I'm using R to analyze a very large dataset. I conduct a PCA on one dataset, PCA and then want to apply the PCA on another dataset, test_rot This works however it is fairly memory intensive and I'm really only interested in the first N principal components (say: 50). Is there a way to only predict the first 50 PCs in that second line of code?
