First, I am guessing from your question that you are a surgeon or other doctor doing some research. How would you respond to someone asking something like "My knowledge of surgery is minimal, so any help would be appreciated. How do I operate on the heart?" So, my first suggestion to you is to hire a statistician/data analyst. Now, if you ignore that advice, either because of cost or some other reason, I'll say this: You have asked about surgical complications and length of hospital stay. Then you asked about categorical dependent variables (yes/no) and continuous dependent variables. Unfortunately, the first two don't fit well into the latter two: For surgical complication you probably want (at least to start) a multinomial logistic regression. For the second, you probably want some kind of survival analysis (although this will depend on other characteristics of your study). For yes/no DVs you usually want logistic regression. For continuous DVs the usual start is linear regression.
