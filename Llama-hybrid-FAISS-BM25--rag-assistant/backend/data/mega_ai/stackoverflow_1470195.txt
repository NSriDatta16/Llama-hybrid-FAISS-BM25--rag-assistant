Dragging items from my C# app into Outlook 2003/2007?

In Outlook 2003/2007 you can drag files from Explorer into its main window and message editing windows to attach a file. But how can I use my own C# app in place of Explorer to do this? Do I need to extend Outlook (by hooking into COM events or otherwise), or does my C# app need to do something special in its drag/drop event handlers?
