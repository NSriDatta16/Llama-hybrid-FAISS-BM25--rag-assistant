As you know, the denominator takes care of the normalizing constants. It is an integral that is usually not possible to calculate analytically. In the fraction above, it cancels as it does not depend on the parameter $\theta$ . Say you draw your proposal $\theta_{proposal}$ from a proposal density $q$ . Since $q$ is different from the posterior you want to infer via MCMC, you cannot accept $\theta_{proposal}$ in each iteration, but only with some acceptance probability that is captured by the ratio of the posterior, evaluated at the current state $\theta_{current}$ and the proposal $\theta_{proposal}$ . This is the fraction above. The underlying idea is that $\theta_{proposal}$ should be accepted with higher probability when the corresponding value of the (unnormalized) posterior is higher than the corresponding value of the (unnormalized) posterior at $\theta_{current}$ . Regarding your 2nd question below: you need a normalized posterior, because you need a posterior distribution . Otherwise you cannot draw inferential statements.
