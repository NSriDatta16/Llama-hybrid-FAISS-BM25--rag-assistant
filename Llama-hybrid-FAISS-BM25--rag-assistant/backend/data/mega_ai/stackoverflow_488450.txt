How does IE7's "View Source" button interact with javascript?

I'm debugging someone else's code for a web page that is made with ASP.NET with some javascript effects. It's a form that we are pre-populating with edit-able data, and one of the text boxes is getting populated with an incorrect value. I know that the text box is getting filled with the correct value in the code behind, but somewhere between there and the browser it gets overwritten. In trying to find out where that happened, I came across an interesting situation. If I right-click near the offending element and select "view page source," I can scroll down to the element and see But the wrong value is in both the rendered html and the IE developer toolbar. This seems like a hell of a clue, but I don't know enough about how "View Source" works to tell what is going on behind the curtain. What happens between the generation of the "View Source" source and the page actually rendering? EDIT: I found where it was going wrong by putting a break-point on everywhere that ID occurs in javascript (not exactly elegant, but I found it). Suggestions to disable javascript and use IE8 were very helpful. thanks.
