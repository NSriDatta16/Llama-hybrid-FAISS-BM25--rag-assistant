Conditional entropy for Markov chain

Say you have a Markov chain $X \to Y \to Z$, and you want to compute $H(Z | X)$. Other quantities, such as $H(Z)$, $H(Y)$, $H(Z | Y)$ and $H(Y | X)$, are relatively straight-forward to compute. Is there any way to get $H(Z | X)$ from these quantities? Thanks :-)
