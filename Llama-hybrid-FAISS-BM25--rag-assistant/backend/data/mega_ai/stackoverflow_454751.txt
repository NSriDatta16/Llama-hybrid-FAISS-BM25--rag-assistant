Polling database for updates from C# application

I'm attempting to create my first "real" C# application - a small pet project to help schedule peer reviews at work. Due to the insane amount of process/bureaucracy involved in implementing anything new - as well as the fact that I'm doing this away from managements eyes, on my own time, for the time being - I'm going to be writing this with an MS Access MS Jet Engine backend (i.e. an access mdb file) due to restrictions on how I can deploy this application to my co-workers. My question is: how do I poll the database intermittently to grab updates (new requested reviews, messages from other developers requesting info, etc.) from the database? Should I just drop a Timer on each form that needs the info and refresh everything when an update has occurred? Edit: I'm looking for advice specifically on how to implement the timer. I can't install things on workstations, I don't have access to servers (outside of storage space), and I can't host this myself due to the company's security requirements since our client has ridiculous DoD restrictions. I guess I've figured this out anyway, since the "timer on form" solution works just fine (I don't know what I was thinking when I said I wanted a secondary solution for a CLI version as it clearly isn't needed.. it's very late). Thanks!
