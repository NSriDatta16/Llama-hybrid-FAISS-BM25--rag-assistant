This question sounds very philosophical to me. The skepticist or logical positivist thought herein would be that the attempts to obtain truths via inference are meaningless. The "solution" is not that we figure out some way how truth works, but that we accept that we can not know it via the paths that are currently available to us. Statistics, like Bayesion posteriors, are not methods to obtain true knowledge. Instead they are pragmatic approaches for humans to optimize their believes and behaviour. We can not know the truth but we do know that following the logic of statistics will optimise our average output. From this perspective the Bayesian approach of computing posterior distributions is ignorant towards the idea that a particular observation is an anomaly. The concept of an anomaly does not exist in the Bayesion framework. The point is to figure out the most likely solution within the model that we have at hand. As long as the model works then we will be happy. When our Bayesion model happens to perform badly, and we get time after time unexpected and bad results, then we may scratch our head and wonder whether our models are correct and try to come up with alternative models, but that is a different process. Then, the question How much does an inability to predict an apparent anomaly mean that we lack something in the feature space to distinguish it from business as usual? becomes "solved" by the statement that it is not a question that can be answered as it is not quantifiable. Trying to quantify the 'how much' can not be done. All we have is the ongoing process of research that is comparing current believes and performing Bayesian updating, and research that is figuring out ways that can makr predictions more accurate and anomalies explained with higher accuracy.
