How to recognize versions of objects placed in isolated storage using .NET runtime serialization?

We are building application that stores objects to isolated storage using .NET runtime serialization. Problems occur when we update application by adding some new properties to the classes of objects we are serializing. So we want to do some kind of versioning of the objects in isolated storage so we can check if they are obsolete before they are deserialized. Any advice and ideas how to do this on best possible way? What do you think about custom formatter implementing IFormatter interface and can it help instead of vesioning objects? I wrote about this issue on MS forum more detailed here .
