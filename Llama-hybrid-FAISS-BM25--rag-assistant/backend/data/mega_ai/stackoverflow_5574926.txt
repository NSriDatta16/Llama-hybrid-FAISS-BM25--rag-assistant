Servlet.staticMethod used to initialize Spring reference data?

I'm working on developing new Spring web applications, on a team that's developed a ton of web apps around Vanilla HttpServlet's. I'm new to Spring ( please don't run! ) and I'm doing my best to find a tutorial, reference document, book, anything to help me leverage a "Vanilla Servlet". I was able to work around my last issue , by invoking the a particular Servlet I needed from the (Flex) client's browser. The trouble now is, I have another Servlet (the source of which, I can't modify) that I need to call when my application is started. The Servlet is involved in initializing application reference data (so this is really critical). It seems to me this should be a typical problem... This must have been a common issue a few years ago when other teams converted to Spring, so why can't I find the tutorial I need? I've tried researching a ton of different Spring classes, but I'm not getting anywhere on this. Here's some notes on what I've tried: ServletWrappingController , but this isn't for use as a Controller, I really only need the Servlet inside a Singleton DAO's Constructor. ResourceServlet , this Class name seems appropriate, and I've run across it in my searching, but I'm not entirely sure if this is something that would help. ServletForwardingController ( mentioned here ), but I can't seem to find an appropriate example. ServletWrappingController ( also from the above question ), but -again- I can't find an appropriate example. Am I on a wild goose hunt here? Is there a way that I can invoke a static method (does that matter?) on a Servlet, during a Spring app's startup? I'm not sure a code snippet will help, but I'd be happy to post one. Really, my only tangential thoughts are "Does the Servlet need to be declared a particular way in web.xml" and "Does this need to be declared a certain way in as a Spring managed bean?" (i.e. in app-config.xml) I can't edit the Servlet, though I can tell you it does extend HttpServlet. I'm not calling doGet or doPost on it, instead there's a static method on the Servlet that makes an RPC call that I need to invoke. If anyone knows a special @MagicInjectHttpServlet annotation, please pass it on!
