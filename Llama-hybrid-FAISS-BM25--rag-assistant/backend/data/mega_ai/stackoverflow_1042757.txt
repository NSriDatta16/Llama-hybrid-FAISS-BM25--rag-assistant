How to handle SQL Agent job error?

I am writing a SQL Agent Job to remove rows from Table 1 and Table 2 once a day. The step of the SQL Agent job is: Delete some specific records from Table 1 Delete some specific records from Table 2. My question is: How to record the error during SQL Agent? Any logs/events we could use? (so that we could see in what days the SQL Agent Job failed, and why it failed.) I want the SQL Job to continue to execute (delete) specific records from Table2, even if for any reason delete from Table1 fails, any best practices how to implement this?
