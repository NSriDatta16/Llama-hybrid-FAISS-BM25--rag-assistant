You're using footer p .right and not footer p.right (note the space character). This means the .right and .left classes don't apply to the paragraphs, but to descendant elements inside the paragraph . Or it could also mean a typo, causing your CSS to fail :) Please copy your HTML here, so we can help you better. Edit: I see you've now posted your HTML. My assumption turns out to be correct. Get rid of the spaces between p and .left / .right . Also, if you're floating the paragraphs anyway, you can omit the text-align properties. #footer p.left { float: left; } #footer p.right { float: right; } Edit: In response to your comment: it should work. Here's a little test case: Test case for the CSS footer problem #footer { width: 300px; outline: 1px solid red; } #footer p.left { float: left; } #footer p.right { float: right; } See http://stackoverflow.com/a/867599/96656 for details.
