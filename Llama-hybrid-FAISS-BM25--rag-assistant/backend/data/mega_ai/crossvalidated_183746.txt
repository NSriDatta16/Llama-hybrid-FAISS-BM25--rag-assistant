Chi squared test for differences between constructed variable

Let's assume I have a control and a treatment group with 1000 participants each and I ask each of them three questions regarding their risk perception. Each of the three questions is concerned with another domain: a, b, c Furthermore I am also interested in the overall risk perception and I assume that this can be inferred from the answers to a, b, and c. Unfortunately I missed to ask a fourth question concerning the overall risk perception ( That's why I want to know if this alternative way might work or not) In a first step I check for significant differences between treatment and control group for each variable using a chi squared test. That is: Variable A: Treatment: 900 yes / 100 no Control: 847 yes / 153 no Variable B: Treatment: 948 yes / 152 no Control: 888 yes / 112 no Variable C: Treatment: 808 yes / 193 no Control: 760 yes / 240 no I find that the differences are significant for A and B but not for C. Now I am wondering if it is possible to construct one general variable based on A,B C- Is it statistically meaningful to construct a new variable 'overall' that takes on the average value from a, b and c? That is: Variable Overall (average from A , B and C) Treatment: 885 yes / 115 no Control: 832 yes / 168 no If 1 makes sense, can I test for significant differences for this constructed variable using a chi squared test?
