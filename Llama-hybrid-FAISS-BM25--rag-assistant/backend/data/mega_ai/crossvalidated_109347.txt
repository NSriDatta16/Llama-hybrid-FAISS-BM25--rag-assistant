If you are interested in machine learning for this problem instead of targeted traditional statistical inference you must be interested in comparing entire distributions rather than just the mean or quantiles. That being the case, consider the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test. If you need to adjust for other subject characteristics in comparing the groups, consider using traditional methods that attempt to isolate the group effect from the other effects, e.g., analysis of covariance or propensity score adjustment.
