In a GTK application, use gtk_window_set_urgency_hint() . If you have a terminal application, you can't really do that - with libwnck you can get information about other application's windows, but as far as I know you can't get a GtkWindow pointer to another application's window. May I suggest using the terminal beep? Of course this isn't a sure way to attract the user's attention, but some terminals are able to flash the title bar instead of beeping, or such things.
