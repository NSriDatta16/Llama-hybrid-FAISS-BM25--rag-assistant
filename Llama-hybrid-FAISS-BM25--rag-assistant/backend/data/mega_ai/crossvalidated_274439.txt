Paired t-test or an unpaired t-test?

Suppose that we have 30 plants (that are the same exact plants). Suppose that we choose 15 out of a sample of 30 plants and we seeded them with a drag. We then want to test whether this drag has an effect of making them grow faster. So we have 15 plants with a drag, and 15 plants with no drag. Let's suppose that the weather conditions are the same and they are at the same exact place-location . Are they paired or unpaired? Before I ask this question I searched it and by definition: Paired samples mean that we take a sample (let's say a plant) and we see how it grows, then we put the drag to the EXACT same plant and see whether it makes any difference. According to this definition, I would use UNpaired samples since I am choosing two different groups of plants and not the same plant each time. BUT, concerning the fact that all these 30 plants are the same (they are the same object) can I still use a paired t-test? Thank you, I hope my question makes sense. I read many examples with animals or humans. Of course if we have humans or animals then of course the answer is very simple, since every animal or human being is different. Subsequently if I use two different groups of human for example, the samples could be unpaired. But when I use objects like plants or clouds or trees or something like that. Does it make any sense to consider them as different, avoiding the fact that we are talking about the same object.
