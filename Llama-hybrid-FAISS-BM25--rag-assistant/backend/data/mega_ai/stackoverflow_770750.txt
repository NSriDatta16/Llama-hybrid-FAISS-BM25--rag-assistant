Schemas may be used to organize stored procedures and other objects. Personally, I prefer to use schemas when they organize objects by functional area, and where those funcational areas correspond to security boundaries. An example of this is found in the AdventureWorks sample databse, which has schemas like "HumanResources" and "Sales". The theory being that a given user may need access to objects in "HumanResources", but may not need access to "Sales" information. An alternative is to use a naming convention and enforce it, as James says above. I'll add that SQL Server Management Studio has a filter button that can be used to filter the list of objects displayed. For instance, one can click on the "Stored Procedures" folder and filter on Name contains "Add". On my current project, I have pulled a number of SQL queries out of SSIS packages and into stored procedures. In order to distinguish between these stored procedures and those that should be of general use, I have prefixed the names with "ssis". It would certainly have been more pleasant if I could have created something similar to a namespace in C# or C++, and created "SSIS.SelectUserLookupData" instead of "ssis_SelectUserLookupData". It would be even nicer if these namespaces could be nested. If this is one of the featues of Packages in Oracle, then perhaps someone would let me know.
