Using N columns as N classification or using 1 column with multiple values

When dealing with the Neural Network outputs, I found two different approaches to express the output to Neural Network: Using one column with different value as different classifications: 1 // class A 10 // class B 10 // class B 1 // class A 1 // class A as two different class Using 2 columns as different classfication 1 0 // class A 1 0 // class A 0 1 // class B 1 0 // class A 0 1 // class B Correct me if I am wrong, or please tell me the differences or which one is better for: MultiLayerPerceptron Transfer Function: TANH using bias neurons ResilentPropagation Using Batch Mode Thanks.
