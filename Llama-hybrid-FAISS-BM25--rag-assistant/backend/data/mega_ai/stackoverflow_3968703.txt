To retrieve the element's text (as in ALL the text, subnodes included): var value = document.getElementById('name').textContent; Then to assigned the text to the input field in another page: document.getElementById('myField').value = value; Of course that doesn't work across pages. If you don't want to use server-side code for this, one simple way of doing it would be to pass the code in a query string, redirect to your form page, and retrieve the variable from the query parameters. Which sounds simpler than it actually is, as you'd need a function to add a query parameter , another one to read a query parameter , and to be sure that everything is encoded and decoded properly . Another - bad - alternative could be to use cookies via JavaScript . Another - better but not yet widespread - alternative could to use the WebStorage API . (see localStorage and/or sessionStorage ). This will require a modern browser supporting these APIs (for instance, Google Chrome, IE9, Firefox 4, etc...) The embedded links will provide the missing parts.
