GLSL convert gl_FragCoord.z into eye-space z

This is a simple question, and I'm sick of searching the web for the right equation. The main problem is that everyone suggests doing something like this VS: varying float depth; depth = ( gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex ); But I can't, because the depth is stored in a texture. So anyway, I now the depth value, and the Projection matrix used to create it from the eye-space coords. If you don't quite understand, tell me and I'll try to word it better. Thanks in advance. :)
