elisp macro to write a function?

I have written a few nearly identical functions, except for their names. For example: ; x is name, such as function/paragraph/line/etc. (defun my-x-function (interactive) (mark-x) (do-more-stuff) (modify-x)) Is there a way to automatically generate such functions? I have a feeling this is what macros do, but I am not sure how to use them. Any help, maybe including a small example would be great. Thanks!
