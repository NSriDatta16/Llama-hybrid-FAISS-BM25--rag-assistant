I had an issue on Tomcat 6 where Commons Logging wouldn't play nice with SLF4J which got dragged in from Hibernate. We had configured Commons Logging to go to Log4J anyway. After explicitly including "slf4j-log4j 1.6.1" and its "jcl-over-slf4j 1.6.1" component to take out Commons Logging, I still got errors from Commons Logging. The answer lied in this blog post : You explicitly include Commons Logging at version "99.0-does-not-exist". This includes an empty JAR, so that only the SLF4J code gets executed now.
