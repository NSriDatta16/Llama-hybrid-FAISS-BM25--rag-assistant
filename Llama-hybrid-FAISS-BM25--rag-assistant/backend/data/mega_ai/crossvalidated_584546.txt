clustering latent space of cnn lstm autoencoder

I am working on cnn-lstm autoencoder for anomaly detection in multivariate time series dataset. However, I need to cluster the latent space for fault diagnosis. But my latent space shape is in the form (n_obs, timestep, features), can anyone recommend a clustering algorithm that accepts this shape as input?
