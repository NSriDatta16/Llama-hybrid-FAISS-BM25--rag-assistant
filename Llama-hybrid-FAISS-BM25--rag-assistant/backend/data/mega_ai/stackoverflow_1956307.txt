Pull 3 tiers of related data from a single table

Our business as a tiered Salesman relation, sometimes called an omni-tier. Its 3 deep. in english: Salesman-A-tier has people under them, we'll call them salesman-B-tier, and b-tier has salesman under them salesman-C-tier. table: id, name, agentId 1011, bob, 0 1012, jim, 1011 1013, tim, 1011 1014, sam, 1011 1015, dav, 1013 1016, kim, 1013 1017, sal, 1015 1018, vin, 1015 (the ID is the agents' Id, the field called agentId is that salesmans upstream agent) what i need is a list of all the salesmen under (in this case bob or id=1011), 3 tiers deep. i've gotten 2 levels deep but get throttled after that. figuring theres a better approach i cannot see myself, i'm asking for help. my sql so far: select c.id, c.name, c.agentId from salesmen s where s.agentId = 1011 or s.agentId = (select ss.agentId from salesmen ss where ss.id=s.agentid) This gets me 2 tiers deep but i cannot get a third. any help is appreciated. thanks in advance, Matthew
