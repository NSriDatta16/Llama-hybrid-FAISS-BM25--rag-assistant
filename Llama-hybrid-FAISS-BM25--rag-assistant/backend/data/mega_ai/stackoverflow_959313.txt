Why won't my web browser reflect changes I made on the server?

This is as simple as it gets. My school provides us with a personal storage that can be used for a webpage. Its the standard http://www.example.com/~studentname type deal. Previously, I would make changes to an index.html file and upload in using the 'Secure File Transfer Client' to my public_html folder. I'd hit refresh, and bingo. I used ssh to login remotely edited the .html file with pico, and saved it. if I do a cat on the file after closing it, it's still there. But my neither firefox nor google chrome reflect the recent changes. I've even deleted my cache to no avail.
