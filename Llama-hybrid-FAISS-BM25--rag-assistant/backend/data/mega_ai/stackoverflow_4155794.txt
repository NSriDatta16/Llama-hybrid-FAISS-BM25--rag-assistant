match a paragraph starts with some letter

I have a file that contains paragraphs starting with AB, I wanted to get all these paragraphs, I used the following code, but it returns nothing: import re paragraphs = re.findall(r'AB[.\n]+AD',text) #AD is the beginning of the next paragraph Any idea why did not this work? Thanks
