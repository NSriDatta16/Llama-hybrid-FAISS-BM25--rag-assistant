Why does converting data into a Time Series change the values and how do you change them back?

I imported data and converted into a simple time series. claims It changed the values from 3496 2453 2311 2559 3149 5103 4951 4165 4340 4868 3862 2811 3583 3469 3171 2660 2772 2223 2115 to 138 105 97 109 130 155 154 146 148 153 142 119 139 137 132 112 116 93 82 How do I calculate what these new values indicate? I am using the tbats forecast function fitem and it is giving me forecast values that are base on these numbers. Even when I don't convert the data and use tbats, it automatically converts to these numbers. Stated simply, I must convert the new ts values into the actuals. Why does 3496 equal 138? Any help is appreciated.
