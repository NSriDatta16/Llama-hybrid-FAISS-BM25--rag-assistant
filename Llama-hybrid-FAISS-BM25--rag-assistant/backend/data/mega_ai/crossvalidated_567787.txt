emmeans properly conducts multiple comparison for one glmmTMB model but not the other

I have two datasets from different years. They are structured almost identically. One is substantially larger than the other and has more time points. When I prepare a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model for one using glmmTMB and then conduct a multiple comparison (Dunnett's test) using emmeans for each 'level' of time (although time is a continuous predictor, not a factor), the contrast output correctly shows treatment vs control at each 'level' of time. When I repeat the exact procedure using the same code for the second dataset, the output contrast is not at each 'level' of time, but instead one single output is generated at the average time. Why is this happening...?

Would this lead to the model being created differently or stop emmeans from properly identifying the 'levels' of time? Maybe there's another approach to make these comparisons? ( glht from the package multComp requires time to be a factor) Any and all help appreciated :)
