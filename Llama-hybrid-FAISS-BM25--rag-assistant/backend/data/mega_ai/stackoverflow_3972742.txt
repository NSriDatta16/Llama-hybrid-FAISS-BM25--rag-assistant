void loopTwice (bool first = true) { // Recursion is your friend if (first) {loopTwice(false);} // Do Stuff ... } I'm sure there's a more elegant way, but this is simple to read, and pretty simply to write. There might even be a way to eliminate the bool parameter, but this is what I came up with in 20 seconds.
