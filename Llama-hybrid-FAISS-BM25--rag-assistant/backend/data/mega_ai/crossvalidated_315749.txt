Sorry, I have not enough reputation to comment. Correlation for multidimensional data is tricky, if all your dimensions are of the same importance (if you have no dependent variable). If You have 3 variables of the same importance H(height), W (weight) and F(foot size) for example, then if response will be H or response will be W you will have different correlation. I would suggest the following: as correlation represents amount of variation explained by predictors, you may use another methods to calculate explained variance. It is possible to perform PCA and use explained by 1st or 1st-2nd etc variance.
