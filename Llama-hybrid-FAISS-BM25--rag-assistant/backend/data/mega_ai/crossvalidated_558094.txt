Depending on what exactly the preprocessing steps are. If you have applied PCA and then feed the principal components as features to the random forest model, then by design you have greatly reduced the interpretability of the machine learning model due to the preprocessing. This is one drawback of applying preprocessing method like PCA. However, there are other types of preprocessing where the reduction in interpretability isn't as serious.
