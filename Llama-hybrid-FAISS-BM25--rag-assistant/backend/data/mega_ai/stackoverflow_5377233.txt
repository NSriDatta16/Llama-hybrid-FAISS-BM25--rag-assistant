Only CClayer is able to detect a touches, its automatic. So you are going to need to handle the per tick thing. And it should be ccTouchesMove.. Something like: -(void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"begin"); } -(void)ccTouchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; location = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:location]; sprite.position = location; } -(void)ccTouchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Ended"); } Of course, in your init, you must set self.isTouchEnabled = YES;
