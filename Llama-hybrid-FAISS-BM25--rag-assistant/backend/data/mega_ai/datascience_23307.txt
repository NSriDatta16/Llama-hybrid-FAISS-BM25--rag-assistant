Simple games such as tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) can make interesting and practical toy problems to apply a variety of data analysis. More complex games can challenge state of the art algorithms and are areas on ongoing research. Artificial intelligence that seeks to optimise game play may or may not be related to data science. Most likely to be on topic are questions about markov models, bandit algorithms and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning specifically is a machine learning approach where analysis or optimal play can be discovered through observing outcomes of actions taken in a game, without prior knowledge of how the game is supposed to behave or be played. Probably off-topic are questions about designing games, implementing game rules in software, "traditional AI" search algorithms such as A*.
