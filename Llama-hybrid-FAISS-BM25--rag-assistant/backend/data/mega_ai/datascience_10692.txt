Number of parameters in Neural Network Language Model

The Neural Network language Model (NNLM) by Bengio et.al is a structure extensively used in machine translation, text summarization based on deep learning. What's the computational complexity of this model? Knowing the complexity in terms of number of parameters helps in choosing the size of the training set and in determining what compute infrastructure is required.
