Why autocovariance is 0?

First of all I am a newbie in stats, trying to study statistics, and somehow I find 'time series' way more difficult than other topics. I am confused with the “autocovariance”. In the book "Time series analysis and its applications", it says: Before my question I must admit that I did not know what values of $w_s$ and $w_t$ shall be chosen, and what I understood from my previous question is that you have to specify a lag: logic of autocovariance in time series ie: lag 1 is to compare each value with the one right before. But now I have 2 questions: Why the author never defines the lag he is using? is he calculating the autocovariance for lag 1,2? or what? I do not see how the covariance would be 0... If I think of the case for lag 1, in my head I picture potential values like: -0.5, 1, -2, 1, 1. I see that the autocovariance will be negative (one value goes up, the next one goes down...) Of course I do know my logic is faulty, the author shall not be wrong, but I want to fully understand it before proceeding to other topics... How come it is 0?
