Following your points: Yes, it is correct that the logistic regression does not generally optimises the accuracy. I would only say that the logistic regression estimates the conditional likelihood rather than the joint likelihood (this follows from the fact that the logistic regression ignores the marginal distribution of each class). If you want to maximise the whole joint likelihood, you should look into Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA). In some cases in theory one could construct a classifier that maximises the accuracy (at least asymptotically). One way to do this would be to define the risk of the classifier as the expected 0/1 loss. Then, one could try to find a Bayes classifier , i.e., the classifier that allows to attain the minimal risk (presumably, this classifier would be the most accurate). For example, one could show that in the domain with two balanced normally distributed classes with the same covariance matrix logistic regression is asymptotically Bayes optimal (see here ).
