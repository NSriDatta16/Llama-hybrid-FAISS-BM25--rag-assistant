MySQL connection parameter to ignore tablename

Is it possible to set a property or variable on MYSQL connect string so that the tablenames are not case sensitive when queries are run on the session? MySQL client/server is running on Linux and storage engine is InnoDB but can be controlled by specifying sessionVariables=storage_engine=MyISAM in the connect string. jdbc:mysql://host:3306/mydb?autoReconnect=true&sessionVariables=storage_engine=MyISAM
