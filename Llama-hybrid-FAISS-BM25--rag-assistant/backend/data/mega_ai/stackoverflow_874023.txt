Keeping page breaks from form input

In my Rails app, I want to keep the \n that are inputted in the forms. What I've done so far is output with simple_format() . But the problem is that simple_format wraps the text in if there is a \n . This is problematic for my chatroom log as I don't want each message to appear in a new paragraph. What should I do instead?
