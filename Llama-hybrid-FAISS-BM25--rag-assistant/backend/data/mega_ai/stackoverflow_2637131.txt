As you already noticed, this approach is very fragile and should be avoided. Try a design were you don't need to add the name as a constructor argument. You could do this for instance: public class Ninja { private readonly IWeapon _weapon; public Ninja(IWeapon weapon) { _weapon = weapon; } public string Name { get; set; } // ..more code.. } public void SomeFunction() { var kernel = new StandardKernel(); kernel.Bind ().To (); var ninja = ninject.Get (); ninja.Name = "Lee"; } I hope this helps.
