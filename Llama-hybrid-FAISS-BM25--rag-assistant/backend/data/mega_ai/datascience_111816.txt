Random Forest needs to handle dates as numeric data, that's why you can use the day, the weekday, the month, the trimester and the year as separated fields. In addition to that, if your data has a cyclic behavior, you can align your data to it. For instance, if your data has a cycle of 3 months, you can have the following features: day of the trimester (from 1 to 90), weekday, trimester and year. This would help to find interesting patterns. Note: after the random forest processing, you may want to convert the day of the trimester to yyyy-mm-dd for a better clarity.
