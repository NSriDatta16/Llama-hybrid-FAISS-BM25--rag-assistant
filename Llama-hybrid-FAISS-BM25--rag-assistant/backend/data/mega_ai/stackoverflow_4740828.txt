how can i make a video/image cube interactive?

im doing a project in adobe director and im looking to make an image/video cube which display an image or video on each side of the cube now i have seen some tutorial on how to make the cube in softwares like cinema 4d but how could i make this cube interactive such as adding a feature were you can drag and drop an image or a video on any side of the cube, so the cube becomes editable, im looking to make this for an application which im making in adobe director so if its possible i would need it still running and editable after i make it a .exe file. the feature doesnt have to be drag and drop but i need to have the cube become editable to add image/video to it after its turned in to .exe file. wouldnt mind looking at other softwares to make this but would need to import it in adobe director to work.
