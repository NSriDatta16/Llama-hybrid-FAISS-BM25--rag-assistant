I never enjoyed math either and getting a degree in Engineering was not as simple...I barely managed to get decent grades in high school and college! As I graduated and started working at an IT company, I started gaining interest in finance and accounting. Being weak with numbers made this even more difficult. So, I searched online and came across this YouTube Channel: The Khan Academy . This guy is amazing! He has posted video tutorials on pretty much everything that we learnt in high school, including algebra, probability and arithmetic and much more. His tutorials are easy to understand and a great way to engage with other people who are on the same position as you on the learning curve. Even better, Bill Gates and his sons follow the tutorials too. Read more about it here: http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/23/technology/sal_khan_academy.fortune/
