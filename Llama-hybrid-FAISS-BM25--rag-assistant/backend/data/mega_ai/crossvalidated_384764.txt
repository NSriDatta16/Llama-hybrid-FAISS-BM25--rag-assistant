The link you provided on Decision Jungles states that they split the space by building directed acyclig graphs. Random Forests use trees, which are only a special case of DAGs. It seems like the algorithm is able to fuse nodes, something that isn't happening in constructing a decision tree. If you follow the link on Decision Jungle's implementation you'll find a paper that explains the method . From the paper, figure 1: Using DAGs instead of trees reduces the number of nodes and can result in better generalization. For a concrete visualization see page 4 of the article supplement - it clearly shows what is built is not a tree, and something more complex.
