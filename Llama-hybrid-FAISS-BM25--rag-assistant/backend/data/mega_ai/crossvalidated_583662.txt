R: Inflated degrees of freedom in mixed linear model

I have a question regarding a mixed model I am using: In a study, participants have been presented with 40 different news article headlines and indicated for each headline whether they would share the headline or not (Yes coded as 1, No coded as 0). There are the two binary within-subjects factors “Accuracy” (true vs. false) and “Strategy” (attacks outgroup vs. praises ingroup). Further, there is a binary between-subjects factor “Condition” (threat vs. neutral). I wanted to run a mixed model with random intercepts for participants (id) and headlines (Headline) that includes sharing decision as a dependent variable and Accuracy, Strategy and Condition as independent variables. I have two issues with that. When I try to use a multilevel logistic regression with the following command, I am running into convergence issues: mreg_P3_g Therefore, I tried to run a linear model with the following command: mreg_P3 When I do that, I receive the following output: Type III Analysis of Variance Table with Kenward-Roger's method Sum Sq Mean Sq NumDF DenDF F value Pr(>F) Strategy 0.828 0.828 1 35.1 7.5283 0.009505 ** Accuracy 80.154 80.154 1 35.1 729.1441 As you probably see, I am having a lot of significant effects and the effects Strategy:Condition, Accuracy:Condition and Strategy:Accuracy:Condition are not interpretable when looking the visualized data. I attribute the fact that they are significant to the inflated degrees of freedom and wonder if I need to specify the random effects of my model differently. I am far from an expert and would be very happy for any help! Thank you very much in advance!
