jQuery-ajax call: async property is not working?

given to certain circumstances, I'm forced to keep page settings (Javascript-values) in the session and it has to be done right before leaving the page (I can't use cookies, since "pageSettings" can become quite large and localStorage is not an option yet ;) ). So this is how I tried it. However it seems that when I call the page directly again, the call of " http://blabla.com/bla " happens asynchronous, even though the async-attribute is set (I don't receive the settings of the previous call, but of the one before): $jQ(document).ready(function () { $jQ(window).unload(Main.__setSessionValues); }); var Main = { pageSettings: {}, __setSessionValues: function __setSessionValues() { $jQ.ajax({ type: "POST", async: false, url: "http://blabla.com/bla", data: { pageSettings: Object.toJSON(Main.pageSettings) } }); } }; Does anyone know what the problem might be? thanks in advance
