How exactly should repeated measures situation be treated in machine learning models?

I was reading this SE about repeated measures and I was a little bit confused. I have a data set consisting of claim information for million locations for up to 5 years and 99.9% of the observations in the data have zero claim values. I have 100 features related to each location which are pretty much the same in all years (for example the area of the location and etc). so I could have 5 observations for the same location in the data (when the value of all the features are the same), with different target value. (see below) Location ID | year |feature 1|feature 2|Target | location 1 | 2005 | 1.5 | 3 | 0 | location 1 | 2006 | 1.5 | 3 | 0 | location 1 | 2007 | 1.5 | 3 | 100 | location 1 | 2008 | 1.5 | 3 | 0 | location 1 | 2009 | 1.5 | 3 | 0 Here are my questions: Is this an example of repeated measures? Would it impact my predictions in case I use non parametric, tree based models such as GBM or Xgboost? If yes, how should I treat this in my modeling approach? Do I have to change the data/modeling approach?
