This debate has been going on in almost any SQL Server community for ages. there are good arguments for both sides and there is definitely not just one size fits all answer. It really depends on your individual situation and on many factors, such as number of users, avg. file size, update frequency, read/write ratio, disk-subsystem yadayadayada... But as you mention SQLExpress probably the most important factor is the max database size limit and this is a very good reason to go for the filesystem approach. Anyway, this research paper might still be interesting for you: To BLOB or Not To BLOB: Large Object Storage in a Database or a Filesystem? This paper used to be on the Microsoft Research site here: http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=64525 , but that link doesn't work for me. SQL Server has come a long way since then. Quassnoi already mentioned FILSTREAM, for example.
