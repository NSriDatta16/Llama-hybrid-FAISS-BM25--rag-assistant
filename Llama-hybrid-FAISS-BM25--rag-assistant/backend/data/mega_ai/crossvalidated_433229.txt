For a multivariate time series, you can use basically any method that you would use for multivariate cross-sectional data, in addition to methods specific to time series (such as VARMA or more generally, state-space models). For example, Multivariate regression is a method used for cross-sectional data when you have multiple dependent variables. VAR is a special case of a multivariate regression: in a VAR, the regressors are bound to be lagged values of the dependent variables (though you can have other variables, too, in which case a VAR becomes a VARX). As you mentioned, you can use artificial neural networks. You can also use k nearest neighbours, support vector machines, tree-based methods and other. In my understanding, dealing with time series instead of cross-sectional data is not limiting the model selection; rather, it adds new possibilities (like VARMA).
