According to Apple's documentation , the mode in which a webapp is being viewed can be retrieved using JavaScript. So, if you send the iPhone's User-agent header from your computer and then grab a copy of the first HTML document that gets served up (before JavaScript has a chance to do any redirects) you should be able to find some JavaScript code that decides how to display the webapp based on the iPhone viewing mode.
