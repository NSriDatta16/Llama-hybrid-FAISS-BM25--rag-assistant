POST Headers being sent, but not received on server

In C#, I am working on a project to automatically update a separate server with an image and other form data and such... However, the PHP server isn't getting any of the POST data, it's only getting the headers and I can't figure out why. Here is what I am sending to the server (all new lines have CRLF): POST /new_reply/1 HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.104 User-Agent: Update Bot Cookie: SID=sib5m5lgaq66vfp2nfhpab6ug0;UID=bot Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=-----xxx Content-Length: 1903 -----xxx Content-Disposition: form-data; name="form_sent" 1 -----xxx Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name" -----xxx Content-Disposition: form-data; name="body" hej fra mig -----xxx Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="test.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg (image data) -----xxx Content-Disposition: form-data; name="post" Post -----xxx-- Here is the image with the hidden characters show of the request: Here is the PHP print_r of $_REQUEST on the page /new_reply/1: Array ( [reply] => 1 [SID] => sib5m5lgaq66vfp2nfhpab6ug0 [UID] => bot ) As you can see, none of the post is coming through...
