Here's an elegant solution I have found, in case anybody else has this problem (in case all other solution don't work for you, as they didn't work for me): The textbox iself was inside the ul (generated by javascript). Pressing enter will trigger the "doNothingButton", which will return false on client side, causing no postback at all!
