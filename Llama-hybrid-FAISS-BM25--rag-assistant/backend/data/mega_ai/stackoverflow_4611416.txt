Resources for doing GPU-accelerated computation (GPGPU) on the iPhone?

I'm interested in doing GPU-accelerated computation in iOS (for iPhones 3GS and 4). Unfortunately, neither device supports OpenCL, so it seems the only choice is to express the program data as graphics data and use the OpenGL ES 2.0 programmable shaders (vertex and fragment) to do the work. Can anyone recommend any resources that might be useful? Sample code is the holy grail.
