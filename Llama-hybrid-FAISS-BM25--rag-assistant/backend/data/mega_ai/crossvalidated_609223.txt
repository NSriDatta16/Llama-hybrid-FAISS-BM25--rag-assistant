Logit inverse for binary data

Suppose I fit a generalised linear model with a binary response on multiple predictors with a logit link. When calculating the inverse of logit, I have the following exponential formula: $$\frac{e^{\theta}}{1+e^{\theta}}$$ I have been taught that $\theta$ can be represented by the following $\beta_0+\beta_1x_i$ , suppose my predictors are factor, would it make sense to do the following? $$\frac{e^{\theta}}{1+e^{\theta}} = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_i}} = \\ = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_10}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_10}} \\ = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1(1)}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1(1)}} \\ = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1(2)}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1(2)}} \\ \vdots$$ Because I cannot calculate the fitted values from this (OR what is the appropriate method to compare fitted values from this?), additionally, would it make sense to take the average of all values x in this case, to have a mean score?
