The first step of fastICA is to whiten the data using PCA . The signs of the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are not uniquely determined . So it's not surprising that you find variations between runs. More resources: The order of ICA results is not fixed. Weird correlations in the SVD results of random data; do they have a mathematical explanation or is it a LAPACK bug? SVD matrixes do not coincide with Eigen decomposition for covariance matrix
