I haven't found a way using the dm-mysql-adapter but dm-mysql looks promising. I had originally submitted a request to the DataMapper team to include an option to allow MySQL database users the ability to specify table options in their DataMapper models. My needs were around data warehousing and I wanted to use a different storage engine like Infobright. Unfortunately this request was denied because dm-core could have ended up looking like spaghetti if my request were approved. Mind you I'm oversimplifying the argument, but I understood where they were coming from. As a result, I bring you dm-mysql! Want more control over your database tables in DataMapper?
