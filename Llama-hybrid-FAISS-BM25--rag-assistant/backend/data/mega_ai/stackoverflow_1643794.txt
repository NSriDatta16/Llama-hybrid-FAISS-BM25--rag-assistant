The CurrentDatabase property of NotesSession is not available if you are running outside of Notes/Domino (ie: COM). Also, the UnprocessedDocuments attribute is only available in the context of a Domino agent. UnporocessedDocuments does NOT provide you a collection of "unread" documents - this is different, and as far as i know is not exposed to the COM classes - you will need to access the unread documents list from the C API. See SO question # 1592940 Notes C API documentation for collecting unread documents is available here: http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/tools/c/7.0/api70ref.nsf/61fd4e9848264ad28525620b006ba8bd/683a9d787a2c9015852561bd00669930?OpenDocument
