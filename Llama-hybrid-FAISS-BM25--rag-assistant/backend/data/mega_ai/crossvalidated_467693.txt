I agree with @r8. We can see from e.g., stan or these notes that the weakly $\epsilon$ -typical set is given by $$ A_\epsilon = \{ x: \left|\ln \frac{p(x)}{\pi(x)} - H(p, \pi)\right| \le \epsilon \} $$ where $\pi(x)$ is a reference measure and $$ H(p, \pi) = \int p(x) \ln \frac{p(x)}{\pi(x)} dx $$ Let me add that we may quickly demonstrate an inequality for the volume of the typical set. We begin by expressing the condition above as $$ e^{H - \epsilon}\, \pi(x) \le p(x) \le e^{H + \epsilon}\, \pi(x) $$ We then build an inequality $$ 1 \ge \int_{A_\epsilon} p(x) dx \ge \int_{A_\epsilon} \pi(x) dx \, e^{H - \epsilon} $$ and thus $$ \text{Volume of typical set} \equiv \int_{A_\epsilon} \pi(x) dx \le e^{-H + \epsilon} $$ Let me further add that in the context of inference from a prior to a posterior (which I why I chose the notation $\pi$ and $p$ ) we may write the condition for the typical set in terms of the likelihood function $\mathcal{L(x)}$ , $$ e^{H - \epsilon}\, \mathcal{Z} \le \mathcal{L(x)} \le e^{H + \epsilon}\, \mathcal{Z} $$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ is the Bayesian evidence (also known as the marginal likelihood), $$ \mathcal{Z} \equiv \int \mathcal{L}(x) \pi(x) dx $$
