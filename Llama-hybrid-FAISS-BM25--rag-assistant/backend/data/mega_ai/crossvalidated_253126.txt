Since you seem to be a novice, I'd strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with pandas and scikit-learn ; these are the "tools of the trade" for people doing data science using Python. Before starting with any analysis (such as finding "correlations"), try to be specific about what question you're trying to answer. With a data set as rich as the one you've been provided, there are many possible questions, each with different models that might be appropriate. For instance, you might try answering the question "can user session lengths be predicted given user demographic information?". This is an example of a supervised learning problem , since the training data has already been labeled (i.e., you know the user session lengths). Furthermore, the variable you're trying to predict is continuous, which makes this is a regression (and not a classification) problem . As a first attempt, I'd trying building a linear regression model to predict the output given the inputs, after one-hot-encoding the categorical variables. Another more difficult problem is "can we divide users into clusters based on their demographic information and/or listening habits?". This is an example of an unsupervised learning problem , since you don't already have labels for the clusters. Since your features will end up being a mix of categorical and continuous, simple k-means clustering probably won't work, and models of the type discussed in this answer might be useful.
