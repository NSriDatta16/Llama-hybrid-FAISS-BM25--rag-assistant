What is the difference between observation and variable?

I have a matrix with size m√ón that is built from n number of individuals for person identification. So, n is the number of person and m is the number of feature's value for the person. It makes me confused about observation and variables. What will I call n and m? Which one represents observation and which one represents variable? My confusion will be cleared to you if you visit the following link: How to do SVD and PCA with big data?
