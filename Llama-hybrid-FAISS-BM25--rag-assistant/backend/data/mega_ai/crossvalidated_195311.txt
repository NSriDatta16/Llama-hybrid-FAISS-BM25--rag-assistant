Interesting. Why would you want to know that? At least the "lifting" function of the polynomial kernel is well known (and on wikipedia): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel Two very good books on the topic: Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis, John Shawe-Taylor, Nello Cristianini An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods, Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor Since they are both from the same authors, they correlate somewhat. I would start with the first one if you are more into kernels than SVMs with kernels. It also has kernel expansions for other types than the polynomial kernel. Btw: When used, the rbf kernel is normally not infinite-dimensional. The regulariation of the underlying modelling problem usually imposes finite dimensionality. Unfortunately this is how far it was explained to me. :/
