The == is comparing the memory address. It's likely that your compiler is making s1 and s2 point to the same static data to save space. ie. The "Andreas" in the first two lines of code is stored in your executable data. The C standard says these strings are constant and so has optomized the two pointers to point to the same storage. The char[] lines create a variable by copying the data into the variable and so are stored at different address on the stack during execution.
