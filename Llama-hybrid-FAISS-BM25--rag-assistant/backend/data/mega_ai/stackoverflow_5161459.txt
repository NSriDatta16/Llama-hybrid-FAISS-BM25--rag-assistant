How to add a value to a dictionary using reflection in c#?

I have the following Dictionary: private Dictionary averages = new Dictionary (); Now I want to use reflection to add two additional values. I can retrieve the field info, but what else do I have to do? FieldInfo field = ProjectInformation.SourceManager.GetType().GetField("averages"); if (field != null) { //what should be here? }
