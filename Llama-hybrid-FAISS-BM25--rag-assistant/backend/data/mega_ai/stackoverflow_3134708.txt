How to use NHibernate to retrieve elements with a criteria on a List

I'm using NHibernate and I have the two following classes which map my DataBase schema: public class A { public virtual int Id { get; set;} public virtual List MyList { get; set; } } public class B { public virtual int Id { get; set; } public virtual DateTime Date { get; set; } public virtual A FKtoA { get; set; } } I would like to get all the entries of table A that have all the elements of their MyList property with a Date less than a given value. How can I do that with an elegant NHibernate syntax?
