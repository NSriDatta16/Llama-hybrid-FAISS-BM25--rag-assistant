Additional assemblies will add a slight load time and memory overhead, but otherwise have no performance implications. Security will only make a difference if you need different code access security (CAS) and will make use of CAS. Generally there are three reasons: It makes things simpler. Putting everything in a single assembly is becoming unwieldy (this could include organisational/team issues). Reuse. You need separate assemblies. E.g. to have interfaces and implementation in different assemblies to allow AppDomains to be unloaded (e.g. for plugins).
