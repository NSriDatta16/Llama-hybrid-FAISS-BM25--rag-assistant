negative Coefficient interpretation

I have the following regression equation: deathrate=0.237 (incidencerate)-0.0006(medincome)+0.201(pctpublicoverage)+0.0002(popest2015)-1.044(Private coverage )+0.777(private employeecovarge)+ ԑ My interpretation for Private coverage () – The coefficient of private coverage implies that 1 percentage point increase in the private coverage leads to decrease in the cancer mortality by 1.044. My professor as to re-write my interpretation, He said that “ but a decrease by 104% implies negative mortality. We can’t have people rise from the dead. You need to think about if the numbers make sense (and realize that something is wrong with your first interpretation).” I am not sure what does he mean, of course ppl are not rise form the death , it just mean that there is less death. Can someone explain and provide the correct interpretation? Thanks in adavcne.
