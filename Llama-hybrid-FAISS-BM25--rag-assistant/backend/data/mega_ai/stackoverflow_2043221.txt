Ok, After an extra bit of playing I came up with this... std::generate_n( std::back_insert_iterator >( ip ), 20, new_ptr () ) ); I'm not quite sure this is as elegant. From a programming perspective, it may be, but from a "in-6-months-time-will-I-know-what-this-was-meant-to-do" perspectice, I'm not sure... Feel free to point out better ways of doing this.
