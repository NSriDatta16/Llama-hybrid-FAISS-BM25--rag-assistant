We're experimenting with a couple of different board structures across a few different projects that we're running. One project has the most basic structure we can use: | (Sprint) Backlog | In Progress | Done | As much as possible, we try to have a single post-it to represent both the Dev and QA activities for a story. The above structure has seemed to work ok for the developers on the project, but the QA members have struggled to know when a story had the development work complete such that they could execute their tests for that story. We found ourselves moving the stories to the "far side" of the In Progress section to indicate that the Dev work was done and that QA could pick up that story. This very quickly became quite unmanageable as the In Progress section filled up. This led to the second iteration of board structure for another project which is: | (Sprint) Backlog | In Progress | Ready for Test | Done | The newly added section Ready for Test essentially became a formal section of the board that was previously the "far side" of the In Progress section. On the surface of it, this should have made things clearer for the QA members, but this still caused some confusion as people had different interpretations of what Ready for Test meant (I'll not bore you with the different interpretations here). This has then led to the latest iteration of board structure we're using on another project: | (Sprint) Backlog | Dev in Progress | Dev Done | QA in Progress | Done | This is certainly quite a far way from the simple Backlog , In Progress and Done sections of the first iteration, but this appears to be working well for the team. They have a clear understanding of what it means to move a story through various sections of the board and for any one story, it gives a clear picture of where in the life cycle that particular story is. We've only been using this structure since the start of the current sprint (we're 9 days into a 10 day sprint), so we'll be exploring this structure in more detail in our retrospective tomorrow. Not perfect I'm sure, but if it continues to work for the team that is piloting it, we'll try to roll it out across other teams in our organisation.
