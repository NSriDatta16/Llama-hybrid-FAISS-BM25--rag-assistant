As far as I know, model comparison should only be done on the same dataset. For models with different configurations, you can try Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Your 2 models have the same regressors but different coefficients. The easiest thing to do is to check the confidence intervals for overlapping. For example, if CI of $a_1$ overlaps CI of $a_2$ or covers $a_2$ if only one model is fit, then there is no significant difference between them. You can do this for all 3 coefficients.
