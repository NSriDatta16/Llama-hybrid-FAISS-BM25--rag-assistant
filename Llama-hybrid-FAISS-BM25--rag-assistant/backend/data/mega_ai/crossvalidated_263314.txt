F-measure: Should I sum the quantities (i.e., TP, FP, FN) over the N x K runs and compute F-measure using these sums? Yes! Calculate one f1 for each run of cross-validation and average over the N runs. This is also a great opportunity to see the difference between this approach and calculating f1 for each fold and averaging over different folds differ from each other. For accuracy, should we sum the accuracy for each of the N x K runs and simply take their average for the overall estimate? Also Yes! Good approach. In applications, it is sometimes not about being 100% correct but applying methods and techniques according to their ease of use. However, whenever you are reporting the mean, please also report the variance or the standard deviation.
