Many of the user-agent based answers on this page aren't too reliable because Opera often identifies itself with a user-agent string containing "MSIE 6.0", such as: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; X11; Linux i686; en) Opera 9.51 This affects all versions of Opera 5 through 9 and even Opera 10 and can be turned on or off from within Opera. See this page . A common approach I've seen is to test for "MSIE" and against "Opera". For example, if (preg_match('/\bmsie 6/i', $ua) && !preg_match('/\bopera/i', $ua)) echo "We have IE6!";
