If the Suite level turns out to be the wrong approach (i.e. "too wide a net", because you end up marking too much methods with a timeout limit), you need to define a custom IAnnotationTransformer which, for each illegible function, will give you the opportunity to modify a @Test annotation (with, for instance the setTimout() method ). ( setTimout(0) cancels a timeout directive)
