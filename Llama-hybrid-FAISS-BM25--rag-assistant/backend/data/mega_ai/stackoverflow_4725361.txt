There are many ways to read a file into Java. I prefer to use the following: Read the file: ArrayList accounts = new ArrayList (); try { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("C:\\readFile.txt")); String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { accounts.Add(new Account(line)); } } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (br != null) { try { br.close(); } catch (Exception ex) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } You have to decide on a format and then use a tokenizer or other parser to extract your information from the string that you have read in. I suggest you set up classes in your project (e.g. Account class - Properties: AccountNumber, Pin, Balance etc). Remember to add an Account(String) constructor and a toString() method to easily create an account from a string and convert the account to a string for storage in your text file. To write the accounts back to your file (at the end of each transaction or when the program shuts down, your choice), do this: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = null; try { //Construct the BufferedWriter object bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filename)); //Start writing to the output stream for (int i=0; i
