iPhone Enterprise Developer Program is your "friend". Allows ad-hoc distribution of applications and costs only $299. However, it is available only for organizations with more than 500 employees and Dun and Bradstreet number. Since you are a small shop, you are probably not eligible for it (check with Apple, though!), but your potential clients might be. Update : An alternative would be to get a separate standard dev license for each client and provision all their devices as test devices for that account. That is not strictly illegal, though I suspect Apple might frown upon such practice. However, that limits you to 100 devices per license and requires you to manually provision each device. Way too much hassle, unfortunately.
