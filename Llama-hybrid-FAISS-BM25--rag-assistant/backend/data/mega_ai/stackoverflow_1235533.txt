Upgrading DTS packages to SSIS Packages

My question is similar to Upgrading SQL Server 2000 to 2005 or 2008 - DTS to SSIS but I have a few restrictions that I'd like the community to consider. We have two databases that currently run on SQL Server 2000 and we are being pushed to move off of this in favor of SQL server 2005 (We do not have 2008, it isn't an option). We have approximately 150 DTS packages that will need to be converted. According to the stack overflow post above, we shouldn't use the conversion tool available. We also anticipate that any "backward compatibility" patches that Microsoft may have released for SQL Server 2005 won't be installed on our server. Can anyone help me understand the learning curve involved in going from DTS to SSIS? For 150 packages, we've come up with a 900 hour estimate. Myself and a more senior developer will be working on this but we've never worked with SSIS. The 900 hours will be divided between us. As with any project, quality is the utmost importance. Is this estimate outrageous or low? We will have access to other developers who have worked with SSIS, so we won't be completely alone in this. Also, I've learned that DTS package conversion is not an option; it is not supported by our DBA staff. Some things we do with DTS include the following. This is by no means an exhaustive list: Load XML, XLS, MDB, CSV, etc files in to SQL Server Export XML, XLS, MDB, CSV, etc files from SQL Server Run Workflow-type processing
