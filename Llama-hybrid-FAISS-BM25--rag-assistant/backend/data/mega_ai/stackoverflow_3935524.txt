How could I encode a string of 1s and 0s for transport?

For a genetic algorithm application, I'm using a whole load of binary strings. Most of the time they literally take the form of 01001010110 , so that they can be mated, mutated and "crossed-over". For transport and storage however, this seems wasteful. What's the simplest way to encode this as a shorter string? I'm guessing this is pretty trivial, but I'm not sure where to start looking. Update: I actually need to end up with another string: one of the transport requests will be GET requests.
