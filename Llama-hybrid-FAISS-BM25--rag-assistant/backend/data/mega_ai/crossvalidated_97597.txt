Logistic regression with an independent variable that only applies to a subset

I'm trying to perform a logistic regression with the dependent variable being whether a potential customer who attended an event purchased or did not purchase. A subset of potential customers at the event participated in a meet-and-greet type activity with each other and existing customers. For each potential customer, the percentage of existing customers was recorded for the time a potential customer was in the meet-and-greet area. For example, a potential customer may have stopped at the meet-and greet for 1 hour, and during that time, on average there might have been 20% existing customers, and 80% potential customers. I would like to incorporate this variable into my logistic regression model as a continuous variable without categorizing it, but I do not know how to code that variable for potential customers who were at the event, but not the meet-and-greet. I think that setting the non-meet-and-greet people to zero would not be the right way to go. Do I just need to perform a separate logistic regression on the people who participated in the meet-and-greet? I'm using SPSS if that makes a difference. Thank you!
