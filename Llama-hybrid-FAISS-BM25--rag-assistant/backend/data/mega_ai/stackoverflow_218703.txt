This is really hard stuff. I'd start off by getting at least a Masters in Linguistics, and then work towards my PhD in computer science, concentrating on NLP. The problem is that most of us don't have the understanding of what language is. And without that understanding, it's bloody tough to implement a solution. Other comments give some readings, which are probably fine if you want to get started playing around with a small subset of the problem, but in order to come up with a really robust solution, then there are no shortcuts. You need the academic background in both disciplines.
