Simply put, your data shows that for a given value of $x$ , you can have a wide range of $y$ values and that the ranges depend on the value of $x$ . This usually happens when you have a partial view of the global picture, meaning that there are other variables in your data that could help explain the relationship. To leverage your plots, you can consider changing the color of the markers depending on an additional variable. You could also change the size of the marker depending on another one. There are a couple of options there, depending on what you look for. EDA is usually not the final step per se, you may rather ask yourself some questions related to the problem you are trying to solve, and see if the data accounts for it. Does this help?
