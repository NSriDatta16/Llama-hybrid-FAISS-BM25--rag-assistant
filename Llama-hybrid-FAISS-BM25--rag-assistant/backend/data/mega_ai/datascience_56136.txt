Understanding LSTM Training and Validation Graph and their metrics (LSTM Keras)

I have trained a RNN/LSTM model. I would like to interpret my model results, after plotting the graph for Loss and accuracy (b/w training and Validation data set). My objective is to classify the labels (either 0 or 1) if i provide only a partial input to the model. In such a way I have performed training. Train_Validate_Test_Split Train 80% ; Validate 10 % ; Test 10% X_train_shape : (243, 100, 5) Y_train_shape : (243,) X_validate_shape : (31, 100, 5) Y_validate_shape : (31,) X_test_shape : (28, 100, 5) Y_test_shape : (28,) Model Summary Model Graph Model Metrics Question or Interpretation from the model results Q 1 : What can I understand/interpret from loss and Accuracy graph ? How can i confirm whether the model trained properly for my data set or not ? Q 2 : Whether oscillations in both loss and accuracy, have some effect in >model training ? (Or it is a normal behavior) If not, how can I regularize my model without oscillations ? Q 3 : What can I interpret or understand from my metrics tabular column ? My > Y_test accuracy is more when compared with Train & Validation accuracy, What can i interpret from this behavior ?
