What is the difference between ARMA+Fourier and TBATS model?

I am just wondering that, in terms of the multi-seasonal time series forecast, what is the difference between using auto.arima find the ARMA order, then fit arima and include xreg=fourier in. using tbats As ARMA+Fourier can also takes other covariates into account while tbats cannot, why people tend to use tbats one? Better performance in terms of forecasting?
