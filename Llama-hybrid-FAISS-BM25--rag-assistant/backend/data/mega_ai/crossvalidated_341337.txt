You are getting good advice, but as your experience widens, it will diversify. Other possibilities include: Scientists should have considerable subject-matter expertise, for example on measurement and what kind of relationships make physical (biological, whatever) sense. Showing that you respect their expertise is a natural and congenial way to establish a good relationship. Scientists may know statistical stuff you don't. For example, most astronomers know more about irregular time series and non-detection problems than many statisticians do. Many fields use circular statistics, which even a full statistical education rarely includes. Graphs are often a lingua franca . Curiously or not, economists often distrust graphs as they are schooled to treat statistics in a highly formal fashion (your mileage may vary) and to avoid subjectivity (meaning, judgement). Sometimes you need to back off. If scientists don't know what they expect, but merely ask for the analysis or something that's publishable, they're wasting your time and you've better things to do. If the data are a haphazard mess, then they can't be rescued by any smart analysis. Always establish an escape route. Your conditions could include (a) agreeing only to preliminary discussion (b) a limit on your time or other commitment (c) the right to back off if they won't follow your advice (d) some kind of idea on conditions for co-authorship. Beware the situation when a scientist just keeps coming back for a little more. Also, beware the situation in which you're treated like a person from the gas company or a plumber: you are called in to clear up a mess but they feel no obligation to maintain a relationship once that's done. I am not a statistician but write from experience in so far as I know more statistics than most of my scientist colleagues. If each party respects the other, the relationship can be highly fruitful.
