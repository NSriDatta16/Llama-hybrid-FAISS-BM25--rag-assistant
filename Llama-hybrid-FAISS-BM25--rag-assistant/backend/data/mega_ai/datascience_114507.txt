How to calculate a trend to use as a feature in a machine learning model?

In a machine learning model one of the features is unemployment: Month Unemployment May-2022 3.6% Jun-2022 3.7% Jul-2022 3.8% Aug-2022 3.9% What I need is to use as an additional feature the trend in the last three months, in this case it went up 0.1% each month, so the trend would be 0.3%? Note that I'm not looking to calculate the moving average.
