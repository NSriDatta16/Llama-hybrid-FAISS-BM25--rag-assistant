Chernoff Bound: Prove that $P[u \geq \alpha] \leq (e^{-s\alpha} U(s))^N$

Let $u_1, ..., u_N$ be random variables, and let $u = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N u_n$. If $U(s) = E_{u_n}(e^{su_n})$ (for any $n$), prove that $P[u \geq \alpha] \leq (e^{-s\alpha} U(s))^N$. $s > 0$ and $\alpha$ is a positive constant. E is the expectation. P is the probability. I can show that for one variable case, $P(u \geq \alpha) \leq e^{-s\alpha}E_{u}(e^{su})$. However, I can't relate it to the case when we take the weighted average of the random variable.
