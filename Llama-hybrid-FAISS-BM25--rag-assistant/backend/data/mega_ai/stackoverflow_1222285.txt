See the FAQ How do I create arrays in a HTML ? So in your case a request of: ?FormSub=Submit&qty[]=1&partno[]=ipod&notes[]=apple&unitprice[]=102.99&rowid[]=1&qty[]=2&partno[]=Ear+Buds&notes[]=Headphones&unitprice[]=45.99&rowid[]=2 would create an array of the form: array( 'FormSub' => 'Submit', 'qty' => array( 0 => '1', 1 => '2' ), 'partno' => array( 0 => 'ipod', 1 => 'Ear Buds' ), 'notes' => array( 0 => 'apple', 1 => 'Headphones' ), 'unitprice' => array( 0 => '102.99', 1 => '45.99' ), 'rowid' => array( 0 => '1', 1 => '2' ) ) But I hope you donâ€™t accept those values without validation or even use it for an actual order. Additionally GET is intended to be used for data retrieval only : In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. For requests with side effects (alteration of data on the server) you should use POST.
