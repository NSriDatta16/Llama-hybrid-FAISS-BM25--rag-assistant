SVM classifier unexpected result without cost

I am new to SVM , and I was playing with a random data which I got by simulation. I have a bivariate data like this Data : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/190aiCNyHXrBGwHP9UleDStNXO_9NIvlNKRQ39_a9V-Y/edit?usp=sharing I have to separate the red and yellow points. By trial and error I found that a separation exists. (The black line in the middle is a circle at radius 0.9 that separates the red and yellow, although it may not be the best one) I applied the transformation $ x3 = x1^2+x2^2 $ to introduce a 3rd axis in order to apply a linear separator. You can see that even in 3D, a plane can be found that separates the blue and red points Here is the code that I used mod = e1071::svm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3, data = x, kernel = "linear",scale = FALSE) w $coefs) %*% mod$ SV slope_1 And using the results from R, the plane of separation is obtained as $z = 0.2274170x -0.2404045y+0.8795599$ which is a slanted plane as below: We can see that this plane causes couple of misclassifications and is way too slanted (has slope along x and y axis) If I give cost argument as 20 in the svm( ) function mod = e1071::svm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3, data = x, kernel = "linear",scale = FALSE, cost=20) I get the surface: $z = 0.018550588x -0.002184182y + 0.8475362$ Which perfectly separates both regions. This new surface is almost parallel to xy plane as has no misclassifications. So why did R not give a better surface that separates both reigons without the cost function even though a plane could be determined without any misclassification?
