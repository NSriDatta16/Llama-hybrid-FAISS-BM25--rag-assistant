This is one of those classic "it depends" questions. You certainly want to eliminate technologies that are demonstrably wrong for your project -- you know, like ActiveX for a web site that you'd like Mac users to be able to use :-) But eliminating the mismatches is pretty easy. And things after that are fairly subjective. The only way to narrow them down is to make some choice. For example: support a wide range of mobile devices. Which ones, exactly? If you want to target multiple platforms, you're almost certainly talking about a web app -- perhaps you've already decided that. Beyond the specifics of your requirements, which ought to help narrow things down, to me the question is, who is going to actually code it? It makes sense to do your best to leverage whatever those folks already know. In short, it's hard to answer the "best" question in a vacuum. There will be a dozen combinations of tools and technologies that can do what you want. To choose among them, you need to use your specific requirements and resources to whittle down the list.
