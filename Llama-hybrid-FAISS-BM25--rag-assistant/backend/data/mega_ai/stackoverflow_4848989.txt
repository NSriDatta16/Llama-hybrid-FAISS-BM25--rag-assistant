Somewhat similar to the macro option (3), but without the disadvantages of a macro, you can make specific functions inline , which will typically result in the desired constant optimizations. Of course this only helps if you're calling the relevant functions from one place (or from a few places), otherwise code bloat becomes an issue. Note that gcc has a provision for forcing specific inline functions to always be inlined (rather than leaving this to the compiler's discretion): __attribute__ ((always_inline)) . Other compilers will typically have a similar mechanism, although it may be a command line switch or a pragma.
