For timeseries, see the function rollmean in the zoo package. You actually don't calculate a moving average, but some kind of a weighted cumulative average. A (weighted) moving average would be something like : price Make sure you rescale the weights so they sum to the amount of observations. For your own calculation, you could try something like : MAt This calculates the averages as linear combinations of MAt, with weights defined by the cumulative product of alpha. On a sidenote : I assumed the index to lie somewhere between 0 and 1.
