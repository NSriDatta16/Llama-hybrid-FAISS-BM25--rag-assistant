Are there any machine learning algorithms that are specifically designed for processing data with low signal to noise ratio?

I have a dataset which is made up of 62 features and 1 set of labels, all of which are percentiles. The signal to noise ratio is low. If I were to do a simple balanced classification, if I could achieve a 55% accuracy that would be great. I've made a few attempts at training a model using XGBoost and a random forest algorithm. Neither have achieved any sort of accuracy that is statistically difference from randomness. I admit I haven't really done much research on which machine learning techniques are necessary for low signalto noise data... I just used XGBoost because it wins all the competitions. Does anyone have any advice on where to start? Are there machine learning algorithms that are designed specifically for low signal data?
