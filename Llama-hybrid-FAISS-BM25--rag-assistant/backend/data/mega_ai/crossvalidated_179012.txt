Imputation during pre-processing in data mining

I'm trying to comprehend the most appropriate way to utilize machine learning imputation (e.g., KNN) as a pre-processing step in data mining, and I've run into a few questions that don't have clear answers in any of the sources I've read. Imagine this scenario: you have a single data set of some size (small/medium/large), and you're trying to classify a binary outcome variable using 10 features, with some degree of missingness in the data (5%/10%/20%). The data has not been split into any partitions yet. In the end, you will want to compare the performance of several different classification algorithms against one another. 1) To what degree does using imputation on our feature set influence our final results? 2) At what point in the data splitting process does imputation have to occur? 3) To what extent do sample size and degree of missingness influence the choice of imputation algorithm?
