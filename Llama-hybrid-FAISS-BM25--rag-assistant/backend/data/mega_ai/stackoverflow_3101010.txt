FreeBSD takes another approach. It never passes TCP or UDP packets to raw sockets. Such packets need to be read directly at the datalink layer by using libraries like libpcap or the bpf API. It also never passes any fragmented datagram. Each datagram has to be completeley reassembled before it is passed to a raw socket. this might go for OSX as well Source: http://sock-raw.org/papers/sock_raw
