In OS X you can access a USB device from user space and request it to suspend. You can find a general example in the USB Device Interface Guide . You will need to use the IOUSBDeviceInterface182 (or higher) USBDeviceSuspend method. Note: Hubs and controller ports may have ganged power supplies, meaning the same switch is shared by multiple ports. if this is the case and your device is in the same group as another active device, it will not be powered down.
