See the following comment about the std::string c_str() member function from cplusplus.com : The returned array points to an internal location with the required storage space for this sequence of characters plus its terminating null-character, but the values in this array should not be modified in the program and are only granted to remain unchanged until the next call to a non-constant member function of the string object. Although you don't call any non-const member functions in the code that you posted, this is not a very good idea. When you modify the private std::sting test variable in the RefPtrTest class, you inadvertently affect the StoringClass class (this violates encapsulation of RefPtrTest). Somebody maintaining your code later (maybe you) may not realize this and introduce a bug/crash.
