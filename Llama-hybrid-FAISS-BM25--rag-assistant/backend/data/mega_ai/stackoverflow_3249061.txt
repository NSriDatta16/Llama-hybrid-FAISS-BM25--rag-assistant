Dojo abort drag/drop operation in dnd/drop/before

I wanted to know if there is a way I can abort the default drop operation in dojo. I am doing some custom manipulation in the function, dojo.subscribe("/dnd/drop/before", function(source, nodes, iscopy){ //Custom manipulation }); And from this function, I want to cancel the drop, similar to what happens when you press the Esc Key? Thanks
