U-net outputs a segmentation, i.e. a binary map. If you want to get the number of objects detected, the most straightforward approach would be to compute the connected components of your binary maps. But as you mention, overlapping object might be a problem. There are CNN specifically design for this task. For instance: http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Stewart_End-To-End_People_Detection_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf which uses LSTM (recurrent network) or https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07999.pdf which is designed for 3D. I hope this helps!
