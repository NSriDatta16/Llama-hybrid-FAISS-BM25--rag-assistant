question about polymorphic association

Now I'm dealing with the video's thumbnail file. I want to use a polymorphic association: class Picture true end class Video true has_many :pictures, :as => :pictureable # I want to use has_one :picture, :as => :picturealbe, it make sense to let each video have a single picture as thumbnail but it doesn't work for me, video.picture return a nil end class Drummer :videoable has_many :pictures, :as => :pictureable end and I want to use this to display all the video with it's thumbnail event place I got this error in the development log file: ActionView::Template::Error (Couldn't find Picture with ID=1 [WHERE ("pictures".pictureable_id = 3 AND "pictures".pictureable_type = 'Video')]): 92: 93: 94: 95: 96: 97: 98: event place app/views/drummers/show.html.erb:95:in `block (2 levels) in _app_views_drummers_show_html_erb___754323413_3886850_892596806' app/views/drummers/show.html.erb:94:in `block in _app_views_drummers_show_html_erb___754323413_3886850_892596806' app/views/drummers/show.html.erb:92:in `_app_views_drummers_show_html_erb___754323413_3886850_892596806' my solution is not elegant at all, But I can't come up with a better idea any suggestion? thanks everyone
