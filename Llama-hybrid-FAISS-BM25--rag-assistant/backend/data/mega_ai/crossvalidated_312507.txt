It's not real clear why you'd want to do such an analysis, but your approach does seem to accomplish that. Essentially, you are determining whether and to what extent a particular y_pred differs from y with a 2-parameter vs 3-parameter model. But, note that it is difficult to assign any meaning to this difference. If a particular point's residual is smaller with 3 parameters than 2, it does not mean that there is something special about the relationship between the 3rd predictor and that point - it is a function of the overall fit, and thus the rest of the data. You might consider turning to influence/leverage analysis if you are interested in how much particular points sway the fit.
