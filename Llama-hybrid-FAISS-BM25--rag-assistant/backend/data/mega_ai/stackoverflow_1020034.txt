You will need to lock the target range (setting the Locked property of the Range to true ). Then you will need to protect the sheet by calling the Protect() method of your worksheet. Below are examples of how to lock and unlock the cells A1:A4 . Locks: Sheet1.Range("A1:A4").Locked = true Sheet1.Protect() Unlocks: Sheet1.Unprotect() Edit : After re-reading the question, it seems as though the OP is using the Worksheet_Change event. To which I have one word: STOP Just put in an ActiveX button into the sheet, and then assign a macro to that, as described here . The Worksheet_Change event is fraught with peril. Beware ye who enter, for there be dragons.
