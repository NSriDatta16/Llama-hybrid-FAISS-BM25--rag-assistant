If I understand the question correctly, I think this question can be formulated as a function approximation problem. Where we are approximate the mean and standard deviation function with a Neural Network. Here is a useful reference. To build such a neural network, we need to generate data for training. Let's assume your network has 100 inputs. We can do following steps to generate the training data. Randomly generate 100 numbers N times. For each time, calculate expected outcome (mean and standard deviation) Put these N numbers with expected outcome to neural network for training. Note, the relationship with Maximize likelihood can be described as follows: we can prove the empirical mean and empirical standard deviation is the MLE estimation of the true parameters (Assuming Gaussian Distribution).
