Python - iterate through list in threaded script

I am trying to write a threaded Python script which will iterate through a list of urls and open each one in a separate thread. from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup from threading import Thread import mechanize tickers = ["aapl", "siri", "goog", "intc"] nextTicker = 0 def quotes(i): br = mechanize.Browser() br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10')] r= br.open('http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=' + tickers[nextTicker]) html = r.read() soup = BeautifulSoup(html) price = soup.findAll('span', attrs={"id":"yfs_l10_" + tickers[nextTicker]}) price = price[0].string print price for i in range(4): t = Thread(target=quotes, args=(i,)) t.start() I know that I need a nextTicker = nextTicker + 1 in there so that each thread will grab a unique ticker symbol from the list named tickers but I am not sure where to put this or how to ensure that each thread is getting a unique url. Right now when the script runs it just grabs the index 0 item from the list for all four threads. How do I get each thread to grab the next item in the list and append it to my base url?
