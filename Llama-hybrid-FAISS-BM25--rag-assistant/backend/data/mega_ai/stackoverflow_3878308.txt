Try changing the mechanize flag to not respect robots.txt. Also, consider changing the User-Agent HTTP header: >>> import mechanize >>> br = mechanize.Browser() >>> br.set_handle_robots(False) >>> br.addheaders = [('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)')] Web servers will now treat you like you were running MS Internet Explorer 6, rather than a bot. Even if they do restrict you with robots.txt, your bot will continue to work until it is blocked. >>> br.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_tyson') >> #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
