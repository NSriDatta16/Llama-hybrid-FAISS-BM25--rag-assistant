Re: EDIT A while back when I began using the jQuery UI, the CSS that came with the download was causing my calenders to render at 150% the size that I expected them to. Through their site, I had to change the font sizes and padding to the CSS and then re-download it all. If the spacing is off, it sounds like there may be some padding-left applied somewhere. I had that same problem initially, but changing the ui.tabs.css like below worked: .ui-tabs { padding: .2em; zoom: 1; font-size: 80% !important; }
