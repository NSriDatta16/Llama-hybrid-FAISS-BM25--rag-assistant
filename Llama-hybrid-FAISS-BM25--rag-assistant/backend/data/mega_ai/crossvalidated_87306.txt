Yes. In logistic regression, the coefficient estimates for non-intercept terms $\beta_1$...$\beta_n$ should be unbiased even when oversampling events. The intercept, however, is not. There's a few methods for recovering an unbiased intercept coefficient in King and Zheng (2001) [an accesible PDF is a google away] if you need that. You should be using the risk from the population at large. As mentioned, the intercept is not unbiased. Furthermore, even when not oversampled, the intercept is usually not an estimate of the base risk (it's the estimate when all $X=0$, so only in the case where you have all continuous predictors and have centered them).
