@JaredPar gives an excellent answer . Under some circumstances, though, it may not we worth rewriting code to be multi-threaded. Multithreaded code is more complicated, and adds a whole slew of additional types of bugs to wrestle with. However, in the simple case of a desktop application, it is sometimes worth leaving the second core of a dual core machine free, so that the operating system can use it for doing things like redrawing the screen for other applications, running the virus scanner, etc. Not the answer you particularly wanted to hear, but a pragmatic one in certain cases nevertheless.
