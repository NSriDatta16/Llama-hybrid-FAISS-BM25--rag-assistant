In your current code, nothing is really done with the input by the clients, and the behaviour does not match your description of it. What is this supposed to do?: for(int i=0;i This will look for each character in the input (seeing as you use 1000 here, and the buffer can be 1024 characters, you are missing the last 24 characters) and return how many times it occurs in "info.txt". Note that you will also do a search for the NUL character ('\0'). Besides these carelessnesses it doesn't really do anything. I assume you just want to find the string in the file, and work with the line number? You need a different method of searching strings. There are some clever and less clever algorithms for that. One of the more 'brute' algorithms is: Search for the first character Keep some flag as 'true' as long as all next characters match the expected character If some character violates the match, go to the next search of the first character Note that there are more efficient algorithms than this. I did not scrutinize your network setup, assuming it works. It would be a good idea to either split the code up into several paragraphs using some more whitespace, or put the network setup into a different function.
