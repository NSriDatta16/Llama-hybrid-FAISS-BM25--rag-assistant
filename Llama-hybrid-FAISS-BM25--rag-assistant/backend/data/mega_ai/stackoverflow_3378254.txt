This is a mathematical problem but there is too little information in the question to properly answer. Depending on distribution of your real data you may try to find a function that it follows. You can also try to interpolate data using artificial neural network but that would be complex. The thing is that to find interpolations you need to analyze data you already have and that defeats the purpose. There is probably more to this problem but not explained. What is the nature of the data? Can you place it in n-dimensional space? What do you expect to get from analysis?
