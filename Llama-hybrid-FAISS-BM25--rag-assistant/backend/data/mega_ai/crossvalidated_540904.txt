EDIT : I have removed my code because Jarle has pointed out that coverage statements are conditional on the predictor of a new point remaining fixed. My simulation was hence incorrect, and I encourage readers to read his answer instead. You are describing the process for validating coverage of a confidence interval. This will not give you 95% coverage of a new observation. The reason is easy to argue. The width of the confidence interval is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{n}$ . Quadruple the sample and, ceteris paribus , the width of the interval decreases by a factor of 2. This means we can make the interval arbitrarily small by taking more samples. However, taking more data does not change the data generating process; the residual variance remains unchanged. This means the coverage of the confidence interval for a new observation will be woefully below the nominal because a confidence interval is a measure of uncertainty at the level of the estimate, not of the data generating process. A prediction interval incorporates uncertainty in the estimate and the data generating processes. Here is a good tutorial on prediction intervals for OLS in R and python.
