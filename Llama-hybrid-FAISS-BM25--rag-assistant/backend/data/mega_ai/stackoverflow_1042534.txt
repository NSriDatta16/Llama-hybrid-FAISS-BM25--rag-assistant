What do you mean access it from another function? What exactly are you accessing? Do you make a new 'classdelcappero'? You have only declared 'chepalle' and 'frasehiragana' within your Page_Load so their scope ends at the end of that method. Finally you aren't changing the 'frasehiragana' of your 'chepalle' instance (you are just setting a new string) and even if you were you would just be setting it to what it is already by default (String.empty). One possibility is to have a 'classdelcappero' instance within your page code-behind class. This is set on Page_Load based on a session property (a cookie, the IP, something belonging to your user that you are using to distinguish them). Then any function can just refer to this instance knowing it is already initialised correctly. For example: class CodeBehind : Page { private classdelcappero chepalle; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { chepalle = new classedelcappero(); chepalle.frasehiragana = ""; /* value based on user */ } }
