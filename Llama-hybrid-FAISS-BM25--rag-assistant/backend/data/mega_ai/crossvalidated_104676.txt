On slide 2, they assume that $X,Y$ being only normally distributed. Then if $\rho=0$, which is exactly their correlation parameter, their estimated correlation would be $r=0$ on average naturally, so its mean $0$ aswell. Why $r$ would also be normally distributed usually requires a longer proof. It may be related to the central limit theorem, that the mean is normally distributed for $n\rightarrow \infty$.
