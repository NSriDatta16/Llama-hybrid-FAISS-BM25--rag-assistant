The situation that you describe sound like simple treatment effect story, where the exogenous binary shock represent the treatment. If you have the shock $T=1$ , otherwise $T=0$ . The blue line represent the level of $x$ , your outcome variable. In time series sense $x$ seems stationary , so it come back to the long run mean, then the effect of the shocks is not permanent. So you can simply compute the difference in the conditional means $E[x|T=1]-E[x|T=0]$ and it represent the average causal effect (ACE) of the treatment/shock Note that you assume exogeneity of the shocks (treatments), like in idealized experiment situations, therefore selection bias disappear. Probably you refers on observational situations and among them the endogeneity by confounding variables represent the main problem. Causal effect in stationary time series can be more exhaustively treated with autoregressive distributed lag models (see for example Econometrics - Verbeek 2017 chap 9.1)
