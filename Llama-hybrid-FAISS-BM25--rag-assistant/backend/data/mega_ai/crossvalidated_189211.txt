You could definitely use softmax with only 2 classes "Face" and "Not Face" and interpret the softmax output as confidence scores, which is a nice feature to get some intuition about your deep net. Try both 2-class softmax and binary hinge loss. There's a recent paper Deep Learning using Linear Support Vector Machines using an SVM instead of a softmax classifier on top of deep conv nets and there's some promising results there.
