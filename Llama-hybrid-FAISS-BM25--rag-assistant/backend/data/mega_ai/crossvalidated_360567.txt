If you are analysing correlation coefficients and the summary estimate is negative then a moderator with a negative coefficient corresponds to the statement that studies with a high value of the moderator (in this case age) have more negative correlations. You are using the robumeta package so you are doing a meta-analysis of summary statistics. This is, therefore, an ecological finding since you appear to be using mean age (or some other summary of age like the median) in the study as the moderator so it does not mean that older people have more negative correlations but that studies with on average older people tend to have more negative correlations.
