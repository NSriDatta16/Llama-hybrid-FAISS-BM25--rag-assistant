Accept a pdf page drop into a C# windows form application

I am trying to allow users to drag a page from a PDF pages tab into a C# listbox control. The only information I need from acrobat is the file name of the document they are dragging from and the page number/numbers they have dragged over. I tried finding out this information from the debugger(add a break point at my dragenter event handler then look at the dragEventArgs). From that I see a Forms.DataObject but that seems to have no public properties. My questions: Does the DataObject hold the PDF file name and the selected pages that are being draged over? Is this information accessible? If it is not accessible this way is there a work around? Thanks for any help you can share. Will
