You can always use a RAMdisk for your MySQL installation if your database footprint is small enough. One way to make your tables small enough to fit is to create them as MyISAM ARCHIVE tables. While they are very compact, compressed, they can only be appended to or read from, but not updated. ( http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/storage-engine.html ) Generally a properly indexed and well organized MySQL table is really fast, especially when using MyISAM, and even more so when loaded from memory. They key is in denormalizing the data as heavily as you can optimizing for your particular read scenarios. For example, having a stock_id, date, price tuple is going to be fairly slow to sort and retrieve. If you have, instead, stock_id and a column with some serialized data, the retrieval time will be very quick. Another solution that is likely faster is to push all the data into an alternative DBMS like Toyko Cabinet or something similar, especially if your data fits neatly into a key/value store.
