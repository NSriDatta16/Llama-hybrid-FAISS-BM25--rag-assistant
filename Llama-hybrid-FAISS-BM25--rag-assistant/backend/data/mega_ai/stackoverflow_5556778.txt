Is there a way to get the subject of a sentence using OpenNLP?

Is there a way to get the subject of a sentence using OpenNLP? I'm trying to identify the most important part of a users sentence. Generally, users will be submitting sentences to our "engine" and we want to know exactly what the core topic is of that sentence. Currently we are using openNlp to: Chunk the sentence Identify the noun-phrase, verbs, etc of the sentence Identify all "topics" of the sentence (NOT YET DONE!) Identify the "core topic" of the sentence Please let me know if you have any bright ideas..
