This isn't an answer to your direct question but it may be helpful to you in the future. First, if you find that one rule is superceding another, pay attention to the natural priority of CSS rules within a stylesheet and for the prioritization of inline css > external css. Second, if you ever want a rule to take priority, you can do: #contactarea p.heading { color:yellow !important; }
