C# HTTP Request Parser

Possible Duplicate: Converting Raw HTTP Request into HTTPWebRequest Object I've got a custom HTTP server written in C# which gives me the raw HTTP request... GET /ACTION=TEST HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:8080 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-gb,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Is there something in the .NET framework that I can use to parse it or do I have to do it by hand? Cheers
