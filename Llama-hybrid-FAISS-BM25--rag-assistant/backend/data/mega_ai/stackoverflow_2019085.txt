What is the meaning of the small "6" on some Domino agents?

Some agents in an ancient Lotus Notes application has a difference in agent-enabled behaviour that I cannot explain: This is the agent list read in R7.0.3: Enabled agents in R7, notice the small "6" http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/a167158e29.png Here is the agents in the same database, read with R8.5: Enabled agents in R8, seems disabled. http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/cc042913f1.png I've checked the following but haven't found any difference between the agents: Inheritance: They inherit from the same template, no prohibit flag set. User activation: They all allow user activation Language: They are all LotusScript agents. $flags are the same on all three documents. There is a difference in trigger : The Auto-unlock agent is triggered on document modification, the others on schedule. There is also a difference in that the ones with a "6" seems to have been exposed to CIAO - but even if the Notes client CIAO-aware that still leaves the difference between R7 and R8 to explanation. So, why is there a 6 in the agent checkmark on R7?
