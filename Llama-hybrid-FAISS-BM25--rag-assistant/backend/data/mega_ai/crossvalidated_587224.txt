This sounds similar to a problem in finance / stock index arbitrage, where one may want to "sample" a small number of assets in a large portfolio to estimate (or "track") the performance (weighted investment return) of a larger portfolio. E.g., "track" the performance of a 1000 stock portfolio with a 50 stock portfolio. This problem is "easy" if $m=N$ , "sample" every case. With $m , one approach that works pretty well in practice but is not provably optimal (with the method described below) is to sample using the inverse cumulative distribution method ; and to consider two phases. Sort the cases by declining weight. In the first phase , select immediately all cases (stocks) with weight exceeding what you hope to represent in the remaining samples, for instance at first iteration, select the largest weighted case if $w_1 \ge \frac{1}{m}$ . At the second iteration select the largest remaining case if $w_2 \ge \frac{1-w_1}{m-1}$ $\ldots$ When $w_{J+1} , in phase two , sample $m-J$ cases identified by samples from the uniform distribution over the interval $\textrm{U}\left(\sum\limits_1^J w_j,1\right)$ and the inverse cumulative distribution function. When constructing a parameter estimate (e.g., portfolio return), use the exact weights $w_1 \ldots w_J$ for the large weight cases, and use the average residual weight $\tilde{w}=\frac{1-\sum\limits_1^J w_j}{m-J}$ for the sampled smaller cases. For example $\hat{\mu}_x = \sum\limits_1^J \left(w_j x_j\right) + \sum\limits_{J+1}^{m}\left(\tilde{w} x_j\right)$ . A final "trick" to consider with $K$ multiple samples of size $m$ is to use antithetic variates when selecting $m-J$ uniform variates for the smaller weighted cases in the distinct $K$ repeats.
