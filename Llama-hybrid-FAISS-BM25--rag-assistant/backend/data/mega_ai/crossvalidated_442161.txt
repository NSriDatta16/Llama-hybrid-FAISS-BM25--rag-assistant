Genetic algorithms are a good way to do architecture search for you (if you have a lot of compute power, it is a great way to let it search the best architecture for you). There are 2 main concepts - cross over and mutation (as proposed by Stanley) that help neural networks to evolve into new generations which have hopefully richer "genetic diversity" (the types of net architecture) and are more "fit" (less loss). Stanley's paper on NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting topologies gives an easy to read clear picture on this).
