I am trying to create a new custom module in magento but the layout is not loading. It always load three column layout which is defined as a default in page.xml file. I think it is not considering the layout set for my module action even if it is mentioned in the config.xml file like this- standard Mynamespace_Test test test.xml and my test.xml looks like this:- Test module page/2columns-right.phtml and my controller is defined like this:- class mynamespace_Test_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action { function indexAction() { $this->loadLayout(); $this->renderLayout(); } } Please help! what I am missing. Thanks
