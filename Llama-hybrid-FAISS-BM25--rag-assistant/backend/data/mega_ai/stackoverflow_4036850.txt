I don't think a 500 error page is very meaningful to your average user. At least tell him something is wrong with your page and guide him back on the right track by providing a link to get back to your site. Sometimes I redirect users to a page that is likely to what he wanted. So when a query goes below zero and this is not permitted, redirect your user to ?page=0 and maybe display a message on top of that page. I think you should prefer this method because it is a better approach in terms of user experience to not use modal windows.
