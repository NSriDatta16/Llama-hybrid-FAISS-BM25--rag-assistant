I've found this approach to work. Recording it here so that it helps someone else. Create a Content Template for the DraggablePushpin from above link so that it only contains a DraggableButton(below). inherit from Button to create a DraggableButton (referenced in the template above) In this DraggableButton, override the OnMouseLeftButtonDown and the OnMouseLeftButtonUp and pass them to the DraggablePushpin. I created a property called ThePin on the DraggableButton and set that in the OnApplyTemplate method of the DraggablePushpin. You can call GetTemplateChild() in OnApplyTemplate to get a reference to the DraggableButton instance in the pushpin. The DraggableButton can now override the Click event for custom actions and also pass through the other events to the DraggablePushpin so that it works as expected. There maybe a cleaner way to do this, but this is what worked for me.
