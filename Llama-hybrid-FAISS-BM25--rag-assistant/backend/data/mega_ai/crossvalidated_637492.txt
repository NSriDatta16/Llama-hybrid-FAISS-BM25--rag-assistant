A hurdle model has this characteristic. Here's the summary from the link: Hurdle models were introduced by John G. Cragg in 1971, where the non-zero values of x were modelled using a normal model, and a probit model was used to model the zeros. The probit part of the model was said to model the presence of "hurdles" that must be overcome for the values of x to attain non-zero values, hence the designation hurdle model. Hurdle models were later developed for count data, with Poisson, geometric, and negative binomial models for the non-zero counts.
