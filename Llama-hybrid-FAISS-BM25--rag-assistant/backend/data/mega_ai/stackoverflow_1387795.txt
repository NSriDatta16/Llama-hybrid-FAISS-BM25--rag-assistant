jQuery JavaScript overlapping id's

I am dragging and dropping elements using jQuery. I have three div's div a and div b and div c. I am dropping div a and div b over div c But when I drop div a over div c then it says it has been dropped on div c. How can I find out that div a has been dropped o div b.
