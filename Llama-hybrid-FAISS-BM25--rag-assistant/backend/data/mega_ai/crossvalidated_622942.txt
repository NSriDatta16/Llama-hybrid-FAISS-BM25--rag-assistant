Had the exact same question. I knew that Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used for regression, but wasn't sure whether this extends to a Poisson regression (GLM) for count data. Unfortunately the link in the comments gives not much information what was done and how. Found a paper in the Annals of Data Science from Sidumo et al. (2021) titled Count Regression and Machine Learning Techniques for Zero-Inflated Overdispersed Count Data: Application to Ecological Data . The paper should be open access, but here still the quick details: The authors compared a Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a Gaussian radial basis function kernel to classical statistical models for count data, i.e. a Poisson, a negative binomial, a zero-inflated Poisson and a zero-inflated negative binomial model. The Gaussian radial basis function kernel is used to model the non-linear relationship between the predictors and outcome. They found that the SVR had the lowest mean absolute error out of all the models. So SVR outperformed the classical statistical methods for a dataset about fish species. So yes, it is possible to use an SVR on count data.
