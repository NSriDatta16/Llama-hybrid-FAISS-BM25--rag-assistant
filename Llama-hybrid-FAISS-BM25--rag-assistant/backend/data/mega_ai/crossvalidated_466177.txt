Measuring quality of a timeseries model

I want to create a model predicting whether an event will happen (let's say if Player A wins a match of ping-pong) conditional on a state (current score of the match). I have already developed a Markov chain model (implementing rules of ping-pong, iid assumption about individual points and saying that probability of Player A to win a single point is p ), that can be used to calculate $$P[A_{win} | State = s_i].$$ My plan is to experiment a little bit with Machine Learning and try to use decision trees or neural networks to predict the same thing and see if my predictions can get any better. I have a dataset of matches (each one is point-by-point, i.e. a sequence of scores) and their outcomes (if Player A won) The question is: How would you measure the quality of such model? Does Average of (average of log-losses over all states of one match) over all matches make any sense? What are other possible metrics? If I train the model so that it predicts the outcome, will it learn the distribution (will it return probability?)? Could RNNs be of any use? Any recommendations/sources to read are welcome! Thanks :)
