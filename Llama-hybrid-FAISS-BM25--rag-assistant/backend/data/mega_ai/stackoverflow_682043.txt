JcomboBox has no border?

When my program starts up, the comboboxes (there are 2 that are having this problem) do show up. However, when I click on the arrow one item (there should be 7 items showing) shows up and there is no border around the list. If I drag my mouse over the area all the other items appear, but still no border. This is only happening at our warehouse which is about 400 yards from the main office. We have fiber going over there and are on the same LAN. I'm not sure if this is a network issue or a java issue. Any help is very much appreciated. Chris
