The standard method of doing this (at least in machine learning) is defining a loss function which penalizes overshooting more than undershooting. For example, if the actual payment is $x$ and the forecasted payment is $\hat{x}$, then standard regression minimizes $E[(x-\hat{x})^2]$ where the loss function is the quadratic loss function, $(x-\hat{x})^2$. To penalize overshooting more than undershooting, you can define the piecewise loss function \begin{cases} L(x,\hat{x})=(x-\hat{x})^2 & x>\hat{x} \\ L(x,\hat{x})=c(x-\hat{x})^2 & x\leq \hat{x}, c>1 \end{cases} and have your model/algorithm minimize that.
