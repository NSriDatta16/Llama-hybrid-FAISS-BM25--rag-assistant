I think by typecasting the void **data based upon the *fmt would do the trick. I am not sure if I understand your question correctly. Because you can you can put a switch-case statement based upon *fmt for typcasting, and then use **data as 2-D array to print it. Use rows/columns as index of the 2-D array.
