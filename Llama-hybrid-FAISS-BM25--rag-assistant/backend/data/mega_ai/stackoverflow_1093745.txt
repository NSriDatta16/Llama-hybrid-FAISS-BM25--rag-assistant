I post a fragment from Stroustrup's The Design and Evolution of C++ , 2.10 The Protection Model, pg. 53. [...] A friendship declaration was seen as a mechanism similar to that of one protection domain granting a read-write capability to another. It is an explicit and specific part of a class declaration. Consequently, I have never been able to see the recurring assertions that a friend declaration "violates encapsulation" as anything but a combination of ignorance and confusion with non-C++ terminology.
