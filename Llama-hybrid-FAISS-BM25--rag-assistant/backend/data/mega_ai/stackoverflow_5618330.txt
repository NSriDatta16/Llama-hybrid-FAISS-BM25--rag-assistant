An absolute URL has the protocol, host, etc, such as... https://example:8080/path?a=b#fragment A relative URL omits the protocol, host, port, username, password, etc, and it will be resolved to an absolute URL generally by the context it is in... path?a=b#fragment If this relative URL was included on http://example.com/abc , it would point to http://example.com/abc/path?a=b#fragment . You can read the RFC for more in depth knowledge.
