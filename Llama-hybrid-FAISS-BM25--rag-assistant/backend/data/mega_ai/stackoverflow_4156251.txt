Has anyone deployed a .NET WinForms application to Japan

Do any developers out there have any experience developing and deploying a .NET Windows Forms application to Japan, using Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana Japanese language scripts? I am wondering what impacts need to be considered for validating data, inserting/updating, searching and sorting data using SQL Server 2008. What are some things to look out for other than setting the .NET culture namespace along with using resx files to display language values on windows forms. Any information and guidance in this area is appreciated. Thanks!
