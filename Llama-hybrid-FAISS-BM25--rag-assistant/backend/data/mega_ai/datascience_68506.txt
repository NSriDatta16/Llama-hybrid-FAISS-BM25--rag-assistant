This metric is usually referred to as a sample-based or example-based score and can be applied in multi-label cases (to recall and other scores too). You can find a brief explanation here . Scikit learn has an implementation for it (see here for recall) when setting average='samples' for recall_score : 'samples' : Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from accuracy_score).
