Logistic regression on aggregated counts

Normally when we do logistic regression, we would have a dataset something like: X1 X2 Y 1: A 3 0 2: A 4 0 3: A 3 0 4: B 4 1 (4 observations) However, for some reasons, I only have the aggregated version: X1 X2 count Y_count 1: A 3 2 0 2: A 4 1 0 3: B 4 1 1 (i.e. a summary table. e.g. 2 records with X1 = A and X2 = 3 but the number of Y = 1 is 0) Now, I understand that I can simply replicate and do the logistic regression normal way; but my question is whether I can simply use the summary table to do logistic regression (potentially in R). Any implications? There're other posts of similar questions: here . Also I'm aware that "weights in logistic regression differs from ... weights in linear regression) ( ref )
