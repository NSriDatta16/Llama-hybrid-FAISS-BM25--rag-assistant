Discrete and continuous actions in the same environment

I am working on a RL environment that requires both discrete and continuous actions as input from the agent. I currently have a fine implementation of DDPG which I would like to use for the continuous part. But what about the discrete actions? Can DDPG output both a continuous and a discrete action? Or should I rather turn to a different algorithm? Thank you in advance.
