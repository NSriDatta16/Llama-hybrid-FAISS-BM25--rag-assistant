To add to what others have already said, "MyClass.class" is semantically identical to: Class.forName("MyClass", false, classloader); where "classloader" is the ClassLoader instance of the calling class. The main difference is in exception handling - with the above code fragment throws ClassNotFoundException, but I don't believe that MyClass.class can throw that (it may throw ClassDefNotFoundError, however, but that's a more general issue). Also, MyClass.class works with import statements, whereas Class.forname() requires you to pass in the fully-qualified class name. As I was reminded, MyClass.class does not initialize MyClass, so the static initializer won't be called.
