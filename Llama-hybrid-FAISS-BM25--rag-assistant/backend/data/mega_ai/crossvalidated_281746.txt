How to correctly interpret f-regression values during feature selection

I am new to machine learning. I would like to know how correctly interpret scikit-learn's f_regression values, in order to perform a good feature selection (I'm using f_regression as score function for SelectKBest() ). More precisely: Is a feature with a high value always better than one with a lower value? How should I interpret f_regression 's values when I am using categorical variables?
