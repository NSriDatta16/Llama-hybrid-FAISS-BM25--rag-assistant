Set the column structure as such... invoice_id == auto incremented invoice_year == YEAR(NOW()) invoice_customer_id == customer_id from customer table etc... ...and then display to the end users a concatenated id (2011-1-1234) in the view. It really seems like you need to organize the schema based on your output.
