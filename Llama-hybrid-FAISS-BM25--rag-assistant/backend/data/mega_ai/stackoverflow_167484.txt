Subversion makes it easier to branch than CVS (in GIT branches are even cheaper). I recommended that you make branches for major revisions, and have a planned merging of the branches back into the trunk. Be vary careful of going long periods of not merging back into the branch , as you it will become more and more difficult the longer you wait. There are also services out there that provide integrated bug tracking/deployment etc, if you need to get off the ground quickly, and don't want to manage all the server/setup stuff: http://beanstalkapp.com/ http://unfuddle.com/ http://www.assembla.com/ Some resources: This particular book answered a lot of the questions I had initially: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/svn/pragmatic-version-control-using-subversion Searching Further on stackoverflow: Good branching and merging tutorials for TortoiseSVN?
