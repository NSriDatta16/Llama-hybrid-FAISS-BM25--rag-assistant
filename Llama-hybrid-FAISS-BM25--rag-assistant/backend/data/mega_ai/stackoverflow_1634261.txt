C#: Not all code paths return a value

I am writing a simple WinForms application in which I allow the user to drag around TreeNodes in a TreeView control. One of the rules that I enforce is that the user is not allowed to drag a TreeNode into one of its own children. I wrote the following function in a recursive style to check for the parenthood of the destination node. Upon compilation, I get the error that not all code paths return a value for this function. As far as I can tell, I do have a return statement on every possible branch of this logic... but I'm obviously wrong. Can someone point out my error, please. private bool IsDestinationNodeAChildOfDraggingNode(TreeNode draggingNode, TreeNode destinationNode) { if (draggingNode.Nodes.Count == 0) return false; else { if (draggingNode.Nodes.Contains(destinationNode)) return true; else { foreach (TreeNode node in draggingNode.Nodes) return IsDestinationNodeAChildOfDraggingNode(node, destinationNode); } } }
