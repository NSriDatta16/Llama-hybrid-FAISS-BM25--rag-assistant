Limma model for incomplete factorial design

Currently, I'm trying to design an appropriate model for some gene expression data, to analyse it using limma . I've got a few questions regarding model design though. Let's assume that we've got the following data (stored in pData ): Sample Treatment Incubated 1 Naive No 2 Naive No 3 IFN Yes 4 LPS Yes 5 Naive Yes 6 Naive No 7 Naive Yes 8 IFN Yes 9 LPS Yes I'm thinking about the following model: mod = model.matrix(~pData$Treatment+pData$Incubated, data=pData), however, I'm not sure if it is going to work as intended. This is not a proper factorial design, since not every combination of conditions is observed. Is it possible to separate the effects of incubation and IFN (LPS) for such data? Is this model going to cut it? Treatment is a factor with levels "Naive", "IFN", "LPS" . Incubated is a factor with levels "No", "Yes" . Default column names of the design matrix ( mod ) are as follows: (Intercept) , pData$TreatmentIFN , pData$TreatmentLPS , pData$IncubatedYes . I can interpret the intercept, for each gene, as an average expression in naive and not incubated samples. How do I interpret, for example, pData$TreatmentIFN ? Is it an average IFN effect in reference to naive samples in general (that is, both naive-incubated and naive-not-incubated)? Or is it an average IFN effect in reference to the intercept (naive-not-incubated) only?
