Because you only have the population averages (so no data or at least variance) then what you can do is perform t-tests or linear regression ( t.test or lm ), to estimate your sample averages and their confidence intervals (for each variable). With this information you would check whether your sample confidence intervals contain your population averages. If they do then you can conclude that your sample approximates the population well.
