This is a problem in optimal control. But you only need a few tools to get a practical solution for your problem. 1) a way to estimate the time distribution of jobs from new customers. Plotting the hourly, daily, and weekly averages for instances of jobs from new customers will give you a feel for the periodicity of the distribution. Then you can fit the distribution to a time-dependent Poisson process, with terms for minute/hour/day/week. 2) quantification of your "loss function." Based on your statement I would imagine that your loss function will include a term penalizing concentrations of jobs in short time periods and a term penalizing time delays on jobs in a nonlinear fashion. Supposing $t_1,...,t_2$ represents the times at which jobs are executed, and $d_1,...,d_m$ represents the delays for job 1, job 2, etc., your loss function might look like $$ L = k_1 \sum_{i=1}^m (\sum_{j=1}^m I(t_i - t_j where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are positive constants, and $T$ is a 'critical' time period (like 5 minutes). 3) simulation of various control policies (scheduling of recurring jobs) to find their expected loss. Given a policy of running daily jobs at time $x_1,...,x_l$ you would draw from your distribution of new jobs to get times of new jobs $y_1,...,y_m$ (where $m$ is random). You can estimate the expected loss by doing the simulation many times and averaging the loss function over the runs.
