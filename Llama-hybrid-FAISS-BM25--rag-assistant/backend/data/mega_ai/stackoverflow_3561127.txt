Well, there is no definitive way to block access to that file. But you can use several measures to make it hard on manual overriding of the file. First thing you can do is lock the file (need to ensure OS compatibility) for as long as your application is running. Anyone can circumvent an OS file lock, but it is not trivial for an average user. Second, you can consider encrypting the file on application termination. Restoring the key can be done from application code inspection, but again - a non-trivial effort.
