It is not that the Xcode dont't like .js files. It does consider them else we would have not used .js files for javascriptexecution in webview. It is just that we need to add the .js file in Copy Bundle resource build phase under targets. Just drag your .js file into the copy bundle resource build phase. Thus Xcode will consider this file since it is now in the bulid phase bundle. I think we if we don't do the above step, we get a warning on building the code. I don't exactly remember the warning but it just said that Xcode cannot recognize .js file. Once the file is added to the build phase, you can use NSData *jsData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"global" ofType:@"js"]];
