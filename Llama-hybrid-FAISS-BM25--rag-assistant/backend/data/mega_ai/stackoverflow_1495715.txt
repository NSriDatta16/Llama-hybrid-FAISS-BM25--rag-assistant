I personally think it's more than just to save the bandwidth, it's also about proper architecture of the application (MVC model, important for code readability, handing over/taking over, etc), easier debugging experience (since the js are in a single file), and you can also make the app efficient by caching the js file if it doesn't change that often (no more download queues which may sometimes messed up the whole app if the js is not loaded in the right order) I believe there are a whole lot more reasons where you are encouraged to separate the js from the partial Hope it helps =)
