Use of smoothed target variable when evaluating forecasting performance

I am working on a forecasting model for the stock price using nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) with MATLAB software. I have achieved good performance and good results in the neural network model. For denoising, the variables (time series data) I have used SMA (simple moving average) for both input and target variables. Am I allowed to use the moving average for smoothing the output variable? Is it a big problem or challenge for interpreting my findings when I have used the data smoothing technique for my target (output) variable? Is it possible to interpret my result? My skepticism is more about the mathematical and computational aspect of the theorem. Could I have reached unrealistic and high-error results due to output manipulation?
