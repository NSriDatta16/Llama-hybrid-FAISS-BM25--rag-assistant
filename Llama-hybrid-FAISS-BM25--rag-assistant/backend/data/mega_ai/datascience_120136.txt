Seasonal ARIMA?

Greatly enjoy exploring data in Orange Data Mining! I have daily average temperature data for several years. I can plot the periodogram, and do a seasonal decompose. Is there a way to forecast the temperature using SARIMA? I tried using ARIMA with moving average order (q) = 70 (the max possible). It is still spinning. Shouldn't it be set to 365 for when looking at yearly data? Appreciate if you can share some advice Cheers!
