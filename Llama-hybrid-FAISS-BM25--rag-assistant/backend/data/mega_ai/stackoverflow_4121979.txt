@ character allowed in URL, dangerous?

From the CodeIgniter config.php file: /* |-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Allowed URL Characters |-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | This lets you specify with a regular expression which characters are permitted | within your URLs. When someone tries to submit a URL with disallowed | characters they will get a warning message. | | As a security measure you are STRONGLY encouraged to restrict URLs to | as few characters as possible. By default only these are allowed: a-z 0-9~%.:_- | | Leave blank to allow all characters -- but only if you are insane. | | DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE REPERCUSSIONS!! | */ $config['permitted_uri_chars'] = 'a-z 0-9~%.:_\-'; Would it be safe for me to add the @ character to this list of permitted characters? What are the risks? Thanks
