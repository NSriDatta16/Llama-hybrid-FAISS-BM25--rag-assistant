If you conclude that there is no difference between a pair of numbers (e.g., 20% and 24%), then yes, you should assume they are the same when doing any calculations. If you are performing statistical tests, you've got three comparisons: 20-24, 250-180 and 60-34 (i.e., the product of the value and the percentage). The traditional testing strategy (General to Specific) would be to first compare 60-34, and then, if that difference is significant, compare 20-24 and 250-180 to work out if the difference is driven by the conversion or the value. This does solve the issue you are worried about but is a bit of a hack, and the core problem here is surprisingly complicated and gets into philosophy (frequentists versus likelihood versus Bayesian). The mean is almost always more informative than the median. People test medians when tests of means aren't robust enough to be relied upon. If your sample sizes are accurate, then the t-test assumptions regarding the skewing aren't going to be much of an issue. It's only with small samples that you typically need to worry about such things. But, if you have a few outliers that would cause a difference. I'd suggest both testing based on median and mean, and if they give you the same conclusion then you've got no problem. If you find their conclusions are different, you need to work out why by looking at the data.
