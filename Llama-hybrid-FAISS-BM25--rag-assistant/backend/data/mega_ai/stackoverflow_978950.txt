Are there any 'rules of thumb' regarding the dynamic creation of form controls?

For example, suppose a new Windows From application were being developed with lets say 25 different screens each of which had say 5-10 controls on them..... Obviously all of the necessary listboxes, dialog boxes, listviews, datasets etc.. could have been created when the original screens were created (say using drop & drag from the toolbox). At what point then, and for what reason, does code come along that dynamically creates a listviews or a dropdown menus. Is it just an attrition kind of thing, where over time the programmers decide it is easier do to this then to modify the original screens? Or are there better reasons for creating some controls dynamically that never existed on the originally designed screens? Thanks - hope that was clear.
