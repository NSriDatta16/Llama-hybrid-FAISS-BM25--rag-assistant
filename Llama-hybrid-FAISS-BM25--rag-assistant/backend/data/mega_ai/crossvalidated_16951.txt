How to specify Bayesian mixed effects model in BUGS

I posted this earlier in the week then retracted the question when I found a good source, not wanting to waste people's time. I haven't made much progress I'm afraid. In trying to be a good citizen here I will make the problem as clear as possible. I suspect there will be few takers. I have a dataframe in R I wish to analyse in BUGS or R. It is in long format. It consists of multiple observations on 120 individuals, with a total of 885 rows. I am examining the occurrence of a categorical outcome - but that's not really relevant here. The question is about something deeper. The model I have been using up to here is mymodel with a marginal model essentially accounting for the clustering of patients. I then examined mymodel in order to account for the time ordering of the observations on the individual people. This didn't change much. Then I tried to model them using the following set of MCMCPack commands: mymodel An examination of the output was thrilling, showing statistical significance for many predictors. I hailed myself as a newly converted bayesian, until I realised I hadn't accounted for repeated measures within patients. I understand that I have to account for that. I understand that this may mean fitting a hyperprior for each individual - is that right? What form will this take in BUGS? Here's a basic log reg model: (kudos to Kruschke, J., Indiana) model { for( i in 1 : nData ) { y[i] ~ dbern( mu[i] ) mu[i] However, no hyperprior here for the individual. Here's my best attempt so far at a within-individual design, accounting for repeated measures within people: Here's Jackman's model for JAGS 1 model{ 2 ## loop over data for likelihood 3 for(i in 1:n){ 4 y[i] ~ dbern( mu[i] ) mu[i] } Here's my bastard-child model for BUGS 1 model{ 2 ## loop over data for likelihood 3 for(i in 1:n){ 4 mu.y[i] Can somebody let me know if I'm heading in the right direction. My understanding of this is growing, but slowly. Please be gentle. I'm a medic, not a statistic! I have used R quite a bit, but I'm new to BUGS, and new to Bayes. Thanks, R
