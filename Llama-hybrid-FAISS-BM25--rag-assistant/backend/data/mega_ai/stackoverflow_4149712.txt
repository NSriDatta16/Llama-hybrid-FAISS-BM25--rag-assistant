Using XML to store data, how can I use Entity Framework?

I'm building a program which has two options: an offline and an online storage option. The online stuff isn't a problem, never has been and probably never will be. To make things a little more simple, I am using the Entity Framework with my online database to do all of my CRUD. The offline option is where I'm having a problem. I tried adding a local SQL install as part of the install package, but it was failing on certain computers depending upon which version of SQL I was using, some people just couldn't install it at all... honestly, I don't want to be going through that just to get people to install the program. I want to do two things: 1) Store the data. I'm currently thinking Linq to XML is my best bet with nothing extra to install, but is there any way to map the entities to classes within the program that would take care of the XML CRUD? 2) Sync the data. I'm thinking I'll use the Sync Framework, but again, with no normal database in the background, it's a bit of a pain. Any help/advice/comments very welcome, if there's a much easier way of doing all this, please let me know.
