Force newsletter subscription in Magento

I am working with Magento, in which I need to require that, if any customer signs up, he/she must be automatically be subscribed to the newsletter. For instance, in the admin site, if we edit a customer, we get the newsletter checkbox for "Subscribed to Newsletter?". I want that check box to always be checked. Please help me out.
