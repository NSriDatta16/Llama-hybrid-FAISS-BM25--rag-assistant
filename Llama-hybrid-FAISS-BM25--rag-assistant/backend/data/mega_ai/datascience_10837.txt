Feature Engineering is at the heart of Machine Learning and is rather laborious and time consuming. There have been various attempts at automating feature engineering in hopes of taking the human out of the loop. One specific implementation that does this for classification problems is auto-sklearn . It uses an optimization procedure called SMAC under the hood to choose the appropriate set of transforms and algorithm (and algorithm parameters). Note that Trifacta offers a really easy to use tool for data transformation. It has a highly intuitive GUI that allows to set up transformation/ feature engineering maps. There is also a free trial version that can be used for reasonably sized problems.
