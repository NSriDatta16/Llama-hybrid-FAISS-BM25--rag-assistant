To add to Robert Elwell's answer: stemming and collapsing word forms. A simple method in english is to use Porter Stemming on the lower-cased word forms. a term for the "common words" is "stop word" or "stop list" Reading through the NLTK book as suggested will explain a lot of these introductory issues well. some of the problems you have to tackle are parsing up sentences (so that your bigrams and n-gram phrases don't cross sentence boundaries), splitting up sentences into tokens, and deciding what to do about possessive forms for example. None of this stuff is clear cut, nor does any of it have "correct answers". See also the "nlp" and "natural-language" SO tags. Good luck! This is a non-trivial project.
