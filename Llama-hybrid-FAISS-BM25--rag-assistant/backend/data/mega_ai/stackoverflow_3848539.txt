Your first paragraph makes some very bad assumptions. I hope you're not really doing that. In any case, the general solution is to use dynamic allocation everywhere and constantly reallocate. However, this is inefficient, and a better approach may be to change the assumption that you want to concatenate strings at all (much less hundreds of times) and instead construct your strings with snprintf in a single operation. Then you can compute the required size first, and you have the option of allocating it or just using a fixed-size buffer in which the output might get truncated.
