In the general case, no, it's not possible, which is why these sort of JavaScript-only pages are an inaccessible, unusable total pain in the neck and people should stop creating them, the idiots. If you are lucky and the site you're talking about has actually Done It Properly, then they'll have used #fragment navigation, so when you click a link it does a history-able and bookmark-able navigation, updating the URL to one with a #something at the end that you can use to navigate back there. If you're really lucky, there might even be a fallback URL for non-JavaScript browsers that you could link to. But more often all there is is a JS function, which you can't link to or invoke outside of that site, leaving you quite out of luck should you want to deep-link anything. (Did we learn nothing from the fiasco, guys? All you trendy webmasters hacking up clever-clever swooshy jQuery-animated load() -powered multiple-pages-in-one sites are churning out rubbish that is no better than the frame-addled worst of the Netscape 3 era. Stop it. Seriously.)
