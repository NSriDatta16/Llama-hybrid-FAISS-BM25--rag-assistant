I second collecting more data if possible, or graphing and contextualizing the findings if you can't collect more data (with a strong call that you or someone else will need to replicate findings in a larger sample). P values have their own issues at the best of times and certainly wouldn't be very meaningful with such a small sample. My other concern is that performing tests of association that assume linearity or monotonic relationships may not be warranted with a sample too small to examine whether those assumptions are valid. From a pragmatic standpoint, if you want to publish or report on the results somewhere (or if a company will make some decision based on these), collect more data first. If you are building toward a larger study/finding, and the pattern of results supports your hypotheses, you could graph it, and use it as preliminary data to report in an application for a grant for a larger study.
