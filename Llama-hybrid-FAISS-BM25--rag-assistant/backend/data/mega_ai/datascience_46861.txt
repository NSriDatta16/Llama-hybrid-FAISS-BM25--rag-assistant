Optimization based on validation and not training

Hello neural network programmers, I am currently creating a neural network with keras, as I am not that familiar with tensorflow and it's a bit more difficult. I want my optimization to optimize the validation loss and not the training loss/accuracy. Ideally, I would want it to look something like this: model.compile(optimizer=adam, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=[ 'val_accuray' ]) but val_accuracy is not something I can eneter into metrics. Any ideas on how I can implement that? Thanks!
