The estimate given by a moving average will lag behind the true state. Say you want to measure the altitude of a plane rising at a constant velocity and you have noisy (Gaussian) altitude measurements. An average over a time interval of noisy altitude measurements is likely to give you a good estimate of where the plane was in the middle of that time interval . If you use a larger time interval for your moving average, the average will be more accurate but it will estimate the plane's altitude at an earlier time. If you use a smaller time interval for your moving average, the average will be less accurate but it will estimate the plane's altitude at a more recent time. That said, the lag of a moving average may not pose a problem in some applications. edit: this post asks the same question and has more responses and resources
