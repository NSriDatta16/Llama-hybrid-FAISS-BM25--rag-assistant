Predicting mean time to failure falls under the general heading of Survival Analysis. So first you should read up on that topic. You should also look at Markov Chains and State Space Models. Markov models are good at representing a system with discrete states and probabilities of transitioning from one state to the other. State space models are a generalization of Markov models, but where the states are continuous instead of discrete. I know that Markov Models have been used for survival analysis before. RNNs and LSTMs would definitely be a possibility for this, but they might be overkill compared to Markov Chains.
