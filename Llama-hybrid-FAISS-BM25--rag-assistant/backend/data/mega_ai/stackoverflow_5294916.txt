Reassigning a boolean if not true

I have a method foo() and foobar() that both return a boolean. Each of them must be executed regardless of the result. boolean changed = true; while(changed) { changed = foo(); if(!changed) { changed = foobar(); } else { foobar(); } } I want the loop to keep executing for as long as changed is true, but I feel like the second code block of ifs and elses for foobar() is not very... elegant. Is there a better way to write that part so that the variable changed will only be reassigned if it's not already true? Thanks!
