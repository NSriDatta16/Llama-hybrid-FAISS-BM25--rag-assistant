ToolBar problem in swing + java

I have this code in my file String[] iconFiles = { "state.jpg", "cursor.jpg", "arrow.jpg" }; String[] buttonLabels = { "New Node", "Attribute Change", "Add Edge"}; for (int i = 0; i I have 2 questions in this. Firstly the image file that is represented by the icon does not get resized on its own and thus gets cut by the button size. Secondly the toolbar gets shown in the window but I am able to drag it out into a sort of a new window. How can I prevent this from happening?
