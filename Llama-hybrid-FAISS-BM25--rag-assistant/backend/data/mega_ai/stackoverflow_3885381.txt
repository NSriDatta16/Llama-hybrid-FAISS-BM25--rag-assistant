How do I get VML working in standards mode?

I would like to be able to use vml objects on a page rendering in standards mode rather than quirks mode. I've found fragments of answers scattered around but can't figure it out. Raphael pulls it off somehow but I can't reverse it to figure out what's happening. Any basic working example would be great.
