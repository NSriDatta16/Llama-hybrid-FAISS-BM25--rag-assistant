WP-eCommerce is the only plugin for WordPress worth looking at when it comes to eCommerce. You do get a lot for free. That said, Alex makes some great points about how WordPress is NOT ideal for eCommerce. However, after having completed 2 websites with WP-eCommerce and 2 websites with Magento Commerce, I can say that there is a HUGE difference in the time it takes to complete. WP-eCommerce can be set up relatively quickly with very little customization to get it to look decent in your own WP Theme. A full eCommerce system such as Magento , on the other hand, has a huge learning curve and you will spend 3 times as long anytime you want to change anything. It all depends what you're going for. If you want something simple that can be tweaked a little but doesn't need to be a great robust long-term solution, I would definitely consider WP-eCommerce. Otherwise, go for a real eCommerce platform. Alternatively: Zen-Cart looks simpler than Magento but without some of the flexibility. Whatever you do, DON'T go anywhere near osCommerce.
