If you won't use an IDE, you definitely want to use Makefiles to organize your workflow... and you can make easily from emacs or vim. Anyway, may I suggest you to use a very simple, almost non intrusive IDE, that could be great for learning purposes: http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html It comes with the MinGW compiler bundled, so it's just install and go.
