GWT is a client side technology, so basically gives you only the UI. Any CRUD process would happen in the server side, which could be any J2EE code. Anyway you can take a look to the StockWatcher Example which gives you a good approach to your question (you need to implement the server side storage) Also take a look to the RequestFactory documentation Does it help you?
