Just FYI, I purchased a G1 off craiglist from someone who had disabled their T-mobile account before Cupcake (Android 1.5) was released. I then proceeded to unlock the phone and use it on AT&T (I know, no 3G and all that, but I couldn't wait for my AT&T contract to end before getting an Android phone). When I started up the phone the first day I owned it, I believe it had firmware version 1.1 (forget the exact version but it wasn't Cupcake). The next day when I turned it on it said there was an available firmware update it wanted download (this is while connected to AT&T). I connected it up to wi-fi so the download would go faster, and let it update. When it finished updating and rebooting I had Cupcake installed. So the moral of the story is, I don't know what it's hitting to get firmware updates, but it's just some internet server, it's not required to be on T-mobile's network to get the updates, it just needs to be connected to the internet.
