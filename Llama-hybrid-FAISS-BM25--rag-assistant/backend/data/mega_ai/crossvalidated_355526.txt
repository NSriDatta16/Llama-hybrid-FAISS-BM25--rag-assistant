I second E. Trauger's recommendation to look at regression . This allows you to model causal drivers. Since you mention that you have a lot of potential variables, you may want to consider regularization to avoid overfitting. Take a look at the Lasso. You mention logistic regression. This will not be useful, as it only works for 0-1 valued series. Don't be surprised if you can't improve on (simple) time series algorithms. In forecasting, it can be surprisingly hard to improve on simple benchmarks . You may want to look at Forecasting: Principles and Practice , specifically the section on regression .
