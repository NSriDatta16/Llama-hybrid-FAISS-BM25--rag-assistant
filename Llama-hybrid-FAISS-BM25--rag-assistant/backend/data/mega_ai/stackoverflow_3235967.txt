UITouch - Event not responding

I have the following piece of code that I'm expecting to run on a touch event: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch; touch=[touches anyObject]; CGPoint point=[touch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint([billTotal frame],point)) { [self pickerShow]; } } Its not being executed, any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Regards, Stephen
