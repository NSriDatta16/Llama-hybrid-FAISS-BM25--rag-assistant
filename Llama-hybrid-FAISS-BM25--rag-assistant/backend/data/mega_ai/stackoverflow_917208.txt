what are "Meta-Data design principles"?

I'm looking at a job description that I'm considering applying for, and one of the requirements listed is "Familiar with Meta-Data design principles". Can some give a brief explanation? I'm probably familiar with the concept, but I've never heard that terminology before. I did Google to find more info, but didn't get good results. Except for this white paper titled Metadata Principles and Practicalities . It was a little heavy, and I was hoping to find a quick explanation. Additional Note: Thanks for all the answers so far. They've been very good. I wanted to clarify that I'm familiar with what metadata is, but I've just never heard of "metadata design principles". What sort of design principles are there for metadata have? Is this a large enough topic for a book? for a pamphlet? As Robert Harvey points out, it sounds like a nebulous term invented by someone in HR.
