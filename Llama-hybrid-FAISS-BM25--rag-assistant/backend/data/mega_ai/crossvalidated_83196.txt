A non-centred MA is not the same as a one-sided MA. See https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/2 to learn about moving averages. A non-centred MA is still two-sided, but for even values of order it is not centered on an observation. If you want a one-sided moving average, then set centre=FALSE and shift the time attribute by half of order .
