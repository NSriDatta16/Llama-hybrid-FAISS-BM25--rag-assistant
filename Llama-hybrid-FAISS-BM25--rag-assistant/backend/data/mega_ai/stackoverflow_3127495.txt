Turns out getting IIS to support POST doesn't really help. i'm using XMLHttpRequest to perform the POST s. Nearly every implementation of XMLHttpRequest out there ( e.g. Chrome, Internet Explorer, MSXML) has a bug where it performs a GET , instead of a POST , after following the redirect. The W3C's XMLHttpReqest specification says that redirects should be followed and requests reissued: If the response is an HTTP redirect: If the redirect does not violate security (it is same origin for instance), infinite loop precautions, and the scheme is supported, transparently follow the redirect while observing the same-origin request event rules . Note: HTTP places requirements on the user agent regarding the preservation of the request method and request entity body during redirects, and also requires end users to be notified of certain kinds of automatic redirections. And here's a site where you can test the bug in your browser's XmlHttpRequest implementation. In the end, i'll work around an IIS bug, and an XMLHttpRequest bug, by having my "default" page do everything that a 302 redirect would, but return 200 OK instead: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Connection: close Date: Sun, 27 Jun 2010 13:28:14 GMT Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 Location: http://errorreporting.example.com/submit/SubmitError.ashx Content-Length: 92 Content-Type: text/html Cache-control: private This content has moved here. i'm forcing the client to do two hits anyway - might as well have it work right.
