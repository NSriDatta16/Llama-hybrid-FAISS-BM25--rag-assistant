@ttnphns has provided a good overview. I just want to add a couple of small things. Greenacre has done a good deal of work with Correspondence Analysis and how it is related to other statistical techniques (such as MDS, but also PCA and others), you might want to take a look at his stuff (for example, this presentation may be helpful). In addition, MDS is typically used to make a plot (although it is possible to just extract some numerical information), and he has written a book this general type of plot and put it on the web for free here (albeit only one chapter is about MDS plots per se). Lastly, in terms of a typical use, it is used very commonly in market research and product positioning, where researchers use it descriptively to understand how consumers think about the similarities between different competing products; you don't want your product to be poorly differentiated from the rest.
