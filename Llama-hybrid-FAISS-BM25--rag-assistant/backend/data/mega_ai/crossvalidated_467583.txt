Will satisfying the OLS Assumptions matter if the only thing i care about is the value of y that is predicted from the output?

If i dont care about the individual effects of each variable onto y, and building confidence intervals and stuff, but only that i get accurate predictions of my y values. Will satisfying them matter? If they do matter, then why are they not taken into consideration when we do linear regression in machine learning? The coeffs of the input variables that are produced remain the same, and if we get bad results when we do not satisfy them, we should surely take them into consideration, right?
