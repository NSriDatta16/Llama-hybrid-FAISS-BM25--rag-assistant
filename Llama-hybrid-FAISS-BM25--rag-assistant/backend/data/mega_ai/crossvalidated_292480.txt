Why does SVM-linear kernel outperforms SVM-RBF kernel in terms of classification accuracy?

I am trying to classify the spectroscopy data, the SVM-linear is performing better than SVM-RBF in terms of classification accuracy, I was expecting the other way. Why is it so? Any reason? How can I justify this?
