In your code fragment test already is a reference to the real instance, so you should try Writeln('Actual object address: ', IntToHex(Integer(Pointer(test)), 8)); And you probably don't need any getSelfPointer method. If you want a second reference to the object instance that test already references, write: var SecondReferenceToTest: TTest; SecondReferenceToTest := test; To see this, try something like: type TTest = class(TObject) public Name: string; end; procedure TestProc; var test, SecondReferenceToTest: TTest; begin test := TTest.Create; try test.Name := 'Named via "test" reference'; SecondReferenceToTest := test; ShowMessage(SecondReferenceToTest.Name); finally test.Free; end; end;
