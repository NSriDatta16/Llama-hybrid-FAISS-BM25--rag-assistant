C++: Status and control pattern

I'm writing a C++ background/server application for Linux/Windows. Is there a standard control/profiling/reporting service I should use to expose my application's current status in a standardized way? If not, what's a good pattern (or library) to use for exposing this kind of data and control? Specifically, I want to expose the following data: Relative "usage" of "components" (where usage/components is user-defined) Any errors/faults Memory, CPU, other misc process data Method/class execution profile Average time spent in method/class Total calls I want to expose the following control mechanisms Start, stop, restart, reload X... (commandesque control) Parameter tuning
