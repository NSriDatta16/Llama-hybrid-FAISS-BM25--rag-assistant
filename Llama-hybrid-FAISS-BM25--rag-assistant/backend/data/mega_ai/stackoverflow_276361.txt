On unsorted vs. sorted. I'll do one, then you really do need to do your homework Stackoverflow markup really needs tables to do this one. You want to say how "expensive" the operation is for the unsorted/array, sorted/array, unsorted/linked-list, sorted/linked-list One final point: "speed of the application" is a hint to consider more than just the speed of the individual operations. * Adding Unsorted: Array adding is O(1) unless resizing needed - just add it to the end. You might want to discuss a resizing strategy that minimises the overhead (hint: don't just increase the size by one) Sorted: Array adding is O(n) - finding the place to add it is O(log(n)), but you need to move half the elements up (on average) to make romm for the new one Unsorted: Linked list is O(1) - add it to the start or end of the list. Sorted: Linked list is O(n) - although you can again add the element in O(1), you need to scan through half the list on average to find the place to put it. So, over to you for the rest. Post an answer, and we'll critique it, but to get the most from your (presumably) expensive educatiom, you really need to do some work on this :) * Removing * Retrieving * Sorting * Overall speed * Overall memory usage
