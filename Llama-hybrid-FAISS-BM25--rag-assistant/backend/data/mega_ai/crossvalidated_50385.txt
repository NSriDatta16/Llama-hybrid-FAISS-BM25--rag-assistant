I have a literal answer, sorry...... You guys are way way smarter than I, but I am certain that all of you would also like to know the true way of consistently predicting a coin toss anway. Having said that I rarely if ever lose a coin toss- No tricks (per say) Regardless of whom flips it. First off, the coin isn't fair - it doesn't weigh the same on both sides and the weight isn't equally distributed across either face. The flipper is also biased- (I favor flipping while tails is up) and sometimes switch between catching over hand or underhand depending on what the other person calls. Not to mention the coin position pre-flip, finger to coin ratio preferences, the friction rate between the finger nail and the coin's surface, the horizontal orientation of the coin, thumb to forefinger resistantance etc... So flipping a coin is not static- force, speed, quantity and angle of rotations, height, atmospheric changes and a bunch of other variables that I am certain you can come up with will all affect the outcome; is the coin called pre-flip? Mid-Flip? Personally I like a lot of height, speed and making the "ting" noise. I prefer flipping right handed, catching the coin overhand, and then slapping the coin on the top of my other hand. The higher it goes the easier it is to predict- again no tricks... A few other variables to consider; Is the coin caught underhand or overhand, does it land on the ground? Does it bounce off the ground? This affects the final outcome as well as you can get a "false" heads/tails. Statistics are also on the side of the person flipping who "wills" it to be heads or tails. For my prediction control test, call it in the air, use the underhand catching method and don't "slap" the coin on the top of the other hand (this actually flips the coin again). Once you flip focus on the coin- there will be a predominating image in favor of heads or tails while in flight. If you see heads it will land heads up on the palm of your hand- if you consistantly see heads and get tails- call tails....etc It takes a little practice but its super easy, I have gotten over thirty in a row right before being wrong and that's because I lose interest and stop paying attention. (or catch it poorly). You can use the same principles when watching someone else flip- depending on their "style" you may have to call heads when you actually saw a tails image in flight to accurately get a heads.
