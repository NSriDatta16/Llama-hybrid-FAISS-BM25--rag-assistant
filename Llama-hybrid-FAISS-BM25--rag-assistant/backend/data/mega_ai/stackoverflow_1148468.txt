AFAIK Ajax.ActionLink doesn't allow you to easily get form values and post them with AJAX. There are some workarounds which seem quite hackish (looking at the last paragraph Adapting the URL Dynamically makes me cry). Here's the jQuery way (I prefer it if compared to MS Ajax): And then unobtrusively attach a click event handler to the anchor: $(function() { $('a#saveComment').click(function(evt) { $.ajax({ url : this.href, data: { // Assuming your model has a property called MyComment myComment: $('#myComment').val() }, success: function(data, textStatus) { // Comment saved successfully } }); evt.preventDefault(); }); });
