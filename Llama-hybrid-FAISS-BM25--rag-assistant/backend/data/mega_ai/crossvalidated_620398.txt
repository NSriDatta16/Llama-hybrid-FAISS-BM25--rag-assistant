A null hypothesis is not meaningful in every case where statistics are used. It is useful for questions of the type "Do this effect a measurable change on something?" But if I want to see "how far can I consistently throw a frisbee", there is no null hypothesis. There is still statistics; do a lot of throws, average distances, until I can say with 95% confidence that I can indeed throw the frisbee this far.
