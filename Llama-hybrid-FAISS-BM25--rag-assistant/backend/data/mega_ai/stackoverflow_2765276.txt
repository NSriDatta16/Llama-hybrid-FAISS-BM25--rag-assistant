PHP problem with selecting from Oracle global temporary table

I have an Oracle global temporary table which is "ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS". I have a loop in which I: Insert to global temporary table Select from global temporary table (post-processing) Commit, so that the table is purged before next iteration of the loop Insertion is done with a call to oci_execute($stmt, OCI_DEFAULT). Retrieval is made through a call to oci_fetch_all($stmt, $result, 0, -1, OCI_FETCHSTATEMENT_BY_ROW | OCI_ASSOC). After that, a commit is made: oci_commit(). The problem is that retrieval sometimes works, and sometime I get one of the following errors: ORA-08103: object no longer exists ORA-01410: invalid ROWID As if the session cannot "see" the records that it previously inserted. Do you have any idea what could be causing this? Thanks.
