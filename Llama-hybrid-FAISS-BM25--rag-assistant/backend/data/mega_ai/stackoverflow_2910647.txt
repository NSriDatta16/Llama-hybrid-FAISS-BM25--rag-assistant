MySQL Query: find the category id in the products table, however id is wrapped like `&12&`

I need to find the category id in the products table below. However the cms_ecom_categories.id is wrapped with the & character like &12& . Is there some kind of wild card I could use to wrap around? like %cms_ecom_categories.id% ? $sql = "SELECT * FROM cms_ecom_products, cms_ecom_categories WHERE cms_ecom_products.pCategories = cms_ecom_categories.id AND cms_ecom_categories.slug = ".$page."";
