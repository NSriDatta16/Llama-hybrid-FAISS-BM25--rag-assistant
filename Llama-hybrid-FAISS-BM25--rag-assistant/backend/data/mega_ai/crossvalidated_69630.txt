The classic distribution for the waiting time between events in a Poisson process is the exponential distribution . Bus time arrivals would be a good example of a Poisson process. However, there are probably different average arrivals/waiting times as most bus schedules have day, evening, night, and weekend/holiday schedules. My suggestion would be to break up and re-aggregate your data into like-schedule buckets (all rush hour together, all weekend together) and then start with fitting an exponential distribution.
