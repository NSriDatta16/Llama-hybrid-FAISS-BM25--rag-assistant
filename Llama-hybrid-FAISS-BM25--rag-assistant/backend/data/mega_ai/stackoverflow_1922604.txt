Creating a WPF editor for XML file based on schema

Here's the scenario. We use a large XML configuration file for one of our server products. This file is fairly well layed out and is validated against an XSD file. It's time now though to build a configuration GUI for maintaining this file and I would like to dive into WPF to do it. I could lay out a seperate form for each config section, refactoring and redistributing every time we add an option to the config file but I'm hoping there is a more clever way of doing this. Since I already have a strongly typed xml/xsd combination I am hoping there is an elegant method for building a UI to edit this easily enough. I know I could write an xml->xaml transformation but was hoping there is something out there to do the heavy lifting for me already? Thanks in advance..
