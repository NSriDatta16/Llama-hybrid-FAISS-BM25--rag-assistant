Cross validation is very hard with time series models. Yes you can hold out the last period but that might be the most important period for your model (recent marketing). Remember MMMs are not forecasting tools but "attribution" models. A simple ARIMA model might produce better forecasts. Ground truth in MMM is hard. You can simulate some data where you know the causal paths and then let the model estimate the effects, then check against true attribution. For an open souced model see https://github.com/google/lightweight_mmm
