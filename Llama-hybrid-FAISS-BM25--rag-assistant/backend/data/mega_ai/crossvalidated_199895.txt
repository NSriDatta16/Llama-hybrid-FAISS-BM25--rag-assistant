A high cophenetic correlation coefficient but dendrogram seems bad

I have 2 results for the same dataset. One is hierarchical clustering using Ward's method and I got 0.75 cophenetic correlation coefficient. The second is average method and I got 0.91 cophenetic correlation coefficient. I used "euclidean distance" for both. When I plot the dendrograms, Ward's dendrogram seems excellent while the one with average method is bad. So, Can I use the Ward's one since it has a good dendrogram and easy to cut the tree, or I have to use the average one?
