Invalid measurement data removing

I have a lot of data (temperatures and similar things) collected using automatic devices. Lots of these data is let's call it smooth: even when the temperature increases/decreases fast there are few points indicating that fact like in the figure 1. Unfortunately there also are a lot of data indicating that something was wrong with measuring device, and there are unnatural peaks like in figure 2. I would like to remove that picks - I can always write a simple algorithm removing those episodes. But I am curious if there is some "smart" filter for doing this. I tried moving average and moving median but that distorts data, and when high peaks occur isn't especially effective.
