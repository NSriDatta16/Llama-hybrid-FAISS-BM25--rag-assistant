Anyone have issues with using a RadTextBox in a MultiView?

I am want to use a Telerik RadTextBox inside a MultiView in ASP.NET 2.0. Just dragging a RadTextBox into a view and running the page generates a run-time error of the good old favorite "Object reference nto set to an instance of an object". It seems to be breaking on the Telerik.WebControls.RadInputControl.SaveViewState() call. Has anyone any ideas on how to get this to work? Thanks!
