Embedding search results (or tagged products) in a Magento CMS page

I can embed a block in a CMS page without difficulty. I can also pass arguments to the block without difficulty. What I'm looking to do is embed a block in a CMS page that returns search results for a particular search phrase. Embedding all products with a particular tag would also be helpful. Neither one has been easy to do.
