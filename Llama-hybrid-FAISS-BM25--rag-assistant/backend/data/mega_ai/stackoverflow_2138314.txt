I am looking for exactly what you are looking for. I have a prototype application done in Labview and now migrating to WPF; and I have to live up to Labviews speed and flexibility of graph plots. Have you had any luck finding anything that comes close to your needs? I looked into Telerik and DxCharts Infragistics... they tend to be more geared towards small data plots and are focused more on the ease of use than the performance side of things. I guess our best hope might be to go for something like http://dynamicdatadisplay.codeplex.com/ and make it work for our situations. It is going to require some work though.
