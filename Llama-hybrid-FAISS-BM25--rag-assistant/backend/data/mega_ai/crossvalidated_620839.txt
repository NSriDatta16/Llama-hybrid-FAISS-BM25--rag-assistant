What are some concepts taught in statistics that rarely show up in machine learning textbooks and why?

So I've been wishing to learn about $p$ value and hypothesis testing for a while now. But since my application is mainly in the domain of ML, and these concepts virtually never shows up in any of the textbooks/applications, therefore I am having a hard time finding the motivation to learn these concepts. For instance, you never hear "let's do hypothesis testing with convolutional neural networks..." Then this got me thinking, what are some commonly taught concepts in statistics which are not found in ML literature/publication/discussion? And why is that the case? Since I don't have a background in statistics, therefore can someone familiar with this issue please chime in and shed a light?
