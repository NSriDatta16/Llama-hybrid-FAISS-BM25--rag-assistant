Finding the apex of a bezier curve

I'm working in flex, although I reckon this is a language independent problem. I'm trying to draw a curve using 3 points, using curveTo (a quadratic bezier function, I don't believe Flex has any other, if it does, please correct me!) Points 1 and 3 are "nodes", with point 2 being a drag handle. What I want is not for the line to curve towards point 2 but in fact pass through it. I've managed to get this working by fluking it - by doubling the (distance between the midpoint of a line between Points 1 and 3) and Point 2. This doesn't put it on the Apex of the line though, just somewhere close to it. Anyone any ideas? Andrew
