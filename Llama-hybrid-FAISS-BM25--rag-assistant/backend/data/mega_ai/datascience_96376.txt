Shapley value, conditional expectation vs reference point

In Shapley, the marginal contribution of a feature is computed by comparing the performance of a model with and without a feature over all possible subsets of features. A common choice is using the average value of a feature, when such feature is not present in the selected subset. What would be the implication of using a fixed constant value for a missing feature (e.g., a reference point) instead of its average value?
