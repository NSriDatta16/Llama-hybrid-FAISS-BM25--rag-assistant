How to conduct regression analysis on ordinal variables in SPSS?

My data basically includes a number of ordinal (and some nominal) variables on perceptions of volunteers. I essentially want to see whether perceived personal benefit from volunteering (based on a Likert scale) is dependent upon certain factors, such as whether they were a good teacher (also an ordinal Likert scale). I tried multiple linear regression and it came out with some pretty good results, and I'm largely statistically illiterate so it took me some time to even do that. But reading a bit more into it, it seems that conducting ordinal regression specifically is the way to go. I don't quite understand what the difference is, I looked at some youtube vids and still can't figure it out. How do I interpret the table? Will multiple linear regression do? Its for my undergraduate dissertation and the article I'm basing this off is published and it just says 'regression analysis', which i assumed was just your average linear multiple regression. Thanks in advance. Help!
