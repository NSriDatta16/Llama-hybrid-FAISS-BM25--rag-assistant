Optimal setup for Doxygen in a large multi-application COM project

A system has up to 100 VC++ projects, each spitting out a DLL or EXE. In addition there are many COM components with IDL and generated .h/.c files. What's 'the right way' or at least a good way to organise this with Doxygen? One overall doxy project or one per project/solution? And what's the right way to handle COM, which has generated code and a lot of 'fluff' that will bloat generated HTML files.
