There isn't anything built-in to jQuery that does it, but you can checkout this site that has a basic code example: http://jamesroberts.name/blog/2010/02/22/string-functions-for-javascript-trim-to-camel-case-to-dashed-and-to-underscore/ String.prototype.toCamel = function(){ return this.replace(/(\-[a-z])/g, function($1){return $1.toUpperCase().replace('-','');}); }; It would seem that from there you could call the code like so: var str = "my string to camel case"; str = str.toCamel(); if ( typeof console !== 'undefined' ) console.log(str);
