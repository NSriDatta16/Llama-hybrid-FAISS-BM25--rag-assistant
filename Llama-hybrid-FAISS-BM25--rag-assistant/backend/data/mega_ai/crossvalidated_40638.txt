Predicting time series with NNs: should the data set be shuffled?

Suppose I'm trying to predict time series with a neural network. The data set is created from a single column of temporal data, where the inputs of each pattern are [t-n, t-n+1, ... , t] , t being the time step and n the embedding size, and [t+1] being the target (predicting the "next step" of the series). Here is the question: if I use such a data set for NN training, should I shuffle it? Shuffling is usually done to avoid overfitting by preventing the NN from memorizing the pattern order. However, in case of time series, could pattern order be a form of information that I shouldn't deprive the NN of? The issue becomes even more severe if recurrent NNs are concerned, where every pattern recurrently receives information about the previous pattern: would a RNN benefit if patterns were in order?
