I just finished writing something similar. Since you didn't define css position on the blocks, they default to relative. Passing in coordinates, via offset() or position() result in "the wrong answer" as all coords are relative to the parent div. What you want to do is move the blocks relative ("+=_ px" or "-= _px) in your animate call. What I had done was find the difference between the desitination and origin, and adjust the animate call appropriately. This fcn assumes the destination is above (ymmv); function moveVidToDrop(dragItem, dropItem) { var deltaTop = dropItem.offset().top - dragItem.offset().top; var deltaleft = dropItem.offset().left - dragItem.offset().left; var dirTop = '+='; var dirLeft = '+='; if (deltaTop Similarly, if you want to send a draggable programatically home do: .animate({ left: "0px", top: "0px" }, "slow")
