WPF FlowDocument Paragraph Inlines Length

Is there any limitations to the WPF Document.Paragraph object when using the FlowDocument control? I have the FlowDocument turning blank when I add a Paragraph that is more than 450 lines to the Paragraph. I could not locate anything within the MSDN documentation regarding max. lengths etc. Any ideas why this would happen?
