It depends on how you develop. If you're someone who drags controls onto the designer surface, it would probably be hard to ever match that level of rapid development with MVC. On the other hand, if you spend most of your time in source view, you'll probably find that MVC allows you to do so more efficiently. Bringing AJAX into the picture, if you're someone who relies on the UpdatePanel, MVC would probably be unspeakably miserable for you. (This doesn't begin to address the subjective issue of which type of development is more "correct". I don't believe that's the point of this question though.)
