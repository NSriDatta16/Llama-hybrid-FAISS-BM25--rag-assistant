HTML5 based node-graph editor?

I'm looking for an in browser click-n-drag type editor for editing directed labeled graphs. All I need is a widget to support the editing and the ability to submit (AJAX, form, whatever) the resulting set of origin/label/terminus tuples. It's not what I need it for, but a GUI editor for simple GraphViz cases would be nearly ideal. This UML widget is kinds along the right track. And I'm kind of restricted to open source, freeware and public domain. Some other close, but not quite options: arbor.js (view, not edit. And I don't need the auto layout.) springy (ditto.)
