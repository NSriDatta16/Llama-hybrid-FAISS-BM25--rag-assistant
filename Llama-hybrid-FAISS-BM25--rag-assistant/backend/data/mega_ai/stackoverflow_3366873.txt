Change a default window size in browser

After pressing the button "submit", brouwser will open a new window with some text like "OK, your messagw sent to our mailbox". Can I make this "new" window NOT fullsize of browser, but 400x300 resolution. (also i have "mail.php" file with the next code: Message written "; echo " Go back and make all steps correctly "; exit; } } else { $mess = "Unspecified"; } $i = "не указано"; if ( $mess == $i) { echo "Error! The script does not have to pass parameters!"; exit; } $to = "vitelp@gmail.com"; /*адрес*/ $subject = "Message to your website"; $message = "Message:$mess"; mail ($to,$subject,$message) or print "Cant send your letter!"; echo " Thanks for ypur attention."; exit; ?> )
