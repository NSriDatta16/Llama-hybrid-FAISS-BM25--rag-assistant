What's the best way to organize code?

I'm not talking about how to indent here. I'm looking for suggestions about the best way of organizing the chunks of code in a source file. Do you arrange methods alphabetically? In the order you wrote them? Thematically? In some kind of 'didactic' order? What organizing principles do you follow? Why?
