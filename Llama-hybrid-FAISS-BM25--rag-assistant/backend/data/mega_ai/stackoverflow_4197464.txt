Schwaber and Beedle say " roughly four to sixteen hours." The upper bound is useful. It forces the team to plan, and helps provide daily visibility of progress. The lower bound is a useful target for most tasks, to avoid the fragility and costs of overspecification. However, occasionally the team may find shorter tasks useful in planning, and is free to include those. There should be no mandated lower bound. For example, one of our current stories includes a task to send something to another team -- a task that will take 0 hours, but one we want to remember to finish. The number of tasks in your burndown chart is irrelevant. It's the remaining time that matters. The team should feel free to change the tasks during the sprint, as Schwaber and Beedle note.
