Web hosting is a service that provides Web users with online systems for storing information, images, video, or any content accessible via the webâ€”often in the form of web pages. The scope of web hosting services varies greatly. The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a Web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web "as is" or with minimal processing. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer this service free to subscribers. Individuals and organizations may also obtain Web page hosting from alternative service providers. Personal web site hosting is typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business web site hosting often has a higher expense. Web hosts often make extensive use of virtual machines and various open source platforms (e.g. LAMP ) to provide the level of server abstraction, ease-of-use, and minimized cost that make modern web hosting feasible.
