Difficult if you use VSTO, because you'll need to deploy/assure different runtime libraries. See the VSTO entry in Wikipedia , not to speak of different development and test platforms (which you may already have, if you aim for it). There's a MSDN Blog from Mary Lee the migration of 2007 to 2010 projects. Please see also this blog from Andrew Whitechapel: Can you build one add-in for multiple versions of Office? From a pragmatical point of view ("time-to-market"), you may consider the use of a third-party-tool ( www.add-in-express.com ), which allows the creation of version-independent add-ins.
