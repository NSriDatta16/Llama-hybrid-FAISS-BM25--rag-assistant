Android: Spinner with changing ArrayAdapter - how to identify?

I want to have three Spinners with contents which depend on each other. E.g. Spinner1 displays {item1, item2} and Spinner2 either {item3, item4} or {item5, item6} depending on whether item1 or item2 is selected on Spinner1. The same I want for Spinner 3, which reacts to changes of Spinner1 and/or Spinner2. For the latter, I have to determine first which of the possible value sets is shown atm in Spinner2. My question is kind of similar to this question , but I don't know what to do after getting the adapter. That's what I have so far: ArrayAdapter adapter1 = (ArrayAdapter) spinner2.getAdapter(); if(items_spinner1[0].contentEquals(adapter1.getItem(0))) { //... } I get the adapter, ask for the first value and compare it to the first String value of my Array to identify it. It doesn't at all seem elegant to me. Is there an easier solution?
