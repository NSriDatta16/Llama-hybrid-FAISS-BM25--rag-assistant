AS Phliplip said, have a understanding of the MVC pattern and the way Zend Framework implements those. Especially the Controller part, Model and View are handled differently. Make sure you use a descent editor (e.g. eclipse+pdt) which allows you to click at any function and it will show you the source as well as setting up xDebug so you can travel though some code while its running and see the values of the variables. Magento gets controlled by many config.xml files in each module which get merged to one big xml. So you need to understand how you setup a module and what Mage::getModule('yourmodul/xx_yyy') does. as well es Mage::getResourceModule(), Mage::helper(), Mage::getBlock() Make sure you are 100% familiar with the class Varien_Object ,... and become a fan of it :) Try to understand the Magento Collection class which basicly wraps any mysql query returning more then one result Get familiar with a the database eav model When you are planning on altering the database,... you should make sure you understand the magento installer. There is lot more.... it took me I don't know 6 month to get a good understanding of it...
