Unsigned integer datatype in column-oriented DBMS

I have checked different column-oriented database systems such as InfiniDB, InfobrightDB and MonetDB. None of them support unsigned integers as a data storage type. Why? One solution is to store all 4 byte unsigned integers into 8 byte signed integers ( Link ), however I think it would waste too much space. Is there any open-source column oriented database system that support unsigned integers? I already checked this ( Link ) with no luck. Thank you very much for your time. Emer
