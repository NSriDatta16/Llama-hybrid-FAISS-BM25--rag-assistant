I think @onestop had the right intuition about the independence of the proportions. Below is the justification. Let $(X_{11},X_{12},X_{21},X_{21})$ following the multinomial distribution under a probability $\Pr$ (with $\Pr(X_{11}+X_{12}+X_{21}+X_{22}=N)=1$ ). We know that $(X_{12} \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1) \sim \text{Bin}\left(n_1; \frac{\theta_{12}}{\theta_{11}+\theta_{12}}\right)$ and $(X_{21} \mid X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2) \sim \text{Bin}\left(n_2; \frac{\theta_{21}}{\theta_{21}+\theta_{22}}\right)$ . We need to prove that $X_{12}$ and $X_{21}$ are independent under a suitable conditional probability. Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be integers such that $n_1+n_2=N$ . Obviously $\Pr(X_{12}=i \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1, X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2) = \Pr(X_{12}=i \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1)$ and $\Pr(X_{21}=j \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1, X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2) = \Pr(X_{21}=j \mid X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2)$ . Secondly, $X_{12}$ and $X_{21}$ are conditionally independent given the event $\{X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1, X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2\}$ . Indeed, by elementary algebra, it is not difficult to check that the intuitive equality $$\Pr(X_{12}=i \mid X_{21}=j, X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1, X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2) = \Pr(X_{12}=i \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1)$$ holds true (this is more easy if knowing in advance that $(X_{12} \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1) \sim \text{Bin}\left(n_1; \frac{\theta_{12}}{\theta_{11}+\theta_{12}}\right)$ ). That shows that $X_{12}$ and $X_{21}$ are independent and distributed according to $\text{Bin}\left(n_1; \frac{\theta_{12}}{\theta_{11}+\theta_{12}}\right)$ and $\text{Bin}\left(n_2; \frac{\theta_{21}}{\theta_{21}+\theta_{22}}\right)$ respectively under the conditional probability $\Pr(\cdot \mid X_{11}+X_{12}=n_1, X_{21}+X_{22}=n_2)$ . (EDIT). The Newcombe interval is available in the R package pairwiseCI. Below are some simulations showing the actual coverage of the $95\%$ -confidence interval in function of $\theta_{12}$ when I fix $N=288$ , $\theta_{11}=0.3$ , $\theta_{22}=0.4$ . library(pairwiseCI) N diff)) } coverage[i]
