I think that you understand the situation a bit better than you are giving yourself credit for. Here are the critical issues. Events in survival analysis Survival modeling with covariates (whether fixed in time or time-varying) typically evaluates the association of current covariate values with the hazard of an event at that time . If the event has already happened to some individuals before your study began and an event can only happen at most once (as seems to be the case here), then you don't have any information available from those individuals about covariate-event associations for any unpredictable time-varying covariates. In your terminology in that situation, "prevalent" cases at your study start time can't be used to evaluate associations of time-varying covariates with the disease incidence evaluated by survival modeling. If you are evaluating covariates fixed in time (like a genotype) then such "prevalent" cases might provide information. If you are examining recurrent events or building a multi-state model (e.g., modeling heart failure, death from heart failure, and death from other causes all together) then they might provide information about subsequent events. But otherwise you run the risk of providing the model with incorrect information about time-varying covariate values as of the event time. Time origin in survival analysis The choice of time = 0 depends on what type of survival you want to model based on your interest in the subject matter. That's not a statistical question, although it has implications for statistical analysis. Obviously, whether you are modeling time since study start or time since birth will tend to give different answers in general. Furthermore, if you are using birth as time = 0 , then you have left- truncated values for age, as you have no information about those individuals before their age at study entry. People who never reached those ages aren't in the study at all, so left truncation needs to be incorporated into the modeling. There is, however, an important difference in how that choice of time origin will affect a parametric versus a Cox model. A parametric model specifies the overall characteristics of the hazard/survival curves versus time starting from time = 0 --however you chose that time. If your participants are on the order of 50 years old and you have a parametric model, there will necessarily be a large difference in how covariates affect the shape of the hazard and associated survival curves depending on your choice of what time = 0 means. In a parametric model with birth as time = 0 , you have no information about the shape of the curve or covariate-outcome associations for the first several decades until events start. Nevertheless, your analysis of events in later decades is specifying the shape of the survival curve and the covariate associations with survival dating back to birth.* A Cox model, in contrast, effectively learns the baseline hazard from the cases themselves. The baseline hazard doesn't enter the initial calculations at all, but it then can be estimated from the model and data . There is no initial assumption about the shape of the hazard. In a Cox model with birth as time = 0 , you would just have a flat survival curve (zero hazard) for those initial decades, and the associations of covariates with outcome will only be evaluated after events started happening. That might be more realistic than trying to impose a survival-curve shape that dates back to birth with a parametric model. *It's possible that properly handling the left truncation of age would improve parametric modeling in your situation with birth at time = 0 . Also, you might not need to resort to parametric modeling to handle left censoring; the icenReg package in R evidently can handle semi-parametric survival modeling with left censoring (although I have no experience with it). The package author has been known to visit this site and might be able to provide further help on associated statistical issues.
