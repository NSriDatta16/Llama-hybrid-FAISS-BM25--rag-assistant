The typical way to quickly store data durably in a write-heavy app is to use an append-only log. If properly deployed s.t. the log file is on its own spinning disk, the disk seek time is minimized per write/append operation. One can update metadata to know the offset for some primary key after each write. There is a mysql storage engine that does this is you want to use mysql. Another option is one of the new nosql databases like fleetdb. Have you tried using a SSD as well? There are lots of options to solve this problem but they are likely going to require some manual labor.
