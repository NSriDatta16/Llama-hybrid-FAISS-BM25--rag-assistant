Actually, the post minus pre approach is one that you should always try to avoid. The issue is not about statistics. It is about measurement. When you calculate difference scores, the reliability of the measures become very low. You don't want that. I prefer ANCOVA if the assumptions are met (and it will in most cases), because the interpretation is easier. The readers of your study will have to look at only the post averages, 3 averages in your case, instead of all 6. If you get an interaction effect, which is expected that you do, you'd have to do a post hoc comparison of that effect. This will give you even more p-values that make reading your paper even harder. If you want others to cite your study, make it easier to read.
