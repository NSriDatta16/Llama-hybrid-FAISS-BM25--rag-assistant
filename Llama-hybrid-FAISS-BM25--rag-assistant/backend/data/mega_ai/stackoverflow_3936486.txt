No response from web page

I have a web page where I redirect the user to if I see that IP is not valid. I want that user's browser will get no response but kept into waiting state, but I also want that my server thread is not blocked for that request. So the idea was that server will response quickly but the user' browser will put into waiting loop to discourage the user. How can I achieve this easily? Is it possible without JavaScript? If JavaScript is the only way then suggest that solution. Thanks
