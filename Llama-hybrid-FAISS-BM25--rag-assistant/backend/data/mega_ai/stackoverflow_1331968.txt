SLaks and VoteyDisciple are correct. You're usage of append is faulty as you are perceiving it as a string function. From http://docs.jquery.com/Manipulation/append Append content to the inside of every matched element. This operation is the best way to insert elements inside, at the end, of all matched elements. It is similar to doing an appendChild to all the specified elements, adding them into the document. Reinventing the wheel on this one is likely more headache than its worth unless this is an attempt to create a superior, competing product or for your own experimentation. Also, I would shy away from use of obtrusive JavaScript as you have shown in your example with onclick='javascript:insert("bold")' embedded in the input element. Instead, you'll have a more elegant solution with something like the following: HTML JavaScript (not tested) $(document).ready(function() { var textarea = $('#PersonalGreeting') $(".editor-command").each(function(i, node) { textarea.val(textarea.val() + ' text here '.replace(/\$/g, node.value); }); });
