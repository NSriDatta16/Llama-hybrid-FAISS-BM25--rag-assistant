Best way to score pair differences

I'm fairly clueless how to accomplish my goal here... Firstly a bit of back story: I have about 10 technicians, and they each make sets of concrete samples in the field. Each sample has 2 x 28 day results and we use the pair MPA differences to see if they are doing a good job (they should be as close to 0 difference as possible) Example table of calculated pair differences SET # TECH DIFFERENCE 1 A 1 2 A 1.5 3 A 1.5 4 B 1 5 B 1 6 C 0.5 Each tech could do between 1 and 500 sets a month. I'm wondering how do I score this fairly? Using the average hardly seems fair for my technicians doing 500 sets a month compared to others doing maybe 10. Anyway I'm hoping to get some help here as this is so far out of my field its not even funny!
