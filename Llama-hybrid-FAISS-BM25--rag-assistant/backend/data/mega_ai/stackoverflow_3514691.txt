.NET Data Storage - Database vs single file

I have a C# application that allows one user to enter information about customers and job sites. The information is very basic. Customer: Name, number, address, email, associated job site. Job Site: Name, location. Here are my specs I need for this program. No limit on amount of data entered. Single user per application. No concurrent activity or multiple users. Allow user entries/data to be exported to an external file that can be easily shared between applications/users. Allows for user queries to display customers based on different combinations of customer information/job site information. The data will never be viewed or manipulated outside of the application. The program will be running almost always, minimized to the task bar. Startup time is not very important, however I would like the queries to be considerably fast. This all seems to point me towards a database, but a very lightweight one. However I also need it to have no limitations as far as data storage. If you agree I should use a database, please let me know what would be best suited for my needs. If you don't think I should use a database, please make some other suggestions on what you think would be best.
