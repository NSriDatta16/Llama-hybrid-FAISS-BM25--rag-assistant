Regarding the answer a bit up in this thread: IsBadReadPtr(), IsBadWritePtr(), IsBadCodePtr(), IsBadStringPtr() for Windows. My advice is to stay away from them, someone has already posted this one: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070625-00/?p=26283 Another post on the same topic and by the same author (I think) is this one: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060927-07/?p=29563 ("IsBadXxxPtr should really be called CrashProgramRandomly"). If the users of your API sends in bad data, let it crash. If the problem is that the data passed isn't used until later (and that makes it harder to find the cause), add a debug mode where the strings etc. are logged at entry. If they are bad it will be obvious (and probably crash). If it is happening way to often, it might be worth moving your API out of process and let them crash the API process instead of the main process.
