Most regular expression engines use non -deterministic automata since they offer much greater flexibility. DFAs are much more restricted. Have a look at some implementations and you'll see this. Microsoft even underlines this fact in their documentation of the .NET Regex class: The .NET Framework regular expression engine is a backtracking regular expression matcher that incorporates a traditional Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) engine such as that used by Perl, Python, Emacs, and Tcl. Matching behavior (first paragraph) â€“ this article also offers a rationale for the employment of an NFA rather than the more efficient DFA.
