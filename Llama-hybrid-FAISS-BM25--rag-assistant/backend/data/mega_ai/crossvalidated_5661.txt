The Brier Score approach is very simple and the most directly applicable way verify accuracy of a predicted outcome versus binary event. Don't rely on just formulas ...plot the scores for different periods of time, data, errors, [weighted] rolling average of data, errors ... it's tough to say what visual analysis might reveal ... after you think you see something, you will better know what kind of hypothesis test to perform until AFTER you look at the data. The Brier Score inherently assumes stability of the variation/underlying distributions weather and technology driving the forecasting models, lack of linearity, no bias, lack of change in bias ... it assumes that same general level of accuracy/inaccuracy is consistent. As climate changes in ways that are not yet understood, the accuracy of weather predictions would decrease; conversely, the scientists feeding information to the weatherman have more resources, more complete models, more computing power so perhaps the accuracy of the predictions would increase. Looking at the errors would tell something about stability, linearity and bias of the forecasts ... you may not have enough data to see trends; you may learn that stability, linearity and bias are not an issue. You may learn that weather forecasts are getting more accurate ... or not.
