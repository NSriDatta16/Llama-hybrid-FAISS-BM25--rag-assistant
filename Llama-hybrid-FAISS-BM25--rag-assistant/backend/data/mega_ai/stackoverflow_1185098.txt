Your question is somewhat confusing...'without subclassing UIResponder...can you get informed of touch events of UIResponder?' Are you asking if you can add touchesBegan/Moved/Ended/Cancelled events to any NSObject?!? I'm not comfortable enough with the framework yet to know for sure if those methods would be called if they were implemented as a category on or subclass of NSObject?!? But, regardless of what you're doing, the top (end) of the responder chain is UIApplication (also a subclass of UIResponder) and if you have an iPhone app then you have a singleton of UIApplication which you can query for touch events...
