In this thread from the MySQL Merge storage engine forum, it appears that many thousands of tables can be incorporated into a MERGE table. Some people have had problems of running out of file handles, but again this is usually only encountered after a few hundred tables are merged in. I suppose it depends on what OS you are using too - perhaps Windows has lower thresholds. MySQL Forum for MERGE storage engine Personally, I would avoid the Merge engine if at all possible. I started using it back in 2002, and have been bitten by numerous bugs across many versions of MySQL. I get the impression that the Merge engine is not a priority for MySQL, and perhaps not very well tested. Partitioning in 5.1 seems more featureful, but for your application I am surprised that you are having performance issues for only a million rows. How effective is your indexing ?
