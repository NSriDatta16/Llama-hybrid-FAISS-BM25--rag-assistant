Is this logic correct regarding how standard deviations work with a simple game example?

Say we have a game where you start at 0 points, you are allowed to get negative points per round and allowed to have negative total points. The points you earn each round is on average 1 with a standard deviation of 1. After 10 rounds, the expected value for the number of points you will earn is 10, but I want to know the odds that the player will have below 0 points after 10 rounds. How I did it was first by finding the standard deviation of the 10 trials, which I believe is $10^.5$ . Thus, 0 is about 3.16 standard deviations away from the mean, and from there I can simply find the probability. Is this the correct logic?
