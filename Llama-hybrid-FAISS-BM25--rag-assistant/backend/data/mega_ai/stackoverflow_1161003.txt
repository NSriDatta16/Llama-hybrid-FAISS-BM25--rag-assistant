I think for now I'm just going to continue to use HDF5 for the persistent data storage, in conjunction with H2 or some other database for in-memory indexing. I can't get SQLite to use BLOBs with the Java driver I have, and I can't get embedded Firebird up and running, and I don't trust H2 with PAGE_STORE yet.
