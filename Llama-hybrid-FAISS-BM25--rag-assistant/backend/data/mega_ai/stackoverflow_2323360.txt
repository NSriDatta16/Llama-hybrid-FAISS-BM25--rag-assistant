No. Much of what CSS does is not possible with HTML alone. Your best option is to design your site in such a way that when it loses CSS, it still renders in a nice and orderly fashion. Pay very close attention to things like Heading Tags, paragraph tags, lists, etc. Be sure to build semantically-correct sites, and they (in most cases) will degrade quite nicely.
