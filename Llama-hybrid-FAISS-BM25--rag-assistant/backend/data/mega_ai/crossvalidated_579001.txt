Random Forest, SVM model giving 100% accuracy for Binary Classification (except neural network)

I have a dataset of size (140,000, 10) containing 1 dependent variable. I used MinMax scaler on independent variables. For the target value, there is a class imbalance of 94% 0's and 6% 1's. Used RandomOverSampler for oversampling. When I run a neural network model on my dataset, it gives me the following plot: With a testing accuracy of 96.34% This is my neural network: model = models.Sequential() model.add(layers.Dense(5, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))) model.add(layers.Dense(5, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l1(0.001), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics = ['accuracy']) history = model.fit(X_over, y_over, epochs=25, batch_size=100, validation_split=0.2, shuffle=True, verbose=1) I have added regularizers to input and hidden layers to prevent overfitting. On using a Random Forest Classifier and SVM, I get 100% accuracies for training as well as testing. Is something wrong with my data? How do I solve this?
