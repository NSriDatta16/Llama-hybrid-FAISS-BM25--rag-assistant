What is $E[X|Y_1,Y_2]$? Literally, the expectation of $X$ given the values of both $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. "The average height (X) of a 12 year old (Y1) male (Y2)" is an example. Is $E[X|Y_1,Y_2]$ equivalent to $E[X|Y_1]⋅E[X|Y_2]$? No. Consider the trivial case where $X$ is independent of both $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. You'd be asking "Is $E[X]$ equivalent to $E[X]⋅E[X]\,$?" Or in the "average height of a 12 year old male" case, it's asking "is that the same as the average height of a 12 year old times the average height of a male?" ... which is plainly not the case. is there a formula for the density of fX|Y1,Y2 just like fX|Y1=fX,Y1/fY1 (assuming that regular conditions such as fY1>0 are satisfied) Of course! $f_{X|Y_1,Y_2}=f_{X,Y_1,Y_2}/f_{Y_1,Y_2}$
