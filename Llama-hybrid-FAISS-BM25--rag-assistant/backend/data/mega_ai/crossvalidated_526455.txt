How to evaluate statistical significance of two feature-based representations using the same classifier

I am new to statistical significance tests. I have two feature-based representations learned by different machine learning models. I compared these two representations using the same classification task and the same classifier. To explain: I have 10000 movies and for each one of the I have two representation. I train svm on each representations to predict the genre of the movies, and I obtained f1 score and accuracy. Now my question is how to prove that the results are statistically significant.
