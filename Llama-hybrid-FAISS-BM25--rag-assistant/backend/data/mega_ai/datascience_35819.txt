How many repititions of a stochastic algorithm should be done before the results can be considered trustworthy?

I have written a stochastic machine learning algorithm. Each time I run the algorithm on the same test data I get different results. I determine accuracy each time compared to ground truth. In order to properly assess the system's performance I must run the algorithm on the same test data multiple times and take the mean of the accuracy of all the runs. I have been asked to justify the number of runs of the algorithm that I do. Is there a scientific method for determining this or a piece of research I can cite that suggests a value?
