Doubleton Pattern Implementation

I'm leveraging the Doubleton Pattern from the Doubleton Design Pattern on Code Project in my own code. I think it makes things a lot easier since the Singleton only provides one instance, but I get two with this pattern. I was wondering if it would make sense to have it implement an interface so I can inject it into my domain layer.
