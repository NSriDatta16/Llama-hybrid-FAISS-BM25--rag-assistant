The most logical statistical model is the ordinal logistic or probit. These are widely available. You know how logistic regression models the log of the odds of something happening or not? Ordered logit models the log odds of giving a higher rating. The ordinal logit model makes the proportional odds assumption, which is that the relationship between each pair of rating is identical, and that the effect of all the covariates you measured is the same across all pairs. There are formal tests for whether or not this assumption is violated (the Brant test is one). If violated, there are some alternative models which make fewer assumptions but estimate more parameters. Get familiar with the ordinal models first, but alternative models include stereotype logit and generalized ordered logistic (and I have not used either of these models, personally).
