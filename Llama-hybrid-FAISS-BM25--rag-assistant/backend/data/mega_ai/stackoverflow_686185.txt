Best starting point for a website with user management functionality

I'm about to start creating a new website that has standard user management (customers login and handling (change customer details etc) + my own functionality. I'm looking for the most efficient way to do it. I know PHP/CSS/Jquery quite well. I have looked into Drupal as a starting point and found it too cumbersome for my needs. CodeIgniter and PHPcake seems not to be efficient because I'll spend time learning the platform instead of developing (which I would love to do, but not currently). It seems that what I need is a skeleton of PHP site that simply handles users functionality. Surprisingly I couldn't find one. Could you recommend a starting point such as an open source website code that I can easily cut the user management part from? Or another option which is more streightforward than learning a new platform/framework?
