Average value of y in linear regression

I've got a regression from the value of a house on things like x1 = number of bathrooms , x2 = number of bedrooms , x3 = age of the house and a couple more. I have the estimates of the coefficients belonging to those variables as well as their standard error, t-value, p-value and 95% CI. Moreover, I got the number of observations, $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$ and the standard error of $y$. Now I am supposed to calculate the average value of a house, which is the average value of $y$. But I got no idea how to calculate it with the information I have. Can anyone give me a hint?
