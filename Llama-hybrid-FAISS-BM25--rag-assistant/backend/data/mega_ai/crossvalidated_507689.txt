Your response variable, rev_rate_tot is not suitable for OLS, since it is bounded between zero and one and OLS assumes a variable in the real line. There are a few options for you, but the one I am going to dive into is a binomial GLM, as suggested by @whuber in the comments. More precisely in your case, a grouped binomial GLM, since you have your "trials", the cases, already grouped by Judge. Note that if you had case-specific variables you wanted to control for, you'd have to ungroup the data and work with an ungrouped binomial GLM, also known as logistic regression if you choose the canonical link. To adjust the binomial GLM in base-R with your data, you have 2 options: model1 model1 They should give you identical results.
