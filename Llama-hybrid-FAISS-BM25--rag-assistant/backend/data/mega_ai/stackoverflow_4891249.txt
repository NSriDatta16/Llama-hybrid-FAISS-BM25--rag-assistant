Not sure whether I exactly understood what you want to achieve. But you can create a HQL query (with projection) to only query for the columns you're intereset in, like: select a.whatever, b.id from A a join a.b b Afterwards you provide an implementation for the interface ResultTransformer and set it to your query object with query.setResultTransformer(yourTransformer) Your implementation of the result transformer is responsible for creating instances for A and B
