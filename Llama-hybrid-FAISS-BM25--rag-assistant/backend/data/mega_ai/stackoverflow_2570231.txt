Would anyone tell me how to fetch the media:thumb element's attribute from a json feed?

I made a yahoo pipe that pulls up the atoms as json format; however, I can fetch and display all the elements in my html page except for the element's attribute. Would anyone tell me how to fetch the media:thumb element's attribute from a json feed? I am pasting the html page's code with javascript. If you save the html page and then view it in browser, you will see that all the necessary elements get output at html page except for the media:thumb as I cannot display the attribute of media:thumb when the feed is formatted as json. I am also pasting the some portion of the json feed so that you can have an idea what i am talking about. Please tell me how to retrieve attribute from media:thumb element of a json feed by using plain javascript but no server side code or javascript library. Thank you. function getFeed(feed){ var newScript = document.createElement('script'); newScript.type = 'text/javascript'; newScript.src = 'http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=40616620df99780bceb3fe923cecd216&_render=json&_callback=piper'; document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(newScript); } function piper(feed){ var tmp=''; for (var i=0; i '; tmp+=feed.value.items[i].title+' '; tmp+=feed.value.items[i].author.name+' '; tmp+=feed.value.items[i].published+' '; if (feed.value.items[i].description) { tmp+=feed.value.items[i].description+' '; } tmp+=' '; } document.getElementById('rssLayer').innerHTML=tmp; } bchnbc Some portion of the json feed that gets generated by yahoo pipe: piper({"count":2,"value":{"title":"myPipe","description":"Pipes Output","link":"http:\/\/pipes.yahoo.com\/pipes\/pipe.info?_id=f7f4175d493cf1171aecbd3268fea5ee","pubDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2010 17:59:22 -0700","generator":"http:\/\/pipes.yahoo.com\/pipes\/","callback":"piper", "items": [{ "rights":"Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works", "link":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/mixtape1", "y:id":{"value":null,"permalink":"true"}, "content":{"content":"We're proud to be releasing this first VODO MIXTAPE.
