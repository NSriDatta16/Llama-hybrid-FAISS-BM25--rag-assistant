Have you tried printing out the value of form to make sure you're getting what you think you're getting? You do have a little problem with your code though... you should be doing form["id"].value to get the value of the item from FieldStorage. Another alternative is to just do it yourself, like so: import os import cgi query_string = os.environ.get("QUERY_STRING", "") form = cgi.parse_qs(query_string) This should result in something like this: {'id': ['123']}
