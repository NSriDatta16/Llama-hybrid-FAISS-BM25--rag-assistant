Survival Analysis for time to recovery data

I am working on a project where I have to understand the drivers of recovery time from an injury in a given sport. Thus, the objective is to understand the time to Return To Play (RTP) in days. The variables I have describe the injury (location, extension, age of the player etc.). A snippet of how the data looks like: RTP Joint Injury_extension Surgery Age 56 Ankle 56% No 19 41 Knee 100% No 27 285 Elbow 100% Yes 41 37 Ankle 16% No 25 15 Hip 6% No 33 $RTP = \beta_{1}\text{Joint} + \beta_{2}\text{InjuryExtension} + \beta_{3}\text{Surgery} + \beta_{4}\text{Age} + \varepsilon_i$ I have been digging into the literature so as to select the most appropriate statistical approach but I am still unsure of how to proceed. My thought was using Survival Analysis (Cox proportional hazard model and Survival Random Forests mainly) but I am unsure because in this database everyone suffers the event (recovery), the only thing that changes is the time difference and the characteristics of the injury. I have also thought of treating RTP as continuous (thus ignoring the right censorship of survival) and then using methods such as XGBoost or SVM to model the data, with the ultimate goal of obtaining accurate predictions and a good explanatory model by means of Shapley Values for instance. I'd really appreciate if you could give me some ideas on what the best approach to model this type of data is.
