I'm not sure what you're trying to do in your setter...but the following line is causing you problems: IResetCategoryControl() ireset = new IResetCategoryControl(); First of all, you don't use parenthesis when declaring the type of a variable. Second of all, you can't directly instantiate an instance of an Interface. To make that statement valid it would have to be something along the lines of: IResetCategoryControl iReset = new SomeConcreteResetCategoryControl(); There is a bigger issue though: Theoretically, your class is implementing the interface and the interface specifies that you need a property called CategoryToAdd with a public setter. That property should be setting the value on your class...not a new instance of another class. I would expect the code to look something like: public partial class AddDocumentsDialog : IResetCategoryControl { private string categoryToAdd; public string CategoryToAdd { set { // do some logic to validate the value categoryToAdd = value; } } } You might also want to re-think your interface design as set only properties are typically discouraged (in favor of using a method, since a set only property indicates some amount of logic being executed and the value being only used internally by the class rather than accessed by the consumer again).
