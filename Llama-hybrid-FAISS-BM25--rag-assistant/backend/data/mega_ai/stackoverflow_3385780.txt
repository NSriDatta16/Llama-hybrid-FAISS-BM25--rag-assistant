So, a two-part question: is there any plan to implement what I'm looking for: to check from inside a free application whether any of my other paid published applications are licensed? There is no way to do this. If not, then what would be the best way of achieving what I'm seeking? I'm thinking of maybe sending an intent to each of the installed upgrades, getting them to perform the licensing check, and then getting the upgrades to pass the response back into my base application. Sounds a bit messy - any better ideas? That sounds like the most reasonable way of doing it, assuming you have no other way of communicating between the clients (e.g. shared storage where you can write the licence status to). You just probably want to make sure that you secure these methods with custom permissions, so that only your apps can broadcast the licence status to your apps.
