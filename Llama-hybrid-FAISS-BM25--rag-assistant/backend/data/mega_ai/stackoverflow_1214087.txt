network monitoring on windows mobile 6

I am currently trying to write a network monitoring software for windows mobile 6. I googled a lot and some people say that it is not possible to use a NDIS driver or WinPcap or so for monitoring any network interface. Others say that it is possible. Fact is, that I found no exaples, nor any sourcecode on the net. Therefore I ask this community: Is it possible to write a packet capturing tool that works on data-link layer for windows mobile in C or C#? with best regards
