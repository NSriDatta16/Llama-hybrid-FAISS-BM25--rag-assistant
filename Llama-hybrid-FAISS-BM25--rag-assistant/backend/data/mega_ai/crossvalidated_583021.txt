Turning my 1st comment into an answer, per advice by @StephanKolassa... KMO isn't needed for PCA, actually, it is for factor analysis ( see and a link therein). Bartlett's test - hard to say what was wrong without having data (you could show your data, btw). This test is for large sample from normal population (e.g. see ). This test is mainly for factor analysis. What might be a reason to use it in the context of PCA as long as PCA is seen as just a data reduction transformation?
