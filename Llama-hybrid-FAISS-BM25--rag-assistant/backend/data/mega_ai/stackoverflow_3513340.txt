Your #pragmas look right. Bitfields don't "auto-pack" to the smallest type that fits the number of bits explicitly specified. I suspect that verlen is taking your given type "unsigned" and assuming that it's a bitfiend of size unsigned int, which sounds like 32 bits in your compiler. Try making the fields of verlen "unsigned char" instead. More here. The ability to specify "unsigned char" here is an MSFT extension (to ANSI C), but should work: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yszfawxh(VS.80).aspx N.B. Same here goes for flagfrag , which should be "unsigned short".
