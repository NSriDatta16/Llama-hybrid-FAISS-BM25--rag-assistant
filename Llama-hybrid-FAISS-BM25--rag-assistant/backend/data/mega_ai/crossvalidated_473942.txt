You should read through some of the threads in @Sycorax's search to become more familiar with logistic regression. You cannot convert the estimate for SVP_SP into an odds and a probability. It is only a number in comparison to the reference category. That is, 0.498532 is not the log(odds), it is the log(odds ratio). The estimate for the intercept, -2.855990 , is the log(odds) for SVP . Thus, the odds a judge affiliated with that party, and who has 0 years of experience and is the reference level of gender, is 0.05749887, and the probability is 0.05437251. If you exponentiate the estimate for SVP_SP , you get the odds ratio, 1.646303. This tells you that a judge from SP (again with 0 years of experience and is the reference level of gender) has an odds 1.65 times higher than a judge from SVP , so the odds that a judge from SP approves an application is 0.05749887 x 1.646303 = 0.09466056. Their probability of approval is then 0.08647481. You can also get their odds (and ultimately probability) by summing the estimates before you convert: exp(-2.855990 + 0.498532) = 0.09466056.
