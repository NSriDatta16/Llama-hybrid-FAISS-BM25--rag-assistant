According to Section VI in "An Introduction To Reinforcement Learning" written by Sutton and Barto, this is an experienced conclusion, not a strictly-proved theorem. So it implies that they believe in some special MDP model cases, it's possible that the convergence couldn't happen. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.
