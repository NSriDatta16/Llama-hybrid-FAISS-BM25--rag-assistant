I like SPIDER, but just because it has cool graphics. It isn't a bad SVM and it can do some basics. When it comes to pattern recognition, there are a lot of flavors of algorithms to choose from and each has its own trade-offs. The kinds of patterns that you are trying to work with determine which methods are going to work better. Without a clear specification there, it is somewhat difficult to make more headway into recommending a particular direction.
