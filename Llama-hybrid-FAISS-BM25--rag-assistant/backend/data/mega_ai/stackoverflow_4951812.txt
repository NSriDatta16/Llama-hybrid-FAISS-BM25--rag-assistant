How do I get the exact scroll position in an Listbox?

I would like to be able to load more data into a listbox when I reach the begining or the end of the listbox. My listbox shows items that are time related therefor when I reach the top and pull down I would like to see some text like "Scroll down more to retrieve more items" and if you do so it then triggers a data download for items that occur earlier. Same thing for the bottom item if you scoll down far enough (beneath the last item it triggers a data download for items later than listed). I'm not after a seamless listbox I want the data download to trigger only if I scroll upp or down far enough and release. I hope this description makes sense. Basically what I need to know is the exact scroll position in the Listbox and so that I can detemine when the list has been dragged and released far down or up. For those who have IPhone the effect I'm after is used in the Facebook app. Cheers /Jimmy
