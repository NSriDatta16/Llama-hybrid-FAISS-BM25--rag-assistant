In my opinion, the reason that Bayesian statistics are "better" for intepretation is nothing to do with the priors, but is due to the definition of a probability. The Bayesian definition (the relative plausibility of the truth of some proposition) is more closely in accord with our everyday usage of the word than is the frequentist definition (the long run frequency with which something occurrs). In most practical situations $p(\theta|x)$ is what we actually want to know, not $p(x|\theta)$, and the difficulty arises with frequentist statistics due to a tendency to interpret the results in a frequentist calculation as if it were a Bayesian one, i.e. $p(x|\theta)$ as if it were $p(\theta|x)$ (for example the p-value fallacy, or interpreting a confidence interval as if it were a credible interval). Note that informative priors are not necessarily subjective, for instance I would not consider it subjective knowledge to assert that prior knowledge of some physical system should be independent of the units of measurement (as they are essentially arbitrary), leading to the idea of transformation groups and "minimally informative" priors. The flip side of ignoring subjective knowledge is that your system may be sub-optimal because you are ignoring expert knowledge, so subjectivity is not necessarily a bad thing. For instance in the usual "infer the bias of a coin" problem, often used as a motivating example, you will learn relatively slowly with a uniform prior as the data comes in. But are all amounts of bias being equally likely a reasonable assumption? No, it is easy to make a slightly biased coin, or one that is completely biased (two heads or two tals), so if we build that assummption into our analysis, via a subjective prior, we will need less data to identify what the bias actually is. Frequentist analyses also often contain subjective elements (for instance the decision to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05, there is no logical compulsion to do so, it is merely a tradition that has proven useful). The advantage of the Bayesian approach is that the subjectivity is made explicit in the calculation, rather than leaving it implicit. At the end of the day, it is a matter of "horses for courses", you should have both sets of tools in your toolbox, and be prepared to use the best tool for the task at hand. Having said which, Bayesian $\gg$ frequentist !!! ;oP
