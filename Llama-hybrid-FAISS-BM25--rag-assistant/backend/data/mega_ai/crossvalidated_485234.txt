I would probably consider this to be a comment, but I don't have enough reputation to add it. I believe that your question can be answered in terms of the difference between stationarity and ergodicity of a particular realisation of the stochastic process. In the book by Hamilton (Time series Analysis) you can find an example of a stationary process that is not ergodic that basically goes as follows: Consider the mean of the ith realisation of a stochastic process $\{Y^{(i)}_t\}_{t=-\infty}^{t=\infty}$ to be $\mu^{(i)}$ , generated by a $\mathcal{N}(0, \lambda^2)$ distribution: $Y^{(i)}_t = \mu^{(i)} +\epsilon_t$ , being $\epsilon_t$ (Gaussian) white noise with variance $\sigma^2$ . Under these assumptions one can show that the process is covariance-stationary. In particular, the mean $\mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \mathbb{E}[\mu^{(i)}] + \mathbb{E}[\epsilon_t] =0$ does not depend on time. However, the i-th realisation is not mean-ergodic because the time average $ \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} 1/T \sum^T_{i=0}Y^{(i)}_t = \mu^{(i)}$ does not converge to the mean of the process, i.e. to $0$ . To me, your examples seem to be a sophisticated version of the above.
