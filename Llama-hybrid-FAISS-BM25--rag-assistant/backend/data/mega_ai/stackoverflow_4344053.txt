compressed string storage

Lets say I have many objects containing strings of non-trivial length (around ~3-4kb). The strings are all different from each other yet at the same time contain lots of common parts/subsequences. On average maybe 80-90% of any individual string is contained withing the others as well. Is there an easy way to automatically exploit this huge redundancy for compressing the data? Ideally the solution would be C++ and transparent for the user (i.e. I can use it as if I was accessing a regular read only const std::string but instead reading from compressed storage).
