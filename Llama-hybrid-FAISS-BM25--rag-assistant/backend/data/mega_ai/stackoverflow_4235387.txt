Processing & OpenGL - Changing the camera position?

I'm doing a small project where I plot data sets onto a world. I've got the plotting done. Now I want to implement camera movement. I have some code where if a user holds down c and drags the mouse, the camera position is changed. The thing is, I'm not sure how to calculate the camera movement from the mouse movement. This is the camera code for the default position: camera(width/2.0, height/2.0, (height/2.0) / tan(PI*60.0 / 360.0), width/2.0, height/2.0, 0, 0, 1, 0); How can I change the camera position in relation to the mouse dragging? (I've tried using mouseX and mouseY to offset the camera eye position, but it doesn't work well.)
