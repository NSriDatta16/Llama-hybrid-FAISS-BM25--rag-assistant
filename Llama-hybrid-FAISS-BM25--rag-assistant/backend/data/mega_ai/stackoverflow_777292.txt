I figured out my mistake, so I'll answer it here in case someone else makes a similar mistake. It looks like I did hint at the answer in my question, though I didn't realize it at the time. In my question, I stated that I have tried setting AllowDrop = true both before the custom control's handle is created (via designer/constructor code) and after the handle is created (via OnHandleCreated override). No difference in behavior. This is actually where the breakdown occurred. I failed to read the OnHandleCreated documentation that specifically states I needed to remember to call the base class' implementation of OnHandleCreated . Reflector shows that Control::OnHandleCreated is responsible for setting up Control 's internal event notification structure. I never called Control::OnHandleCreated , so the internal event notification structure was never getting properly built up. This eventing structure (reflector again shows) is responsible for firing OnDragOver , etc, so the missing eventing structure resulted in my missing events. Answer: Be sure that you call the base class implementation of OnHandleCreated when you override it!
