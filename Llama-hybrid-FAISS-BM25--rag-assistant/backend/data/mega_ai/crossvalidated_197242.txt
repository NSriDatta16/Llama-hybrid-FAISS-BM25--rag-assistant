For readers facing the problem of going to Bayesian for estimating survival functions accepting right censoring, I would recommend the nonparametric Bayesian approach developed by F Mangili, A Benavoli et al. The only prior specification is a (precision or strength) parameter. It avoids the need to specify the Dirichlet process in case of lack of prior information. The authors propose (1) - a robust estimator of the survival curves and its credible intervals for the probability of survival (2) - A test in the difference of survival of individuals from 2 independent populations which presents various benefits over the classical log rank test or other nonparametric tests. See the R package IDPsurvival and this reference: Reliable survival analysis based on the Dirichlet process. F Mangili et al. Biometrical Journal. 2014 .
