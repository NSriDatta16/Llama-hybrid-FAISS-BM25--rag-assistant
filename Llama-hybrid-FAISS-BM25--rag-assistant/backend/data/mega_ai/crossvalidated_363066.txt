Predicting Dependent Variable with Fixed Effects Model

I am currently working testing the effects of aid on inequality. I am using panel data, and the model looks something like the following: Model or Model I now have my coefficient estimates, and would like to show the average effect of increasing aid by x amount, to illustrate the substantive meaning of my model. To do this, I'd like to hold all of the other explanatory variables at their mean value, and then vary the value of the aid variable. e.g. to predict the outcome (inequality) when aid = 10 predict(Model, newdata = data.frame(Aid= 10, GDP.capita =mean(data$GDP.capita), Growth = mean(data$Growth), polity2 = mean(data$polity2), GovtConsumption = mean(data$GovtConsumption), Country = "??" , Year= "??")) However, because it is a fixed effect model, I do not know what value to input for the "mean" fixed effect (see question marks above). I don't want the prediction to be for any specific country, but rather the overall average effect - is it possible to do this? Many thanks in advance M
