You can use fviz_cluster function from factoextra pacakge in R. It will show the scatter plot of your data and different colors of the points will be the cluster. To the best of my understanding, this function performs the PCA and then chooses the top two pc and plot those on 2D. Any suggestion/improvement in my answer are most welcome.
