Note that the first definition refers to the median, while the second refers to a median. This is not a minor distinction. According to some uses of the term "median" you can have more than one -- a median is any value that satisfies certain requirements (typically either dividing the set in half, or minimizing some distance/loss function based on absolute distances between points) and so in your example, any real number in [0,1] is indeed a median, while convention dictates that we refer to 1/2 as the median. The distinctions between the various common definitions (averaging "middle" values, finding any point that divides the set, or finding points that minimize the distance according to the L1 norm) won't actually make a difference in most circumstances, and so most commonly people will refer to the median and ignore the others. Think of it analogously to how people will often casually refer to 2 as the square root of 4, even though -2 is also a square root of 4. The less commonly encountered cases are simply ignored.
