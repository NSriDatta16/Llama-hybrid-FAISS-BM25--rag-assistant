You can reference projects which are lower down but you cannot add them in Visual Studio. Seems a little odd to me but I've found that you can do it but you need to edit the path in the sln file. Bit fiddly but it works. My personal favorite way to oganising source is: - Vendor -- Product --- Version so for example -Microsoft --Enterprise Library ---3.1 ---4.0 --Style Cop ---4.3 -Apache --Log4net ---1.2.10 ---1.2.1 etc that way you will never have dulplication of Dlls and your code will fit under your company and product, with each release being a version.
