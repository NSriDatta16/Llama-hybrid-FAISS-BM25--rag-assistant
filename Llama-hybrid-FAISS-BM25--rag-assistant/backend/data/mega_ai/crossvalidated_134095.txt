How to get class probabilities for unsupervised random forest

I have created random forest for the unsupervised case. g = randomForest(iris[,-5],keep.forest=TRUE) Now I need to know the class probabilities for each entry (with respect to iris$Species). In case of a supervised case, then I would use this code: p = predict(g, iris, type = "prob") However, for the unsupervised case it says: Can't predict unsupervised forest. So, how can I extract the class probabilities?
