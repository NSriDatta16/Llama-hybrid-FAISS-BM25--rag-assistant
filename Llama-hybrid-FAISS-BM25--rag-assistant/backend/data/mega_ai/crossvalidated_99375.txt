Gelman and Rubin convergence diagnostic, how to generalise to work with vectors?

The Gelman and Rubin diagnostic is used to check the convergence of multiple mcmc chains run in parallel. It compares the within-chain variance to the between-chain variance, the exposition is below: Steps (for each parameter): Run m â‰¥ 2 chains of length 2n from overdispersed starting values. Discard the first n draws in each chain. Calculate the within-chain and between-chain variance. Calculate the estimated variance of the parameter as a weighted sum of the within-chain and between-chain variance. Calculate the potential scale reduction factor. List item I want to use this statistic but the variables I want to use it with are random vectors. Does it make sense to take the mean of the covariance matrices in this case?
