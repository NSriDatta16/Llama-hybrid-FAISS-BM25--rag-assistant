Why do the p-value and confidence intervals not always match in logistf?

I have recently started using logistf in R and find that I am getting strange results. Namely, sometimes the confidence intervals for the coefficient cross 0, despite having a strongly significant p-value, and vice versa. For example outcome In my output, I discover the coefficient for my predictor to be -0.4 (95% confidence interval -2 to 7). However, the p-value is 0.00000352. Can anyone explain how I am using this penalised logistic regression method incorrectly as this result seems to be inconsistent?
