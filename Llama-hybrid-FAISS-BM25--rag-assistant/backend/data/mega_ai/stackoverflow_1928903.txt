Got around this by converting the images to be span's with the same styles that the image had on it for width, height, border, etc. and setting the background-image in an inline style. IE now treats it like any other HTML element rather than an "image" so the dragging is fixed. Not perfectly accessibility friendly but then neither is dragging and dropping!
