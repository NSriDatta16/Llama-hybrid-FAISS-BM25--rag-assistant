Can you reframe your question as, "Are perch heights different between successful and unsuccessful foraging attempts?" In this case, you could compare the two groups, success and failure, with a t-test. By using a two-tailed t-test, you are making no assumptions of the direction of the difference, higher or lower could either be more successful. The null hypothesis in this case is that heights do not differ between successful and failed foraging attempts, and the alternative hypothesis that perch height does differ between groups.
