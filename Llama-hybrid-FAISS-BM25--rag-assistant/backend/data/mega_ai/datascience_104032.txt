New classification in Machine Learning model with xgboost

I write a code in Rstudio with xgboost to solve a Machine Learning problem. This is my actual code: library(xgboost) library(tidyverse) library(caret) library(readxl) library(data.table) library(mlr) data $Species ts_label Species new_tr 0.5,1,0) #confusion matrix library(caret) factors_both So, this is a Machine Learning supervised models. How can I classify a new registration? I have this new registration: new_record How can I classify it using the previous model?
