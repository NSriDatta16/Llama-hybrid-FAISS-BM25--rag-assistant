To make it really elegant and Pythonic, try to create a generator, yield -ing successive values from the LFSR. Also, comparing to a floating point 0.0 is unnecessary and confusing. A LFSR is just one of many ways to create pseudo-random numbers in computers. Pseudo-random, because there numbers aren't really random - you can easily repeat them by starting with the seed (initial value) and proceeding with the same mathematical operations.
