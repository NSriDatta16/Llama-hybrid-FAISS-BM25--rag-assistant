In terms of persistent storage, 10Mb isn't a lot for modern mobile devices, so - once downloaded - storing your application data on the device shouldn't be a problem. The other type of footprint you may want to consider, however, is memory usage. Ideally, you'd have clips buffered in RAM before starting playback, to minimise latency. Given that most Symbian devices impose a per-process default heap size limit of 1Mb, you can't hold all clips in memory, so your app would need to manage the loading and clearing of a cache. It isn't generally possible to buffer multiple compressed clips at a time on Symbian however, since buffering a clip typically requires usage of a scarce resource (namely an audio co-processor). Opening a new clip while another is already open will typically cause the first to be closed, meaning that you can only buffer one in memory at a time. If you do need to reduce latency, your app will therefore need to take care of loading and decompressing where necessary, to give PCM which you can then feed to the audio stack.
