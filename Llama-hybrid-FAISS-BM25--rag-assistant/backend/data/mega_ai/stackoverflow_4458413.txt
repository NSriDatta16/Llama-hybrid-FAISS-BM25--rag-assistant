Old discussion, but I was looking for the same answers - so for those who follow - this is what I found out RTFM! from the CGI man page ( and there is more ) DEBUGGING If you are running the script from the command line or in the perl debugger, you can pass the script a list of keywords or parameter=value pairs on the command line or from standard input (you don't have to worry about tricking your script into reading from environment variables). You can pass keywords like this: your_script.pl keyword1 keyword2 keyword3 or this: your_script.pl keyword1+keyword2+keyword3 or this: your_script.pl name1=value1 name2=value2 or this: your_script.pl name1=value1&name2=value2 To turn off this feature, use the -no_debug pragma.
