How to create a list or tuple of empty lists in Python?

I need to incrementally fill a list or a tuple of lists. Something that looks like this: result = [] firstTime = True for i in range(x): for j in someListOfElements: if firstTime: result.append([f(j)]) else: result[i].append(j) In order to make it less verbose an more elegant, I thought I will preallocate a list of empty lists result = createListOfEmptyLists(x) for i in range(x): for j in someListOfElements: result[i].append(j) The preallocation part isn't obvious to me. When I do result = [[]] * x , I receive a list of x references to the same list, so that the output of the following result[0].append(10) print result is: [[10], [10], [10], [10], [10], [10], [10], [10], [10], [10]] I can use a loop ( result = [[] for i in range(x)] ), but I wonder whether a "loopless" solution exists. Is the only way to get what I'm looking for
