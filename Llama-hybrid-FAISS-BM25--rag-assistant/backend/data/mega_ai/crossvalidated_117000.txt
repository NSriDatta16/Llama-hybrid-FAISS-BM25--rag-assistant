Regression/classification, how to accommodate the missing columns of data?

I would like to apply any regression methods, such as the ones available using WEKA libraries (for example, SVMs, NNs, Random Trees,...) . However, I am getting very low results since I am missing the relevant columns of data. I am posting this question since doing the internet search gives the results regarding the situations when there are missing data-points and not the whole data-sets. What would be the best way, if any, to accommodate the missing columns and get better regression results ? What I need is something that would mock the missing data in such a way, that would yield the better statistical results regarding the prediction results. I have tried clustering, and than doing the regression per cluster. That does improve the results, but the improvement is not a significant one. Furthermore, I have tried applying the regression methods multiple number of times, but that does not do anything at all for a data-set I have. Mocking the data by adding a random data column improves the training (sometimes), but not the actual prediction. Any help or a hint would be more than appreciated! Thank you.
