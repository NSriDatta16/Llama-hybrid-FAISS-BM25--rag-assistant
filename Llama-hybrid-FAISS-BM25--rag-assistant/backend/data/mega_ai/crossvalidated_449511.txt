In my opinion "examining fitted vs residuals" is a graphical alternative to the Box-Cox test When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? which can help to evaluate the hypothesis that the variability of residuals is or is not linearly related (sympathetic) to the level i.e.the fitted values of the series. IFF you are analyzing time series or spatial data there is an additional scheme available.... "examining the plot of the residuals over time" is a graphical way of assessing possible deterministic change points in the error variance which suggest periods of time where the variance of the errors changes significantly. See a formal test for this here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html Finally if you don't treat one-time anomalies as just that you can often mis-analyze the data as was done with the classic INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PASSENGER DATA example presented by Box and Jenkins in 1964 https://autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog . A few anomalies at the highest level of the series skewed the Box-COX test to conclude the higher levels meant higher model error variance which is not true in general. https://autobox.com/pdfs/vegas_ibf_09a.pdf has some very illuminating and specific details on the AIRLINE SERIES data. Box & Jenkins conclusion (without suggesting viable alternatives) that you need to take logarithms was roundly criticized in the respected literature by other time series statisticians particularly Professor Chris Chatfield from Bath University.
