What does the KNNclassifier do differently from the KNNregressor?

While I understand how KNNregressor will fit a line to data by taking the k nearest neighbors to a point and averaging them, I am having more trouble understanding what KNNclassifier does with respect to this other method that shares the KNN prefix. Does the KNNclassifer just average the response of parameters at a point and guess from that average? How does that work exactly? Does which method you use just depend on the output you want, continuous or discrete?
