Flex HTTPService does not include Content-Length header?

I am trying to get a Flex application to communicate with a custom python webserver I have developed. I am noticing that I cannot read the postdata received because Flex does not seem to include the Content-Length in the HTTP headers. (My webserver work when posted to from plain HTML) Is this a known problem? any ideas how to set the content-length header? Here is the current headers being sent: Host: localhost:7070 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0 .3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive
