The way I think about it is that the best part of "code is data" is the face that function are, well, functionally no different than another variable. The fact that you can write code that writes code is one of the single most powerful (and often overlooked) features of Lisp. Functions can accept other functions as parameters, and even return functions as a result. This lets one code at a much higher level of abstraction than, say, Java. It makes many tasks elegant and concise, and therefore, makes the code easier to modify, maintain, and read, or at least in theory. I would say that the only way to truly "get" Lisp is to spend a lot of time with it -- once you get the hang of it, you'll wish you had some of the features of Lisp in your other programming languages.
