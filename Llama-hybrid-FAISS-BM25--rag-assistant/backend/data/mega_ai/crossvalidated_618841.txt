Interpreting results of K-means after PCA

I have this dataset about an airline company customers with 22 explanatory variables. My goal is to perform some sort of customer segmentation with the k-means algorithm. One problem that I've found is that when applied on the whole dataset, I find it difficult to identify well-separated and balanced group. For this reason, finding some sources online to support this practice, I tried to first apply PCA on the dataset and then the k-means obtaining some good results in terms of clusters. My question now is, would it be wrong to use this clusters that I found, to compare the differences in the original 22 variables between groups? For example I have column 'satisfaction', which identify whether or not a customer is satisfied, and I've noticed that the percentage of satisfied customer in each group is very different. Can I try to analyze other variables, like age in each group, to try to explain this difference? Or would it be wrong since the clusters were created using transformed variables and not the original ones?
