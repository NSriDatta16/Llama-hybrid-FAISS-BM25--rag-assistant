How can I use properties taken from a file in the code of an eclipse PDE fragment/plugin project?

I have created an eclipse plugin project and a corresponding fragment project which I use for junit tests. In the fragment I specify the plugin project as the "Host plugin". Further I specify the following on the build.properties pane: source.. = src/ output.. = bin/ bin.includes = META-INF/,\ .,\ my.properties where my.properties is a file located at the root of the fragment project. I have then written a test where I try to load the my.properties file like this: Properties properties = new Properties(); InputStream istream = this.getClass().getClassLoader() .getResourceAsStream("my.properties"); try { properties.load(istream); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } but istream is null and the test fails with a NullPointerException when calling load in the try block. I have tried to do the same thing in the host plugin and there it works fine. Any ideas about why I can't read resouces in my PDE fragment when using Junit?
