Any regression package will either (1) include an intercept and drop one dummy to avoid collinearity or (2) not include an intercept but not drop any dummies. In case (1) the interpretation of any dummy coefficient is "in respect to the average of all others" and in specification (2) it is in respect to the one omitted where the intercept is shared for all.
