Does variable X, for example, X= average daily activity of a person, change with age?

I would like to answer the following question: Does variable X (numerical variable), for example, X= average daily activity of a person, change with age? For example, can I say that generally older people tend to have less daily activity than younger people? I have 3 groups of people, grouped by age, each person with one value of average daily activity. For example: G1 - N=10 all 50 years old, each person with a value for variable X G2 - N=2 all 5 years old, each person with a value for variable X G3 - N=40 all 20 years old, each person with a value for variable X I already tried to plot all points (disregarding groups) in a 2D plot Age vs Variable X, and calculate Pearson and Spearman correlations to try to detect a correlation between the variables. Is this valid? Should I keep the groups and try to perform a hypothesis test to check for differences between groups? How can I deal with different sample sizes? What would you do to try to understand if there is some relation between age and variable X? Thank you!
