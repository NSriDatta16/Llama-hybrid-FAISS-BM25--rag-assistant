vector of weights

I am using the MuMIn package for model averaging. However, I am not clear of the function par.avg(). In this function, we need to specify the following, par.avg(x, se, weight, df = NULL, level = 1 - alpha, alpha = 0.05, revised.var = TRUE, adjusted = TRUE) x: vector of parameters. se: vector of standard errors. weight: vector of weights. I am using the regression coefficient (beta) for x, standard error obtained after model averaging and the Akaike weight of the parameter (predictor). However, I find that irrespective of the Akaike weight value I input, the upper and lower CI do not change. So why do we need the vector of weights? Or is it that I am grossly or conceptually confused by the "vector of weights"? e.g. x Changing the weight x Am I on the right track of interpreting confidence intervals from the par.avg() function? Another question, if there is a single best model (w = 0.96), can we use the par.avg to find the confidence intervals from the standardized model coefficients?
