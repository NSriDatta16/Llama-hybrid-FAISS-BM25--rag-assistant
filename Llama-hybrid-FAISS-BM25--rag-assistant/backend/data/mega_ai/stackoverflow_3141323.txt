You're probably looking at a recursive function as being the simplest solution to this. A really simple example is something like this, there are various techniques you could use to make this a proper tree structure. Really depends what you want to do tbh function showlist($parent=NULL) { $q = ($parent !== NULL) ? "SELECT `id`,`name` FROM `categories` WHERE `parentId` ='".$parent."'" : "SELECT `id`,`name` FROM `categories` WHERE `parentId` IS NULL"; $result = mysql_query($q)or die(mysql_error()); while ($cat = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { echo $line['name']; showlist($line['id']); } } Theres some really good info on the MySQL site about managing hierarchical data but the most elegant solutions would mean you changing your Schema which i'm not sure if you're able to do or not?
