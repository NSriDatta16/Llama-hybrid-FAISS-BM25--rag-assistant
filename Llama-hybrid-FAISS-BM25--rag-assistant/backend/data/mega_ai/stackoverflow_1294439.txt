How to make an element take up all-the-width-that-is-left?

Shoes.app do flow do file = "something with variable length" para "Loading #{file}: " progress :width => -300 end end As you can see from the code I am trying to display a progress bar that goes from the end of the text until the right edge of the application window. When the text has a fixed length this solution works but it doesn't once the text changes length in the above fragment: there will be either too little or too much space for the progress bar. Is there a solution to this problem? I tried asking the para element it's width but it is 0???
