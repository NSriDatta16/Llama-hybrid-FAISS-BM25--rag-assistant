There's no way (AFAIK) to get the dimensions of the keyboard view. It is however constant, at least in every iPhone version so far. If you calculate the toolbar position as an offset from the BOTTOM of your view, and take the size of your view into account, then you should not have to worry whether a navbar is present or not. E.g. #define KEYBOARD_HEIGHT 240 // example - can't remember the exact size #define TOOLBAR_HEIGHT 30 toolBarRect.origin.y = viewRect.size.height - KEYBOARD_HEIGHT - TOOLBAR_HEIGHT; // move toolbar either directly or with an animation Instead of a define, you could easily create a keyboardHeight function that returns the size based on whether the keyboard is being displayed, and move this toolbar positioning into a separate function that reorganizes your layout. Also it can depend on where you do this positioning as it's possible the size of your view may change between being loaded and shown based on your navbar setup. I believe the best place to do it would be in viewWillAppear.
