Using the fbagent, you cannot publish title+description only, you have to also provide a link to an image and a webpage url. The image can be your iPhone app icon stored on your site and webpage url can be appstore download link of your iPhone app. This will help popularize and advertise your app. So, minimum you can do is: fbAgent.shouldResumeSession = YES; [fbAgent publishFeedWithName:art captionText:summ imageurl:@"http://amanpages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/logo2.png" linkurl:@"http://amanpages.com/" userMessagePrompt:@"What do i think:"]; Hope it helps.
