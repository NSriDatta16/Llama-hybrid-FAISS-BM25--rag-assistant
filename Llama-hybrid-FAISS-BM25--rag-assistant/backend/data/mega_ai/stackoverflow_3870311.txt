(i.e. no javasript, images, or css) make them JS, CSS external. google will not touch it (very often) - (or you can block it via robots.txt, but that's unnecessary) make all repeating images sprites. load the big image asynchronously via js after the onload event of the document body. this is also good for the user, as the site renderes faster until they see something. as long as the main content is the same for google and the average first time visitor, and if there is no miss-leading intent, it's ok and a great strategy. don't worry to much about any possible penalities. as long as there is no missleading intent it's mostly ok. what is not ok to deliver google based on the user agent something majorly different. (here it's better to be save than sorry)
