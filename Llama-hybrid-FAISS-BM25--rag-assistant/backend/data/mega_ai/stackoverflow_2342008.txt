The " sos " package is an excellent resource. It's primary interface is the " findFn " command, which accepts a string (your search term) and scans the "function" entries in Johnathan Baron's site search database, and returns the entries that contain the search term in a data frame (of class "findFn"). The columns of this data frame are: Count , MaxScore , TotalScore , Package , Function , Date , Score , Description , and Link . Clicking on "Link" in any entry's row will immediately pull up the help page. An example: suppose you wanted to find all convolution filters across all 1800+ R packages. library(sos) cf = findFn("convolve") This query will look the term "convolve", in other words, that doesn't have to be the function name. Keying in "cf" returns an HTML table of all matches found (23 in this case). This table is an HTML rendering of the data frame i mentioned just above. What is particularly convenient is that each column ("Count", "MaxScore", etc.) is sortable by clicking on the column header, so you can view the results by "Score", by "Package Name", etc. (As an aside: when running that exact query, one of the results was the function "panel.tskernel" in a package called "latticeExtra". I was not aware this package had any time series filters in it and i doubt i would have discovered it otherwise.
