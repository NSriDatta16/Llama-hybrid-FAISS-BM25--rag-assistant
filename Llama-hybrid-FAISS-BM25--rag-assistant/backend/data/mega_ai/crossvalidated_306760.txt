You can break time time into intervals and perform a multiperiode logit model as in Shumway (2001) . E.g., you time intervals are $(0, 1], (1, 2], \dots$. I have implemented this in dynamichazard::static_glm in R which is directly applicable if you have initial data in a typical stop-event setup used in survival analysis. Do notice that the t-stats from the resulting model does not have the correction mentioned in Shumway (2001). This method differs from the one @ndoogan with time dummies as you only get one common intercept in all time periods with dynamichazard::static_glm . You can, however, get a dummy for each period by calling dynamichazard::get_survival_case_weights_and_data with argument use_weights = FALSE , add the time dummy indicator yourself to the returned data.frame and then call e.g. glm .
