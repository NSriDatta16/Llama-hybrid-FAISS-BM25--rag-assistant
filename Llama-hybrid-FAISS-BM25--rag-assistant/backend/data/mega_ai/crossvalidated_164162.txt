Is large scale PCA even possible?

Principal component analysis' (PCA) classical way is to do it on an input data matrix which columns have zero mean (then PCA can "maximize variance"). This can be achieved easily by centering the columns. Howenver, when the input matrix is sparse, the centered matrix will now longer be sparse, and - if the matrix is very big - will thus not fit into memory anymore. Is there an algorithmic solution for the storage problem?
