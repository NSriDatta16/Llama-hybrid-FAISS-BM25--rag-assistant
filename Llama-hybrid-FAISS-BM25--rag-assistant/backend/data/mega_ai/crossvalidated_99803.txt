Is a data point significantly larger than a certain distribution average?

I have a simulated distribution with mean 12.53% and standard deviation 11.83%. The sample size is big enough (10,000) to assume it is a Normal distribution. How do I properly test if the value "26.05%" is significantly larger than the mean 12.53%? Can anyone please help me to write the null hypothesis, as well as the test, or just give me any reference that I'm not being able to find (or most probably to recognize) on the web?
