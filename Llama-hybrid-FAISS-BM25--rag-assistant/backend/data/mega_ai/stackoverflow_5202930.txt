Letters, or more exactly, characters, are numbers (from 0 to 255 in extended ascii, 0 to 127 in non-extended). For instance, in ASCII, 'A' (quote means character, as opposed to string) is 65. So 1 + 'A' would give you 66 - 'B'. So, you can take a random number from 0 to 26, add it to the character 'a', and here you are : random letter. You could also do it with a string, typing "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" and taking a random position in this chain, but Barker solution is more elegant.
