What are some of the basic results I should report in a statistics project?

I have been sitting in on a lot of data science/statistics project and I've noticed some inconsistencies when data scientists report their metrics. Is there some resources available that outline the statistical test performed and the appropriate metrics and format to report for the said test? Here are two examples for my recent experience: One-way repeated measures ANOVA, Score [F(8,92) = 43.12, p ANOVA, F=1.95, p = 0.015 My question is not limited to just ANOVA, but any statistical test and their corresponding results.
