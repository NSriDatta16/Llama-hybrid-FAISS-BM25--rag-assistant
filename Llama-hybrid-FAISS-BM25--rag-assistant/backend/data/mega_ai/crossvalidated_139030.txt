Conditional probability and frequentism

I'm brushing up on my basic statistics from undergrad engineering, and (being much older) I've found myself trying to understand the Frequentism vs. Bayesianism debate. Luckily there's plenty online for that. Some questions that came to mind while researching this (and that I cannot find through extensive searching) are: Is conditional probability a foundation for Bayesian probability (due to it being a part of the likelihood function) and strictly confined to the Bayesian concept of probability, given that it requires a prior? Is there such a thing as a frequentist's conditional probability? Thanks in advance
