Another approach would be to use the Magento classes to form the query for you. require 'app/Mage.php'; Mage::app(); $products = Mage::getModel('catalog/product') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToFilter('type_id', 'configurable') ->setPage(30, 0); foreach ($products as $product) { echo nl2br("id: {$product->getId()} sku: {$product->getSku()} value: {$product->getTitle()} Categories: {$product->getCategoryIds()}"); } The advantage is it automatically uses the correct database credentials even if they are changed. You also benefit from methods like $product->getCategoryCollection() should you want to retrieve the category names or any other detail. This way does have the overhead of loading Magento which might make your page a little slower.
