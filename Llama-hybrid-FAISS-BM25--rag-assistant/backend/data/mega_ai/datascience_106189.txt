Twitter Sentiment Analysis: problem in predicting

I am going to do Sentiment Analysis over some tweets. The goal is to find out which post is with and which one is against a specific topic(which tweet is saying this product is good and which on is saying that is not good). I have about 6000 tweets for each Positive, Negative and Neutral. I have tested some models like Naive Bayes, NN, Decision Tree and Random Forest but I saw no good results. When I refer to confusion matrix, I see that many Positive and Negative are predicted interchangeably . Also, when I try to add some layers (for example in NN), it is going to over-fit. I use these models, but almost all the results are the same: [(TF-IDF)] + [(Naive Bayes), (Decision Tree), (Random Forest)] [(BERT), (Distilbert)] + [(Fully connected NN)]
