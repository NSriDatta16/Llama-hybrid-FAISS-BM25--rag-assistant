Practical interpretation of the moving average part of Arima model

My question is regarding the practical definition of Arima (0, 1, 1) posted on this site ARIMA(0,1,1) Forecast . The random walk part is very clear to me, the current observation is a function of the previous observation. Could anyone explain to me what the MA(1) part practically indicates? for example, if I have population time series data, a random walk shows that the current population or this year's population at time t is equivalent to the previous population t-1. If we add the moving average part (MA(1)), what does really mean in practical terms? thanks
