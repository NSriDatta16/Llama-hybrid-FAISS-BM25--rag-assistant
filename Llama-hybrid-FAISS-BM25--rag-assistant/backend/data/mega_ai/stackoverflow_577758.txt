I found the IE6 registry key. Am I able to delete this without causing problems on my PC?? HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-117609710-1647877149-839522115-1003\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\User Agent\Post Platform where I found the following: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) I have IE7 installed and am able to use most facebook etc. items. It was pointed out to me that I seem to have both versions active and could experience problems if I don't fix this. I don't want to remove the registry key if that could cause a whole new set of problems! thanks
