This sounds like a provisioning issue. It will do this exactly if there is a certificate problem - display the load screen - then just abort. This happens, for example, if the certificates are expired. It will however tell you that this is happening on the console. Run with your iDevice connected - open the Organizer - view the console - try running. See if it complains about the certificate on launch. If not - the console will probably tell you something ...
