Java (swing): Annoyance resizing JFrame by dragging the bottom left corner

The black is JFrame content and the red one is JPanel's. This happens a lot when resizing the JFrame. A little less, when resizing the frame from upper left corner, but still happens. The panel is not able to keep up with the frame change. Why, is it "fixable" ? Thanks
