Yes, you are right. Time series analysis for prediction is nothing else than supervised machine learning. I argue here why time series analysis is not commonly considered machine learning , but in my opinion, it really comes down to terminology . Note that there is a lively research community looking at ML algorithms for time series forecasting, e.g., neural networks . However, just because a method "is machine learning" or sounds sexy doesn't mean it will necessarily outperform simple time series methods like exponential smoothing, ARIMA - or even a simple historical average: Is it unusual for the MEAN to outperform ARIMA?
