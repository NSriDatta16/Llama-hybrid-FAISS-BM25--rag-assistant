Kth element in an unordered list, using k order statistic - Time complexity O(n)?

Can some one tell me how Randomized select algorithm gives average case time complexity of O(n)? I see that it will have the best case O(n) if the randomly selected pivot (during 1st pass) is the kth element in the list. But how can this be average case? we cant guarantee that every time we run the algorithm we will hit the correct one in the first pass itself rt?
