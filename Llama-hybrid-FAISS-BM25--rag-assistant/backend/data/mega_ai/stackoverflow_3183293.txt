PartCover and multiple TargetArgs

I need to load coverage report from multiples test source, but if I set multiple dlls (two of them test the same class) in TargetArgs, the coverage data is overwritten with the results of the last dll. How can I add the results from multiples dll testing the same class? Here is an example of my partcover config file c:\NUnit\nunit-console.exe c:\MyProject\Testing ApplicationServices.Test.dll Integration.Test.dll +[MyProject.*]* -[*.Test]* Thanks In Advance
