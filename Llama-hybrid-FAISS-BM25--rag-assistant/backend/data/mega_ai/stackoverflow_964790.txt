SilverLight file upload?

I would like to upload file from the client to the server with a Front End in SilverLight. My problem is that the file is NOT in the isolation storage (that would be easy!). The application in few word require to upload images from the user computer similar to the file uploaded FaceBook, (the Java version). Is there a way to grant permission from the user OR a trick that I might not know to be able to upload files? Thank you *I do not want to use the Open File Dialog.
