Here is a nice article by Mark Fletcher: Consistent Web Design with Dreamweaver Templates Briefly, if you have a lot of same pages but with different content, like photgallery, simple paragraphs, login forms etc. you can define a template and create documents based on this template. Also, you will have to define editable and "not editable" regions of template. And when you will create several documents based on this template, and you will need to change something in the header, you will have to change it only in template file and then, this change will apply to all child documents. (But only if changes was made to "not editable" region). Its almost the same as template logic of PHP sites.
