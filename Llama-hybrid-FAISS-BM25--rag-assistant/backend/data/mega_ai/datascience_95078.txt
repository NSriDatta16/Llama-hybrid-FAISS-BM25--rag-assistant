There's a good chance that your question will be closed I'm afraid, but here are a few thoughts: would differentiate a professional data scientist from me A professional data scientist is somebody who does data science for a living, so you definitely belong to the club, congrats! Seriously, apparently, you have at least some symptoms of the impostor syndrome : your level is appropriate, you're able to do your job, yet you feel inadequate. The usual advice on AcademiaSE (it's very common in academia) is to deal with the psychological aspect, optionally with some professional help. Now about the myth of "the real professional data scientist": data science has become vast and specialized. There's not even a clear definition of the scope of data science, let alone a shared understanding of which knowledge/skills a data scientist should have. Additionally, the field changes very fast, so it's humanly impossible to know everything. What people usually recommend is to gain as much experience as possible, and especially in your case since it looks like you already covered the theory fairly well. You can just pick a topic you'd like to dig deeper into and go for it. For the record, I find browsing and answering questions on DataScienceSE a very good way to keep up, discover things that I didn't know, and progress. Why answering is useful you ask? Because it forces me to (1) understand the problem and think about how I would address it. An intellectual ML design exercise, it's always good to practice. (2) explain things in a clear way, which is always a good exercise to check how clear things are in my mind.
