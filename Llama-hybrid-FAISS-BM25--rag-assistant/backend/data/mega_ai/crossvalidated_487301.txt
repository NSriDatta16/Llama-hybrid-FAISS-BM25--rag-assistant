Your argument seems mostly OK. I'm not sure what you mean by "[S]ince it can be assumed that voters think similarly...." and I'm not sure I follow all of your steps toward the end. I think you are describing the Wald confidence interval, which is of the form $$\hat \theta \pm 1.96\sqrt{ \frac{\hat\theta(1-\hat\theta) }{n} }.$$ This kind of interval was originally proposed as an 'asymptotic' interval to be use for very large $n.$ The number 1.96 comes from assuming that $n$ is sufficiently large that $\hat \theta = \frac{X}{n}\stackrel{aprx}{\sim}\mathsf{Norm}\left(\mu = \hat\theta, \sigma=\sqrt{ \frac{\hat\theta(1-\hat\theta) }{n} }\right),$ where $X$ is the number of Successes. There are two approximations involved in the displayed relationship: (a) that $\hat \theta$ is approximately normal and (b) that the standard deviation $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\theta(1-\theta)}{n}}$ is well-estimated by $\hat\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\hat\theta(1-\hat\theta)}{n}}.$ Assumption (a) is reasonable for $\theta$ not too close to $0$ or $1$ and $n$ is at least several hundred, as in most election polls. However, (b) is not reliably accurate unless $n$ is a thousand or more. For 95% confidence intervals, the Agresti-Coull variation of the Wald confidence interval has been shown to have 95% coverage of $\theta$ more reliably than the Wald interval. It uses $\tilde\theta=\frac{X+2}{n+4}$ and is of the form $\tilde \theta \pm 1.96\sqrt{ \frac{\tilde\theta(1-\tilde\theta) }{n+4} }.$ Rationale: A test for $H_0: \theta=\theta_0$ vs. $H_a: \theta\ne\theta_0$ rejects at level 5% when $|Z| = |(\hat\theta - \theta_0)/\sigma_0| \ge 1.96,$ with $\sigma_0 = \sqrt{\theta_0(1-\theta_0)/n}.$ "Inverting this test" to find the interval of values $\theta_0$ for which $H_0$ is not rejected, we would get a 95% CI for $\theta,$ without using $\hat\sigma$ to estimate $\sigma.$ This involves solving a somewhat messy quadratic equation. By taking $1.96 = 2$ and ignoring small terms in the solution, one gets the Agresti-Coull interval as a good approximation. Example: In your example with $X=800, n=1000,$ the Wald CI $(0.7752,0.8248)$ the Agresti-Coull CI $(0.777,8266)$ are nearly the same. However, for $X = 80, n = 100,$ the respective intervals $(0.722,0.878)$ and $(0.710, 9.867)$ are noticeably different. Another good frequentist CI, called the Jeffreys CI, for $\theta$ uses a Bayesian argument with noninformative prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(.5,.5).$ It uses the quantiles $0.025$ and $0.975$ of $\mathsf{Beta}(x+.5,n-x+.5).$ In the previous example, the CIs for samples $n=1000$ and $n=100$ are $(0.774,0.824)$ and $(0.714,0.869).$ respectively, in close agreement with the Agresti-Coull intervals above. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 800.5, 200.5) [1] 0.7743623 0.8239041 qbeta(c(.025,.975), 80.5, 20.5) [1] 0.7137204 0.8692096 Simulation: Among a million samples of size $n=50$ with $\theta = 0.81,$ only about 91.3% (not 95%) produced Wald "95% CIs" covering $\theta.$ set.seed(2020) n = 50; th = .81 x = rbinom(10^6, n, .8); th.est = x/n se = sqrt(th.est*(1-th.est)/n) mean(th > th.est-1.96*se & th References: The Wikipedia article on binomial confidence intervals discusses these and other styles of confidence intervals.
