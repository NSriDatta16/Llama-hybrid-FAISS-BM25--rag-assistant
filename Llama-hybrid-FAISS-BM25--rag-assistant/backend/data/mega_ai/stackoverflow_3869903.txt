I have a working example class object you can use that makes this a good deal less code. http://www.members.shaw.ca/albertKallal/Ribbon/ribbon.htm The above lets you use a very much like previous style code approach. So, to set a picture for a ribbon, you can go: meRib("Button1").Picture = "HappyFace.png" The same download has a working form in which some images in the ribbon change from choices made on the form.
