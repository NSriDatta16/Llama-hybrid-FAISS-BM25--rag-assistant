Coldfusion MX 8 is several times faster than MX 7 from all accounts. When it came out, I read many opinions that simply upgrading for the performance boost without changing a line of code was well worth it... It was worth it. With the gains in processing power, memory availability, generally, you can do a lot more with less optimized code. Does this mean we should stop caring and write whatever? No. Chances are where we take the most shortcuts, we'll have to grow the system the most there. Finding that find line between enough engineering and not over-engineering a solution is a fine balance. There's a quote there by Knuth I believe that says "Premature optimizations is the root of all evil" For me, I try to base it on: how much it will be used, how expensive that will be across my expected user base, how critical/central it is to everything, how often I may be coming back to the code to extend it into other areas The more that these types of ideas lie in the "probably or one way or another I will", I pay more attention to it. If it needs to be readable and a small performance hit results, it's the better way to go for sustainability of the code. Otherwise, I let items fight for my attention while I solve and build things of real(er) value. The single biggest favour we can do ourselves is use a framework with any project, no matter how small and do the small things right from the beginning. That way there is no sense of dread in going back to work on a system that was originally meant to be a temporary hack but never got re-factored.
