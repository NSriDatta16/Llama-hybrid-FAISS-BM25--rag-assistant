The reconstruction probability is $f(x|\vec \mu, \vec \sigma$ ) where $f(\cdot | \vec \mu, \vec\sigma)$ is the density of a normal distribution with mean $\vec \mu$ and diagonal covariance $\vec \sigma$ . $\vec \mu$ and $\vec \sigma$ are indeed the outputs of the encoder part of the VAE. Please refer to an implementation here . The reconstruction probability is calculated using the " reconstructed_probability" function.
