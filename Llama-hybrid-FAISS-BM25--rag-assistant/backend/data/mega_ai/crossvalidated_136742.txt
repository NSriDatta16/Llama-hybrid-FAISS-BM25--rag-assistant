Intuitive interpretation of Bayes risk $R(\delta, \lambda) = \int_{\Omega}R(\theta, \delta) \lambda(\theta) d\theta$

Consider the risk function R of an estimator (statistic) $\delta(X)$ trying to estimate parameter $\theta$: $$R(\theta, \delta) = E_{X \sim P_{\theta}}[Loss(\theta,\delta(X)]$$ Which can be interpreted as the average loss our estimator has weighted by relative frequency of the data X. Then consider Bayes risk: $$R(\delta, \lambda) = \int_{\Omega}R(\theta, \delta) \lambda(\theta) d\theta$$ where $\lambda(\theta)$ is a weighting function on each possible value the parameter could take. How would one interpret $R(\delta, \lambda)$? The thing that is kind of confusing me is that because we are integrating with respect to both X and $\theta$, it was harder for me to interpret what it means. The interpretation I was thinking was something like this: The "real" (average) loss of $\delta$. Why real? Well, because we are using $\lambda(\theta)$ to put a higher weights on which parameters we care more about. We want to have an estimator that is good in general but we care more about some $\theta$'s, depending on $\lambda$.
