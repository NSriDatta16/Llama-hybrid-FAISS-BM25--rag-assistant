MS Project VBA getting or setting Title of custom task field Text1..Text30

I try to change the title of the task fields Text1 to Text30 in Microsoft Project 2007 using VBA. Here is what I do manually: In Gant Chart Task Table click on table header and add a column. In the popup I can select which task property to add, in my case “Text1” and I can enter a title, for example “my text1”. But I don’t care about the table. I want to give the title to the text field. I want to export Text1 to Text30 to an XML file and like to export the title of the field as well, so I need to get the title and I like to set it, because even if it isn’t used in a table it shallbe exported. Here is what I wrote just for testing: Private Sub setfieldtitletryout() Dim i As Integer Dim c As Long For i = 1 To 30 c = FieldNameToFieldConstant("Text" & i, pjTask) Debug.Print "Text" & i; " has constant " & c Debug.Print " Name of Text" & i; " is " & FieldConstantToFieldName(c) ' well what a surprise... SetFieldTitle(c, ListOfNames(i)) ' Oviously doesn't work, because the function doesn't exist :-( Debug.Print " Title of Text" & i; " is " & FieldConstantToFieldTitle(c) ' unfortunately doen't exist too Next End Sub Here is what I checked but did not ready help me… http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb221504(office.12).aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb221254(office.12).aspx I’d be glad to get this fixed! Thanks in advance for helping out! Cheers B
