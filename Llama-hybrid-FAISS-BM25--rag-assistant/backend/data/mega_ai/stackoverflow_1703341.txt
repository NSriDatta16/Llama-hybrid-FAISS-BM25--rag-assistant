Every browser has a "flow". The flow sort of emulates a word processor in that elements flow from left to right, top to bottom. Elements that do not fit at the end of a "line", wrap to the next "line", so to speak. Block elements take up the full line. Inline elements only take up as much space as they need, so other elements can sit next to them on the same line. Unless there is a width declared, that doesn't happen with block elements. Floating an element takes the elements out of the normal flow and shifts it to the left/right. The space that the object occupied before it was floated is empty, and collapses. If I float two elements that take up more space than the line can hold, one may fall to the next "line". @Jitendra - displaying two spans inline will put them together in the flow, yes. Floating two elements that do not take up the space of the full line will appear to do the same thing. They definitely have different uses, though. If I wanted to have text flow around an image in a paragraph, I would float the image not use display:inline . If I wanted to create a horizontal menu from list item elements, I would use display:inline , not float .
