Rotatable image or div with javascript?

I'm working on a web application that need to allow the user to drag and drop as well as rotate an image. Drag and drop is solved with the jQuery UI Draggable. But how am I suppose to rotate an image on the page? My images are mostly one colored rectangles. I used div s to draw them on the page but how to rotate them? It is okay if they only rotate 22, 5-45-67, 5-90 degrees So I think of 3 solutions Using Canvas Problem: IE support Using div s Problem: it also needs canvas to rotate PHP GD This solution is the only hope that left. How it might work: The application will prerender (22,5*x) rotated versions of original image. So they will be ready whenever user wants to rotate an image. Please help. Any suggestions appreciated
