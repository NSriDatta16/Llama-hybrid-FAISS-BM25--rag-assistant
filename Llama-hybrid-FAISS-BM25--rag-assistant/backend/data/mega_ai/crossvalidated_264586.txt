My answer to a related question points out that the harmonic mean of a set of positive data $x_i$ is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimate (with weights $1/x_i$). You can therefore compute its standard error using WLS methods. This has some advantages, including simplicity, generality, and interpretability as well as being automatically produced by any statistical software that allows weights in its regression calculation. The principal disadvantage is that the calculation does not produce good confidence intervals for highly skewed underlying distributions. That's likely to be a problem with any general-purpose method: the harmonic mean is sensitive to the presence of even a single tiny value in the dataset. To illustrate, here are empirical distributions of $20$ independently generated samples of size $n=12$ from a Gamma(5) distribution (which is modestly skewed). The blue lines show the true harmonic mean (equal to $4$) while the red dashed lines show the weighted least squares estimates. The vertical gray bands around the blue lines are approximate two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the harmonic mean. In this case, in all $20$ samples the CI covers the true harmonic mean. Repetitions of this simulation (with random seeds) suggest the coverage is close to the intended 95% rate, even for these small datasets. Here is the R code for the simulation and figures. k
