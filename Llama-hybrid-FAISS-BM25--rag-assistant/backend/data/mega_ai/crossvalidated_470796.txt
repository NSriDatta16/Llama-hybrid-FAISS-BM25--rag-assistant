Add input features for transfer learning? (Not for CNN)

I've trained a robot to walk forward using the TD3 algorithm, where the input features are the robot's joint states, roll pitch & yaw, accelerations, and position. Now I want to use this trained model to get it to stop on a target, which involves adding the input features x and y as coordinates for where to stop. How should I approach adding features to the model without having to train it from scratch? (Nearly every resource I found was targeted for CNNs, which have a pooling layer which makes it easy to use the same model for different image sizes, so that won't apply here.)
