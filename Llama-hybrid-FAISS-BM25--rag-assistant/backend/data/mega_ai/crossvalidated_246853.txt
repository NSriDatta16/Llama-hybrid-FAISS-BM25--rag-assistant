Time Series and XGBoost

I have time series data for two and half year. I am performing xgb.cv (from Jan 2014 to March 2016) and its giving very good result, but when I am using new data (April 2016 to June 2016) to predict, the accuracy is getting worse. I am using R xgboost package. Any suggestion on improving accuracy?
