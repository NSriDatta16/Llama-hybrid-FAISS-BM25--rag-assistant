How to determine the weights of features when calculating the weighted average?

I have a dataset of Tweets along with their Retweet Counts and Favorite Counts. After extracting features from the Tweets, I am training a model to predict the Retweet Counts and Favorite Counts. I want to calculate a value called "Popularity" by taking the weighted average of Retweet Count and Favorite Count for each Tweet. For this, I need score values (or weights) for Retweet Count and Favorite Count. How do I determine these weights? I am writing a research paper and need to justify why I assigned those weights for Retweet Count and Favorite Count.
