Im looking for good neurons silmilarity metric

Recently I managed to create simple neural network visualization, to help to understand how neural network works on the signal level. I also wanted to arrange neurons by similarity cause I was expecting them to have noticeable areas of responsibility. see how it looks: http://nn.3dev.io in order to see the distribution I've created two metrics: Euclidean : calculates the distance in output weights space (10 dimensions) and repels neurons according to that distance, as well as attracts neurons which are close in that 10d space output dominance : that attracts neurons having maximum weight at the particular output. The problem is that I don't see any trend (or tendency) in neuron distribution which may be caused by : there is no such trend or noticeable areas of neuron responsibility (at least in this case) I have improper metric Guys, what do you think about it? Thanks, Regards
