ARIMA(0, 1, 1) process cant be stationary?

According to "Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control" (Box, Jenkins), for any process represented by a linear filter $$ z_t = a_t + \psi_1 a_{t-1} + \psi_2 a_{t-2} ... = a_t + \sum_{J=1}^\infty \psi_j a_{t-j} $$ be a valid stationary process, it is necessary for the coefficients $\psi_j$ to be absolutely summable: $\sum_{J=1}^\infty |\psi_j| . For an ARIMA(0, 1, 1) process, $$ (1-B)Y_t = (1-\theta_1 B)a_t\\ Y_t = \frac{(1-\theta_1B)}{(1-B)}a_t = [1 + (1-\theta_1)B + (1-\theta_1)B^2 + (1-\theta_1)B^3 ...] \cdot a_t. $$ Thus $\psi_j = (1-\theta_1)$ for all $j$ . Since, I think, $\sum_{j=1} ^\infty |\psi_j|= \infty$ , doesn't this mean that an ARIMA(0, 1, 1) process can't be stationary?
