As far as I can see (forgive me if i'm wrong), $p$ and $q$ are independent proportions, so you're after a confidence interval for the difference between two independent proportions. A comparison of various methods for constructing such intervals was conducted by Robert Newcombe: Newcombe RG. Interval estimation for the difference between independent proportions: comparison of eleven methods. Statistics in Medicine 1998; 17(8):873-890. He found the simplest method with good performance was one involving combining Wilson score intervals for the two proportions ('Method 10' in the above paper). Newcombe wrote an Excel spreadsheet which implements his recommended formulae for this and other CIs of several estimates involving proportions, available at http://medicine.cf.ac.uk/primary-care-public-health/resources/ .
