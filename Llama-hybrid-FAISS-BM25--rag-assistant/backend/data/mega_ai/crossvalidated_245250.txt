Survival Analysis with multiple time series and intervention events

I have data in a longitudinal format that I would like to analyze. A sample of My data looks like this in R: ID Location Type DateTime Test Result 8 4 6 2016-10-01 04:14:19 4 8.2000 8 4 6 2016-10-01 04:14:19 11 32.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-01 15:54:25 4 7.6000 8 4 6 2016-10-01 15:54:25 11 31.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-02 04:03:04 4 7.9000 8 4 6 2016-10-02 04:03:04 11 33.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-02 15:59:00 4 7.6000 8 4 6 2016-10-02 15:59:00 11 30.0000 .... 8 4 6 2016-10-17 10:23:21 12 3000.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-17 10:28:38 4 7.6000 8 4 6 2016-10-17 10:28:38 11 32.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-17 11:13:45 6 31.8000 8 4 6 2016-10-17 14:26:23 6 31.9000 8 4 6 2016-10-18 04:32:34 4 7.8000 .... 8 4 6 2016-10-20 15:50:26 9 240.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-20 15:50:26 11 40.0000 8 4 6 2016-10-21 04:34:27 4 7.4000 .... Tests 4 and 11 are recorded almost daily. These are purely observational. Tests 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 are also purely observational, but not conducted on a regular basis. Only when something is suspected to be wrong based on the results of test 4 and 11. The tests that cause an intervention in the system are tests 7, 9, and 12. A failure is considered when the result of test 9 is greater than or equal to 240. I am interested in knowing two questions. Does the intervention tests extend the life of the series? At a given point in time how much longer can I expect my series to last? I think survival analysis would be able to answer these questions, but I do not have much experience in this branch of modeling. Am I on the correct path here or is a different approach required? If survival analysis is the right path the hurdle I am running into is the structure of my data. Every example I've seen uses aggregation of the time stamped data into a structure like this: seriesID startTime EndTime death test1Indicator test2Indicator My problem is that not only is the presence of a test in a series important, but so is the value of that test. I have not found an example of survival analysis with continuous multivariate event data. I appreciate any and all thoughts and thanks for reading my lengthy post.
