Hi: When the quote calculates the the value of three, it's calculating the average lag. So, the first value ( $y_t$ ) has a lag of 1, the second 2, the third 3, the fourth 4 and the fifth 5. So, the sum of those is m(m+1)/2. Then you divide by m to get the average lag and get (m+1)/2. Brown ( below ) has a nice explanation of this sort of thing in his text. I recommend it for this topic. https://www.amazon.com/Smoothing-Forecasting-Prediction-Discrete-1963-05-03/dp/B01FGN92SG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=brown+forecasting%2C+prediction&qid=1607080240&sr=8-1
