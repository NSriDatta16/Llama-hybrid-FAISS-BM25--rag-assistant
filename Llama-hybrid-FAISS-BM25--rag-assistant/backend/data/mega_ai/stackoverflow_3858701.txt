Wordpress sidebar column pushed down following the main column

I have Wordpress blog, and the problem I am having is that the sidebar of the blog is being pushed down after the main column for the content of each post. The theme is Papercut and the PHP for each post is singe.php http://www.mirabaz.com/wordpress/articles/cnn-ireport-features-sanaa-music-festival/ This is the home page http://www.mirabaz.com . As you can see the sidebar has to on right side of the page. If i remove the code the shoes the content of the post, then it the sidebar comes back to the original position. But the content is blank. Please advise.
