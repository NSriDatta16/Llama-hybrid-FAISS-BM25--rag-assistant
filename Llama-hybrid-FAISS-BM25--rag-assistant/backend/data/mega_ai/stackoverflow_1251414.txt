can we place a picture in a picture box in differrent place?

i am using vb.net i just wanna ask if we can place a picture in a picture box in different places... for example, we place a picture in the center of a picture box then we place another picture on the left side of the picture box. is it possible?? and also can we use one picture box that can contain more pictures or images on it??? to make it clear, it is a drag and drop senario, first you have to drag a picture from a toolbar for example, then you are to drop it on the picutre box, the problem is, we have to drop more than one picture in the picturebox, so is it really possible?
