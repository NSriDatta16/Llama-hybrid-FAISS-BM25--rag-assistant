XML layout editor

I'm new to android programming, but one thing that I can't seem to get down is writing the XML files. I use a program called droiddraw to help generate the xml code. This program is very simple because it lets me add buttons and DRAG them where I want them. Once I get the screen/form (or whatever it's called) setup the say I like, it will generate the the xml file for me. My question is this: "Does eclipse have a plugin that will do that too?" I know that I can view the form/screen that I can designing, and add buttons and such, but I can't drag them to where I want them. I always have to edit the layout values manually.
