editing/viewing a Microsoft Outlook NK2 name cache file

I am trying to find some code which shows how one might open an Outlook NK2 names cache file. I did some searching and I have seen several people say that it's not possible, but then I find links to some freeware that can do just this so I know its possible. I would use the freeware applications, but would rather do it in my own code, and it easier to get an approval from management if I use my own code within my organization rather then a freeware/shareware application. I'm trying to write the code in VB, but I would like to find a example in any language if it helps.
