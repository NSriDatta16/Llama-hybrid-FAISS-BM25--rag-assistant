Train a classifier on cluster analysis results

I am using HDBSCAN clustering in Python, to cluster my data. Next I want to use those thus labeled data to train a classifier (e.g., random forest) on these. The ultimate objective is to assign the label to a new unseen data. My doubt is, if it would be normal to obtain 100% train and/or test accuracy on the model?
