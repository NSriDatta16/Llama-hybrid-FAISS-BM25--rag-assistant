using apache's mod_rewrite to parse SEO friendly URL's

How do I convert something like me.com/profile/24443/quincy-jones to me.com/profile.php?id=24443 or something like me.com/store/24111/robert-adams to me.com/store.php?id=24111 with mod_rewrite? Can I make the reverse conversion as well with mod_rewrite, or would I have to parse it through PHP?
