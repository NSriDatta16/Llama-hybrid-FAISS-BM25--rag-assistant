How to compute the probability of a multi-class prediction using libsvm?

I'm using libsvm and the documentation leads me to believe that there's a way to output the believed probability of an output classification's accuracy. Is this so? And if so, can anyone provide a clear example of how to do it in code? Currently, I'm using the Java libraries in the following manner SvmModel model = Svm.svm_train(problem, parameters); SvmNode x[] = getAnArrayOfSvmNodesForProblem(); double predictedValue = Svm.svm_predict(model, x);
