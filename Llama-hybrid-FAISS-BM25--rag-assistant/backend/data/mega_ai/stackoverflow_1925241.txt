In addition to the MVC pattern that Gordon mentioned, to make sure you aren't loading any extra classes that you don't need to use you can setup a simple class autoloader. The autoloader can work a number of ways, but in the MVC app I'm currently working on, the class name is also the name of the file, and it dictates where the file is located also. __autoload is a magic method that PHP calls if you attempt to access a class that is currently not included. Then it performs whatever action is specified in the function then attempts the same call to that class again. Implementing an autoloader cut the average memory footprint of an instance of my MVC app by about 75%... check out the documentation here: https://www.php.net/autoload
