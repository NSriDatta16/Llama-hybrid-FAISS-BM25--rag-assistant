Remove attributes with missing values exceeding a given threshold in WEKA

I imported csv file into WEKA, i have features that have missing value that has missing value percentage of 70% or above, i want to remove these features by weka or also sort that features by missing value percentage desc and then remove some features manually. How can i do that? i'm new to machine learning and WEKA.
