var listsToRefresh = new List { ddlRemoveUsersFromRole, ddlAddUsersToRole, ddlAddAllUsersToRole, ddlRemoveAllUsersFromRole, ddlDeleteAllUsersFromRole }; listsToRefresh.ForEach(l=>l.ClearSelection()); There are many ways to do this, I would prefer this one. If all you are doing is performing ClearSelection() on each one, then there is no need to create a method for that one line of code. However, if you want to do some more work on each DropDownlist, then I think the use of an extension method would keep it elegant. public static class DropDownListExtensions { public static void Reset(this DropDownList dropDownList) { dropDownList.ClearSelection(); //... do more stuff } } listsToRefresh.ForEach(l=>l.Reset());
