UCI Machine Learning Data Set: Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound Recordings Data Set

I would like to use the data set Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound Recordings Data Set from UCI to test pattern recognition algorithms. However when I plot the features and labels, it seems the features and the label are totally irrelevant. For example, I use K-L Transform, generating a 2D data, but this still does not work well. Are these data from different classes separable?
