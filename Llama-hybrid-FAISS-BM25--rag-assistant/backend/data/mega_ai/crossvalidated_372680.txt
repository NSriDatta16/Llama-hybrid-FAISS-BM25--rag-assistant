Finding the feature map corresponding to a specific Kernel? (Polynomial Kernels)

I am just getting into machine learning and I am kind of confused about how to show the corresponding feature map for a kernel. For example, how would I show the following feature map for this kernel? $K(x,y) = (x \cdot y)^3 + x \cdot y$ Any help would be appreciated. Where x and y are in 2d x = (x1,x2) y = (y1,y2) Thank you.
