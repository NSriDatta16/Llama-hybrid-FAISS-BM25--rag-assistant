Multidimensional scaling (MDS) seems like a good fit for this problem. Given a pairwise distance matrix that measures the dissimilarity between each pair of data points, MDS embeds the data into a vector space such that Euclidean distances in the embedding space match the input distances. By embedding into a two- or three-dimensional space, you can visualize a low dimensional representation of the data. It's important to choose an appropriate distance measure because this determines the structure that the low dimensional embedding tries to preserve. In your case, distances would indicate how dissimilar two molecules are in terms of their angles. Since you're trying to visualize an existing clustering, it would make sense to use the same distance measure that you used to produce the clustering. Different variants of MDS arise from different ways of measuring how well embedding distances match input distances. For example, metric MDS attempts to directly preserve input distances, whereas nonmetric MDS attempts to produce an embedding where distances are monotonically (but perhaps nonlinearly) related to input distances. There are multiple variants of each. If runtime is an issue with >10k data points, have a look at this question for some computational tricks.
