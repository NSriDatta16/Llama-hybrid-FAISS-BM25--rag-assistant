To estimate the associations between variables in a study containing repeated measurements (in this case shifts within the same driver), you should use methods which account for dependent data. The generalized estimating equation model (GEE) is a powerful tool for program evaluation and epidemiology because it estimates a population averaged effect. Packages which fit GEEs in R are gee and geese . Load the library and call the help file for information on fitting the models library(gee) , and ?gee .
