It depends on the hyper-parameters of the random forest, such as the number of trees, the depth of the trees, the number of features per tree. So, for example, if you have 4 data features and each tree uses 3 features to be fitted, then you would have 4 choose 3 different sets of features. If you use all data instances to fit the trees, you would have a maximum of 4 unique trees. So, having more trees would indeed over-fit the random forest as the excess trees would be repeats of the unique ones that have already been fitted. Indeed as it is a popularity vote and averaging amongst trees in the forest, so to prevent over-fitting it would be highly dependent on the data that you have along with the hyper-parameters.
