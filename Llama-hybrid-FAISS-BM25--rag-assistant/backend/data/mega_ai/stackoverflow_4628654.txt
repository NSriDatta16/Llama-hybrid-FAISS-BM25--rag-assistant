NSTask launches a single command that takes a set of arguments as an array of strings. NSTask does not do any of the shell parsing magic, nor can you pass the string to sh as an argument and have it parse it in that fashion. There is probably a way to do so, but there is a better solution. Simply run the ioreg command via NSTask , grab the output via the standard means, then do a simple enumeration of the returned string to find the line(s) you want. While a few more lines of code, it'll be considerably less fragile (and less of a security hole if you ever supply arguments of some kind) than trying to pump it through the shell. And it is easy to do. See this document for more information.
