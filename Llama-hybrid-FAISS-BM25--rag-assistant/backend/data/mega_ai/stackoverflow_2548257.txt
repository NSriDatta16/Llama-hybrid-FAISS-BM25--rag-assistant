Since you downloaded the source from trunk, you will also have to build all of OpenCV before you can use it or the Python wrappers. Have you compiled it? If not, check the directions on http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide under the "Building OpenCV from source using CMake" heading. There is also a section at the bottom specifc to MinGW.
