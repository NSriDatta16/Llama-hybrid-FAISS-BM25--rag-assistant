What algorithm to use to classify image-like data by spatial relations?

Let's assume I have dataset of image-like 2D samples where values can be divided into few discrete levels (for example 1, 2, 3 and 4) like in the image below, where each color maps different value, from 1 to 4. Number of how many times given color occurs on the picture varies from sample to sample though. I would like to classify these images into different classes but based on the spatial relations of these values between each other (not the values themselves). By spatial relations I mean basically (left, right, up, down), for example: If blue is above and to the right of the red Another blue is above and to the left of the same red Yellow is to the right of one blue (same height) One green is below red ... My question is, what machine learning or deep learning algorithm I should use for that task? I would appreciate even just some keywords or clues of what might help here. [EDIT] These data are not proper real images. Just more-less 50x50 arrays with one integer value per cell (range of these values is limited to just few, like 1, 2, 3, 4).
