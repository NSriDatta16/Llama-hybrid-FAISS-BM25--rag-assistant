Lisp and Prolog for Artificial Intelligence?

Now since i've taken a class 3 years ago in A.I. im clearly proficient enough to ask this question......just kidding just kidding ;) but seriously, what is it about these languages that make them so popular for A.I. research. Even though A.I. research is "old"...it's came probably the longest way in the past 5-10 years it seems like.... Is it because the languages were somewhat "designed" around the concept of A.I. , or just that we have nothing really better to use right now? I ask this because I've always found it quite interesting, and Im just kinda curious. If im entirely wrong and they use different languages I would love to know what all they use. I mean i can understand prolog, especially with Sentient/Propositional Logic and Fuzzy logic. but I dont understand "Why" we would use Lisp...and even what else A.I. researchers would use to do machine learning etc. Any articles/books on the subject matter is helpful too :)
