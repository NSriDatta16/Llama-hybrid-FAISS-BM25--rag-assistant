I think I now have the missing piece of the puzzle. Jeremy D. Miller was kind enough to post his code for the ITransactionProcessor. http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2010/01/06/how-dovetail-uses-structuremap-with-nhibernate.aspx This will use the new StructureMap nested containers to scope my session to all my components in a single transaction. When I get this working, I'll post the code to my blog and an update to this thread. http://blog.coreycoogan.com
