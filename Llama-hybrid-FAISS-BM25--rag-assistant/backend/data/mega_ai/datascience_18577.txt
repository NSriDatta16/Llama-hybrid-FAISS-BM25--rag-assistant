Methods to analyze time series data when only small amount of it is labeled

I have time series data out of which only 10% is labeled into 10 classes. What should be the methods or models that I should look for to analyze this problem? I know the question is a bit vague but I am not looking for exact answers. I would appreciate any pointers or resources on how to approach these types of problems.
