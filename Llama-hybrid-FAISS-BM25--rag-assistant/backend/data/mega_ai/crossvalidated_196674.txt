They deal with estimating different parameters but indeed share common features: Nickell ( Econometrica 1981 ) bias : The time demeaning operation of fixed effects in a dynamic panel data model $$ y_{it}=\alpha_i+\beta y_{it-1}+\epsilon_{it} $$ leads to a transformed regression model $$ y_{it}-y_{i\cdot}=\beta (y_{it-1}-y_{i\cdot-1})+(\epsilon_{it}-\epsilon_{i\cdot}) $$ where dots indicate time averages. Here, error terms $(\epsilon_{it}-\epsilon_{i\cdot})$ and regressors $(y_{it-1}-y_{i\cdot-1})$ are correlated even as $N\to\infty$, where $N$ is the number of units in the panel. This can be shown formally, but essentially follows from the observation that $y_{i\cdot}$ contains future $y_{it}$ which are generated by past $y_{it}$ which, in turn, are generated by past $\epsilon_{it}$ which are contained in $\epsilon_{i\cdot})$ Hence, even as $N\to\infty$, the FE estimator will not consistently estimate $\beta$. Incidental parameter problem : The classical Neyman and Scott ( Econometrica 1948 ) case is an an example that MLEs need not be consistent. Consider a random sample of size $N\equiv nr$, $$X_{11},\ldots,X_{1r},X_{21},\ldots,X_{2r},\ldots,X_{nr},$$ where we have $n$ subsamples of size $r$, $X_{\alpha 1},\ldots,X_{\alpha r}$, $\alpha=1,\ldots,n$ which are distributed as $N(\theta_\alpha,\sigma^2)$. Hence, each subsample has a different mean $\theta_\alpha$, but a common variance $\sigma^2$. It can be shown that the MLE for $\sigma^2$ is given by $$ \hat{\sigma}^2=\frac{1}{rn}\sum_{\alpha=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^r(X_{\alpha j}-X_{\alpha \cdot})^2 $$ One may show that $$\hat{\sigma}^2\to_pE(S_\alpha^2)=\frac{r-1}{r}\sigma^2\neq\sigma^2$$ Hence, the MLE is not consistent as $n\to\infty$. So they are related through the fact that both FE and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ inconsistent estimators, that however both are consistent as the "other" dimension also goes to infinity - $r$ in the incidental parameter problem and $T$, the number of time series observations per panel unit in the Nickell bias case. Nickell shows the inconsistency to be approximately equal to $$ -\frac{1+\beta}{T-1} $$ for $T$ "reasonably" large.
