You probably should use ArrayList instead of Vector for reasons explained in other answers. However ... I tried using Vector, but that shifts all elements over by when when you do an insert, and I need an array that can grow but the elements stay in place. When you do an insertElementAt(pos, elem) , you have specifically asked for the element shifting. If you don't want the elements to be shifted, you should use set(pos, elem) instead. Or if you want to add the element at the end of the vector, you can also use add(elem) . Incidentally, the previous paragraph applies to all implementations of List , not just Vector , though the implementation details and performance vary across the different kinds of List .
