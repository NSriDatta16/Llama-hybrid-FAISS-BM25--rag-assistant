For the counts a few models might be compared. I assume that parishes are numbered from 1 to 8000 across all the counties. 1 Random county and parish effects. model1 2 Random year effects added. Maybe first only across counties, next also across parishes. model2 3 Random pastoral effect across counties. Only possible if pastoral changes over the years, given a county. model3 These models assume that for a given parish/year observation, e.g. 80 longterm and 120 shortterm, all 200 workers have the same probability to be longterm. The models might improve by adding a random parish/year effect. E.g. for model1 you add: + (1|parish:year) The exp() function of the fixed effects of pastoral and year are oddsratio's as usual for a logistic regression.
