.NET 4.0 uses a new location of the GAC. It isn't c:\windows\assembly anymore, the GACed files are now stored in c:\windows\microsoft.net\assembly. The shell extension handler isn't available for this directory, at least on my machine, so you won't have the drag-and-drop capability in Windows Explorer anymore. Be sure to use the .NET 4.0 version of gacutil.exe so the proper directory is used. Use the Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010) shortcut in the Start menu. Note that installing assemblies into the GAC is a very unusual thing to do on a dev or test machine. The GAC is a deployment detail.
