Transparently Handling GZip Encoded content with WWW::Mechanize

I am using WWW::Mechanize and currently handling HTTP responses with the ' Content-Encoding: gzip ' header in my code by first checking the response headers and then using IO::Uncompress::Gunzip to get the uncompressed content. However I would like to do this transparently so that WWW::Mechanize methods like form(), links() etc work on and parse the uncompressed content. Since WWW::Mechanize is a sub-class of LWP::UserAgent, I would prefer to use the LWP::UA::handlers to do this. While I have been partly successful (I can print the uncompressed content for example), I am unable to do this transparently in a way that I can call $mech->forms(); In summary: How do I "replace" the content inside the $mech object so that from that point onwards, all WWW::Mechanize methods work as if the Content-Encoding never happened? I would appreciate your attention and help. Thanks
