Problems setting up git with github

I've googled the heck out of this one, and it is still failing me. ssh: Could not resolve hostname github: Name or service not known fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly Most of the problems with this seem to do with having the wrong keys being sent to the server, which isn't the problem. I can SSH into github as stated in github's help pages. I did have this working fine before, but I had wiped out the repository, wiped out my keys, and started fresh. Here is the output of ssh -v git@github.com : OpenSSH_5.5p1 Debian-4ubuntu5, OpenSSL 0.9.8o 01 Jun 2010 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to github.com [207.97.227.239] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /home/patrick/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: Checking blacklist file /usr/share/ssh/blacklist.RSA-2048 debug1: Checking blacklist file /etc/ssh/blacklist.RSA-2048 debug1: identity file /home/patrick/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/patrick/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/patrick/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.1p1 Debian-5github2 debug1: match: OpenSSH_5.1p1 Debian-5github2 pat OpenSSH* debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.5p1 Debian-4ubuntu5 debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received debug1: kex: server->client aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none debug1: kex: client->server aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST(1024 debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_INIT sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REPLY debug1: Host 'github.com' is known and matches the RSA host key. debug1: Found key in /home/patrick/.ssh/known_hosts:1 debug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correct debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received debug1: Roaming not allowed by server debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering public key: /home/patrick/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Remote: Forced command: gerve blueshift9 debug1: Remote: Port forwarding disabled. debug1: Remote: X11 forwarding disabled. debug1: Remote: Agent forwarding disabled. debug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled. debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 279 debug1: Remote: Forced command: gerve blueshift9 debug1: Remote: Port forwarding disabled. debug1: Remote: X11 forwarding disabled. debug1: Remote: Agent forwarding disabled. debug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled. debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey). debug1: channel 0: new [client-session] debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com debug1: Entering interactive session. debug1: Sending environment. debug1: Sending env LANG = en_US.utf8 PTY allocation request failed on channel 0 debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype exit-status reply 0 debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype eow@openssh.com reply 0 Hi!
