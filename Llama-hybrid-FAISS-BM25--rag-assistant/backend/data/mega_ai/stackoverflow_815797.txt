Add dependency property to control

I am using the Infragistics XamDateTimeEditor control and I want to add a dependency property to it to allow the developer to choose to have all the text selected when the control gets focus. I have created a style that is used to set the behavior I want but I want the developer to decide if the behavior should be executed based on a boolean dependency property. I am not sure how that is done.
