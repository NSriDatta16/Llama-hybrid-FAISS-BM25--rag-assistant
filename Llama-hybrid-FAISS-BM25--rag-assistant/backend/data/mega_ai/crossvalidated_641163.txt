I don't think the model is coded the way you think it is. > contr.sum(factor(0:1)) [,1] 0 1 1 -1 > contr.treatment(factor(0:1)) 1 0 0 1 1 The number labelled Flow1 in your output estimates $$0.5\times(\text{mean when flow==0}-\text{mean when flow==1})$$ averaged over Pesticide and Drug . That is, they have the opposite sign to the treatment contrasts that would give you flow=1 minus flow=0 . The coefficient of -209 means that flow=0 is lower on average by about 418 than flow=1. If you ran a model with no interactions and ran it with both contr.sum and contr.treatment , the coefficients would differ by a factor of -1/2. It's really worth starting off with a main effects model so that you can see this sort of thing in a setting that's easier to understand
