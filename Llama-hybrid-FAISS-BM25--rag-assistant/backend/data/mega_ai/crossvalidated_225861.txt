Bayesians and Frequentists do not only differ in how they obtain inferences, or how similar or different these inferences can be uncertain certain prior choices. The main difference is how they interpret probability: Bayesian probability : Bayesian probability is one interpretation of the concept of probability. In contrast to interpreting probability as frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, Bayesian probability is a quantity that is assigned to represent a state of knowledge, or a state of belief. Frequentist probability : Frequentist probability or frequentism is a standard interpretation of probability; it defines an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency in a large number of trials. This interpretation supports the statistical needs of experimental scientists and pollsters; probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion). It does not support all needs; gamblers typically require estimates of the odds without experiments. These two definitions represent two irreconcilable approaches to defining the concept of probability (at least so far). So, there are more fundamental differences between these two areas than whether you can obtain similar estimators or same conclusions in some parametric or nonparametric models.
