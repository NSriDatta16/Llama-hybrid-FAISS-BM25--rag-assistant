Relation between dyi/dei and its leverage (hii)

Althought I have tried in different ways, I have not been able to show that $$\frac{\mathrm{d}Y_i}{\mathrm{d}e_i} = \frac{1}{1 - l_{ii}}$$ $e_i$ is equal to $l_{ii}$ is the $i-th$ element of the diagonal of the "Hat matrix" H . Also, I was able to show that . I think it could help but I don't really know how. Pd: I'm sorry for the format, and I will try to improve it.
