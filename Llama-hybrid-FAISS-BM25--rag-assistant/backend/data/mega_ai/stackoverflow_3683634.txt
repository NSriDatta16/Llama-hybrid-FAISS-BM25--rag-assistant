if youve got that many menu items that you cant fit it concisely into the topnav, i'd consider reorganising your content. Go and find a user thats never seen the system and get them to try and find "x", then ask them a week later were it was. try breaking it down in to three levels instead of two. Take a look at some large online shops, like amazon or ebuyer. they have abstract subjects at the top, then as you drill down you get more and more subnavs.
