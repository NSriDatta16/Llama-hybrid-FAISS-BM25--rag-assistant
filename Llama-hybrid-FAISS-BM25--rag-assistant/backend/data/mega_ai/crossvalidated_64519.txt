Comparing samples across time periods

I have about 80,000 observations that I collect each day, which include a numeric variable called amount (it's a bid). I often stuff with determining whether a decrease or increase in the amount, be it by hour, day, or week, is meaningful enough that it warrants further analysis. So let's say I have a week's worth of data and I notice that Thursday had a lower average bid amount than the other days of that week. I want to use a 'test' to determine if the values from Thursday are 'significantly' different from the rest of the week. My initial thought was to use a one-sample t-test as it allows me to assess difference between a sample mean (Thurs's mean bid amount) and the population mean (weekly bid amount) to verify if the null hypothesis is correct. However, I'm a little confused how to proceed given that I'm dealing with time series data. How then can I go about comparing bid amounts from different time slots or days to determine whether there is a significant increase or decrease in the bid amount? PS: Question tagged as 'R' because I'll be using R, although the question itself isn't R specific.
