Do you have data with rankings? If yes, you can build a linear regression model that predicts the score/rank given the 4 features. The feature weights will be learned from the training set. A positive weight will suggest that the feature adds positively to the rank (e.g bandwidth); a negative weight will suggest that increasing feature value will decrease the rank (e.g. delay). You can use LIBSVM to fit a linear regression model or any other package for this task.
