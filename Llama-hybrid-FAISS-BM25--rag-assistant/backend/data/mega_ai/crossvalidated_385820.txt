Multi variable clustering cartographical data

Firstly , my knowledge in statistics is very limited , so excuse me if I'm ask a none well placed question. I have a country ,( example : USA ) , and i have 3 set of data 1) position (lat , lng ) of every food storage (S) . 2) every storage have a variable C with , the C is the capacity . 3) a group of position (lat , lng) to specifing boards of every state I need to cluster this data based on distance , capacity , and the border of any cluster need to be as similar to state boards Ex : we need to create 3 k The output will be : 33% of the capacities of all storages house in the first cluster , the second 33% , etc ... But that not mean the cluster will take 33% of the map , because that will gives an inequality between clusters . Note , the border alignment for states is used to to the same effect of a map matching . What clustering algorithm i need to use ? And any idea of how i can create a visual image for this clustering ? Thanks
