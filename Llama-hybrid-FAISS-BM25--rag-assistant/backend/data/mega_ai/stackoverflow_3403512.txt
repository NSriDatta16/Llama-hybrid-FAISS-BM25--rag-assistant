Regex match take a very long time to execute

I wrote a regular expression that parses a file path into different group (DRIVE, DIR, FILE, EXTENSION). ^((? [a-zA-Z]):\\)*((? [a-zA-Z0-9_]+(([a-zA-Z0-9_\s_\-\.]*[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)|([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)))\\)*(? ([a-zA-Z0-9_]+(([a-zA-Z0-9_\s_\-\.]*[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)|([a-zA-Z0-9_]+))\.(? [a-zA-Z0-9]{1,6})$)) I made a test in C#. When the path I want to test is correct. The result is very quick and this is what I wanted to expect. string path = @"C:\Documents and Settings\jhr\My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\FileEncryptor\Dds.FileEncryptor\Dds.FileEncryptor.csproj"; => OK But when I try to test with a path that I know that will not match, like this : string path = @"C:\Documents and Settings\jhr\My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\FileEncryptor\Dds.FileEncryptor\Dds.FileEncryptor?!??????"; => BUG The test freezes when I call this part of code Match match = s_fileRegex.Match(path); When i look into my Process Explorer, I see the process QTAgent32.exe hanging at 100% of my processor. What does it mean ?
