Try this: $p_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim} Be(\alpha,\beta)$ and $p(\alpha,\beta)\propto (\alpha+\beta)^{-5/2}$. I believe the issue you are running into is that $ss\sim Ga(\gamma,\gamma)$ with $\gamma\to 0$ results in the improper $p(ss)\propto 1/ss$ prior. This prior, together with your uniform prior on mu, results in an improper posterior. Despite the fact that you are using a proper prior, it is close enough to this improper prior to cause issues. You might want to take a look at page 110 of Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed) for a discussion of priors for this model as well as the prior suggested above.
