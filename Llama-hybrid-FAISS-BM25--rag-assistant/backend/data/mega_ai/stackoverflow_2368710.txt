Have you considered SimPy ? SimPy is a rather generic Discrete Event Simulation package, but could feasibly meet your needs. Better yet the Molecular Modelling ToolKit (MMTK) seems more specialized... I have used neither, but this sounds like fun. Python, as a language, seems to be in privileged position for use in simulation software, whereby people can script the specific details of their model while relying on the framework for all the common logic, such as scheduling, visualization, monitoring etc. The unknown is how well such toolkits scale when fed with agent counts commensurate with biology models (BTW, how "big" is that?)
