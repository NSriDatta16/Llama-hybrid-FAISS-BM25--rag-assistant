The model you describe is discussed by Gelman in section 6 here , where the group variances $\sigma_k$ have a half-Cauchy prior multiplied by a scale factor $A$. I'm only seeing this independent variance model in the context of Hierarchical regression models. If you look at chapter 5 of Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis he alludes to the possibility of including independent variance components in a hierarchical model (reflected in his notation), but sets it aside and says it will be considered later. He finally discusses it in the context of Hierarchical Linear models in chapter 15. He notes that the same hiearchical model studied in ch. 5 can be represented as a Hierarchical linear regression problem. The model in (15.2) tries to predict the proportion of Democratic voters in a presidential election given some past data at the state level. He adds an additional level to the model to capture regional patterns in the voting data which partitions states (groups) into regional clusters--southern and non-southern. The within region variance is modeled as an independent draw from a uniform distribution. The incorporation of independent variance parameters is at a higher level than the model you described, but it might help direct your search for more applicable examples.
