Pluses and minuses of using Factories in a Rails test suite?

I'm currently looking at a hefty Rails test suite. It's nothing I can get into specifics about, but the run time for the entire suite (unit/functional/some integration) can run upward of 5 minutes. We're completely reliant on fixtures and are we're not mocking and stubbing as much as we should be. Our next few sprints are going to be completely focused on the test suite, both improving coverage, writing better tests and most importantly writing more efficient tests. So aside from more mocking and stubbing within our tests, we're considering replacing our fixtures with most likely Factory Girl. I see a lot of happy folks doing similar situations but haven't been able to find a good resource on any minuses of moving to a factory. I have seen some slower benchmarks when using benchmarks from various resources but cannot find a definitive this why factories are good and this is why you might not want to use them. Can anyone educate me on why or why I shouldn't be using factories? Thanks!
