Given that Ruby is explicitly calling your attention to UTF-8, I strongly suspect that you haven't actually written out a UTF-8 file to start with. Make sure that Vim (or whatever text editor you're using to create the file) is really set to write out UTF-8. Note that in UTF-8, any non-ASCII character will be represented by multiple bytes, not a single byte as you've described from the Vim diagnostics. I'd recommend using a binary file editor (or dump, or whatever) to really show what's in the text file though. Something that doesn't already have some preconceived notion of the encoding - something that isn't even trying to think of it as a text file. Notepad lets you write out a file in UTF-8, so you might want to try that just to see what happens. (I don't have Ruby installed myself, otherwise I'd try it for you.)
