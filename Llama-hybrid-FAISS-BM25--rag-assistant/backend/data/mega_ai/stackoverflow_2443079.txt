c/c++ how to convert short to char

I am using ms c++. I am using struct like struct header { unsigned port : 16; unsigned destport : 16; unsigned not_used : 7; unsigned packet_length : 9; }; struct header HR; here this value of header i need to put in separate char array. i did memcpy(&REQUEST[0], &HR, sizeof(HR)); but value of packet_length is not appearing properly. like if i am assigning HR.packet_length = 31; i am getting -128(at fifth byte) and 15(at sixth byte). if you can help me with this or if their is more elegant way to do this. thanks
