In a Beta-Binomial 'Bayesian' A/B test, is it possible to add a third, fourth, etc. recipe?

For context: How to define prior for beta-binomial A/B test For P(A > B), you can draw samples from A's posterior and B's posterior and then count the number of times the sample from A is greater than the sample from B. If choice C entered the picture, I don't intuitively see why: mean(A_samp > B_samp & A_samp > C_samp) wouldn't work, but I suspect that's a bit too simplistic. I'm not sure how to extend this to the n >= 3 case.
