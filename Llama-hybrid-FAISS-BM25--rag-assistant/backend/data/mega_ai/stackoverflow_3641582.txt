.htaccess: How to "Specify a cache validator"?

I'm running Google PageSpeed on my site and it's tell me that I need to "Specify a cache validator." The following resources are missing a cache validator. Resources that do not specify a cache validator cannot be refreshed efficiently. Specify a Last-Modified or ETag header to enable cache validation for the following resources: ... then it lists images, CSS, JS, etc. According to http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html#LeverageBrowserCaching : Set the Last-Modified date to the last time the resource was changed. If the Last-Modified date is sufficiently far enough in the past, chances are the browser won't refetch it. I have the following in my .htaccess: Header set Last-Modified "Tue, 31 Aug 2010 00:00:00 GMT" What am I doing wrong?
