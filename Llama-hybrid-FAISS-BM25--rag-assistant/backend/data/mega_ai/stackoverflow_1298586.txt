How do I separate my entities from database model?

I need some help to organize my data model well. I am writing an app which will be a simple notebook. I use a three-tier architecture = business-logic, data-logic, database access. I`d like to use system of tags so it will be easier to search info in the app. Here are few questions - due to separation of concerns, classes of entities and classes supporting tag search through these entities must be different. so, what is the best way to do it - encapsulation or inheritance? - is it a good idea to separate entity classes from classes which retrieves and gives information to the database? If yes, it will be 4 levels - entity classes, database classes, tag-search helpers and BL classes.
