What is probabilistic inference?

I am reading Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning textbook. I came across the term probabilistic inference several times. I have a couple of questions. Is probabilistic inference only applicable in a graphical modelling context? What's the distinction between traditional statistical inference (p-values, confidence intervals, Bayes factors etc.) and probabilistic inference? Is this a term that's specific to the CS community or is it widely used in the statistics community as well?
