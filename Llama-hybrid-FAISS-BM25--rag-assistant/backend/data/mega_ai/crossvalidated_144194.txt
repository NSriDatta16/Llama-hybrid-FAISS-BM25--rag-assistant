What you want sounds akin to a precision-recall (PR) curve. PR curves show precision (TP / (TP + FP)) as a function of recall (TP / (TP + FN)). Every PR point corresponds to a threshold $T$ on the SVM's output $d$ (signed distance to the hyperplane), that is positive if $d \geq T$ and negative otherwise. As such, you could create a figure depicting precision as a function of decision threshold. The general shape of this figure will be similar to a PR curve, except that it will be stretched horizontally (because not every unique decision value corresponds to a unique recall, the PR curve is more dense horizontally). It must be noted that, perhaps contrary to intuition, precision is not necessarily highest for the largest decision values ($d$).
