Code obfuscation became popular around the time perl was first released. It was really an artifact of making the code more efficient. In those early days of yore there was a flame war of sorts between the established "c" programming community and the "renegade" perl advocates. The old-school c guys obviously trumped the perl guys by siting performance. The perlers (?) in response began coming up with performance hacks without regard to readability. Hence,obfuscation. This of course is no longer necessary since the perlers (?) conceded performance a long time ago the the c'ers (nice piun huh?). Obfuscation was NEVER used for security purposes that I've seen. In fact if you would suggest it as some kind of security measure people would laugh you out of the room. The hackers trying to circumvent security are in general very knowledgeable of the languages and toolsets they are targeting. Thats what makes them so successful. Obfuscation is not in any way a defense against them.
