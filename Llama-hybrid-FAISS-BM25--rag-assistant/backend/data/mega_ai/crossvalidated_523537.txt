There are two primary methods used to get adjusted odds ratios. If the variables one wants to adjust for purely categorical one may be able to cross-classify on them to compute stratified odds ratios, and do some sort of averaging on the log odds ratio scale. Second, and more common because of its flexibility in handling continuous variables and more variables in general, is logistic regression. Assuming no interactions between the exposure and the adjustment variables, the regression coefficient for exposure is the adjust log odds ratio, and one anti-logs that to estimate the adjusted odds ratio.
