This all seems sensible to me. I would explain the surprising result of a significant (at $\alpha = 0.05$ ) $p$ -value by noting that your plot shows the whole population. It's not unreasonable that average effect of going from left to right leg (0.02 * 2 = 0.04 in whatever units your response has), while small, is still significant across the population since your data set is reasonably large. Squinting at the picture, I can convince myself that more of the lines are decreasing from left to right than increasing (since you are using sum-to-zero contrasts, a parameter estimate of 0.02 means the response for left legs is 0.02 units higher than the population mean on average). Also note that these effects, while significant, are small relative to the standard deviations at all levels (ranging from 0.08 to 0.36), consistent with the noisy-looking picture. To help convince yourself, try drawing boxplots of (left-right) for each subject, subdivided by age, and including the boxplot notches that indicate approximate 95% CIs for the median. Computing (left-right) will eliminate the variation in the intercept; showing the notches will contrast the inference on the average difference between groups (analogous to a standard error of the mean) with the overall variation shown by the boxes ( $\approx$ IQR, analogous to the standard deviation).
