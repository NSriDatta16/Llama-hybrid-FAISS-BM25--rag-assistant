The biplot() function following a PCA using prcomp() is minimal in functionality. As we all (should) know, ggplot() offers maximal functionality. So the trick is to get the arrows from a PCA using prcomp() into a format for plotting in ggplot() . Or at least I would see this as a solution to the initial question of this thread. This is relatively straightforward. Note that my post is partially inspired by this post from Benjamin Bell. Also, the iris data are not necessarily ideal for this, but should provide enough for the user to see the potential here.
