Methods for storing searchable data in C#

In a desktop application, I need to store a 'database' of patient names with simple information, which can later be searched through. I'd expect on average around 1,000 patients total. Each patient will have to be linked to test results as well, although these can/will be stored seperately from the patients themselves. Is a database the best solution for this, or overkill? In general, we'll only be searching based on a patient's first/last name, or ID numbers. All data will be stored with the application, and not shared outside of it. Any suggestions on the best method for keeping all such data organized? The method for storing the separate test data is what seems to stump me when not using databases, while keeping it linked to the patient. Off the top of my head, given a List , I can imagine several LINQ commands to make searching a breeze, although with a list of 1,000 - 10,000 patients, I'm unsure if there's any performance concerns.
