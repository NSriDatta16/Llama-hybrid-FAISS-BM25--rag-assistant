Bayesian analysis is iterative --- to get a "prior" for a new analysis based on older data you use the "posterior" from that older data based on an even more remote "prior-prior". So, if you want to form a prior based on past data, you can do this by first formulating an even more remote prior (belief prior to seeing this past data) and then use the resulting posterior as the prior for your new analysis. For example, you might start with a uniform prior-prior and then update this to obtain the posterior from the data you have listed (you haven't told us the sample sizes so I can't do this part for you) and then you will use that posterior as the prior for your new analysis formed with that older data.
