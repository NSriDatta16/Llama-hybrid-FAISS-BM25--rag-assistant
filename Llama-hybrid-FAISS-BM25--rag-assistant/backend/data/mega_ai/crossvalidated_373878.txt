There are various ways of optimizing combination weights, but using the inverse of out-of-sample forecast errors is an intuitive way to go about it. (You are using out-of-sample error, not in-sample ones, right?) One question is of course how you calculate MAPEs for intermittent data without dividing by zero. I assume you do some kind of aggregation. Just try it! You know your data better than we do. If your series behave very similarly, then pooling them makes sense. Without knowing your data, there is little we here can say. LSTMs typically need lots more data than a demand forecaster has available. One year of daily data is very little for an LSTM to shine. Or other neural network architectures, for that matter. Then again, in a combination approach, adding ML methods to the mix should usually not break anything, so if you can implement a simple ML method with low effort (e.g., by just running nnetar() from the forecast package in R), then go for it. The fact that combinations with constant equal weights often outperform combinations with "optimally set" weights has been called the "forecast combination puzzle". One explanation is that "optimally estimating" weights adds variance to the entire procedure, which may outweigh the lower bias in the bias-variance tradeoff ( Claeskens et al., 2016, IJF ). I'd recommend you test your weighting scheme against a very simple scheme with equal weights. It may indeed turn out that the simple scheme performs better. Since you mention the mape above, which kind of raises a red flag to me, you may be interested in Why use a certain measure of forecast error (e.g. MAD) as opposed to another (e.g. MSE)? and What are the shortcomings of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)? In terms of literature, I recommend the excellent free online book Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman , though this is not focused on intermittent demand forecasting. I know that John Boylan and Aris Syntetos are writing a textbook on intermittent demand forecasting, but this does not seem to have been published yet. If you are explicitly interested in model combination, then combination across frequencies might be enlightening ( Petropoulos & Kourentzes, 2015, EJOR ). You could also look through previous questions in the intermittent-time-series tag.
