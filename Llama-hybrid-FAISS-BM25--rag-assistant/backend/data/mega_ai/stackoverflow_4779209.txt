do { // etc. } while(menuChoice != 1 && menuChoice != 2 && menuChoice != 3 ); Each of the clauses of a conjunction must be an expression that evaluates to a bool . Note that != 2 is not an expression that evaluates to a bool . In fact, it's not even a legal expression. This is why you must specify menuChoice != 2 . Also, note that you should use && because the clauses. You want menuChoice to equal 1, or to equal 2, or to equal 3. Therefore you want !(menuChoice == 1 || menuChoice == 2 || menuChoice == 3) as the condition in the while loop. By DeMorgan's Laws, this is equivalent to menuChoice != 1 && menuChoice != 2 && menuChoice != 3
