So I realized this was asked years ago, but as there still isn't an answer, I'll try and explain the structure and the logic of AR-1 at bit of a higher level, and explain why the effect of time (defined here tt) is inherently a random effect. I'm not very familiar with the calculations of glmmTMB The AR-1 accounts for auto-correlation which means, for a variable that is repeatedly measured over time, the values of the individual time points are correlated with the other values of that same variable, and observations closer in time are more correlated than observations farther in time. Further, the variance $\sigma^2$ is assumed to be homogenous within a time-series, and that the time measurements are evenly spaced. An example could be a measure of blood cell counts taken from a patient at the same time every morning for a span of days. Lets assume we have 4 time points, or $t = 4$ . The AR-1 correlation is a square matrix and is written: $$ \mathbb{R} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho & \rho^2 & \rho^3 \\ \rho & 1 & \rho & \rho^2\\ \rho^2 & \rho & 1 & \rho \\ \rho^3 & \rho^2 & \rho & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$ where $\rho$ is the correlation between time points. The correlation between time points exponentially declines as the distance between two time points $i-j$ increases. $\rho$ is also limited to $-1 . Because we have the assumption that $\sigma^2$ is homogenous within a time series, the covariance is then: $$ \sigma^2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho & \rho^2 & \rho^3 \\ \rho & 1 & \rho & \rho^2\\ \rho^2 & \rho & 1 & \rho \\ \rho^3 & \rho^2 & \rho & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 & \sigma^2\rho & \sigma^2\rho^2 & \sigma^2\rho^3 \\ \sigma^2\rho & \sigma^2 & \sigma^2\rho & \sigma^2\rho^2\\ \sigma^2\rho^2 & \sigma^2\rho & \sigma^2 & \sigma^2\rho \\ \sigma^2\rho^3 & \sigma^2\rho^2 & \sigma^2\rho & \sigma^2 \end{bmatrix} $$ So, in the example of the blood cell counts, within an individual person the change in variance over time is an inherently random process.
