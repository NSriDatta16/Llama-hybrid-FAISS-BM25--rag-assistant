Error Reporting Using The Global.aspx PAge

I have always had issues with identifying the errors in applications from the error reports I get. Currently I build an email with information about the error containing. User Url Error Message Time And Date This is the code I use Sub Application_Error(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Dim _UserIpAddress as string = Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_ADDR") Dim _Browser as string = Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_USER_AGENT") Dim _URL as string = Request.Url.AbsoluteUri Dim _ErrorDate as string = System.DateTime.Now Dim _Error as string = Server.GetLastError().InnerException.ToString() End Sub The issue is that with this information in some cases I cant work out what has caused the error. How would I get some more detail on the error? e.g what control caused it, the data in the variables being passed in the system Also what methods of collecting the data other than email have you used and how successful have they been. e.g. logging in a database, recoding in a text file etc.
