Rails3 and Easily caching views and controllers

I am currently caching my web application. So I was driving to use memcache and i was looking for an easy way to handle all that. For exemple, i would like to cache all my contents until they are not modified. And I can't cache all the page because some parts need to be cached apart. So I could use a fragment_cache for the controller, and then an other into the views, and then in the model after an update delete the fragment. But it feel heavy and I don't like this way. If you have any ideas, i would be glad to hear them. Thanks ;)
