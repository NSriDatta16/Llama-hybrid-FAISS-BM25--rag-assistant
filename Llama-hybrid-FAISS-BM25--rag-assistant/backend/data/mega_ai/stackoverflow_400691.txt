C# Create OU in Active Directory

I'm struggling to create an OU for Active Directory using the code below. strPath = "OU=TestOU,DC=Internal,DC=Com" DirectoryEntry objOU; objOU = ADentry.Children.Add(strPath, "OrganizationalUnit"); objOU.CommitChanges(); The problem is strPath contains the full path 'OU=TestOU,DC=Internal,DC=net' so using .Children.Add is making the ldap path 'OU=TestOU,DC=Internal,DC=net,DC=Internal,DC=net' which results in an error as the domain obviously doesn't exist. My question is can I create an OU using strPath without .Children.Add ? I'm not familiar with AD and this is something I inherited from the guy before me.
