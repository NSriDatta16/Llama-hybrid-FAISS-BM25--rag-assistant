Binary linear SVM in terms of structured SVM

On slide 32/85 of this tutorial on structured SVM learning , the author formulates binary SVM classification in terms of structured output SVM by defining $\Psi(x, y) = \frac{y}{2}x$. Why is there a constant factor of $1/2$ in the feature map and inference? I can't see it making any difference to the result.
