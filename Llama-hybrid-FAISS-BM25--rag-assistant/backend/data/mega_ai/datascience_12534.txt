Library to calculate Distance Metrics on GPU

Suggestions of widely used and fast GPU libraries that calculate the Euclidean distance of a vector from a matrix of vectors (of the same dimension) ? Preferably one that works on NVIDIA GPUs. Need it as a part of comparing solutions that evaluate Radial Basis Function Neural Networks.
