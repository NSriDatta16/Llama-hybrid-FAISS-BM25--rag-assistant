Is there a way to select the variables that contribute the most to the neural network when there are a lot of variables to choose from?

Is there a way to find the 'information gain' from each variable that we input into a neural network. I have 47 variables for creating a classification model. When I use them all, the model becomes horribly overfit. I am not sure how to go forward. Is selecting the right concoction of variables mostly intuition, plus trial and error? Or are there any tools for this purpose? Any input is appreciated.
