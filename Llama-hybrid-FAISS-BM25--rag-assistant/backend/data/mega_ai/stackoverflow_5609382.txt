Export sqlite results to a file

I came across a few questions/answers on SO that deal with exporting a database/table to a txt file. Almost, every solution makes use of Java I/O. I was wondering if anyone has had any success with native sqlite commands. Following is my code and it isn't working. I would really appreciate if anyone has any ideas to get this working. String OutputFile=Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/"+output + ".txt"; databaseHelper.getDatabase().beginTransaction(); databaseHelper.getDatabase().execSQL(".mode list"); databaseHelper.getDatabase().execSQL(".separator |"); databaseHelper.getDatabase().execSQL(".output " + OutputFile); databaseHelper.getDatabase().execSQL("select * from "+ TABLE_NAME); databaseHelper.getDatabase().execSQL(".exit"); databaseHelper.getDatabase().endTransaction();
