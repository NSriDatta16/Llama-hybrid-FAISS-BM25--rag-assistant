The bootstrap is a Monte Carlo technique, in that it involves some type of random sampling. If you run the bootstrap twice on the same set of data, you'll get different answers. The more samples you use in your bootstrap, the less variation you'll get. The coverage refers to the variation of the results on different data sets from the same hypothetical sampling distribution.
