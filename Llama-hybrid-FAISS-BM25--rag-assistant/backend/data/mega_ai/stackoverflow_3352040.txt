To hide the border, use If you don't want to have a selection, use an ItemsControl instead of the ListBox . The following code hides the border around the ListBox and does always show a white background on the item (if its generated through the ItemsSource -property). If you use ListViewItem-instances, you must change the background there. UPDATE In the meantime I have found a solution that is IMO much more elegant: This should work also with ListBoxItem-instances and is IMO less "work-around".
