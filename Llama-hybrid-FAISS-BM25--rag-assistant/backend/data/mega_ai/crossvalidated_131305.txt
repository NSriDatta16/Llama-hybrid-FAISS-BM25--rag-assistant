Many financial instruments are often modeled as being stochastic partial differential equations or difference equations if modeled in discrete time. It is not so different as in time series analysis where series are modeled as some sort of low order process having trends, seasonal components and irregular noise superimposed in the same process. In more classical setting volatility is an parameter, not an variable to be modeled but this has changed too. It might not be theoretically justifiable to incorporate deterministic parameters and their sample estimates in used model, but of course in reality many might do that. For example in Black & Scholes valuation formula has fixed parameters and users often supplant sample estimates into the formulae. Users generally can fall into the trap of model risk if they believe too much that their formulas incorporate all relevant aspects of reality.
