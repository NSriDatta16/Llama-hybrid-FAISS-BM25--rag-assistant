It could be an issue with temporary files as you've suggested in your comment to Frank Heikens's answer. http://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html says: 2.6 Transient Indices SQLite may make use of transient indices to implement SQL language features such as: * An ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause * The DISTINCT keyword in an aggregate query * Compound SELECT statements joined by UNION, EXCEPT, or INTERSECT Each transient index is stored in its own temporary file. If and where files are created is controlled by SQLITE_TEMP_STORE , PRAGMA temp_store and PRAGMA temp_store_directory , see http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html
