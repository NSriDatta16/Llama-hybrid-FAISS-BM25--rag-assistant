How can I store objects between bookmarklet calls?

I wrote some bookmarklets to automate some tasks on a webpage. I'd like to be able to store a value somehow, so that when I run a bookmarklet the second time, it will see that it exists, and try to use it. I'd like to be able to do that using pure javascript. Kind of like greasemonkey's storage.
