random selection of feature-subset is used at each node in Random Forest RF which improves variance by reducing correlation between trees(ie: it uses both features and row data randomly) While Bagging improves variance by averaging/majority selection of outcome from multiple fully grown trees on variants of training set. It uses Bootstrap with replacement to generate multiple training sets.(only Row data is used here)
