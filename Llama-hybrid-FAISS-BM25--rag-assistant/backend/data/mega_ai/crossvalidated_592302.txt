I have doubts the median is the quantity that might be of interest in this case. But more importantly seems to be that calculation of the confidence interval for the true median assumes that that true median isn't going to move in the future. This assumption seems to be too bold, since the storage cost tends to decrease over time, leading to higher and higher storage consumption. Therefore this calculated true median's range is expected to become false pretty soon.
