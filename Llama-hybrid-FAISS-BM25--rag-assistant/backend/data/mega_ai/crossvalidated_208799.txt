We make an assumption that all objects are realizations of random variables, which are independent and identically distributed from some distribution. Very often we have one more assumption that this distribution is from exact parametric family of distributions. In this case training data is used to evaluate its parameters. No, in general case the Bayes decision boundary shouldn't be linear. If you want linear decision boundary, look for linear classifiers such as SVM, logistic regression and the Naive Bayes classifier.
