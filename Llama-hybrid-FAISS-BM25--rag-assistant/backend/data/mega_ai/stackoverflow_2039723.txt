In my opinion it is highly unwise to be using a struct in this way. Yes, you can get what you want in this case with a compiler specific pragma. I would consider that an acceptable solution if you were writing a Windows device driver or something else that was already very specific to a particular platform. But this is loading a file in a standard format. It's code that could run in any environment. Personally, I would write code that lifted the data out of a character array and plopped it into the structure by hand instead of relying on the structure to be layed out in just the right way by the compiler such that fread will magically put all the little bits of data in the right places.
