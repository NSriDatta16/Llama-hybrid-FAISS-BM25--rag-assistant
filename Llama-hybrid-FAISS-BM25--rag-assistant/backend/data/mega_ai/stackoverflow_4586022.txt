Is there a bug with using InnerHTML inside a UIWebView within a native iPhone application?

I have a fairly large HTML/JS/CSS application that works great when running as a web application with Safari on the iPhone. When running this same application in an UIWebView within a native iPhone application calls within jQuery to create HTML fragments fail silently (ie: $(" HELLO WORLD "); will not create the element. I've tracked this down to the following equivalent code snippet in clean jQuery method: var div = document.createElement(“div”); div.innerHTML = “ HELLO WORLD ” ; When I look at div.outerHTML I see / div.innerHTML returns an empty string. This does not appear to be a jQuery problem, nor does this happen 100% of the time. I haven’t been able to find a pattern, but in some cases it works 2-3 times in a row, sometimes if fails 5-6 times consecutively. This seems to only shows up when running the application inside a UIWebView in an Objective-C application. Also I’ve only seen this on an actual device running iOS 4.2, not the emulator. Has anyone run into anything similar? Does anyone have a fix?
