The first one will write some data (str) to computer memory, and then exit. The OS will then ensure all that memory is zeroed before any other program can see it. (This is an important security measure, as the first program may have been processing your bank statement or may have had your password). You need to write to persistent storage - probably disk. (Or you could use a ramdisk, but that's unlikely to make any difference to real-world performance). Alternatively, why do you have 2 programs? Why not one program that does both tasks?
