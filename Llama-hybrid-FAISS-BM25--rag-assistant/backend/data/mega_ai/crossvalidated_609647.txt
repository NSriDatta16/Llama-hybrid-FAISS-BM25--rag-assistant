A simple "rule of thumb" can be derived from the conjugate normal model As you correcly point out, the simplest way to examine this is to consider an archetypal model form like the normal model to derive an appropriate "rule of thumb". To this end, let's consider the Bayesian normal model using the conjugate prior for the mean parameter $\mu$ and with a fixed precision parameter $\lambda$ . ( Precision is the inverse of the variance if you haven't seen this before.) This model can be written formally as: $$\begin{align} X_1,...,X_N | \mu, \lambda &\sim \text{IID N} \Big( \mu, \frac{1}{\lambda} \Big), \\[10pt] \mu | \lambda &\sim \text{N} \Big( \mu_0, \frac{1}{\tau_0} \Big). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ Under this model the posterior distribution for $\mu$ (conditional on $\lambda$ ) is: $$p(\mu|\mathbf{x}, \lambda) = \text{N} \Big( \mu_n, \frac{1}{\tau_n} \Big),$$ with posterior mean and precision given respectively by: $$\mu_n = \frac{\tau_0 \mu_0 + n \lambda \bar{y}_n}{\tau_0 + n \lambda} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \tau_n = \tau_0 + n \lambda.$$ Now, since our interest is in the prior-to-posterior change in variance, we are only interested in the latter equation for the precision parameter. As you can see from that equation, there is a simple rule for updating the precision: the posterior precision of the mean parameter is the prior precision plus $n$ lots of the sampling precision. (You can easily get the corresponding rule for the prior-to-posterior variance, but it is not as simple.) This means that ---within the normal model--- the posterior precision is always higher than the prior precision and so the corresponding posterior variance is always lower than the prior variance. This gives you a "rule of thumb" that holds exactly in the normal model but would only be an approximation (at best) in other models. It is not always the case that the posterior variance is lower than the prior variance, so be careful with how widely you consider this "rule" to apply. It will tend to apply reasonably well in cases where the sampling distribution and prior distribution are both unimodal and close to the normal distribution.
