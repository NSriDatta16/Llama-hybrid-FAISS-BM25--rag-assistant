Simple JPG/HTML Not Showing Up in iPhone

I'm not familiar with iPhones wants and needs, nor do I have one, but a client wants a screen cap of his site to show up when an iPhone user comes around so I created an .htaccess redirect to an iPhone specific page with this bit of code... RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} iPhone RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/iPhone/ RewriteRule .* /iPhone/ [R] And the html of the iPhone page... Eatamadedia The page redirects just fine, but the .jpg doesn't show up. I can't imagine a simpler page. Anyone know what could be preventing the image from displaying? Does the iPhone require headers? The site in question is http://eatamedida.com Thank you in advance for your input. -J
