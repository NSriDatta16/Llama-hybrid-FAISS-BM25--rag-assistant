probability of getting to state a before state b starting from state a

If $X_n$ is a Markov Chain. P(0,0) = 0.5, P(0,1) = 0.5. For all states x > 0, P(x, x) = 0.5, P(x, x+1) = P(x, x-1) = 0.25. My goal is to find $P_0$ ( $T_0$ $T_5$ ), which is the probability of starting at state 0, getting to state 0 before state 5. I know there is a formula for $P_x$ ( $T_0$ $T_5$ ) when 0
