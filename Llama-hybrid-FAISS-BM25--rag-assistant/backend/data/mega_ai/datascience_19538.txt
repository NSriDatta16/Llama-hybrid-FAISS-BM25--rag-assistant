ICD-10 codes in Machine Learning

Can anyone provide specific techniques with using ICD-10 codes in Machine Learning? I have usually used a simply approach of creating multiple binary column representing ICD-10 codesâ€¦ which can get extremely long. Or I have used Hashing features. Are there other techniques or ways to use ICD-10 codes in ML? Anyone can provide a useful link to see various approaching to modeling such features?
