relationship between ARMA and AR

I once heard some statements regarding the relationship between ARMA and AR process, such as An average of severl lags of an autoregression forms an ARMA process or A weighted mixture of lags of an AR(P) model is ARMA I am not very clear about these two statements, whether they are right? If they are right, how to get them? Thanks.
