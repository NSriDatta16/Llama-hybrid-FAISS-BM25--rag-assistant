While I haven't seen anything specifically, I doubt that it would achieve much, at least for linear regression. Each regression equation is just a linear combination of the predictors: $$\hat{y}^{(j)} = \sum_i \hat{\beta}_i^{(j)} x_i$$ Most boosting algorithms in turn combine multiple predictors by taking a weighted average, which is another linear combination: $$\hat{y} = \sum_j \hat{w}^{(j)} \hat{y}^{(j)}$$ So the final output is still a linear combination of the predictors, only with the coefficients obtained by a complicated process.
