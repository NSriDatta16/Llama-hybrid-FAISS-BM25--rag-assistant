AS3 MOUSE_LEAVE problem

I am coding a drag and drop application where I can grab an object and then place it over different object containers. When I am dragging the object (keeping the mouse button pressed) and I leave the stage, I can still control the object with the mouse...this is not what I want. I would like to lose control of the object when the mouse leaves the stage. I tried to remove the event listener for MOUSE_DOWN on a MOUSE_LEAVE event but nothing. I also tried to dispatch a MOUSE_UP event on a MOUSE_LEAVE event but it does not work either...it works only if I manually release the mouse button. Is there any way to override the MOUSE_DOWN event when the user moves the mouse away from the screen but he is still pressing the mouse button??? Any suggestion??? Thanks in advance
