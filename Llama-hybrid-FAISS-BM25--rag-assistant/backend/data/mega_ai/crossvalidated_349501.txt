Why these the results in factorial 2k experiment analysis with R are different of the Minitab?

I'm studying DoE $2^{k-p}$ and I'm attempting to replicate an experiment using R software from a article that was run in Minitab, but the results are different. Regression model presented in the article: My results (code to set up is below): summary(lm(plan.atualizado1)) # ... # Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) # (Intercept) 67.16781 0.08914 753.497 How did they build this equation regression? If this equation is made using the regression beta coefficients of the T statistic, the values found are different. Article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389409017166 Images of the article results: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAFfa.png The pareto, half-normal, main effects and interaction effects graph I'm getting to reproduce normally. I am testing only for the removal of SMO oil. Here's my code to set up the data, fit the model, and if(!require("FrF2")) install.packages("FrF2") ; library(FrF2) plan.person = FrF2(nfactors = 5, resolution = 5, replications = 2, randomize = FALSE, factor.names = list(pH = c(3, 9), Temp = c(5, 30), Dose = c(0.05, 0.5), Conc = c(50, 350), Velo = c(100, 200))) Oleo1 Note that the T statistics have the same results except the standard error coefficient.
