Using 'starts with' selector on individual class names

If I have the following: I can use the following selector to find the first two DIVs: $("div[class^='apple-']") However, if I have this: It will only find the second DIV, since the first div's class is returned as a string (I think) and doesn't actually start with 'apple-' but rather 'some-' One way around that is to not use starts with, but instead contains: $("div[class*='apple-']") The problem with that is it will also select the 3rd DIV in my example. Question: Via jQuery, what is the proper way to use predicate selectors on individual class names, rather than the entire class attribute as a string? Is it just a matter of grabbing the CLASS, then splitting it into an array and then looping through each individual one with regex? Or is there a more elegant/less verbose solution?
