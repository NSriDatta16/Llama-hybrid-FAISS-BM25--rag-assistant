Coordinating Asynchronous Requests in Javascript

I want to get two resources using two asynch calls. I want to proceed only when both resources have been retrieved. How can I do this elegantly in JS? This would work: getStuff1(function (result1) { getStuff2 (function (result2) { // do stuff with result1 and result2 .... } } but stuff2 only starts after stuff1 completes. I'd prefer to start stuff2 while waiting on stuff1.
