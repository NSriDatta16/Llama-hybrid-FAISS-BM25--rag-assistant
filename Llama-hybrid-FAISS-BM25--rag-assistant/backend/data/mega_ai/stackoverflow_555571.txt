Getting a list of all modules in the current package

Here's what I want to do: I want to build a test suite that's organized into packages like tests.ui, tests.text, tests.fileio, etc. In each __ init __ .py in these packages, I want to make a test suite consisting of all the tests in all the modules in that package. Of course, getting all the tests can be done with unittest.TestLoader, but it seems that I have to add each module individually. So supposing that test.ui has editor _ window _ test.py and preview _ window _ test.py, I want the __ init __ .py to import these two files and get a list of the two module objects. The idea is that I want to automate making the test suites so that I can't forget to include something in the test suite. What's the best way to do this? It seems like it would be an easy thing to do, but I'm not finding anything. I'm using Python 2.5 btw.
