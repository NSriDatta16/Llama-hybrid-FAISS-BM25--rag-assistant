Arbitrary functions Synthetic Control Time series

I am aware that in synthetic control you create the synthetic control time series by effectively creating a weighted average of the matched/donor controls (plus extra covariates). My question is, is it wrong to have an arbitrary function like a gradient boosted model for estimating the test time series in the preintervention period?
