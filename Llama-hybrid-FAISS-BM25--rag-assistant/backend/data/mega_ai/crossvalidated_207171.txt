What advices do you have for a starter in multiple image recognition?

So, I have experience in machine learning for NLP and a little in neural networks for NLP, but never so far done anything in computer vision in this area so bear with me if what I am asking is a little naive. I have many images of playing cards. These images can have one or several cards in the same image. What I want to do is train a CNN (maybe another algorithm?) to recognise the images but I have no clue where to start. I mean, if I have one card, the CNN should give me the card's name (or an id or whatever), and if I have several cards in the image, the CNN should give me the list of names of all the cards in the image. To train such a model, what should I have as a dataset? Images of one card only with its name? Images of multiple cards with all the names of those cards? A mix of both? Thank you for your help!
