Prediction problem in randomForest in R

I'm trying to use the randomForest algorithm in R. When I apply the algorithm to my database, I got the following result: library(randomForest) x = data[,1:8] y = data[,9] model Call: randomForest(formula = y ~ ., data = x) Type of random forest: classification Number of trees: 500 No. of variables tried at each split: 2 OOB estimate of error rate: 23.7% Confusion matrix: 0 1 class.error 0 430 70 0.1400000 1 112 156 0.4179104 The answer is according to the prediction: pred y pred 0 1 0 430 112 1 70 156 [1] 0.2369792 Here, above, we have the same error rate. However, when I try a new prediction with the explicit initial x values, the result is different: pred2 y pred2 0 1 0 500 0 1 0 268 [1] 0 I've already tried the same procedure with the glm function, and in both cases, the result were the same. What is the difference between the two predictions above?
