Why is covariate balance fundamental for causal inference in observational data but unnecessary in experimental data?

The observational case For observational data, Hern√°n & Robins (2023, p. 49) state: In the absence of marginal randomization, [computing the average causal effect in the entire population] requires adjustment for the variables $L$ that ensure conditional exchangeability of the treated and untreated Adjustment can then be achieved via regression adjustment in an outcome model, standardization, stratification/restriction, matching or IP weighting. When using matching or weighting, for example, packages offer a multitude of methods and diagnostics to evaluate the degree of balance achieved. If our generated pseudo-population is greatly imbalanced, we will consider our estimate most surely biased and, thus, invalid. The experimental case In the context of randomized clinical trials, Senn states explicitly in myth number 2 of the article "Seven myths of randomisation in clinical trials" (p. 1441): There is no requirement for baseline balance for valid inference. Likewise, in his guest blog post " Randomisation is not about balance, nor about homogeneity but about randomness ", he unambiguously states: Randomisation does not produce balance This does not affect the validity of the analysis , as well as, Balance is a matter of precision not validity The question How does the process by which data is created alters the role of balance, from one of ensuring validity into one of ensuring precision?
