Try adding the same css to test.html file. If you are actually using an iframe or embedding a page into another then the CSS will not cascade into the embedded page. It is rendered as its own document. Update: It looks like you might need to add a class to the first cell in the row to make it get styled. The test.html does not have any elements in it that are styled by the second section of CSS since it does not match any element. Header 1 Header 2 Record 2 Desc 2
