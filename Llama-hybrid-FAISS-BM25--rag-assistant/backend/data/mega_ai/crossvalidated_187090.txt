How to conduct Support Vector Mache using R(e1071)

Could anyone help me to interpret these results from R? How can I find nBSV,nSv, obj and iteration numbers? How can I use nBSV and nSv, obj to determine which kernel is the best? > library(e1071) > data(cats, package="MASS") > inputData svmfit print(svmfit) Call: svm(formula = response ~ ., data = inputData, cross = 10, kernel = "linear", cost = 10, scale = FALSE) Parameters: SVM-Type: C-classification SVM-Kernel: linear cost: 10 gamma: 0.5 Number of Support Vectors: 79 > plot(svmfit, inputData)
