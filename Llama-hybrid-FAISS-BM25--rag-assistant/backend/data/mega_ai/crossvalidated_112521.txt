I believe your interpretation is correct. (Though without knowing the context the author intended for the graphic, I suppose anything is possible.) Likewise, your point about adding subscripts to $p$ seems right: if the model assumes different parameters drawn from some distribution, then those values would generally appear with subscripts. I'm not sure this is a strict convention, but it's used in practice, and arguably clearer. See for example formula (3) in the latent Dirichlet allocation paper , p. 996. A specific example might help illustrate the difference. See p. 3 of this tutorial based on a chapter from Doing Bayesian Data Analysis . In short, it imagines a group of coins produced by the same mint, and theorizes that each coin from the same mint has a $p_i$ drawn from a beta distribution specific to the mint; each flip of a coin is assumed Bernoulli generated using that coin's $p_i$. Put more simply, it assumes variation in the probabilities of coins produced by a mint, and models that variation by way of the hierarchy. That's the sort of model described by your second interpretation. In your first interpretation, there's only one coin, and $x_4$ could represent the next, unseen flip.
