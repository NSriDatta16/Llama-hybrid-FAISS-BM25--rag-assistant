What you are trying to build is a multi-agent game. The solution approach is from Multi-agent RL field and not single-agent RL. There are some differences between the frameworks that have huge impact to the process of finding an optimal solution (if you can find an optimal solution). MARL problem is quite hard and not easily scalable to many agents. I suggest you to take a look at MAPPO and their paper that you can find in the link. It is important to understand the preferable setup of the solution method: e.g. fully decentralized training and execution, fully centralized training and execution, centralized training and decentralized execution. Depending on the setup you will understand everything you need about the representation (e.g. in a centralized training setup all observations from all agents are concatenated and are inputs to the model of the value function).
