reduce size of an MCMC/ rjags object

I have recently started running more complicated Bayesian models in R using the rjags package. As model complexity has increased I have had to run longer chains to reach convergence for some parameters. Generally I will try a run at 20,000 and if this does not converge, use the update function to increase the chain length. For simple models I can save the model object, and it is small enough to share easily ( 100 Mb. Is there a function or technique to reduce the size of these objects before I save them? I am familiar with the concept of thinning when starting the model, but am interested if there is a technique to "thin" the chains post-hoc.
