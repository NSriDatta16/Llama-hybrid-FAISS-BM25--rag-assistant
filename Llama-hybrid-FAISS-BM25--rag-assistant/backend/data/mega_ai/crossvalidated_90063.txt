Correlation and group difference with unequal sample sizes

My sample is 60 participants. At first, I did not expect to analyze the correlation, but the result is interesting, so I would like to. The 60 participants are 50 people who have good reading skill AND another 10 people who have poor reading skill. They took a test for which the full score = 7. The good reading skill group got an average score = 6.7. The poor reading skill group got an average score = 5.1. Questions: Is there a test to find these relations? Do the good reading skill group and poor reading skill group have significantly different scores? Does reading skill relate to achieving score? Does good reading skill affect score positively? I have SPSS, but do not know how to analyze these relationships. Thank you.
