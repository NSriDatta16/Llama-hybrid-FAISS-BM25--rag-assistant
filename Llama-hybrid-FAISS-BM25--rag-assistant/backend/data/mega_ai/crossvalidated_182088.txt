Compare t-test of difference in means of 3 samples

I am comparing the statistical significance of the difference in means (say average age) using three samples (say classes) a, b, and c. The results of t-test show that there is no significant difference between the mean of samples a and b, and sample b and c (average age of students in class a is not different than in class b, similarly classes b and c). However, there a significant difference between samples a and c. a - b = 0 b - c =0 a - c =! 0 From the first two results, we can conclude that a=b and b=c, which means that a=c. However, this contradicts with the third result. What is the best way of analyzing this?
