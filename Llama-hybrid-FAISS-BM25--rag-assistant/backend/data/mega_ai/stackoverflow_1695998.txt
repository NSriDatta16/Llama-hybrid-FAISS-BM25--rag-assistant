A pragmatic solution: 1) choose some consistent guard-naming policy (e.g. path relative to project root + file name, or whatever else you choose). Include possible exceptions for third-party code. 2) write a program (a simple python script would do) to walk recursively the source tree and verify that the guards all conformal to the policy. And whenever the guards are wrong, output a diff (or sed script, or whatever else) that the user can easily apply to fix. Or just ask for a confirmation and make changes from the same program. 3) make everyone on the project use it (say, before submitting to source control).
