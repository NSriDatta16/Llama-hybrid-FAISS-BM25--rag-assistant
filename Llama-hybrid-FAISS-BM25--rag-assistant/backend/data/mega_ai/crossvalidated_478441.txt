Can linear and logistic regression coefficients be combined using an inverse variance weighted average?

Suppose I have coefficients from several studies, some are linear regressions and some are logistic regressions. They measure the same construct, but because of the nature of the experiments (i.e., using continuous vs binary responses), they were analyzed with linear vs logistic regressions. Is it okay to combine the coefficients from these studies using an inverse variance weighted average? (If it matters, the regression models were all mixed effects models using Bayesian parameter estimation.) Edit: I should have mentioned that all predictors and outcome variables were scaled in the manner recommended by Gelman et al. (2008). This meant that all linear DVs were scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.50.
