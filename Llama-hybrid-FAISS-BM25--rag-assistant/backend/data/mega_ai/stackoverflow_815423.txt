C/C++ Machine Learning Libraries for Clustering

What are some C/c++ Machine learning libraries that supports clustering of multi dimensional data? (for example K-Means) So far I have come across SGI MLC++ http://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/ OpenCV MLL I am tempted to roll-my-own, but I am sure pre-existing ones are far better performance optimized with more eyes on code.
