Persisting graph data (Java)

I have an application which utilizes graph (tree-like) custom structures. The structures are not real trees, but pretty much everything is connected together. The quantity of the data is also big (millions of nodes can exist). Tree-nodes can vary in type to make it more interesting (inheritance). I don't want to alter the data-structures to accommodate the persistence storage. I want to persist this data without too much extra work. I've goggled some options to solve this problem, but couldn't find anything that fits exactly for my needs. Possible options: serialization, databases with ORM (Hibernate?), JCR (JackRabbit?), anything else? Performance is important, because it's a GUI based "real-time" application (no batch processing) and there could be millions of graph-nodes which should be read and written between the memory and the persisted data store. Does anybody have experience or ideas about storing these kind of data?
