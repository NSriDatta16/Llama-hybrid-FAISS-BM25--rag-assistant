Breusch Pagan and White test always 0

I'm working on a machine learning algorithm and trying to evaluate the model based on a guide online. No matter how I change the features of the model, the results of both tests are always 0. Is there a problem with calculation or the model? I'm having a hard time understanding why this is happening from reading online, so anything helps! I'll place relevant code below # Applying model to be used with the statsmodel package (needs a constant) X2 = sm.add_constant(X) # create a OLS model model = sm.OLS(Y, X2) # fit the data est = model.fit() _, pval, __, f_pval = diag.het_white(est.resid, est.model.exog, retres = False) print(pval, f_pval) _, pval, __, f_pval = diag.het_breuschpagan(est.resid, est.model.exog) print(pval, f_pval) and the output 0.0 0.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.0 0.0
