The initial value of the CNN kernels can be seen from the documentation found here . The default Conv2D layer looks like keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (5, 5), activation='relu', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', bias_initializer='zeros') So we see that the kernel weights are initialized by Glorot uniform method an dthe bias is initialized as all zeros. Glorot Uniform Uniform sampling from $[-limit, limit]$ where $limit = \sqrt{\frac{6}{fan\_in + fan\_out}}$ where $fan\_in$ is the number of input neurons to the weight tensor and $fan\_out$ is the number of output neurons of the weight tensor.
