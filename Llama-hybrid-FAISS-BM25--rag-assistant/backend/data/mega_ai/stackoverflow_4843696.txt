This may seem trivial, but the solution in my case was using a module definition file ( foo.def ). The file format specification by Microsoft implies that it should be used only for DLL files, but it works perfectly well for static libraries too so i had to change my library into a DLL . This reduced my minimal link time from 7 to 2 seconds (probably helped the average link time too).
