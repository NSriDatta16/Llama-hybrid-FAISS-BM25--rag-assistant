Looking at your scatterplot (which is very helpful in my view), I would argue, you are not missing anything. The average rating in Goodreads is not very informative about your own rating of a book. Your sample size is with 221 observations not too small and there are books you like with high as well as low average ratings all across the board. Of course you could do some analyses which takes into account the ordinal nature such as an ordinal regression of your own rating variable which takes only values in the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ but that will not change much. Perhaps there are only few books with a high average Goodreads which you rate very badly, but I think this is a dead end. I do not feel that Goodreads ratings are as unreliable as the correlation seems to suggest Your feeling does not seem to be warranted by the data you presented here. Neither by the correlation you presented here, nor by the scatterplot. The graph does not suggest any nonlinear relationship as accurately suggested by DeltaIV in his comment (before the scatterplot was added to the post). I feel that most books that have a high rating are those I have personally liked as well If you care more about certain books than others, i.e. if you would be very sorry to not read those books, you could try to add weights , marking important books and see if both ratings give more similar results in this case? But this is of course an additional complexity. I intuit that selecting books based on genre and the average rating is a much better approach than randomly picking up books from a bookstore or library. This is an interesting question and we cannot answer it using the data at hand (because the books, and perhaps the ratings, in your Goodreads have not been randomly drawn/selected). If you want to be sure, try an experiment: Just randomly select and read 20 books or so (e.g. collect a large number of for example of ISBN numbers of novels and use a random generator such as the sample() function in R ). Give am a rating and do not look at Goodreads before you rate the book; then look at the correlation of your rating and the Goodreads rating for those randomly selected books. Of course, come back to us and tell us whether this changed your experience regarding the Goodreads ratings! In this case, it is not primarily a statistical issue but a "problem" of non-random samples and human behavior :-) PS: And I completely agree with DeltaIV very good comment that I would take a look if many average Goodreads ratings are based on (very) observations/ratings.
