The pmf of part(a) is the Binomial, which I am sure you have heard about. The distribution comes from the sum of independent and identically distributed (same probability of success) Î’ernouli random variables, which are zero-ones variables. You can easily compute the expectation and variance of such variables using basic principles. The hint given then advises you to use the iid assumption of these variables and work on the sum in order to derive the expectation and variance of the binomial distribution. In part(b) you have to recall what the maximum likelihood estimator precisely does. There are two equivalent ways to derive this estimator, either by working on the Bernouli variables or on the Binomial pmf. These hints should help you start. Since this is a self study question, we encourage you to work with our hints and finish the problem yourself.
