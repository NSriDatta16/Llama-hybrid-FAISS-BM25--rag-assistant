There are as far as I know no JSF components which does that with a single tag or something. The easiest what you can do is just displaying the raw HTTP User-Agent header. This is only a large and ugly string which is not always decipherable to everyone. There are however APIs which can convert a HTTP User-Agent header into useable information, such as the exact browser make/version and platform make/version, such as useragentstring.com . Once converted the User-Agent header into useable parts with help of such an API, you must be able to display the parts of interest in JSF with help of a managed bean the usual way.
