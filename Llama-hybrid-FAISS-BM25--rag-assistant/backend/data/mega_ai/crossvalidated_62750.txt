I'd expect substantial correlations between your predictor variables ("how long to post a project after signing up", "how long to get a first response to a project", "how many applications until the poster makes a selection," etc.) so you'll almost certainly get a better solution by using a multivariate approach. You're having problems with an "ellipse around the data" because your predictor variables are not Normally distributed. Those you've mentioned are bounded by zero, some of them are counts. Taking logs has made the distributions a bit more symmetrical, but they're still not Normal. In your plot the data isn't bounded by a square, it's bounded by straight lines below (zero) but apparently tails off above. "Ellipses around the data" are usually equiprobability contours. For a multivariate Normal they approximate ellipses, for other distributions they may not. The rigorous approach to your problem would be to fully define your multivariate non-Normal distribution and calculate equiprobability contours, but that is likely to be difficult and I'm not seriously recommending it. A more practical approach would be to work with the empirical multivariate distribution function (the data) and a pragmatic way of defining a boundary. If you have lots of data and can categorise your projects (e.g. did or did not complete in a reasonable time) I'd consider a classification tree approach (rpart in R). In that case I wouldn't start with a data set of "completed" projects - that excludes projects which did not complete, the ones you want to recognise! I'd use "projects posted over 'a long time' ago". Do remember to reserve a substantial part of your data as a test set; pragmatic categorisation algorithms can dangerously overfit their calibration sets.
