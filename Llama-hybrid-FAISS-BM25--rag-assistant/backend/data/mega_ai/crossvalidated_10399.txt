You'll want to look up the literature on multinomial logistic regression, a.k.a. nominal regression. It's an expanded version of the usual logistic regression. Coefficients and odds ratios obtained deal with the likelihood of the outcome being A, B, or C as opposed to D , the reference category. Thus for 4 levels of a dependent variable you'll have 3 tables with coefficients, odds ratios, etc. You'll want to make sure you choose that reference category intentionally: to which result will you and your readers most want to make comparisons? Sorry I can't provide syntax but SAS documentation should be a help there.
