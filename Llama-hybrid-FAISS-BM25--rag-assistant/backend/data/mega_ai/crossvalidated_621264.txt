In causal inference, we are usually interested in the causal effect of interventions for the purpose of informing policy decisions. Therefore, we need to estimate these causal effects without bias and in a practically useful and interpretable manner. Regarding the bias-variance trade-off, we are usually willing to sacrifice precision in my experience because policy decisions that affect public health, for example, are often based on a meta-analysis or synthesis of multiple evidence sources, not just one. In observational studies with confounding adjustment based on models, confidence intervals are not very meaningful to begin with. Nonetheless, even for causal inference, as long as it can be justified based on domain knowledge or sensitivity analysis that the magnitude of any residual bias is small, we are often willing to make the trade off to get more precise estimates. Because causal effects need to be interpretable and transparent to have any practical value for policy-makers, we will often use parametric models to model them. Recently, semi-parametric models are being used such that the causal effect itself is modelled parametrically for ease of interpretation but machine learning models are used to model nuisance parameters (e.g. high dimensional confounders) non-parametrically. You mention estimators: In my experience, the choice of estimators or methods has depended more on how comfortable various stakeholders are with different ones and choosing the one that everyone currently prefers rather than any principled consideration of measures such as efficiency.
