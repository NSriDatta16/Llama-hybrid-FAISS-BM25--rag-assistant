Your best option is probably to use the properties panel in the designer to set the positions etc (or maybe just drag them?). You could go digging around in the designer file for the form (something.Designer.cs), but this isn't a fantastic idea because it can be pretty sensitive to changing things in ways the designer doesn't expect. Having said that, it looks like you're not actually using the designer to make your form (the class would be partial , for one thing), in which case you're SOL.
