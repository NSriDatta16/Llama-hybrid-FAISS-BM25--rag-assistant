How do I control output files name and content of an Hadoop streaming job?

Is there a way to control the output filenames of an Hadoop Streaming job? Specifically I would like my job's output files content and name to be organized by the ket the reducer outputs - each file would only contain values for one key and its name would be the key. Update: Just found the answer - Using a Java class that derives from MultipleOutputFormat as the jobs output format allows control of the output file names. http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/MultipleOutputFormat.html I haven't seen any samples for this out there... Can anyone point out to an Hadoop Streaming sample that makes use of a custom output format Java class?
