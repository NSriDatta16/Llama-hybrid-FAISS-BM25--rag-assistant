How can I make a simple browser user-agent parser in Perl?

I needed to make a simple browser user agent parser in Perl. I have found a PHP code that does this but my knowledge is rather limited (esp. in regular expressions). So, here is the code whose Perl equivalent I want to write. if ($l = ereg($pattern, $agent, $a = array())) { array_push($found, array("product" => $a[1], "version" => $a[3], "comment" => $a[6])); $agent = substr($agent, $l); } The $agent is the user-agent string passed as argument, and returns an array of associative arrays $found, each one defining a product/comment in the agent string (key of the associative array are product, version, comment). The $pattern is the user-agent regular expression I am searching which I already know. So, how would this look like in Perl? Edit: Seems like there is an confusion about whether I want a Perl compatible regex or an equivalent function in Perl. I am looking for an Perl function and syntax that does the same thing.
