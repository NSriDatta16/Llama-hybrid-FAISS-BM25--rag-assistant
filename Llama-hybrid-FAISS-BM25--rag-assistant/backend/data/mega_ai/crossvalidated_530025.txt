A question of semantics: is any functional of a distribution a "statistic"?

I'm trying to figure out if my usage of the term "statistic" has drifted over time. I was thinking that, for example, any expectation or function of an expectation was a "statistic" in a physics sense but now I see that Wikipedia defines only the actual calculation (function of samples) as the statistic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic#:~:text=A%20statistic%20is%20an%20observable,measurement%20and%20a%20population%20average . Is anyone aware of more physics leaning definitions where an expectation operator was called a statistic and does this not transfer into probability and statistics in some contexts?
