time series prediction model with minute data

I m trying to apply prediction at my data that is taken from the sensor after 15 min 2020-01-09 12:00:00 90.82098 2020-01-09 12:15:00 90.61686 2020-01-09 12:30:00 86.22828 2020-01-09 12:45:00 82.04382 2020-01-09 13:00:00 79.90056 I saw some methods. Stated from ARIMAX (but I understood that I can't apply because my data have multi-season ) So I looked the TBATS but something goes wrong from tbats import TBATS, BATS # Fit the model estimator = TBATS(seasonal_periods=(96, 35.064)) model = estimator.fit(train_X) # Forecast 365 days ahead y_forecast = model.forecast(steps=35.064) but the first value is different and others remain the same in fact the output of y_forecast is this : array([89.39551833, 89.90889142, 90.04436999, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499, 89.97717499.... as I can see is various for the first 4 value..and for other is constant I think I m wronging the seasonal period. Any suggestions?
