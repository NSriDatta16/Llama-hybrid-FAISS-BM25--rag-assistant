This seems a little bit outside the scope of what DML error tables are intended to do natively, and then yes - the parallel DML rules are going to retrict you from other options. The easiest way to resolve this would be to add that batch processing date to the original table so that it also is reflected in the error table. Costs you a bit of storage, but if you need to identify rows by batch anyway.... Or, as you mention, there is a post-process solution. Finally, is there perhaps a way to layer that information into a view that overlays the error table when you go to look at the errors? Or is the batch date impossible to calculate at a later time?
