Are there known statistical tests to determine the parameters of a machine learning algorithm?

What i am trying to do is to take a machine learning algorithm that is already trained.Run the algorithm several times and collect the output. Conduct a statistical analysis on the output and try to create an inference regarding the parameters of the algorithm Is this possible ? Are there known statistical tests which does this or which does something similar to this ? Adding from the comment I was not sure whether to add statistical bias or not.I ll try to explain my thought flow when i added that tag. If in fact we can learn something about the algorithm (it could be the parameters used or something else) from the output, then it should be(i am not sure) because the output is biased in some way. My aim to find out if there is some way to learn something about the algorithm used, using the properties of this output.Have you heard of such a thing ?
