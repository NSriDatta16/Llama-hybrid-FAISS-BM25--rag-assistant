How long are your byte[] array? Do they fall into the small object or large object heap? If you experience memory fragmentation, I would say they fall into the LOH. You should therefore reuse the same byte arrays (use a pool) or use smaller chunks. The LOH is never compacted, so it can become quite fragmented. Sadly there is no way around this. (Apart from knowing this limitation and avoiding it)
