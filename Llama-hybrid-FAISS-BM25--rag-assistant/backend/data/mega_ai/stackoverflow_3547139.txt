Somewhat a partial answer, but you can use the lagacy CAS in .Net 4. Quote from http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/11/CAS-Replaced : With .NET 4.0, global CAS policies will disabled by default. System administrators are encouraged to use more effective means such as Windows Software Restriction Policies instead. If CAS is actually needed, it can be enabled on a per application basis in the app.config file setting the runtime/NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicyenabled flag to true.
