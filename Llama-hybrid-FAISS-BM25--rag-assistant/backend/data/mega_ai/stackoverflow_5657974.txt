File content upload using JSON

I am attempting to upload a file from the browser to a Spring 3.0 MVC application (hosted in Glassfish). The intent is to send the file content through a JSON request. Attempting to read the file using JavaScript and then placing the file content in a JSON request does not seem advisable as the file content may be large and consume memory on the browser. Next I attempted using the mootools uploadManager . The documentation and demos deal only with a php server. There is de-coding of the file contents by the php script that handles the upload. So to use mootools uploadManager, I would have to simulate the de-coding (contained in the php script) in my Spring MVC controller. Since this isn't going to be straight forward, I am wondering if there are other elegant solutions to this issue (after reading this and this ). TIA, Vijay
