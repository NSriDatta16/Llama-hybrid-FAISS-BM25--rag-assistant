For example, people often choose to use a non parametric test when some other test suggests that the residuals are not normally distributed. This approach seems pretty widely accepted but does not seem to agree with the first sentence in this paragraph. I was just hoping to get clarification on this issue. Yes, a lot of people do this kind of thing, and change their second test to one that can deal with heteroskedasticity when they reject equality of variance, and so on. Just because something is common, doesn't mean it's necessarily wise. Indeed, in some places (I won't name the worst-offending disciplines) a lot of this formal hypothesis testing contingent on other formal hypothesis testing is actually taught. The problem with doing it is that your procedures don't have their nominal properties, sometimes not even close. (On the other hand, assuming things like that without any consideration at all for potentially extreme violation could be even worse.) Several papers suggest that for the heteroskedastic case, you're better off simply acting as if the variances aren't equal than to test for it and only do something about it on rejection. In the normality case it's less clear. In large samples at least, in many cases normality isn't all that crucial (but ironically, with large samples, your test of normality is much more likely to reject), as long as the non-normality isn't too wild. One exception is for prediction intervals, where you really do need your distributional assumption to be close to right. In part, one problem is that hypothesis tests answer a different question than the one that needs to be answered. You don't really need to know 'is the data truly normal' (almost always, it won't be exactly normal a priori ). The question is rather 'how badly will the extent of non-normality impact my inference'. The second issue is usually either just about independent of sample size or actually gets better with increasing sample size - yet hypothesis tests will almost always reject at large sample sizes. There are many situations where there are robust or even distribution free procedures which are very close to fully efficient even at the normal (and potentially far more efficient at some fairly modest departures from it) - in many cases it would seem silly not to take the same prudent approach.
