3 optimizations that should help: Threading If the program freezes it most likely means that you're not using a separate thread to process the large XML file. This means that your app has to wait until this task finishes to respond again. Instead, create a new thread to process the XML and notify the main thread via a Handler when it's done, or use AsyncTask . This is explained in more detail here . Data storage Additionally, a local SQLite database might be more appropriate to store large amounts of data, specially if you don't have to show it all at once. This can be achieved with cursors that are provided by the platform. Configuration changes Finally, make sure that your data doesn't have to be reconstructed when a configuration change occurs (such as an orientation change). A persistent SQLite database can help with that, and also these methods.
