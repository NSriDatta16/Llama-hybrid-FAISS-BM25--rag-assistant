Drupal + page fragment caching

our drupal site has some user specific content. When we enable page caching the whole page is being cached. Isn't it possible to cache only fragments of the page. Or specify which fragments not to cache? Or even specify which pages not to cache. This way we can remove some stuff from the caches when logged in. Or don't use the cached versions when logged in. I found this website already but it doesn't seem to work: http://www.jpstacey.info/blog/2009/03/03/how-to-not-cache-a-particular-drupal-page But this doesn't seem to work. kind regards, Daan
