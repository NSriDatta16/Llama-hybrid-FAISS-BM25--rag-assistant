You seem to be looking for a prediction-interval , not a confidence-interval . There is a difference. The simplest approach would be to regress the European numbers on the US numbers and use established formulas for regression PIs . Maybe work on a log scale, since you anticipate a multiplicative relationship. (Note that you need a bias correction in back-transforming an expectation prediction from the log scale, but you don't need it in back-transforming a PI.) Alternatively, try a regression as above, but model residuals using ARIMA to capture any remaining time series dynamics. The forecast package for R will do this for you and give you PIs.
