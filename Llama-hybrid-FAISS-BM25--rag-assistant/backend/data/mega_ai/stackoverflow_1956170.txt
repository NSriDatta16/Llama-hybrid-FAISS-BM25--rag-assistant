innerHTML size limit

I want to use AJAX to load an htmlfile into a I will then need to run jsMath on this. Everything I have done so far with innerHTML has been a paragraph or two, maybe a table and/or image. Nothing too fancy. What potential problems may occur when I set innerHTML to an external 25k file, with all sorts of complex css formatting? (thanks to jsMath) I can't think of any other method of doing this, but need to know if there are any limitations. Thanks in advance. --Dave
