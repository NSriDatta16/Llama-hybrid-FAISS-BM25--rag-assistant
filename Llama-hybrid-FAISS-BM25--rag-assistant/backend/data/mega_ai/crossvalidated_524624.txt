Why does auto-encoder best suited for the job of anomaly detection?

Currently, I have been studying auto-encoders. What I have understood is that an auto-encoder is a neural network where the input layer is identical to the output layer, and it does this by minimizing the reconstruction loss. Now, I want to know why auto-encoder is mostly used for anomaly detection ?
