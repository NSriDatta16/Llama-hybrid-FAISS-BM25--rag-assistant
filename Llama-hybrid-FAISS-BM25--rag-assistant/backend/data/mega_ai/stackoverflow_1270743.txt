Cocoon escape query parameters problem

I'm maintaining Cocoon 2.1 application and I faced serious problem with request parameters. Consider following url: http://myapp.com/somePage.html?param1= &param2= Both param1 and param2 are directly passed into transformer as parameters ( ) and then directly used in javascript code using attribute value template: ` ` The problem is that it is possible to inject some JavaScript code in parameters and they are not escaped by default (nevertheless all articles about cocoon and xslt says that output is escaped by default). Perhaps someone more experienced with cocoon and xsl may know something about this problem? How can I escape output in cocoon? I will appreciate any help and guidance. Thanks in advance Simon
