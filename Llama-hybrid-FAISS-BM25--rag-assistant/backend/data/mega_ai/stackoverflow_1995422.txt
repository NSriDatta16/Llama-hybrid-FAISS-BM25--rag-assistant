A few thoughts: Know the STL. There is std::swap already. Instead of spending your time making everything as generic as possible, spend your time becoming more familiar with the STL. Don't do it till you need it: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."---Ron Jeffries . If you don't actually reuse the code you didn't write reusable code, you wrote unnecessary code. Unnecessary code is expensive to develop, expensive to test, and expensive to maintain. Don't forget opportunity cost ! Keep things simple: "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."---Albert Einstein. This is KISS .
