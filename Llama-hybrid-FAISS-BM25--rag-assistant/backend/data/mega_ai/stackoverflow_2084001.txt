Calling a Method from Within a Ruby Class? (or is this rails magic)

I'm new to Ruby and working through some tutorials/screencasts. I've reached the section where they're discusisng the before_filter callback, and it's using some syntax that's a little weird for me. I don't know if it's a feature of ruby, of if it's some rails magic, and was hoping someone here could set me straight or point me in the right direction w/r/t the manual This is a code fragment from the screencast I'm watching class MachinesController [:report] #... def index #etc... end def login_required #etc... end end In the context of rails, I understand that before_filter is a callback that will fire login_required method when the report action is called. However, it's not clear to me what it is within the context of ruby. In other languages classes typically contain methods, properties, class variables and constants defined within the braces. However, this looks like its a function call inside the class, and some experiments have show that you can put code in your class definitions and have it called when the program runs. Is this correct? If so, are there special contextual rules for code that's put inline into a class like that? (i.e. would the before_filter function in rails know what class it was called from) If not, what magic is rails doing here?
