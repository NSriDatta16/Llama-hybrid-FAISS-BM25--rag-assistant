It's likely that your problem can be solved by reauthorizing your device: If your iPhone is plugged into the computer, unplug it In Xcode, display the Organizer (Window->Organizer) In the Devices area click on your device and delete it . Just in case, Quit Xcode and then re-launch it. Open the Organizer again, then plug your iPhone into your computer. Tell Xcode that yes, you'd like to authorize the device . If everything works correctly, Xcode will now download device information for 4.2.1. If this doesn't work then I suggest performing the steps again, but replace step 4 with removing all traces of Xcode from your computer and then reinstalling it. This includes the entire Developer folder.
