Are the No Free Lunch Theorem and Halting Problem connected?

I just read about the no free lunch theorem where it is said: Uniformly averaged over all target functions $F$, $\mathcal{E}_1 (E|F, > n) â€” \mathcal{E}_2(E|F, n) = 0$ The words "all target functions" , reminded me of the halting problem : In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. This made me wonder if the two are related, if yes, how ? EDIT: Here is a different reason why they might be connected: -Intelligence is a form of (lossy) compression -Measure of compressability is Kolmogorov complexity -Calculating the Kolmogorov complexity for an arbitrary string is undecidible (-> Halting problem) (One flaw with this similarity that the Kolmogorow complexity is defined for lossless compression, while Intelligence is a form of lossy compression).
