If you are developing within an ASP.NET website (eg., File -> New Web Site ) and you want to reuse classes within your web app you need to put the classes in .cs files within the App_Code directory of the application, or you can compile them into a DLL and place that within the bin directory. If you are developing within an ASP.NET web application project (eg., File -> New Project, New ASP.NET Web Application ), then you may organize your class files however you wish within the substructure of that project, or you may add additional projects to the solution to arrive at a higher degree of separation between UI code and elements and your business or data logic. And, of course, newer ASP.NET technologies such as MVC would follow conventions for storing controllers and things such as that, and the same about additional projects applies. After you have organized your files in a way consistent with your application type, you may include using myNamespace; in whatever class or page that needs to be able to use those classes.
