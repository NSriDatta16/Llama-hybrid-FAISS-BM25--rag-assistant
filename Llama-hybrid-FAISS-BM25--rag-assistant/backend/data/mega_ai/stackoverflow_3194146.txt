Force VS2010 to keep the build output path absolute

We want to have our build server send the output of each build to C:\Projects\{project name}\build\{build configuration}\ . To accomplish this, I set the Build Output path property for my projects to that in Visual Studio 2010, and build locally to make sure everything works. When I do so, visual studio changes the path to a relative one, for example ..\..\build\Debug . Since the project directory is not the same on the build server (we use TeamCity, so the project url there is something like C:\BuildAgent\work\9358A92GF92), the output doesn't end up where we want it. How do I make Visual Studio not change the build output paths to relative paths?
