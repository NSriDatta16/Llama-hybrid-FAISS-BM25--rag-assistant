You didn't mention whether this is a document-based app (like say, TextEdit) or a library-based one (like say, AddressBook). That may help you decide where such information should go: assume a document-based app. Assume its documents get placed under version-control (this is actually feasible when using Core Data's XML data store type). Open the app, change the doc's sort orders. Does this dirty the document? Would this change be worth a check-in? Would the change be valuable to other users of this repository? Typically, sort orderings aren't valuable enough to warrant document-based storage (ala NSTableView's Auto Save Name in Interface Builder). But your app may place a priority on sorting (it sounds like it). So, there is no hard-and-fast rule. But I think the idea of having a document under version control, potentially shared with others, provides a good intellectual framework to make your case for either side.
