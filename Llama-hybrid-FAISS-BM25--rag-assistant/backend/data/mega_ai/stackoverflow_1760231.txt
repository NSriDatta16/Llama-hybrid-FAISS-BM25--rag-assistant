How do I get the title of a youtube video if I have the Video Id?

I'm playing now with the Youtube API and I began a small project (for fun). The problem Is that I cant find the way to get Title of a video from the Id. (example: ylLzyHk54Z0) I have looked in the DATA and PLAYER api documentation and I cannot find it. If someone knows how to do this or if someone could help me find the way to do this, please help me. NOTE: I'm using javascript. It will be a web app. EDIT: I have got an Idea. Maybe using a Regular expresion to parse out the title from the page title. I'm working on this.
