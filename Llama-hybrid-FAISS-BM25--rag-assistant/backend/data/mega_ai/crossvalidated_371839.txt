A useful model for the 28 observations is here and also here as a famili ar regression equation . When identifying via pre-whitening it is often necessary to include any needed differencing operators. Some software provides recognize that the transfer function itself does not necessarily include the differencing operators and they provide the option to include differencing operators or not. For example if y and x are both upwards trending series , it is entirely possible for y=3x might be a useful model even though both y and x ( by themselves) are non-stationary. In this case unwanted/unneeded differencing and unwarranted dynamic structure (INTENT) injects unneeded structure causing your consternation. There are two seasonal pulses and 1 level/step shift at or around 12/2017. I have have also attached the litmus test for model adequacy ... the plot of the model errors and also the acf of the model errors. . It would be interesting ( and probably revealing) to see the plot of the residuals and the residual acf of the SPSS model. I would suggest that any complete/thorough analysis would include this presentation. In terms of why neither SAS or SPSS include the automatic identification of deterministic structure https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/09c4/ba8dd3cc88289caf18d71e8985bdd11ad21c.pdf when predictor series are employed, you might ask them as the last time I looked they were not available. The actual/fit/forecast graph is here ## ## and the statistical summary of the model is here Hope this helps your understanding. p.s. You might look at steps to time series analysis on my data and note that for programming simplicity SPSS does not automatically assess the need for the inclusion of differencing operators into the transfer model .. it simply naively assumes it.
