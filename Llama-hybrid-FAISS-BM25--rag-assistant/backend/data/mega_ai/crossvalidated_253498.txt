What I suggest is this. If indeed you can extract the age in a continuous format it might prove advantageous: The data is more robust. The way it is currently created makes it ambiguous when 20, 25 etc.. are, as they belong to two groups simultaneously. caveat - If there is a logical or theoretical reason to group Age, than do so. For example, if certain Age points hold specific meaning, like 21 (drinking age), 65 (pension), 6 (entering elementary school) or otherwise, than grouping is what you want to do. Now, if you have two interval variables ( Proportion and Age ), I would plot them to see the connection visually. Since these are only two variables (no other controls), There is no real need for regression (Ill go there in a sec). --Note that the below is resting on a linear connection (which seems the case with your data) You can measure the correlation (Pearson's $r$) : > cor.test(df$Proportion,df$Age) Pearson's product-moment correlation data: df$Proportion and df$Age t = 8.4717, df = 8, p-value = 2.884e-05 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.7917609 0.9880651 sample estimates: cor 0.9485315 This means that the connection ($r=0.949$) between the two variables is very very strong (and significant). With a $95%$ chance, the correlation in the actual population is between $0.791$ and $0.988$ Regressing these: > summary(lm(Proportion~Age, data=df)) Call: lm(formula = Proportion ~ Age, data = df) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.097030 -0.032030 0.009212 0.018409 0.106545 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

If you want to plot it with the regression line (using ggplot2 here): ggplot(df, aes(x=Age, y=Proportion)) + geom_point(size=4) + geom_smooth(method = lm)
