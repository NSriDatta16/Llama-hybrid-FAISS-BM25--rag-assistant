There are a few different ways you can migrate. The tool will pull your history, etc. over, but the more pragmatic and simple way is to lock VSS as a history archive and start fresh: Have everyone check in all changes into VSS, make sure everything builds, etc. Set all VSS databases to "locked" (read-only rights for all users) Get Latest on the entire VSS database into a "clean" set of folders on a workstation Check all of the files into TFS from the workstation For any history prior to the conversion, folks need to go to VSS, but after a week or two it's realistically unlikely to happen all that often. And you know that the history in VSS is accurate and not corrupted by the conversion process.
