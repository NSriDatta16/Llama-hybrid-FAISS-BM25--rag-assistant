multiply each coordinate whit offset I knew, that somebody will not believe. Ok here is full source in python (I used pythonxy ) import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x1, y1 = np.random.rand(2, 20) plt.plot(x1,y1) x2=x1*1.3 y2=y1*1.3 l=len(x1) #calculate centers cx1=sum(x1)/l cy1=sum(y1)/l cx2=sum(x2)/l cy2=sum(y2)/l #recenter polygon x2=x2-(cx2-cx1) y2=y2-(cy2-cy1) plt.plot(x2,y2) plt.show() I made example whit random line but it is not different from your example http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/8615/grafm.png The reason that this works is because multiplying each point is same as stretching axes. I calculated center as "average" and move one center over another, that way position looks more natural
