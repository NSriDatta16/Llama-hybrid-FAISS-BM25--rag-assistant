Is it possible to define a one-off user control in the ASPX codebehind?

One of my big beefs with ASP.NET is that it makes it difficult to organize the controls of a page beyond excessive amounts of prefixing IDs. I have gone to great and complicated lengths in the past to try to alleviate this, but I would like a solution that is easier to implement. So, I'm wondering: Is it possible to define a user control in the codebehind of a .aspx, and then use it in the .aspx? I'm thinking probably not... I can't get it to work.
