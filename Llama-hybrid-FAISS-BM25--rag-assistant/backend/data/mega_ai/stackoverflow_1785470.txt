First, if you want lightweight, Sinatra is usually my first pick. Pair it up with rack and Passenger for best results. It's not CGI, but realistically speaking, CGI is rarely a good match-up with Ruby. Here's the "Hello World!" Sinatra app from the main page: require 'rubygems' require 'sinatra' get '/hi' do "Hello World!" end Hard to get more lightweight than that. As for providers, anybody that supports Passenger (mod_rack) should be able to handle Sinatra. I'm a big fan of Slicehost personally, but they're a VPS host, which means you need to be able to install and manage the entire stack yourself. If you don't mind paying a tiny bit extra for the infrastructure, Heroku makes installation and deployment dead simple, so long as your needs don't exceed what they provide (sounds like they won't). In the unlikely event that you're only using 5MB or if you're using an external storage mechanism like Amazon RDS , Heroku may actually be free for you. Update: Passenger is an Apache module that allows Rack applications to be run inside of Apache. Rack is a middleware layer that separates the web server and the web framework from each other. This allows web frameworks to run on any web server for which there is an adapter. Sinatra is a lightweight web framework that runs on top of Rack. Once Passenger and Rack are installed ( gem install rack , gem install passenger ) you just need to edit the Apache vhost to point at the config.ru file for your Sinatra app and create the required directories as per the Passenger docs and you'll be good to go.
