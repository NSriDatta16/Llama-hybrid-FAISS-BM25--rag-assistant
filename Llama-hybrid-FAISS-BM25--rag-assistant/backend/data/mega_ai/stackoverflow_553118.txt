Make an image from image tiles

I have seen a couple of images where they generally make a face out of numerous smaller images. For example, say they tile 100 images in 10x10 grid, and somehow they vary hue/sat/col of the smaller images so that when you see the Big Picture , you see another image. The question boils down to - say you have an image. What kind of algorithm would you apply to that image so that the average RGB value of that image is the one you have defined?
