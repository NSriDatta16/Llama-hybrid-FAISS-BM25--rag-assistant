Given your level of expertise, your suggestion of averaging (some) of the scores and then carrying out a t-test to compare the groups is reasonable. Rather than select the 3 highest scores I think you should average all four, or perhaps average the last 3 (assuming that people get better at playing the game over time). Plotting the average of each trial by gender would help you see if that first trial is perhaps not representative of an individuals performance. What you have is called a "repeated measures design", and to analyze it properly is not an introductory level task. Search for "mixed models" on this site. The main issue is that although you have $90 * 4 = 360$ observations many of those observations are not independent of each other, because individuals differ in their game playing ability. Thus treating all the observations independently inflates your sample size. Averaging the observations within each individual solves this problem, albeit at the cost of throwing away other useful information like how much people improve as they play the game more times, and how much people vary in game playing ability.
