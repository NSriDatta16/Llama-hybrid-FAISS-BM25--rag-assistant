What happened to Mongoid.config.master.connection.host?

I am trying to get Carrierwave (0.5.1) to work with Mongoid (2.0.0.beta.20), Rails 3. I followed every step at this guide . In config/initializers/carrierwave.rb, I have: CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.grid_fs_database = Mongoid.database.name config.grid_fs_host = Mongoid.config.master.connection.host config.storage = :grid_fs config.grid_fs_access_url = "/uploads" end When I try to start my server ( rails server ). In the console, I get: ...config/initializers/carrierwave.rb:3:in `block in ': undefined method `host' for # (NoMethodError) I don't understand why I am getting this error. I've looked everywhere and can't seem to locate why this is happening... It seems, Mongoid.config.master.connection.host doesn't work anymore in newer versions of Mongoid. Was this removed? What is the replacement for this? So far my workaround is the following code: CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.grid_fs_database = Mongoid.database.name config.grid_fs_host = 'localhost' config.storage = :grid_fs config.grid_fs_access_url = "/uploads" end Line 3, should be: config.grid_fs_host = 'localhost' .
