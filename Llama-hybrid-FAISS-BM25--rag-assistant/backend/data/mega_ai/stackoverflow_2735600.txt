Why is there a limit of max 20 parameters to a clojure function

there seems to be a limit to the number of parameters a clojure function can take. When defining a function with more than 20 parameters I receive the following: # Obviously this can be avoided, but I was hitting this limit porting the execution model of an existing DSL to clojure, and I have constructs in my DSL like the following, which by macro expansion can be mapped to functions quite easily except for this limit: (defAlias nn1 ((element ?e1) (element ?e2)) number "@doc features of the elements are calculated for entry into the first neural network, the result is the score computed by the latter" (nn1-recall (nn1-feature00 ?e1 ?e2) (nn1-feature01 ?e1 ?e2) ... (nn1-feature89 ?e1 ?e2))) which is a DSL statement to call a neural network with 90 input nodes. Can work around it of course, but was wondering where the limit comes from. Thanks.
