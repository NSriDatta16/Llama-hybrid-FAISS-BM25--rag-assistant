You should be using an evaluation metric like area under the ROC curve not R^2. R^2 is good for continuous unbounded variables not classification. This is the most important thing you should do. If your outcome variable is highly imbalanced you might want to use precision recall. More about Precision-Recall and ROC. You need to do parameter tuning with Grid Search. It might be better to use random forest since sometimes boosting methods can overfit. You should also try logistic regression. I would avoid removing variables before training based on correlation. I am happy to help further if you update your question to include correct metrics for classification problems.
