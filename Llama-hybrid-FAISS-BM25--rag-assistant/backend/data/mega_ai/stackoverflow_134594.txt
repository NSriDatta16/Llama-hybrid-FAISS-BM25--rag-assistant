Google Maps-Like Scrolling Panel in WPF

I have a Canvas where I'm drawing a bunch of shapes and other UI elements. This canvas can be very large so I want to put this in a panel which allows me to zoom in/out using the mouse and scroll by dragging the mouse, just like Google Maps. The closest thing I could find was the ScrollViewer but obviously this isn't close enough. Has anyone done this in WPF and have any XAML and/or C# code?
