It depends on the exact question, but probably a linear mixed effects model with the proband id as random effect and a dummy variable that is $0$ if the proband did receive nothing (pretest values) or placebo in the last period and $1$ if the proband received true therapy in the last period, and otherwise $0$, as fixed effect. The biochemical level being the dependent variable. Depending on the values and your expectiations on the durability of the drug effect you might consider another dummy variable on whether there was drug influence in the last two periods or you might consider the log of the measurement instead of the measurement itself or if you are faced with floor or ceiling effects you might consider the same as logistic regression. It really depends on your expectations on the drug. However, the above given model will be a good start to improve upon.
