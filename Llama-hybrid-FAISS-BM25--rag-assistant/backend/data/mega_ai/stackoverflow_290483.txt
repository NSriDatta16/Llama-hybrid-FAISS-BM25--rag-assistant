What file permissions should I set for uploaded files

I have a PHP script that processes file uploads. The script tries to organise the files that are uploaded and may create new folders to move the files into if needed. These files will be below the www root directory (ie, a web browser will be able to access them). My question is, what permissions should I set for the folders that get created and for the files that are moved into them (using mkdir() and move_uploaded_file() )?
