i ve tried to code and test the solution you proposed, since i am facing similar problems concerning proximity alerts and intents carrying location objects. According the information you provided, you managed to overcome the null object retrieval, on the BroadcastReceiver's side. What you might did not observe is that now you should be receiving the same location as the one your intent was first created (also seen it as: intent caching problem). In order to overcome this problem, i used FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT, as being proposed by many people here and it works pretty fine, fetching fresh (and juicy :P) location values. So the line defining your pending intent should look like this: PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(getApplicationContext(), 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT); However, you can ignore this if: your purpose was just to receive a location value once you managed to overcome it in some other way not visible in your post
