In theory, you use the training set to learn the weights, the validation set to adjust the network architecture and the testing set to verify the generalisation of your network. You can find further details on this towards data science article . Only the accuracy on the testing set - unseen during both the training and the architecture tuning - give you an unbiased idea of your performance. If you want now to use your model on new data - in production for instance - you could re-train it on the training + validation sets.
