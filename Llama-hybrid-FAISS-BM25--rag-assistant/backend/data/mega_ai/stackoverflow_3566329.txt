Hmya, it is only going to slow down a decent programmer for no more than 5 minutes: string[] lines = ((RichTextBox)myEditor1).Lines; which will blow just as hard. There isn't much point in trying to prevent usage of your class that can be used anyway. The Lines property ought to be useful to anybody that uses your editor, it covers the very basic need to be able to retrieve the text that was edited. Don't throw out the baby with the bath water. The real problem here is that RTB uses so much unmanaged memory to store the text, leaving little left for the garbage collected heap. It gets really slow too once you pump thousands of lines into it. No component should ever be allowed to swallow up half of all available memory. Either limit the number of lines you allow to edit or use a better editor, like ScintillaNET. It is also rather important to be a pragmatic programmer. Beyond hiding a property needlessly. 600,000 lines in a text box is an enormous number. There a 3/4 million words in the Bible, you are displaying 6 copies of the Bible in your text box. No sane human is ever going to read that, they'll just dislike your program intensely. Not just because it is impossible to use effectively but also because it is a crash bucket.
