If all the null hypotheses were true, 5% of the time you should get a p-value below 0.05. You did 51 tests, so on average you should get 2.55 with p-values below 0.05. If the tests were all independent, it would even be slightly surprising if you didn't get at least one of them below 0.05. You got the most likely number of rejections if the RNG was actually random. Nothing surprising is happening here.
