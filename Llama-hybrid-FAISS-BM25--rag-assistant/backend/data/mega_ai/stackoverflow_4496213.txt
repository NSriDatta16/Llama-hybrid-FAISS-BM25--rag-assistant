this probably means that you're failing to spawn the remote processes - upcrun delegates that to a per-conduit mechanism, which may involve your scheduler (if any). my guess is that you're depending on ssh-type remote access, and that's failing, probably because you don't have keys, agent or host-based trust set up. can you ssh to your remote nodes without password? sane environment on the remote nodes (paths, etc)? "upcrun -v" may illuminate the problem, even without resorting to the man page ;)
