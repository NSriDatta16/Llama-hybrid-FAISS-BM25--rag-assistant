C# How to print multiple pictureboxes

I have 2 pictureboxes: pb1 and pb2. Pb1 can be dragged and dropped, pb2 cannot. Pb1 can also be resized. What i want is, when pb1 is inside pb2, both (pb1 and pb2) must be printed. And pb1 must keep it's sizes. When a look at the prinpreview, is see that pb1 has it's original sizes. So, how can i print these 2 printboxes and make sure pb1 keep it's resized size?
