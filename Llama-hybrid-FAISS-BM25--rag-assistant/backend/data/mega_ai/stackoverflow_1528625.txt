ThemeResolver is reasonably straightforward to implement. You won't be using the setThemeName() method, so have it throw an UnsupportedOperationException . Your resolveThemeName() method would: Get "User-Agent" request header and determine the appropriate theme. Run a DB query (you may want to cache this). Return theme name. You'll then need to declare your implementation under 'themeResolver' name in your application context.
