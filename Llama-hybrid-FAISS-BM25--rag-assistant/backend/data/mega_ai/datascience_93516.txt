How to fit a KNN and then a linear regression with those neighbors?

How do I fit a KNN to get the $k$ nearest neighbors and then aggregate the those neighbors into a fit using a linear regression (instead of a weighted average) in Scikit-Learn? I've tried creating a pipeline using KNeighborsTransformer and then LinearRegression but that doesn't appear to be doing the right thing.
