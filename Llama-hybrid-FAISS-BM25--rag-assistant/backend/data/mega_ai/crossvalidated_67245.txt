Confusion matrix of random Forest doesnot match predicted probabilities on train data

Based on an earlier question I balanced the classes such that the numbers in both classes is about similar. The random Forest gives next result: > print(rFresult) Call: randomForest(formula = finresfh ~ ., data = rFdatasubset, importance = TRUE) Type of random forest: classification Number of trees: 500 No. of variables tried at each split: 14 OOB estimate of error rate: 35.53% Confusion matrix: 1 2 class.error 1 1852 627 0.2529246 2 1022 1140 0.4727105 Prediction on the train set shows perfect separation in contrast to the confusion matrix: > tab tab TRUE_status probability 1 2 0.1 978 0 0.2 1447 0 0.3 54 0 0.7 0 65 0.8 0 1551 0.9 0 543 1 0 3 The probability is estimated for the subjects to be in class 2. The "probability" table means the number of subjects with predicted probability level having a certain TRUE status. Can anyone explain why the estimated probabilities show a perfect separation but a totally different result in the confusion table?
