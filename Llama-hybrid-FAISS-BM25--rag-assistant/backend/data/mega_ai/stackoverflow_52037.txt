When embedding SWFs from unknown sources, it is also best practice to throw a mask on the Loader so that the loaded SWF can't take over more screen real estate than expected. Pseudo-code to do so: var maskSpr : Sprite = new Sprite(); maskSpr.graphics.beginFill(); maskSpr.graphics.drawRect(0,0,safeWidth,safeHeight); maskSpr.graphics.endFill(); myLdr.mask = maskSpr;
