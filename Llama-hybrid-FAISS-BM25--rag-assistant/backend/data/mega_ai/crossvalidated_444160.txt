Average/Aggregation of 10 Discrete Probabilty Distributions

I have 2 experiments, where I have repeated each 10 times (20 experiments in total). I want to compare experiment A with experiment B. I create a probability distribution from each exp (20 prob distributions) and I would like to now compare exp A with exp B. I want to do some sort of aggregation (almost like average) on all probabilty distributions for A and plot and compare that with all probabilty distributions for B. Is there a way of doing this? Note some of these distributions are not necessarily normal.
