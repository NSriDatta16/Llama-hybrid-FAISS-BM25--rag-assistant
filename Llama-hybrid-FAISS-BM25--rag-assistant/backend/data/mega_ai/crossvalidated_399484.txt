Long data format for Mixed linear modeling

I have a data set from an experiment with two conditions: a control condition, and a testing condition. It's an experiment performed in pairs. Each condition was undertaken by 20 pairs of subjects (total 40 pairs). I want to compare outcomes between the conditions with Bayesian modeling. How do I write the data in long format? Should I have two models to compare and hence two sets of long data, or should I do this with one set of long data format for both conditions?
