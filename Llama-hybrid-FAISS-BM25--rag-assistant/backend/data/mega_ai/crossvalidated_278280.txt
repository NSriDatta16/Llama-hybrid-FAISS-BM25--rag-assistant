The research activities included creation of research plans, reference retrieval, collection and analysis, research report writing, participation in symposiums, and research paper publishing.

(1994), and Hicks (1995). It was further modified according to the opinions of eight experts. The KR-20 was 0.91, indicating a good internal consistency for this tool. There were 12 research activities in the tool. Five of the items contained 5–10 minor items each for a total of 33 items. A 2-point scoring system was adopted in which 1 meant participation in such research activity and 0 meant no participation. A higher score meant more participation in research activities.
