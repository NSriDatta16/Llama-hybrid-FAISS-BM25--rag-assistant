What is the connection (if any) and difference between logistic regression and survival analysis?

What is the connection (if any) and difference between logistic regression and survival analysis? If we build two models one using logistic regression to predict if the instances will survive or not. Another is using survival analysis. Can we compare two model's coefficients?
