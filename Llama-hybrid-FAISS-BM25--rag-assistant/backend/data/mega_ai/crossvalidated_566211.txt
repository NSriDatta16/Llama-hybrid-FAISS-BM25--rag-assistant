Age adjustment or Age standardization state of the art?

I want to run some comparisons of a quantity between different populations. Such quantity comes from a model that includes, among other variables, the variable age. So, one of the variables affecting such quantity is age . I want to account for the different age distribution in the the populations in order to obtain meaningful comparisons. I found this wikipedia article that discusses Age Adjustment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_adjustment However, the papers presented in the references are a bit old or do not seem to have attracted much attention among practitioners. I was wondering what is a good reference to identify gold-standard methods (i.e. widely accepted) or the state-of-the-art in age standardization/adjustment methods?
