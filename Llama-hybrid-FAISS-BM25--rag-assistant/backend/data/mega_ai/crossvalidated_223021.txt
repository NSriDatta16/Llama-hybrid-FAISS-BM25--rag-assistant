Take a simple example. In a multiple regression model, when you add or remove a variable, the statistical significance of estimates of the coefficients on the other variables change (unless the added/removed variable is uncorrelated to any linear combination of the other variables). In ARMA models it is something similar. You add or remove a term, and significance of the other terms changes. This is nothing special. Also, statistical significance is not such an interesting property in ARMA models. Recall that interpretation of individual coefficients of ARMA models is not that meaningful; to better understand the time series development at hand one should rather check impulse-response functions. If you are going to use your model for description of the data or forecasting, better look at diagnostics of model residuals (ideally, they should closely resemble an $i.i.d.$ process) or predictive performance, respectively.
