.NET Regex Expression For Finding & Replacing Any ProductName Value In A .vdproj File In C#

I'm trying to write a NAnt extension task that can update different settings within a Visual Studio 2003 generated Setup .vdproj file, and would appreciate help with the following. Specifically, I would like to use a RegEx expression to find, and if found, replace any value string value assigned to the ProductName value with a new string value in its entirty. I am looking for a RegEx expression set to change "ProductName" to any other value without having to rely on anything other than that the string sought begins with "ProductName" = "8": and then has 1 or more characters and ends with a " mark. I've tried the following to no avail: Before executing the following code fragment, the .vdproj file's ProductName reads: "ProductName" = "8:My Simple .NET Application" ... and the code fragment in C#: string _theProductName = "My Other Native Application"; Regex productNameExpression = new Regex( @"(?:\""ProductName\"" = \""8:*)" ); _theProjectFileContents = productNameExpression.Replace(_theProjectFileContents, "\"ProductName\" = \"8:" + _theProductName + "\"" ); bool updatedProductName = (_theProjectFileContents.IndexOf(_theProductName) >= 0); After executing the above code fragment, the .vdproj file's ProductName now reads: "ProductName" = "8:My Simple .NET Application"My Other Native Application" Close, but I was expecting "My Other Native Application" to replace "My Simple .NET Application", and not add to it. Any insights and help would be greatly appreciated.
