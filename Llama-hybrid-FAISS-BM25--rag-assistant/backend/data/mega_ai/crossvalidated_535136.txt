How to understand the scaling in Metropolis Hastings MCMC

We know the Metropolis Hastings (MH) in MCMC: target distribution: $\pi(x)$ proposal distribution: $p(y|x)$ acceptance: $\alpha(x,y) = \min \Big(1, \dfrac{\pi(y)p(y|x)}{\pi(x)p(x|y)}\Big)$ Here are some examples of a proposal distribution: $p(y|x)$ density of $U(x-\sigma, x+\sigma)$ $p(y|x)$ density of $N(x,\sigma^2).$ Then how to understand the statements that: large $\alpha$ or $\sigma^2$ will lower the acceptance; small $\alpha$ or $\sigma^2$ will increase the correlation. I cannot mathematically deduce the result from the acceptance formula.
