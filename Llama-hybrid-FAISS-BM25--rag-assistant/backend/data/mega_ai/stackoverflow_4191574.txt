If you mean, can you hide your ASP.NET code : it's not visible in View Source. If you mean can you hide your HTML : you can discourage casual peeking by creating your HTML on the fly via Javascript or AJAX, but a developer will always be able to see what you are doing, using simple tools like Firebug and Fiddler. Edited to add: I wasn't thinking of obfuscation (though that also discourages casual peeking), I was thinking of using javascript to pull down HTML. Doing a View Source will only show a bunch of tags. But it appears his question has been revised to go in a different direction anyway, to can I keep people from downloading my images , and the answer to that is a simple no . Making money from small numbers of images is not a viable business model. (If you have thousands of images, that's another story.) Edited to add: The conventional way of making a catalog of photographs is to [a] show low-resolution previews, [b] put a watermark on each image ( here's an example ), or both.
