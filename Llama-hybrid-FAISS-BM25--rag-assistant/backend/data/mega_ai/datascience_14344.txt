Since the points in each cluster are fairly spread out along the direction of the separating line , the average distance within a cluster is probably not that much smaller (as you might hope) than the average distance to points in the other cluster. A small positive value could be plausible. (Maybe look at the distribution of the points along the second principal component. A big spread could be the problem.)
