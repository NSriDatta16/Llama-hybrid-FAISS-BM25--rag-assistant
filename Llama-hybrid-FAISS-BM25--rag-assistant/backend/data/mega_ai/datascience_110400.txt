If you have Target Variables, why would you want to use Unsupervised learning like K means i believe Supervised Multiclass classification would have been a better approach. That being said your question is still valid, so let me try to answer that. In K means clustering, cluster number does not have any sequence which means you cannot directly map 0,1,2 cluster to the categories. To know which cluster belongs to which category you will have to do a deeper cluster analysis. You will have to look at average characterstic of each cluster and assign them categories accordingly. This can we done by aggregating data at cluster level and calculating averages for various variables
