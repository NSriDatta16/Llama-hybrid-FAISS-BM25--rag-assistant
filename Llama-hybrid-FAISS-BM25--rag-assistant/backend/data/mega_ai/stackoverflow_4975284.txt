Decimal(2, 4) means 2 total digits of precision and 4 behind the decimal. SQL Server won't let you do that, but I think it would means you can store values from -0.0099 to 0.0099. I'd recommend decimal(9, 6). This will store with an accuracy down to about 1/6th of an inch at the equator. Using 9 or less as the precision requires 5 bytes of storage, using 10-19 requires 9 bytes.
