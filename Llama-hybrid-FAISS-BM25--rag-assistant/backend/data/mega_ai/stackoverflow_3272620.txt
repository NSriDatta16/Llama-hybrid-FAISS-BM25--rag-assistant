Any tool to allow moving of elements on a webpage to aid design?

Are there any tools/Firefox plugins that will allow you to drag elements (divs, images etc) about on the page, and tell you the amount (x, y) that you have moved it? It would speed up designing a page a lot, instead of tweak css, reload page, tweak css, reload page. I've found the Firefox Web Developer extension useful for editing the css live, but it seems to hide background images when used.
