Meta analysis: Covariate adjustment?

I am doing meta analysis using "rma" (function) in the "metafor" package (in R). And this is my first time to do meta analysis. The estimate is a proportion (# of patients with good outcome / Total # of patients). Each paper has two groups to compare (Treatment 1 vs Treatment 2). However, I do also know the average age, # of females, and location (country) of each paper. I suspect that these three covariates affect the "proportion"; therefore I would like to adjust the effect from them. In rma function, there is an argument called "mods", where I can put "moderator" variables. In such case, to adjust covariates, can I use (something like) rma.da.adjusted Here, age and female are continuous covariates, and location and treatment_group are categorical covariates. Thank you in advance!!
