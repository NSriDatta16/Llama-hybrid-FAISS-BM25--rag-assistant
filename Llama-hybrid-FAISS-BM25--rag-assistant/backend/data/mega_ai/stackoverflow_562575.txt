two column CSS layout problem -- in IE6, table in content area is being pushed down by left nav

I have an extremely simple page that isn't displaying properly in IE6. In this browser, the left nav pushes down a table that's in the content area. Can anyone help me get the table to stay at the top of its container where it should be, rather than getting pushed down by content in the left div? Here's the html code for the page: body #nav { float: left; width: 180px; background-color: #999; } #content { margin-left: 210px; background-color: #999; } left content table Here's a url so you can see what it looks like: http://www.morganpackard.com/cssTest.html
