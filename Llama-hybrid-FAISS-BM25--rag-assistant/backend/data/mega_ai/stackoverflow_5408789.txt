Your code looks good. Have you tried embedding another mp3 file? I noticed that some mp3 files on our projects hang the mxml compiler when embedded. I've posted a bug report but it hasn't been looked at yet: https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-29391 It seems that specific mp3 files can cause strange things in the MP3 Transcoder.
