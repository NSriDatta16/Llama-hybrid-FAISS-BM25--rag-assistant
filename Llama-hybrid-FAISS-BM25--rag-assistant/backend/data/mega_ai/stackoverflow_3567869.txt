As a design agency, presumably with a number of customers with live websites that constantly need to change that are taking manpower away from new projects, My first question would be if I intend to migrate my existing customers to the CMS based version of their site Then, What are the commonalities/differences in your customer sites? If there is a lot of commonality (in the back end code as opposed to the front end design), then maybe integrating a basic article editor is all you need? Look at how a CMS is going to affect your design flow, Your designs will then be CMS 'Themes', that'll be a learning curve. I'm not trying to discourage you from Buying or Building a CMS, but the decision will be completely decided by your companies situation. Personally I use Joomla and DotNetNuke. I'm a developer not a designer, so I buy off the shelf themes and modify them. I also had no existing clients when I started out. I decided to use a CMS specifically because I could buy themes, and secondry to that was the client modifying the articles.
