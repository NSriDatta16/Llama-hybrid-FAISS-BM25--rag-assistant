Rails3 ajax upload with Iframe

before rails3 I had a working multiple ajax(mootools) file upload solution. I used form_to_remote with an iframe and responds_to_parent. In rails3 the ajax upload with form_tag remote => true, traget => "my_iframe" doesn't work. The the param[:uploaded_image]with the file is missing. I don't know why. Can anyone recommend a good ajax file upload solution?
