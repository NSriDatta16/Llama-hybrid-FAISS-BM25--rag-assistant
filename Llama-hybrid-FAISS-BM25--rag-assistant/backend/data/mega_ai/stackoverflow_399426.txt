Find tools that will reward you for testing . For example, make it very easy to run all the tests and get a message like 73 tests passed. Try random testing because you can test against a lot of values quickly and easily. See if your language provides a test-coverage analysis tool that gives you percentage of statement coverage or percentage of block coverage. It is very rewarding to drive code coverage from 60% up to 90% ---and if you are lucky, you will find bugs. My key advice is to quantify your progress in testing so that you can see the numbers going up. That will make it a lot more motivating. (Gee, I wonder what other numbers that go up can be found on this site...)
