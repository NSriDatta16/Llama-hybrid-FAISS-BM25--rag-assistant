The resolution of a multimedia timer is much better than one second. It can go down to 1 millisecond when you call timeBeginPeriod(1) first. The timer will automatically adjust its interval for the next call when the callback is delivered late. Which is inevitable on a multi-tasking operating system, there is always some kind of kernel thread with a higher priority than yours that will delay the callback. While it will work pretty well on average, worst case latency is in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Clearly, your requirements cannot be met by Windows by a long shot. You'll need some kind of microcontroller to supply that kind of execution guarantee.
