To make an informed selection, you'll really need to know your data model. MongoDB and CouchDB are document-oriented data stores. Cassandra is quite different, it is a bit more special-purpose and its distributed design is its strength. It's more of a distributed key/value store but with slicing, timestamp sorting, range queries, with limited data types. If you had a huge amount of data and knew exactly how it needed to be indexed for retrieval, Cassandra might work. Mongo and Couch are better for ad-hoc queries, and for example an AR replacement for a Rails app. As far as popularity, I'd say MongoDB is currently more popular with Rubyists, but in general CouchDB seems to have more mindshare and a lot of momentum. See also http://nosql-database.org/ for more information on the differences.
