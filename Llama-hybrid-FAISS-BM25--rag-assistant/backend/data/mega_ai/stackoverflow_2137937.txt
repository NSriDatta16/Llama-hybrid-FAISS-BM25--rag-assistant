Can I pass complex parameters to a Java Applet?

I'm really new to Java and I have to create an applet for signing documents electronically. The applet will be called from an ASP.Net web page application. Right now, I embed the applet in page as a and send parameters to the applet like this: In the applet, I can get the value using applet's built-in method getParameter("EdocPath") ; What I need is the ability to pass the applet a list of several files and their "display names". For instance, it would be simple to write it down like an XML string: ... However, as far as I see in HTML4.01 specification , the PARAM HTML element may not have content and it has no end-tag. The choices I'm considering, are: html-encode the xml structure and send it to applet in a single PARAM object creating a list of PARAM objects and constructing their names like "File1", "Description1", "File2", "Description2", "File3"... then in Java applet create a while loop to read filenames while there is any. However, none of the solutions seems to be elegant. The question is, what's the best practice in this case?
