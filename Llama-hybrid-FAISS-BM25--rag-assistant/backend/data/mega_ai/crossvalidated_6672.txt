Okay, I realize that when you calculate a 95% confidence interval for a parameter using classical frequentist methods, it doesn't mean that there is a 95% probability that the parameter lies within that interval. And yet ... when you approach the problem from a Bayesian perspective, and calculate a 95% credible interval for the parameter, you get (assuming a non-informative prior) exactly the same interval that you get using the classical approach. So, if I use classical statistics to calculate the 95% confidence interval for (say) the mean of a data set, then it is true that there's a 95% probability that the parameter lies in that interval.
