ARIMA modelling can be a very powerful tool BUT like all model specifications there are assumptions. An ARIMA model is not a panacea. Good econometricians are taught early to test "model specification assumptions" . A critical assumption is that if you have daily data then you must not omit any observations. You data has missing values(dates eg. 4.21.12 where the financial markets were closed.) My observation/finding could only be found by examining the time series in question. Other assumptions of ARIMA modelling is that there needs to be a constant variance in the (to be found) error process . Also there needs to be no pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses ( like a monday effect) or local time trends. You data clearly has "spikes' which need to be explained either via dummies or known events. Often times in daily data there are deterministic effects like day-of-the-week , month-of-the-year and even week-of-the-month or day-of-the-month. These need to be factored into the equation culminatimg in a Transfer Function with possible ARIMA structure. An example of a daily model can be found here http://autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/53-capabilities-presentation starting at slide 48 When an OP asks a very general question like this one it is insufficient to deliver a "Sermon from the Mount" like read the book ! but rather to provide possible specific help regarding logic flaws in their approach. Actual assumption testing much like an earlier Thomas can often be very useful.
