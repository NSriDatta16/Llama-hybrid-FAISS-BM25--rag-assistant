the goal of the model is to predict text documents associated to features patterns the final text is always a combination of chunks of pre-written text It is not yet clear to me what you are trying to do, but I think it is roughly a "data-to-text" problem: learning a mapping from structured data (your boolean features) to natural language. You could try to 1) selecting the pre-written chunks using a classifier that independently predicts whether each chunk has to be included, and 2) "smoothing" the text by learning to mapping the raw concatenation of chunks into a smooth coherent text. This is the kind of approach described in the following paper: Unsupervised Natural Language Generation with Denoising Autoencoders, Freitag and Roy (2018)
