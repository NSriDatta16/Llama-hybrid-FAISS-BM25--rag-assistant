You can train an RNN with character embeddings . This can be done by splitting the name into sequences of chars and vectorize them numerically. If you are working with Keras, you can feed them into an Embedding() layer that will learn how to represent characters. RNN layers will then process their sequence. At the output node, your Network will perform a classification ('good'/'bad').
