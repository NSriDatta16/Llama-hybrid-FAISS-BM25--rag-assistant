I don't really know how matlab works so I can't really comment on the code, but maybe this will help explain a bit how RGB colors work. When using RGB colors a gray scale can be made by making sure the values for R,G and B are all the same. So basically what you want to do is detect if a pixel is red, when not just make R,G and B the same (you can use an average of the 3 for a rudimentary result). Harder part is how to detect if a pixel is actually red, you can't just check if a pixel is high in the R value since it can still be another color, and a low R value can just mean a darker red. so you could do something like this: (I don't have matlab, so assuming syntax): red = cdata( y, x, 1 ); green = cdata( y, x, 2 ); blue = cdata(y, x, 3); if (red There are probably better ways to detect red and to get an average gray, but it's a start ;)
