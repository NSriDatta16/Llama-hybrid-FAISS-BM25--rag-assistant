i'd say on average that request and response have about 8 lines of headers each and about 30 chars per line. Then allow for the size increase of converting any uploaded binary to Base64. You didn't say if you also want to count TCP packet headers, in which case you could assume an MTU of about 1500 so add 16 bytes (tcp header) per 1500 data bytes Finally, you could always setup a packet sniffer and count actual bytes for a sample of data. oh yeah, and you may need to allow for deflate/gzip encoding as well.
