Is there a tool for creating historical report out of j/nunit results

Looking for a way to get a visual report about: overall test success percentage over time (information about if and how quickly tests are going greener) visualised single test results over time (to easily notice test gone red that has been green for long time or vice versa to pay attention to a test that has just gone green) any other visual statistics that would benefit testers and the project as a whole Basically a tool that would generate results from the whole test results directory not just off the single (daily) run. Generally it seems it could be done using XSLT, but it doesn't seem to have much flexibility to work with multiple files at the same time. Does such a tool exist already?
