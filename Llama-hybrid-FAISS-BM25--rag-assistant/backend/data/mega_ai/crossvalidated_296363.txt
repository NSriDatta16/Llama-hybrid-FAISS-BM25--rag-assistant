No, the point of ARCH is to model time-varying conditional variance which does not have to be nonstationary. Stationarity is not the same as constancy. A time series can be stationary without being constant. E.g. the variance $\sigma_t$ of a variable $x_t$ can be stationary without being constant, i.e. without $\sigma_t\equiv \sigma$ for some fixed value $\sigma$.
