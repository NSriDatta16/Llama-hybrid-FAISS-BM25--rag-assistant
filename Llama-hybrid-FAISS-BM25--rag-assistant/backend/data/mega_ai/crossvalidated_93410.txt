For what you're trying to do, the second approach seems better to me. If your model is correctly specified, then you'll converge to the right answer as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Meanwhile, the first approach, i.e., cutting at 0.5, could go horribly wrong if you have lots of probabilities that are systematically around 40% or 60%. One follow-up, though: Are you sure you will always have 0 or 1 purchases per time period? Or is it also possible for people to buy 2, 3, etc. items? If so, I'd recommend doing Poisson regression instead of logistic regression. Poisson regression is the standard way of predicting quantities of the form "number of times something happens."
