Most commerical products do not protect their schemas. They fall into one of two camps: Either they are making use of an enterprise class database for a key component of the product (such as a payroll system), in which case there is no attempt made to hide the schema/data. In most of these cases the customer needs control over the database anyway - to configure how the database is backed up, to be able to make a clustered environment, etc. The other case is if your "database" is nothing but a small settings or storage file for a desktop application (ex. the history and bookmark databases in FireFox). In that case you should just use an embedded database (like SQLite, same as FireFox) and add a streaming encryption layer (there is an official version of this called SEE), or just use the embedded database and forget about the encryption layer, since the user will need to have to install their own database tools to read the file in the first place.
