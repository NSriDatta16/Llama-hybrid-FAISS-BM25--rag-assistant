I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but Maruku is just a Markdown interpreter. To produce a code block in Markdown , simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input: This is a normal paragraph: This is a code block. Markdown will generate: This is a normal paragraph: This is a code block.
