Just looking around I found the paper, Ramirez et al. (2018) Testing Equality of Multiple Power Spectral Densities, which appears to deal with the problem you are interested in. Also, a good resource for stochastic properties of Fourier transforms and the periodogram is the book by D.R.Brillinger, Time Series. Data Analysis and Theory , HRW, 1979.
