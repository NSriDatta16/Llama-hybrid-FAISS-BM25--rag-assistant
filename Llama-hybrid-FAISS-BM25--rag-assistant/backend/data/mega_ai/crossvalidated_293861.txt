In order to find an optimal separating hyperplane, the norm of the weight vector $||\overline{w}||$ should be minimized, subject to constraints $y_i(\overline{w} \cdot \varphi(x_i) + b) ≥ 1 − \xi_i$, $\xi_i \geqslant 0, i=1,\dots, l$ (see here ). While it's technically possible to minimize $\mathcal{l}^1$-norm $||\overline{w}|| = \sum_i^n |w_i|$ (i.e. to solve linear programming problem) instead of $\mathcal{l}^2$ norm (quadratic problem), the $l^1$-approach has a number of disadvantages over the $l^2$: (a) the solutions for $l^1$-norm minimization problem lack stability, (b) the solution isn't unique, (c) it's harder to provide computationally efficient method for $l^1$-minimization, as compared to $l^2$-minimization. On the other hand, while the solution of $l^1$-minimization problem is more robust to outliers than of the corresponding $l^2$ problem, this doesn't play a great role specifically for SVMs, since there's a very small chance for an outlier to become a support vector.
