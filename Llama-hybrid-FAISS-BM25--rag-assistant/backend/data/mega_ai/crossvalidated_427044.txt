Define $\pi =P(\text{Dis})$ as prevalence, and let $\tau = P(\text{Pos}).$ Also define $\eta = P(\text{Pos}|\text{Dis})$ as sensitivity and $\theta =P(\text{Neg}|\text{No Dis})$ as specificity. Then $\tau = \pi\eta + (1-\pi)\theta.$ And with a little algebra, one obtains $$\pi = \frac{\tau+\theta - 1}{\eta + \theta - 1}.$$ So if $\tau$ is estimated by $t = \frac{\text{Nr. testing Pos}}{\text{Nr. tested}},$ then $\pi$ may be estimated by $$p = \frac{t+\theta - 1}{\eta + \theta - 1}.$$ One can obtain a binomial confidence interval (CI) for $\tau$ and use the second displayed equation to transform endpoints of the CI for $\tau$ to get a CI for $\pi$ (of the tested population). In some cases, the estimate $p$ of prevalence can fall outside of $(0, 1).$ Then one can use a Bayesian approach and perhaps Gibbs sampling to get a useful interval estimate for $p.$
