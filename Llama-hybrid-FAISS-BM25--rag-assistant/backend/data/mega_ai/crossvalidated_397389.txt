Alright, I am going to close this before anyone wastes their time explaining why I was wrong. Just debunked my own theory and did, after all, realize how much simpler it was than I made it out to be. There is a reason for the linear regression to output the slopes that it does, either direction you calculate it. The resulting slope has always taken into consideration the r^2 value, since this is a measure of the percent of variance of each factor that is explained by the other. By my "happy medium" technique, I basically am saying that the r value is this same percent of variance explained, instead of the r^2 value. In a situation where we want to predict the adjusted value of a point in Y if the corresponding point in X was average instead of its current value, then we must take the percent of variance explained (r^2) fully into consideration. Only if we want to assume that each factor is explains the other completely (for whatever conceptual reason) would we then want to divide the slope of the linear regression by the r^2 value before using that calculated result as our regression coefficient in the adjusted mean equation.
