google maps custom control position - BOTTOM_RIGHT not working

I made a custom control in google maps and i'm trying to position it on the BOTTOM_RIGHT corner of the screen. When the page initially loads for the first time it is placed correctly and works fine. However as soon as I drag the map, the control is moved to center of the screen. Any ideas on what might be wrong? Perhaps i could add a listener on dragstart and replace the control every time? Not sure how to do this though... var leyendDiv = document.createElement('DIV'); var leyendControl = new LeyendControl(leyendDiv); leyendDiv.index = 1; map.controls[google.maps.ControlPosition.BOTTOM_RIGHT].push(leyendDiv); any advice is very much appreciate it!
