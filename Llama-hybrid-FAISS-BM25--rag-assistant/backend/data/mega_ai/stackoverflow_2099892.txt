Extracting 1 or more hyperlinks from paragraph text in Javascript using Regular Expression

Sorry to bother you guys again, but here's my dilemma. There must be a "better" regular expression to identify HTML link from a paragraph text (there can be more than 1 html links in the text). How do I extract all the link and anchor it in javascript? My attempt (in javascript) is like this: var urlPattern = "(https?|ftp)://(www\\.)?(((([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.){1,}[a-zA-Z]{2,4}|localhost))|((\\d{1,3}\\.){3}(\\d{1,3})))(:(\\d+))?(/([a-zA-Z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=:@/]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?(\\?([a-zA-Z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=:/?@]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?(#([a-zA-Z0-9._-]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?"; function extractURLs(s) { return s.match(new RegExp(urlPattern)); } //s is of type String //For testing... var text = "Check this video out http://ww w.youtube.com/watch?v=y3U3R3b1dOg or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX6Vm0MoPCY"; alert(extractURLs(text)); (spaces on hyperlink has been deliberately added here to allow posting of question in SO). Result: I only get the 1st hyperlink and not the second one.... Has anybody done something similar or better that I can utilize? Thanks in advance.
