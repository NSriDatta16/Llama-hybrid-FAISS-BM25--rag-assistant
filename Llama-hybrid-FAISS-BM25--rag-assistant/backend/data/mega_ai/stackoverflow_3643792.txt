If you want to use good old urllib instead of newer, fancier urllib2 , then as urllib's docs say, and I quote, For example, applications may want to specify a different User-Agent header than URLopener defines. This can be accomplished with the following code: import urllib class AppURLopener(urllib.FancyURLopener): version = "App/1.7" urllib._urlopener = AppURLopener() Of course, you'll want a version (aka User-Agent header) suitable for whatever version of Firefox (or w/ever else;-) you want to pretend you are;-).
