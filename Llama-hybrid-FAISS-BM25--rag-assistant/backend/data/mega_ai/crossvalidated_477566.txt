Can I apply AdaBoost on Random forest?

I know the Random forest is a bagging technique. But what if my random forest overfits on a dataset, so I reduce the depth of the decision tree and now it underfitting. In this scenario, can I take the underfitted random forest with little depth and try to boost it?
