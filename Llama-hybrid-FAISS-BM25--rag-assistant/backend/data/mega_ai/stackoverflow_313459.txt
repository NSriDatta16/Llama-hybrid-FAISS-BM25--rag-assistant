Consider that a jQuery script downloaded from the google CDN might well already be cached on a visitor's browser, since it has consistent headers and cache control no matter where it is downloaded from. Hence, on average most users will only have to download your site-specific javascript scripts. Also, CDN generally have faster response times than single servers, since they respond from a server nearest to your location. There is no cut and dry answer to your question, as both approaches offer good performance on modern connections. You should profile your system under duress and see what solution offers the best results (and if such optimization is even needed).
