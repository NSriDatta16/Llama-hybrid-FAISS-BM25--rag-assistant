What's the best way to raise an exception in C#?

I traditionally deploy a set of web pages which allow for manual validation of core application functionality. One example is LoggerTest.aspx which generates and logs a test exception. I've always chosen to raise a DivideByZeroException using an approach similar to the following code snippet: try { int zero = 0; int result = 100 / zero; } catch (DivideByZeroException ex) { LogHelper.Error("TEST EXCEPTION", ex); } The code works just fine but I feel like there must be a more elegant solution. Is there a best way to raise an exception in C#?
