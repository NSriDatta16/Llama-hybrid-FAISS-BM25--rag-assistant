Unfortunately, I am late a couple of years, but after reading Ng's lecture notes, I was asking myself the same question. The complementarity conditions you have listed follow from the other KKT conditions, namely: $$ \begin{align} \alpha_i &\geq 0 \tag{1},\\ g_i(w) &\leq 0 \tag{2},\\ \alpha_i g_i(w) &= 0 \tag{3},\\ r_i &\geq 0 \tag{4},\\ \xi_i &\geq 0 \tag{5},\\ r_i \xi_i &= 0 \tag{6}, \end{align} $$ where $$ g_i(w) = - y^{(i)} \left(w^T x^{(i}) + b\right) +1 -\xi_i. $$ Furthermore, from $$ \begin{equation} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \xi_i} \overset{!}{=} 0, \end{equation} $$ we obtain the relation $$ \alpha_i = C - r_i \tag{7}. $$ Now we can distinguish the following cases: $\alpha_i = 0 \implies r_i = C \implies \xi_i = 0$ (from Eq. (7) and (6)), which together with Eq. (2) gives $$ \begin{equation} y^{(i)} \left(w^T x^{(i}) + b\right) \geq 1 \tag{8} \end{equation} $$ $0 0 \implies \xi_i = 0$ via Eq. (3) gives $$ \begin{equation} y^{(i)} \left(w^T x^{(i}) + b\right) = 1 \tag{9} \end{equation} $$ And finally $\alpha_i = C \implies r_i = 0 \implies \xi_i \geq 0$ so that, again, from Eq. (2): $$ \begin{equation} \xi_i \geq 1 - y^{(i)} \left(w^T x^{(i}) + b\right), \end{equation} $$ which we note can only be fulfilled simultaneously with Eq. (5) if $$ \begin{equation} y^{(i)} \left(w^T x^{(i}) + b\right) \leq 1, \tag{10} \end{equation} $$ Note that Eq. (8) does not contribute to the SVM, as it is classified with sufficient confidence ( $\alpha_i = 0$ as for the linearly separable case). For the case $0 , $\xi_i=0$ the points are on the margin, and for $\alpha_i = C$ the points are within the margin (where depending on the value of $\xi_i$ the points are either classified correctly or incorrectly).
