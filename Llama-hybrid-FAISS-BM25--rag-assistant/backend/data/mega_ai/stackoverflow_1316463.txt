VS .NET class designer

Assume that class Being has a property of type Habitat. Both classes are implemented in their own .cs files. When I drag and drop the two classes from the class designer onto a new Class diagram, I do not see an association line from Being to Habitat, whereas there is an association in code. Am I doing something wrong, or this simply isn't implemented in VS yet?
