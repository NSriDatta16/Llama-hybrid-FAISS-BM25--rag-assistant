Can a small sample size with applied machine learning provide higher accuracy than the sample size alone?

Say I have 4000 apples and I want to know the percentage of apples that are red and the percentage that are green. Using only a sample, I could randomly pick and classify ~351 apples to report with a 95% confidence level and a 5% confidence interval what the percentage is. My question is, if I build a highly accurate machine learning model on a sample size of ~100 apples (let's say it's over 99% accurate), then apply it to the remaining ~3900, could that give me a better estimation of the total population of 4000 apples?
