I would modify what Peter said slightly. JRuby may use more memory compared to standard Ruby, but that's usually because you're doing the work in a single process what would take several processes with Ruby. You should try the Rails.threadsafe! option with a single JRuby runtime (for example, the Trinidad gem with the --threadsafe option). We've heard several stories where it gives you great performance and low memory usage, while leveraging multiple CPU cores with a single process.
