jQuery.post() issues with passing data to jQuery UI

I am trying to get jQuery.post() to run my php script and then open a jQuery UI dialog with the data that php script returns. Its supposed to come back as a form with a table and a textarea in it. It works great with alert(data); and i get a pop-up with all my data. The problem starts if i turn off alert() . Now it opens 2 dialogs. One containing only the table, without textarea, and the second one absolutely empty. What am i doing wrong here? How come all my data shows up in the alert() , but not in dialog? What do i need to do to fix it? Oh, and do i need to also include $.ajax() before the $.post() ? Thank you. $.post("/path/to/script.php", { id: this.id, value: value }, function(data){ // THIS WORKS //alert(data); // THIS DOES NOT WORK $(data).dialog({ autoOpen: true, width: 400, modal: true, position: 'center', resizable: false, draggable: true, title: 'Pending Changes' }); } );
