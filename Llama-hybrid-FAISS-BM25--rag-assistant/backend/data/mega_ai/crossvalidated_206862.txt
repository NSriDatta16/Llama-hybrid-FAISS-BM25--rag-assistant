How to handle over-prediction in Random-Forest

I have a regression Random Forest model (generated using H2O and R). After tuning and building the model, I plot the predicted value vs. the labeled value of both the train and test datasets. In a model with zero errors I'd expect it to align with the 45-deg line. In my plot a get a line which is paralleled to the 45-deg line, but not aligned to it. From the plot I concluded that the model pick up the general trend, the slope, correctly, but it's biased in terms of absolute values. I'm a little confused on how to address it. I tried both parameter tuning and enlarging the train dataset, but in vain. Does anyone know how to solve it? Thanks!
