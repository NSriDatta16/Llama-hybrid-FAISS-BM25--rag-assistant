Weak IV test- one endogenous regressor and two IVs

I wanted to know what would be the relevant weak IV tests among the following in case of one endogenous regressor and 2 IVs. i) Comparing Cragg-Donald F-statistic to Stock-Yogo table ii) Kleibergen-Paap statictic (should it be compared to Stock-Yogo table?) iii) CLR test iv) Montiel-Plueger test v) Hahn & Hausman forward-reverse TSLS estimators It would be really helpful if someone could point out the appropriate method. Please also suggest if any other tests are applicable. Thank you.
