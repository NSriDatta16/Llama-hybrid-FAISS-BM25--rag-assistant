This could indicate one of two things. Either your model is overfitting to the test data, or your features fully explain your target variable. The only way to be sure would be if you had (or could obtain) another independently collected dataset and use that to test your model. If that's not practical, then use your data exploration results to investigate further. Are there predictor variables that are very highly correlated with the target? Do you get perfect results if you create another type of model, such as a logistic regression?
