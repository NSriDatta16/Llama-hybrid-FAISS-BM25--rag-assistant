Estimating remaining video recording time

I am developing a piece of software that records video from a live source to WMV files (using WMV1 compression). I am attempting to provide a rough estimate of the recording time remaining, based on the space left on the storage hard drive. I cannot simply base the output file size on the bit-rate of the codec, unfortunately, since the video compression means that the output size varies wildly according to the complexity of the image. Any thoughts? FYI I am using C# and DirectShow.
