From the documentation you can read that see ?svm (or here ): The probability model for classification fits a logistic distribution using maximum likelihood to the decision values of all binary classifiers, and computes the a-posteriori class probabilities for the multi-class problem using quadratic optimization. The probabilistic regression model assumes (zero-mean) laplace-distributed errors for the predictions, and estimates the scale parameter using maximum likelihood. Some more information can be found in libsvm documentation that svm function uses, and in JSS article Support Vector Machines in R .
