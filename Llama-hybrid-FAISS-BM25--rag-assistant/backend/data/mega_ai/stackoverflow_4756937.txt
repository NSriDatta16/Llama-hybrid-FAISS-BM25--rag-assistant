Prefer one class in libsvm (python)

I just started playing a bit with libsvm in python and got some simple classification to work. The problem is that I'm constructing a face detection system, and I want a very low false rejection rate . The svm on the other hand seems to optimize for equal false rejection and false acceptance. What options do I have here? And as a said earlier, I'm very new to libsvm, so be kind. ;)
