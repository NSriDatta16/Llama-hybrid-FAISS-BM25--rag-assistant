There is no "trick" behind the use of an offset term ( * ), while the other coefficients will be estimated, that is, their values will be updated at each step of the IRLS ( * ) fitting algorithm, the offset coefficient will not be updated, it will keep its value of 1. ( * ) IRLS is iteratively reweighted least squares, the fitting algorithm usually used for generalized linear models such as logistic regression. For an overview, see Can you give a simple intuitive explanation of IRLS method to find the MLE of a GLM? The offset term is included with a term offset(x1) in the model formula, or via the use of a separate offset= argument. The first way is the preferred one. This will force the coefficient of x1 to be one.
