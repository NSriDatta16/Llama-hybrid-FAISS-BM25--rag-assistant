How to check linearity in binary logistic regression with many covariates having 0 as a value

I'm trying to check linearity in my binary logistic regression. According to my handbook ( Discovering Statistics Using SPSS , by Andy Fields: ch.19.8.1) this should be done by adding var*log(var) to the model and check for significance. Many of my covariates however are binary variables which can be 0 or 1. Doing log(0) doesn't give an outcome which results in a lot of missing values when recoding the data. Now only 8% of my variables is used in the regression and I don't get the desired results. How do I do this check on my data where lots of values are 0?
