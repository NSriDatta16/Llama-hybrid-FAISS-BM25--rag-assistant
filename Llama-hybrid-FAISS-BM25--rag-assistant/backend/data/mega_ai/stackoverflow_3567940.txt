I am thinking I could have a filler variable that I just fill with the current item regardless of condition and use that within the scope Usually I do this and I do not know a better way. Thus, your code would be: ... default { $filler = $_ :CurrentSwitch switch ($currentArg) { "Organizational Unit" { use $filler in here } "Compare To" { use $filler in here } } }
