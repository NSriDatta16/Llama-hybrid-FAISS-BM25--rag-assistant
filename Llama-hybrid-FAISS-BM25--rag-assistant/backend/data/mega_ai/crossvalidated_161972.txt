You could always come up with a set of transformed variables that aggregate the data from 3 months into one observation for each patient (e.g., average blood pressure across the prior 3 months, 3-month exercise hours/cigarette, etc.). Then you have independent observations (1 per patient), and you could build the model. This kind of defeats the purpose of having monthly granularity, but you could evaluate a logistic regression like this against a legitimate longitudinal method.
