Technological measures are generally ineffective at solving these sorts of social problems. Manual moderation is pretty much the only really big useful thing you can do. Successful sites of this nature tend to leverage the community to help with the task of moderation, by recruiting volunteer moderators from the more devoted regulars and/or providing post voting / flagging mechanisms (e.g. Stack Overflow).
