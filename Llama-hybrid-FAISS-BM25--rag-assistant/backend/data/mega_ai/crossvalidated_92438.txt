SVM without offset

I would like to know if the linear-SVM-without-offset solver: $$\min \frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2+C\sum_{i=1}^m \xi_i, \quad \mbox{s.t.}\quad y_iw^\top x_i \geq 1-\xi_i, \quad \xi_i\geq 0 \quad \forall i=1,\ldots,m.$$ can be applied to classify linearly separable data, where the hyperplane does not pass through the origin. Maybe a change of coordinate system would help?
