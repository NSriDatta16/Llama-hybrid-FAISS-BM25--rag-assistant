If two forms in a view, how to pass both sets of params when one is submitted?

I have a view with two forms. A main form to create a new contact and another form to add a new folder (for organization). Is it possible to get params for both forms to be set when one of the forms is submitted? Say, if a new folder is created I'd like to return to the view with any filled out contact information still there (or the other way around if the main form has errors). Thanks!
