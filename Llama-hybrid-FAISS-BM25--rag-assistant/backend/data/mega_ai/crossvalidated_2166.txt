I'm not aware that anyone is doing this, but I generally like to try dimensionality reduction when I have a problem like this. You might look into a method from manifold learning or non-linear dimensionality reduction . An example would be a Kohonen map . A good reference for R is "Self- and Super-organizing Maps in R: The kohonen Package" .
