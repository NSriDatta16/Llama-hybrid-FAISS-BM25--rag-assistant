Thanks Bruno, So, am I mistaken in thinking that the EventLog instance in the Log method is different from the EventLog instance in the same method call in a different thread? Or am I just getting confused about object instances inside a static method? OK, so I have several wrapper methods to the Log(...) method. If I moved the Log method into a singleton class, changed the wrappers (LogEmail, LogXxxx, LogYyy etc then I could keep my Log.Zzzz interfaces the same, but leverage the security of the singleton LogSingleton.Instance.Log(...) from the current Logs. OR because I want to write to different logs, would each one require its own LogSingletonXxx? You can tell I'm confused :) Yes - I'd really appreciate some synchronisation code :) Nij
