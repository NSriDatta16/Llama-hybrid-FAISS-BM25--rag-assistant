You are making the problem much harder than needed. A necessary condition that the process ${X_t}$ be stationary is that $X_t$ must have the same distribution as $X_{t-1}$. In particular, $X_t$ must have the same mean and variance as $X_{t-1}$. Now, in order for $E[X_t] = E[X_{t-1}]$ to hold, it must be that $$E[X_t] = aE[X_{t-1}] + E[Z_t] = aE[X_{t-1}] \implies E[X_t] = 0 ~\forall t.$$ Similarly, in order for $\operatorname{var}(X_t) = \operatorname{var}(X_{t-1})$ to hold, it must be that $$\operatorname{var}(X_t) = a^2 \operatorname{var}(X_{t-1}) + \operatorname{var}(Z_t) = a^2 \operatorname{var}(X_t) + \sigma^2 \implies \operatorname{var}(X_t) = \frac{\sigma^2}{1-a^2}.$$ Now, the distribution of $X_t$ is the convolution of the distributions of $aX_{t-1}$ and $Z_t$, and if $X_{t-1}$ and $Z_t$ are (independent) normal random variables, so is $X_t$ a normal random variable. With regard to strict stationarity when the $X$'s and $Z$'s are normal random variables, see the last two paragraphs of this answer of mine over on dsp.SE.
