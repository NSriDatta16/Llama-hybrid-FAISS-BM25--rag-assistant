You should never concatenate strings to build SQL queries for SQLite - or for any other SQL DB if possible. It makes your code fragile and opens up potential entry points for injection attacks. The proper way to do it is to use hosted parameters . This approach removes the need for cumbersome string filtering. I am not sure how to do that in C# for SQLite but any decent language binding for SQLite should allow you to use hosted parameters.
