right now most viable competitor of GAE is Windows Azure. You can easily build a site/application in Azure without getting dependent on Azure framework. There is /very/ little from Azure APIs that you have to deal with(mostly for diagnostics). If you decide to use other Azure services, like table storage services, you'll want to get real good at abstracting yourself away from the table storage to make your code portable. Dealing with SQL Azure (at least from utilization perspective) is no different then using SQL Server and you would need to make a simple abstraction from actual rdbms implementation (most data access libraries do that anyway) to later utilize MySQL or Oracle, etc.
