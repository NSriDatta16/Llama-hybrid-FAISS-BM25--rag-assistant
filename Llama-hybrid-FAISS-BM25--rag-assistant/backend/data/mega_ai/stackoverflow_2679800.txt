This is my suggestion, you can use this jquery multiupload file to ease of to multi uploading file plus better interface rather than to organize multi input boxes. you can use this is image resizer to dynamically resize your picture rather than to create another file, it will cache your picture then some sort of up a little bit perfomance. Just go to the site and only download 1 image.php file. There will be example that you can test and play of. For the caption, suggest that you will make something like display all file list and multi update at once, sorry i don't really have much time for doing it myself but this is what I will do many times.
