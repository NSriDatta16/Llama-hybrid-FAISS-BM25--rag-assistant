create the class by hand in the linq2sql builder, so the class is generated as part of the linq2sql data context. name the class Department, add each of the 4 properties with the names you want. in each of the properties' properties, you need to set the type (the .net type), and the Server data type (varchar(100), int) and the source (the name of the field returned by the sproc.) once that's done, drag the sproc from server explorer onto that class, and the method for the sproc will return a result as a collection of that type.
