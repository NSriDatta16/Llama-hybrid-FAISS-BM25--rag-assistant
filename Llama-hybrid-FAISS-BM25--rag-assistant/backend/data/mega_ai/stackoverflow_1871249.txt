Resolving variables inside a Coldfusion string

My client has a database table of email bodies that get sent at certain times to customers. The text for the emails contains ColdFusion expressions like Dear #firstName# and so on. These emails are HTML - they also contain all sorts of HTML mark-up. What I'd like to do is read that text from the database into a string and then have ColdFusion Evaluate() that string to resolve the variables. When I do that, Evaluate() throws an exception because it doesn't like the HTML markup in there (I also tried filtering the string through HTMLEditFormat() as an intermediate step for grins but it didn't like the entities in there). My predecessor solved this problem by writing the email text out to a file and then cfincluding that. It works. It's seems really hacky though. Is there a more elegant way to handle this using something like Evaluate that I'm not seeing?
