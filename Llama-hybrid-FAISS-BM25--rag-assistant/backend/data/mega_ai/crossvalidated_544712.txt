The unsatisfying answer is "It depends who you ask." "Sigmoid", if you break it into parts, just means "S-shaped". The logistic sigmoid function is so prevalent that people tend to gloss over the word "logistic". For machine learning folks, it's become the exemplar of the class, and most call it the sigmoid function. (Is it myopia to call it the sigmoid function?) Still, there are other communities that use S-shaped functions.
