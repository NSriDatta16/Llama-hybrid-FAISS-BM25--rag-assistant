How to return a value from a pop up window

I am using asp.net webforms 2.0, c#. What I need is a simple, elegant way to do the following: User clicks an element in webform A; Webform B pops up; User interracts with webform B; On closing webform B, probably by a submit button, the source element in webform a a is updated with a value from webform B. What technologies would be involved here? Aside from Javascript and c#, of course. Can I do it without Ajax? EDITED: To clarify, WEBform B will save the data entered into the database, say customer information, then it will come back with the customer ID (after saving), this customer ID needs to be passed to the parent window, which should refresh after this.
