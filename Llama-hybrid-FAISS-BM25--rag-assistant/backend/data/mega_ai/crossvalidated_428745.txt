How could one estimate $Y = X\beta \times \epsilon$ with $\epsilon \sim \text{Beta}(a,b)$?

Suppose the data generating process is $$Y_i=f(X_i)M_i.$$ where $M_i$ ~ $Beta(a,b)$ and $f$ linear, for example, $f(X_i)=\alpha_0+\alpha_1X_i$ . This is equivalent to $$M_i=Y_i/f(X_i).$$ I'm trying to think of someway to estimate $a,b$ and the $\alpha'$ s. Do you have any suggestion? I don't know if I have to go through Bayesian estimation. Thanks in advance!
