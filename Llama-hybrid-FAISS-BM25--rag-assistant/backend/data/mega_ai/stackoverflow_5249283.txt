Your question is already answered in the blog post you linked to. See the last paragraph. As usual IE is the odd browser which requires a special case. IE doesn't like deleting native properties off of DOM nodes. Fortunately this doesn't matter, since IE allows one to reuse script tags. Just change the SRC property and it will fetch the new page immediately. Thus one only needs a single script tag in IE. The code provided works in all browsers except IE, and in IE it's not an issue since you can just change the src property of the script tag and it will refire. So your code (for IE only) would just be: var script = document.getElementById('JSONP'); if (!script) { [create it once] } script.src = URL + (uuid ++);
