Creating class labels for custom DataSets efficiently (HuggingFace)

I have pandas dataframes - test & train,they both have text and label as columns as shown below - label text fear ignition problems will appear joy enjoying the ride As usual, to run any Transformers model from the HuggingFace, I am converting these dataframes into Dataset class, and creating the classLabels (fear=0, joy=1) like this - from datasets import DatasetDict traindts = Dataset.from_pandas(traindf) traindts = traindts.class_encode_column("label") testdts = Dataset.from_pandas(testdf) testdts = testdts.class_encode_column("label") Finally these Datasets are put into DatasetDict like this- emotions = DatasetDict({ "train" : traindts , "test" : testdts }) Everything works well but as you see that the way I am doing it can be definitely improved. How can it be done more efficiently in less number of lines ?
