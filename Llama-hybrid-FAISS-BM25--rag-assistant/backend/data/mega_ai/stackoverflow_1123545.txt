take a look at this blog entry . There you can see the applet tag which is generated by the javascript. Though it uses JNLP and not the old-fashioned applet style. Does this help? By the way, why don't you want to use the JS? EDIT: See this article http://blogs.oracle.com/mobility_techtips/entry/how_to_develop_and_run about how to run applets in a closed intranet. As you will see its not very convenient, and comments show that people are not really happy with it. But it should work.
