Nobody mentionned that you must use this if the requirement is to make a StyleCop compliant code and do not violate the readability rule SA1101. According to the documentation, A violation of this rule occurs whenever the code contains a call to an instance member of the local class or a base class which is not prefixed with ‘this.’. Also, in my opinion, using this keyword must be encouraged even for non-StyleCop-compliant source code, since specifying this increases readability and reduces the risk of mixing between local (method-scope) and class (object-scope) variables.
