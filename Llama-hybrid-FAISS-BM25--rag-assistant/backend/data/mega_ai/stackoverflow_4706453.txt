Same result anyhow since if window.localStorage is undefined you will both get false . And if window.localStorage is null you will both get false because undefined == null . However, I prefer using !! just because it's the fastest way to convert to a boolean and how useful is localStorage if it's false, null, undefined, '', NaN or 0? return !!window.localStorage; Edit One caveat, they are not exactly the same since if you set window.localStorage to undefined the first would report it as true
