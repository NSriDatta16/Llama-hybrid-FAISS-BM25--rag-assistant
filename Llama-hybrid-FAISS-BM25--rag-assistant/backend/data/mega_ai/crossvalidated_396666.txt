Central limit theorem and statistical uncertainities

I am unable to understand the statement that the statistical uncertainties associated with measured data are have to be gaussian distributed because of the CLT theorem. What I know about CLT is that if we generate a sampling distribution of sample size n, and plot the mean or the average value of all the samples, then this distribution approaches gaussian distribution as sample size increases. But from this, how could we comment on the uncertainties associated with our measured values?
