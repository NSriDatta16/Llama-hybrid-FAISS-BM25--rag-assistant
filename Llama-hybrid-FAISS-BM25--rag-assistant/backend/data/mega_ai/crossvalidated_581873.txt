Bayesian SEM: Selecting (Weakly) Informative Prior

I am looking for recommendations regarding how to select informative (or minimally weakly informative) priors for a Bayesian SEM model? I have no specific predictions with regards to my model / individual parameters. I am running my models in r using the 'blavaan' package. Alternatively, if I rely on the default priors will this bias my results? Dr. Merkle's website has been extremely helpful in understanding how to specify priors https://ecmerkle.github.io/blavaan/articles/prior.html - I am just unclear on how to select meaningful priors for my specific parameters. Thank you very much.
