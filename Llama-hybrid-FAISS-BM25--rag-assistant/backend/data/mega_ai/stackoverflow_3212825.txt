Conversion VB -> C #. Regular expression to modify ("abc") in ["abc"]

We are currently converting our old base VB.Net to C #. Converting the bulk of the code is not a problem .. there are good converters around. The problem we are facing is that none of the tested converters can convert () in [] in arrays and collections. Example: Session ("abcd") to Session ["abcd"];. Converters think Session is a method/function and leave with the parenthesis. My question is: is there any regular expression that can be used in find/replace in Visual Studio 2008 that can make this substitution? Why do it manually to get tired when you have to do it over 200 times per class. Thank you for attention
