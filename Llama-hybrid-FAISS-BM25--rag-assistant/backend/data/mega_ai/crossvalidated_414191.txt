strucchange::breakpoints giving implausible results

I'm trying to detect the breakpoints in Facebook's stock price with strucchange::breakpoints . library(quantmod) library(ggplot2) library(strucchange) FB $FB.Adjusted bp breakpoints] ggplot(data = Y, aes(x = index(Y), y = Y)) + geom_line(color="#3078EA") + stat_smooth(color = "#3F5A93", method = "loess") + ylab("Facebook's adjusted close price") + xlab("Time") + geom_vline(xintercept=bp, linetype=2) The result is Major breakpoints such as 2018-03-17 and 2018-07-25 are undetected. Instead, I got four seemingly insignificant breakpoints: 2013-08-22, 2014-09-15, 2015-10-22, and 2017-04-21. How do I locate the shocks? As a side note, this is for my Bayesian final project, so if you have alternative Bayesian methods for detecting structural breaks in your mind, feel free to share them with me.
