Help with Strange Python scraping error. HTTPError with one machine while it works on others

I am using a proxy and following is the code. 20 req = urllib2.Request(url) 21 # run the request for each proxy 22 # now set the proxy 23 req.set_proxy(proxy, "http") 24 req.add_header('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3') 25 req.add_header('Referer', 'http://www.google.com/') 26 # time it 27 start = time.time() 28 # try to open the URL 29 30 time.sleep(maxwait*random.random()) 31 #response = urllib2.urlopen(req) 32 opener = urllib2.build_opener() 33 response = opener.open(req).read() Works fine on one machine (with eclipse and Firefox directly) but fails while running it at the terminal on another machine (different IP) with the following error. urllib2.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden Any leads? Thanks guys!
