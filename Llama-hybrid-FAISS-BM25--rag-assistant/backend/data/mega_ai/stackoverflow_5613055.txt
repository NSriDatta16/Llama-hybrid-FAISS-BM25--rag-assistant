I have the same problem on a HTC Incredible and sadly DJC's answer didn't work for me. Both the EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI and INTERNAL_CONTENT_URI didn't give me any images. After some digging I found that by using the following content URI, it did seem to work on the HTC Incredible. Uri contenturi = Images.Media.getContentUri("phoneStorage");
