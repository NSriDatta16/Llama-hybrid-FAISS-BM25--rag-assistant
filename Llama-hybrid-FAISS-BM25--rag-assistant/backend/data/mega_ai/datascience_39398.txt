Best way to build a wave classification system

I want to make a classifier for waves such as following: Above image is from: http://www.invisiblesbook.com/equal-temperament-tuning/ I believe, I will have to extract features from raw input using FFT or some other method and subject that to a CNN. What is the best way to go about building classifier for such waves? I am not particularly asking about neural-networks; any other method which is accurate and fast will also be of help.
