Don't use captcha until you have to. Most sites are not important enough to waste people's time and and attention jumping through hoops. This particularly applies if you are trying to sell something, rather than providing a free service. Just making your form non-standard is enough. Unless you're important enough to attract someone to write code specific to your site, you can block every generic spammer by including a field labelled "please type the word orange". If you're big enough to be targeted, start implementing behavioral spam detection, hidden fields and so on. If you're overwhelmed, the bring out the captcha ; possibly even temporarily. Your hot dog stand contact page does not deserve to waste people's time......
