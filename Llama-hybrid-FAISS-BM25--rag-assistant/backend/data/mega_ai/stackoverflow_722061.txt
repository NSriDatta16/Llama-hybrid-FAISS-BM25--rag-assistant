Which metrics are most useful in an ASP .Net build server?

I'm just wondering what metrics people measure on a build server. I'm setting up a build server for a series of asp .net 2.0 projects. On the server I'm currently measuring: Unit test code coverage. Build and test run time. LOC (just out of idle curiosity). Cyclomatic complexity. Some FxCop rules. What do you measure and how do you measure it?
