Normal Distribution (Solution explanation)

The average temperature of a particular tropical island is normally distributed with a mean of 74 degrees and a variance of 9 degrees (a) If a random sample of 16 days has been taken, what is the probability that at least 12 of them will have temperatures higher than 70 degrees? Method: (70-74)/3 : Gives us probability of 0.91 approximately. Found np = 14.56 and S.D = 1.144 My doubt is in the final formula what will I replace 74 with?
