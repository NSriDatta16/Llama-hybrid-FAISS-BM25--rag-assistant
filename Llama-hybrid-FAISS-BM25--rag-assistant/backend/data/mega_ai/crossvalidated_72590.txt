BIC vs. Out of sample performance

I have two statistical models. Model 1 uses a GLM approach while model 2 uses a time series approach for fitting. I want to compare these two models. Model 1 (i.e. GLM) has a better out of sample performance. Model 2 has a better BIC criteria. So based on out of sample performance, I should pick up model 1 and based on BIC I should pick up model 2 as the preferred model. I should add that in this context and for the question I am trying to answer, Both the BIC and out of sample performance are important. The question is how to choose the best model in this case? Should I consider other criteria? Please let me know if you know any good reference with similar cases.
