CLLocationManager ensure best accuracy for iphone

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to obtain the best horizontal accuracy on the location manager? I have set the desired accuracy to NearestTenMeters, but given that the accuracy can always change depending on coverage area, how can I write some code in the locationManager to stop updating only after I get the best horizontal accuracy?
