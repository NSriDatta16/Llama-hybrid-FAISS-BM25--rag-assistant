Both MCMC methods and network analysis play an important role in data science. I think you should go for the project you like more. However, in my experience, community detection in networks is a niche (applied math/graph theory) of network analysis, while MCMC methods involve lots of statistical and computational concepts. Personally, being a statistician, I would go for the MCMC methods.
