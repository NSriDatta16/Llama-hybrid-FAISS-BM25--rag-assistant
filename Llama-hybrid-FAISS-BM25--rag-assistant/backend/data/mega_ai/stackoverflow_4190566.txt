Embed V8 in OpenCL application?

I am using OpenCL to write GPGPU kernels which target the NVidia CUDA runtime. I was recently reading up on V8 and found the page describing V8 embedding techniques: http://code.google.com/apis/v8/embed.html Is it possible to 'wrap' all the OpenCL functions in V8 'templates' so that I can write kernel logic in JavaScript? For reference, links to the OpenCL 1.1 C++ bindings are on the Khronos web site. My main concern is that OpenCL relies heavily on OpenGL. Would a V8 OpenCL wrapper entail wrapping large portions of OpenGL (or prohibitively, the closed-source CUDA runtime) as well? Or is it simply impossible to reconcile the V8 virtual machine and CUDA runtimes?
