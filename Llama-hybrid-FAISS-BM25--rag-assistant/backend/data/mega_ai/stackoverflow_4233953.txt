It is probably a very small concern to have logging code in your application that does not "run". The overhead of the "null" logger or conditionals is likely to be very small in the scheme of things. The strings will incur memory overhead which could be worrying for a constrained device, but as it is WP7 the minimum specs are not that constrained in reality. I understand that logging code looks fugly though. :) If you really want to strip that logging code out... In .Net you can use the ConditionalAttribute to mark methods for conditional compilation. You could leverage this feature to ensure that all logging calls are removed from compilation for specified build configurations. As long as methods that you have decorated with the conditional attributes follows a few rules, the compiler will literally strip the call chain out. However, if you wanted to use this approach then you would have to forgo your interface design as the conditional attribute cannot be applied to interface members, and you cannot implement interfaces with conditional members.
