Why aren't unsigned OpenMP index variables allowed?

I have a loop in my C++/OpenMP code that looks like this: #pragma omp parallel for for(unsigned int i=0; i When I compile it (with Visual Studio 2005) I get the following error: error C3016: 'i' : index variable in OpenMP 'for' statement must have signed integral type I understand that the error occurs because i is unsigned instead of signed, and changing i to be signed removed this error. What I want to know is why is this an error? Why aren't unsigned index variables allowed? Looking at the MSDN page for this error gives me no clues.
