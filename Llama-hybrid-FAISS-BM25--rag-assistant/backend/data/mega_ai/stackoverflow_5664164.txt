Take a look at the userData behavior at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424%28v=vs.85%29.aspx It doesn't provide as much flexibility as the DOM storage mechanism defined by the HTML 5 specification, but should be sufficient for most operations. As a caveat, for security reasons, I don't recommend making use of this on anything beyond intranet sites or applications. Cheers!
