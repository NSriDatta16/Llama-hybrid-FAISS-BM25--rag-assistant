How to plot ROC for LOOCV by hand based on output probabilities returned by SVM?

I want to plot ROC for Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation (CV). I have the decision values as well as probability values for each class from SVM classifier. I did see the answer to this post ; however, the answer was not complete about plotting ROC according to probabilities. As an example the output of my classifier for one sample is like this: c1a 1 attr(,"decision.values") 1/0 c1a 0.1338180 attr(,"probabilities") 1 0 c1a 0.6824716 0.3175284 Levels: 0 1
