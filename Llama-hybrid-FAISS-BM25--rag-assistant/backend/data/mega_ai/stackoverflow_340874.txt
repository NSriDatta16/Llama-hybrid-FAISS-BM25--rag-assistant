Anything that goes through versions (documents, code, presentations, ads, images...) can all benefit from version control. If there is more that one person using/editing the piece, then you definitely need version control.

Thanks to this post from Rands in Repose ("Dumbing Down the Cloud[sic]"), I've looked into dropbox which is free online storage with version history tracking, rollback and sharing. For someone like my wife, a professor working with coworkers on papers across the country, this is a huge step forward in their work flow.
