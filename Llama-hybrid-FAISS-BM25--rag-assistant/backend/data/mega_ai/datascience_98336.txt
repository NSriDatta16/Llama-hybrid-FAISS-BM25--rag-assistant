I don't think you can compress time series because there is a risk of losing valuable data. Rather than that, you can set a the max size as the default size, and set zeros to the left for smaller data. If the sampling is too high (ex: milli seconds), do not hesitate to reduce it for all data (ex: seconds) taking the average values, as long as the prediction objectives allows it. Furthermore, the further you want to predict, the worst the prediction generally is: that's why a lower sampling rate could be useful. RNN and LSTM are also good solutions, in addition to ARIMA. However, they are quite sensitive to noise: if your signals are quite noisy, try to reduce the noise to have good predictions. Keep in mind that time series prediction with NN is not an exact science: you may have to apply many modifications and improvements on your data to reach very good results. Here is a notebook that could be useful: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/15_processing_sequences_using_rnns_and_cnns.ipynb
