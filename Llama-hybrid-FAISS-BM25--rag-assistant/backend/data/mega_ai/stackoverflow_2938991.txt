Generally, all numeric quantities and measures are columns in the fact table(s). Then everything else is a dimensional attribute. Which dimension they belong in is rather pragmatic and depends on the data. In addition to the suggestions you have already received, I saw no mention of degenerate dimensions. In these cases, things like an invoice number or sequence number timestamp which is different for every fact needs to be stored in the fact, otherwise the dimension table will become 1-1 with the fact table. A key design decision in your case is probably the analysis of data related to age if the study is ongoing. Because people's ages change with time, they will move to another age group at some point. Depending on whether the groups are fixed at the beginning of a study or not, this may determine how you want to aggregate. I'm not necessarily saying you should have a group dimension and get to age through that, but that you may need to determine the correct age/demographic dimension during the ETL. But this depends on the end use (or accommodate both with two dimension roles linked from the fact table - initial demographics, which never changes, and current demographics which will change with time). A similar thing could apply with geography. Although you can obviously track a person's geography by analysing current geography changes over time, the point of a dimensional DW is to have all the relevant dimensions linked straight to the fact (things which you might normally derive in a normalized model through the network of an Entity-Relationship model - these get locked in at the time of ETL). This redundancy makes analysis quicker on the dimensional model in traditional RDBMSes. Note that a lot of this does not apply in massively parallel DW like Teradata, which don't perform well with star schemas - they like all the data normalized and linked up to the same primary index because they the primary index to distribute the data over the processing units.
