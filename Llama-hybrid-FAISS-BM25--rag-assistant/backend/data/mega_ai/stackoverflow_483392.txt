There's a good chance it's not what you're looking for since it's an entire IDE, but Netbeans has some really neat Ruby testing support: http://www.netbeans.org/features/ruby/index.html The built-in testing framework in Ruby, Test::Unit, is supported directly. You can create new unit tests from the New menu. You run your unit tests by just invoking Run File (Shift-F6) on files. This opens a test results window with the output from executing the unit tests and test result statistics. Double-clicking the nodes in the statistics panel takes you to the corresponding declaration location in the editor, and you can navigate to the next/previous failure using the arrow buttons. alt text http://wiki.netbeans.org/attach/RubyTesting/testrunner-1%20.png You also get test coverage (it will color code your files as well so you can immediately see what what lines are tested and what aren't): alt text http://blogs.sun.com/tor/resource/ruby-coveragereport.png
