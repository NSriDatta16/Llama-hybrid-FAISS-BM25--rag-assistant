To get you started, here are some important things when switching to a enterprise grade networked DB -- from a global-lock embedded in-process db: You need to know about connections failing when doing networked programming, and how to handle such exceptions elegantly. You need to know about connection pooling. you need to know about transactions, since there is no global lock in a enterprise grade enterprise system. You need to know about isolation levels which depend on the type of guarantees a database can give you. You need to learn about SQL extensions -- such as those made by the T-SQL language. These extensions allow you to program complex logic easily.
