There are two official resources: JPA JavaDoc: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/index.html?javax/persistence/package-summary.html . Look at the section "Annotation Types Summary". It lists all annotations which are part of the JPA API, as well as some description. JPA JSR documentation. http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr220/ . This is the official specification for the JPA. The reading may be boring, but it's the best official resource for it. I believe that every programmer should read JSR's, specially the JPA, when it's part of their daily jobs. But I also like to look at the Hibernate test suite. Even though it's not "official JPA" documentation, it provides a big set of use cases, which almost always matches our regular use cases. I'd say that if you are familiar with the javadoc, the JSR and comfortable in taking references from the Hibernate test suite, you are prepared to deal with edge cases.
