Short answer: this should be no problem. I'm pretty sure you'll have somewhat lower power than if you had a perfectly balanced design, but there is no fundamental difficulty. Here's an example where I subsample the (complete/balanced) sleepstudy data set and show that it works fine (and the results don't change very much). The only specific issue that I can think of is that if you are fitting a model with autoregressive structure (e.g. in lme with the correlation argument), you'll have to switch from an "AR1" specification to a "continuous AR" or "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck" or "exponential correlation" specification (in lme from corAR1 to corCAR : in glmmTMB from ar() to ou() ). This analysis of carbon exchange in tundra ecosystems shows an example of mixed models applied to an unevenly sampled time series. subsample data set library(lme4) set.seed(101) table(sleepstudy $Subject) ss Subject), function(x) { x[sort(sample(1:10, size=rbinom(1,size=10,prob=0.7), replace=FALSE)),] })) lapply(split(ss,ss $Subject), function(x) x$ Days) fit unbalanced/subsampled data set lmer(Reaction~Days+(Days|Subject), data=ss) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] ## Formula: Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject) ## Data: ss ## REML criterion at convergence: 1130.586 ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Std.Dev.
