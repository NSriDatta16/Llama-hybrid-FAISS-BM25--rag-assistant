Your pseudocode is almost valid C++0x code â€” but C++0x requires less! map theMap = { {2, 5}, {79, 12958 } }; assert ( theMap[ 2 ] == 5 ); In "normal" C++, you have to initialize the map like this, still quite elegant: pair map_array[2] = { make_pair(2, 5), make_pair(79, 12958) }; map theMap( &map_array[0], &map_array[2] ); // sorts the array assert ( theMap[ 2 ] == 5 ); This is fast to write and fast to run! Edit: Just don't make the map a global variable. (Although that is safe in C++0x.) If you do, it will only be initialized properly if the compiler chooses to initialize it after map_array, which is VERY not guaranteed. If you want to to be a global, initialize it with theMap.assign( &map_array[0], &map_array[2] ); .
