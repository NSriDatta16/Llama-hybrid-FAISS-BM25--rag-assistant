Why do classification trees tend to perform better on large data sets and logistic regression on smaller ones?

Is this simply because if we have a lot of data, there is a bigger chance that a more complicated decision boundary (boundaries) is required to separate the observations? Does someone know researches who published papers about the performance of these techniques depending on the data size?
