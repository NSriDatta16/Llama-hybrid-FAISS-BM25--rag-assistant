I care about the precision of a few of the classes, how would I write a custom XGBoost objective function?

I'm using XGBoost on a dataset with 3 classes. However, I primarily care about the precision of 2 of the classes. It should also have decent recall, otherwise the algorithm might classify everything as the 3rd class. How would I write a custom objective function for this? I'm not too familiar with gradients and Hessian.
