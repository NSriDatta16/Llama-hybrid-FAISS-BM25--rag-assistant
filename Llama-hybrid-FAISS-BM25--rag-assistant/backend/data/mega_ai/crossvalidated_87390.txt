I don't see any issues with how you coded your mixture model. That said, you could make your life a lot easier (and possibly speed up your code) by using the built-in functions for those pdfs from the statistics toolbox: f = @(x,lambda,a,b,t) lambda*gampdf(x,a,b) + (1-lambda)*exppdf(x,t); Now, let's talk about your predictions. the predicted data are no where close to what one would expect. How are you generating these predictions? You've shown us how you coded the model, but I have no idea how you fit this model. Having seen your objective function, I'm wondering if your optimization routine isn't the problem. Some considerations: Are you using a built-in function to fit this, or have you home-brewed your own optimization? If you rolled your own optimization, maybe you should try using a supported tool like mle or fmincon . If you built your own optimization: what algorithm are you using to fit this? EM? Gradient Descent? Newton-Raphson? If you're not using EM, I'd give that a shot. Have you tried using different starting parameters? Maybe you're getting stuck at local minima. Try randomly sampling a bunch of starting parameters within what you consider to be reasonable ranges for the problem. Exploring the model space like this might land you on a better (possibly global) minimum. Are you using a bayesian strategy? Maybe you need to reevaluate your priors.
