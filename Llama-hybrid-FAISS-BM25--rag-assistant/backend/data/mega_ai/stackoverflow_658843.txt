As an alternative you could try storing all the entries for a graph in a single HashMap, in which the key is an object containing both the node number and the neighbour node number. I presume the node number would normally be the index into the array of HashMaps, and the neighbour node the key to the current HashMap. That would enable you to do the same retrievals that you do now, and iterate over all the entries without having to write any special code. Don't forget you'll need to write an equals() and a good hash function for the object used as the key (which object can otherwise be very simple). If you have very large graphs this may not be appropriate of course.
