You are leaving out what isn't working but I assume you can't add a child activity to the ForEach in the designer. If that is the case that is because the Body property is an ActivityAction not an Activity and it needs to be initialized. There are several ways of doing this but the easiest is to get started with the ForEachWithBodyFactory in the designer and drag that onto the design surface instead. The following code works for me. I can drag the ForEach onto a workflow and add child items to it. var cat = new ToolboxCategory("Standard Activities"); cat.Add(new ToolboxItemWrapper(typeof(ForEachWithBodyFactory<>)));
