Calling a method in a view controller from a view

I have to invoke a method present in a view controller who's reference is available in the view. When I try to call the method like any other method, for some reason, iPhone just ignores the call. Can somebody explain as to why this happens and also how can I go about invoking this method? In the view I have this method: -(void) touchesBegan :(NSSet *) touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSArray* mySubViews = [self subviews]; for (UITouch *touch in touches) { int i = 0; for(; i } Whenever the touches event is triggered, Hellooooo gets printed in the console but the method before that is simply ignored
