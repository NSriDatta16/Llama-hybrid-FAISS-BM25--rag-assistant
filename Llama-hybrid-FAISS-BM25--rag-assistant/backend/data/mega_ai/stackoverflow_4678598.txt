Is there an issue? Yes! If the users connect through an unencrypted wifi in a coffee shop, everyone can read the credentials. That is really bad, especially if you consider that the average user probably uses one password for all his accounts. Should the password be hashed? A simple hashing, like sending the md5 sum of the password, would not help, because an attacker could simply replay the attack. My recommendation: don't try to invent your own encryption solution, switch to SSL.
