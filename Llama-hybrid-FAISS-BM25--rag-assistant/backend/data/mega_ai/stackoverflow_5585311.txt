I assume phpunit has an issue with getting that path right on windows since i couldn't reproduce that on linux. (Using an absolute and an relative path worked fine). Also i've heard people talk about that issue with filtering and pathes on windows. So my first suggestion would be to just use a whitelist. I've created a small project that includes code from different folders (and all showed up in the code coverage). But after setting this whitelist: . only the code from that folder (or your file if you really one have one) show up in the coverage report.
