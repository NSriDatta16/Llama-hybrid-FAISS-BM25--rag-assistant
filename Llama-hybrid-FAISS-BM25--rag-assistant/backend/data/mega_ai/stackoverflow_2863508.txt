Windows Azure - Automatic Load Balancing - partitioning

I was going through some videos. I found that Windows Azure will group the blobs into partitions based on the partition key and will Automatically Load Balance these partitions on their servers. The partition key for a blob is blob name. Using the blob name, azure will automatically do partitions. Now, My question is that Can I able to make the azure to do partitions based on the Container Name. I wanted my partition key to be container name. For example, I have a storage account. In that I have 2 containers named container1 and container2 . In container1, I have 1000 files named 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, ......., 501.txt, 502.txt, ..... 999.txt, 1000.txt and in container2, I have another 1000 files named 1001.txt, 1002.txt, 1003.txt, ......., 1501.txt, 1502.txt, ..... 1999.txt, 2000.txt Now, Will Windows Azure will generate 2000 partitions based on the blob name and serve me through several servers??? Won't it be better if Azure partitions based on the Container name? container1 on one server and conatiner2 on another.
