Tortoise SVN - moving whole project to a folder

I am having a huge problem with this. I want to take my whole project from the root folder, and move it to the root/webUI folder. What I have done seems simple, but it's not working. I simply made the new root/webUI folders, selected everything else in the root folder, and right-click dragged it into the new folder. I then elected to SVN Move Versions Item(s) Here which is all well and good, everything shows up in local drive just fine. Then I go to commit the new changes, everything seems to work, but only the upper level folders are uploaded, none of the contents inside are added at all. Is there any way to force a full update? It seems that SVN feels it is up-to-date, even though the files in the repository are absent in relation to my project. Please let me know if this does not make sense.
