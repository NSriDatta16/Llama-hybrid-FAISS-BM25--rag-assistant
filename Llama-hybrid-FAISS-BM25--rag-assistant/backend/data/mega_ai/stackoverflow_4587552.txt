Mysql default packet size is 1MB this means that your query's result's data should fit in it. If you are trying to store multiple rows of information and if that is more then 1 MB the rows are split in transfer. But in case of large blob you can either increase your network packet size or store your information in smaller multiple rows as shown on this blog http://akashkava.com/blog/127/huge-file-storage-in-database-instead-of-file-system/
