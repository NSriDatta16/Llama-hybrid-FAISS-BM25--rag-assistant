If it is not reasonable to precompute all your report data into flat view, then just don't do that. You may want to join a bunch of tables for your report. It's your decision what can be precomputed, and what is not worth it (cpu, storage considerations). In your particular case (StartDate, EndDate,..) - i can't see what is the problem to generate a single ViewModel table for it, and just query directly against the parameters.
