How to create a bulleted or numbered list with Qt?

How to create a bulleted or numbered list in QTextEdit with Qt by clicking a button? Also it is necessary that make a list the paragraphes which are selected by clicking the same button. And when the cursor is in the list and you click the button, the the list item becomes not-list item, but a simple paragraph. In two words I want to create for my text editer 2 buttons, that work in the same way as (buletting and numbering button is MS Word).
