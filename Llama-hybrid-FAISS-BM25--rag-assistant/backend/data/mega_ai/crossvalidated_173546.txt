How to interpret error autocorrelation?

I'm new to time-series processing and I wonder what does the error autocorrelation plot generated by MATLAB's ntstool + ploterrcorr actually represent. Here is what it looks like : How should I interpret this? What I understand from this is : Average (?) correlation of error(t) ~ error(t-x) is the y axis. Is this correct? If so, shouldn't the value at [Lag=0] be 1? Is it normalized? Also, isn't correlation a symmetric function? So isn't one half of the [Lag] axis unnecessary? And what do the confidence limit (red lines) represent? Thanks for any help.
