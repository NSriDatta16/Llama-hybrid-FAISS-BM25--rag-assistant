Flex Script and Event Question

I wonder how to achieve this in Flex. Basically, I have enabled Drag and Drop in some of my list controls. In the function dg1_dragDropHandler event, I have the following codes: private function dg1_dragDropHandler(evt:DragEvent):void { // Perform some actions here... // ....... // Show Message to Confirm. Alert.show('Proceed?', 'Title', Alert.YES | Alert.NO, null, handleAlert, null, Alert.YES); } private function handleAlert(evt:CloseEvent):void { if (evt.detail == Alert.YES) { // Perform the functions as necessary } else { // Execute the script to prevent the dropping of the object. // How can I call the DragEvent.preventDefault(); function from here? } } In the codes above, I want to call the preventDefault() on the alertHandler function since the other scripts after the call to the Alert.show in dg1_dragDropHandler event would be executed concurrently with the alert.show. How would I be able to reference the DragEvent of the dg1_dragDropHandler event from the alertHandler event?
