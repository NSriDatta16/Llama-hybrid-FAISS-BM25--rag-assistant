The machine learning asks that you have listed can be covered by sklearn in python - Classification, clustering , anomaly detection Indexing can be done with whoosh (again python) Additionally one can use Pandas in Python (which can do time series data analysis although more of statistical techniques) along with sklearn. I doubt that a single library can do all of time series analysis.
