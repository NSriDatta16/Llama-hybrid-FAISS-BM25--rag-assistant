ANDROID How to reduce String allocations

I've managed to get my allocations down to next to nothing using DDMS (great tool), this has drastically reduced my GCs to about 1 or 2 every 3 minutes. Still, I'm not happy because those usually cause a noticeable delay in the game (on some phones) when you interact with it. Using DDMS, I know what the allocations are, they are Strings being converted from integers used to display game information to the HUD. I'm basically doing this: int playerScore = 20929; String playerScoreText = Integer.toString(playerScore); canvas.drawText(playerScoreText, xPos, yPos); This happens once each frame update and the HUD system is modular so I plug things in when I need and this can cause 4 or 5 hud elements to allocate Strings and AbstractStringBuilders in DDMS. Any way to reduce these further or eliminate all the String allocations and just reuse a String object? Thanks, Albert Pucciani
