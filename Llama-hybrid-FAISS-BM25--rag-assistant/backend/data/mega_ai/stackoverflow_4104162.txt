Simply, because those are the rules. Rationally, template parameters have to be resolved at compile time and objects of class type are only constructed (even temporaries and those with static storage duration) at run time. You can only have template parameters that are "values" resolvable at compile time such as integers and types. It is possible to have template parameters that are pointers or references to objects, though.
