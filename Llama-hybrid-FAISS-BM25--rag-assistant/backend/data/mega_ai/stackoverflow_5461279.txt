context.Request.Files collection empty on remote server only

I'm using a custom ashx handler to handle a file upload. When run locally, the file uploads fine. When I use the same setup on the web server I get a "Index out of range" error. In firebug I see the binary contents of the file in the post data and the file name is also passed in the query string. Any one seen this before? I`m sure its something minor, but its driving me up the wall. Update: Made some progress. I found out that I'm getting two different errors. One from FF / Chrome and one from IE. I'm focusing on FF now, just because firebug makes debugging easier. Now I get an error "Could not find a part of the path 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\'" Update 2: Got this working in FF/Chrome. Turns out IE and FF/Chrome post the data differentlly. Update 3: Here is the output of the network profiler in IE dev tool: Request header: Key Value Request POST /Secured/UploadHandler.ashx?
