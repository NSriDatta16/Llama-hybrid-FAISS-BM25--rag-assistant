I successfully used a non-negative weights linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) by adding some dummy data (all possible one-hot-vector excluding the bias) at training time and using off-the-shelf SVM implementations such as LibLinear but any implementation could do -- see my blog post . My goal was to fastly achieve diagonal Mahalanobis metric learning. Be careful with the class weighting (wi in LibLinear).
