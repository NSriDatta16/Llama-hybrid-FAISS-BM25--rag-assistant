The best solution would be to set a Deny Access Right for the distribution lists in Active Directory; follow these steps: 1) Open Active Directory Users & Computers as an admin (any user with access to creating groups and modify distribution list security settings). 2) Go to the View menu and make sure that there's a check-box next to Advanced Features. Create a new security group in Active Directory (call it HideFromSharePoint or something) and add the SharePoint Content Access account (in my case DOMAIN\sa_spcontent ) to that group (has to match the account used in step 4). 3) For all of the distribution lists that you don't want to show up in SharePoint do the following: 3a) Open the distribution list and select the Security tab (Advanced Features must be checked for this tab to be shown). 3b) Click on Add and type in the name of the security group that you created in step 3 ( HideFromSharePoint ); click Check Names and click Ok. 3c) Under Permissions for HideFromSharePoint ; check the Deny box next to Read (it's set to Allow by default) and click Ok and Ok again at the prompt. You've just denied any members of the HideFromSharePoint group read access to the distribution list. 4) Go to SharePoint Central Administration; SharedServices1; User Profiles and Properties; Configure Profile Import and under Specify Account enter the credentials of the account that you added to the HideFromSharePoint -group in step 3. (For some reason if you leave this to using the Default Content Access account SharePoint will use some other account to access Active Directory and thereby being allowed access to the distribution lists. You could experiment with adding other SharePoint service accounts to the HideFromSharePoint group but I think it's safer to specify an account explicitly so that you know which account is accessing AD and importing the data.) Also make sure the "Import Connection" for your Active Directory is set to "Use Default Account" (thereby "inheriting" the account used for Profile Imports). 5) Go to SharePoint Central Administration; SharedServices1; User Profiles and Properties and click on Start full import. (You can't do an incremental import because nothing has changed for the users in terms of group membership; it's just the access rights that have changed.) After completion of the full import (click Refresh until "Import time:" says "Started full import at 11/25/2009 ##:## AM - Ended import at 11/25/2009 ##:## AM") The distribution lists should now no longer show up under Memberships. A couple of things to note: You have to set the Deny Access Right explicitly and individually on all of the distribution lists that you don't want showing up in SharePoint. That's because the special AD-group " Authenticated Users " has read access to every object in the directory by default and explicit Allow Access Rights trump Deny Access Rights set (for example) at the organizational unit level. While you could skip the step of setting up the HideFromSharePoint -group and set the Deny Access Right directory for the SharePoint Content Access account Active Directory administration best practices is to use a group when configuring security permissions. (Then you can add additional members to that group and have those denied read access too.) You might have to wait a while (5+ minutes or so) between setting the the Deny Access Rights for the changes to replicate to all of you domain controllers. Otherwise the import might read from a domain controller where the Deny hasn't yet come into effect. Be careful adding any other accounts to the HideFromSharePoint -group because this might break your distribution lists. For example; if Exchange can't read the groups mail won't work. As long as you just add the SharePoint Content Access Account you're safe. Also (and this has nothing to do with SharePoint or the solution above) be aware that any user in your domain can fire up ADUC or a LDAP tool and see the members of your distribution lists that way. If you have anything "Top Secret" you need to experiment further with setting access controls in Active Directory.
