Alternative to EC2 for running ML batch training jobs on AWS

We are building an ML pipeline on AWS, which will obviously require some heavy-compute components including preprocessing and batch training. Most the the pipeline is on Lambda, but Lambda is known to have time limits on how long a job can be run (~15mins). Thus for the longer running jobs like batch training of ML models we will need(?) to access something like EC2 instances. For example a lambda function could be invoked and then kick off an EC2 instance to handle the training. Are there any alternatives to using EC2 for the heavy compute? Is there a way to still host/run the job on AWS without leveraging any EC2 to do the compute? The idea is to avoid the extra management that comes with EC2 since weâ€™re not currently using it. Keeping everything ad close to Lambda-like as possible is ideal.
