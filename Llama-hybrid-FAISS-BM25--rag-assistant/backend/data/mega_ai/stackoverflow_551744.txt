Definitely Flash. It's much easier to build complex animations with, has almost no risk of interfering with things if you decide to start using javascript for else later, and it's easy for me to get rid of with AdBlock if I have a problem with animations (I do). If you're not too comfortable doing things by hand in Flash, you might want to check out SWiSH, it's great for creating the sorts of attention-grabbing monstrosities clients seem to love without too much effort.
