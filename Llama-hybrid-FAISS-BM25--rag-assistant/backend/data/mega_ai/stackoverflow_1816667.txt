dragStart on draggables repeatedly called in jquery?

Ok. So I'm going to go out on a limb and presume that a draggables " start " event gets fired again after the movement has stopped and user starts moving again, even if hasn't been dropped yet? The main issue is I want my draggable to create my droppables depending on having an odd or even class. But I'm afraid the user may start dragging, stop, start dragging again without releasing the mouse button which could rebind the droppables. Is there a way to only catch the drag start event once?
