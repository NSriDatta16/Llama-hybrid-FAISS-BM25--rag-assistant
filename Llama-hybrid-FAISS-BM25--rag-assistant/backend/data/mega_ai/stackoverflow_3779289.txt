Natural Language Processing Algorithm for mood of an email

One simple question (but I haven't quite found an obvious answer in the NLP stuff I've been reading, which I'm very new to): I want to classify emails with a probability along certain dimensions of mood. Is there an NLP package out there specifically dealing with this? Is there an obvious starting point in the literature I start reading at? For example, if I got a short email something like "Hi, I'm not very impressed with your last email - you said the order amount would only be $15.95! Regards, Tom" then it might get 8/10 for Frustration and 0/10 for Happiness. The actual list of moods isn't so important, but a short list of generally positive vs generally negative moods would be useful. Thanks in advance! --Trindaz on Fedang #NLP
