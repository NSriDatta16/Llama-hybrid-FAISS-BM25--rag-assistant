I'm big on pragmatism. If it works, do it! But in the name of purity and goodness, I'd like to make a design suggestion: This class muddles up the data content with the mechanism for retrieving it. The object you end up using elsewhere is interesting only for the data it contains. So the "clean" thing to do would be to have a different class for digging out the information and then creating instances of this properties object. That other class could have a longer lifetime, as you'd typically be calling a method to do the work, not the constructor. The constructor of DBMSSpecInfo might end up assigning a bunch of properties but not doing a lot of error-capable DB access work.
