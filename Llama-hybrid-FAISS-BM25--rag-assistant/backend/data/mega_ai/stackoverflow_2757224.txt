I want : UIscrollview with non scrolling button

I'd like to put the following interface in place : I'd like to have a uiscrollview taking all the screen (big picture to be zoomed...) On top of that "scrolling image" : I'd like have 2 buttons (e.g.back and instructions) redirecting th user to other views. Could you drop me a code snippet where I understand how to organize the UIView and UIScrollview in order to have scrolling layer but with selectable non scrolling buttons on top of it ? many thanks...
