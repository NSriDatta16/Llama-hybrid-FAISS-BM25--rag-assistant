No, you're thinking of PCA sideways. PCA, like many other dimension-reduction methods, is a means for organizing the variables , not the cases . You can use PCA (or, e.g., factor analysis) to assign variables to groups, not cases to groups. If you want to group cases, you want some kind of cluster analysis , such as K-means.
