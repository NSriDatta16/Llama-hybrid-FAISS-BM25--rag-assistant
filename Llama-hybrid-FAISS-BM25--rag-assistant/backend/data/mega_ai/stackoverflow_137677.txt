the best library I have used in 8 years of NMS development - adventnet you can write your own, but you need to understand ASN . Good luck with that. SNMP agents do 2 things: query for data, send and receive traps. What else you want them to do? wash your laundry?! (sorry couldn't resist that! :) ). What are you trying to do with your SNMP agent?! Does you app need to send traps?! or query for data from a node?!
