How to statistically compare the performance of machine learning classifiers?

Based on estimated classification accuracy, I want to test whether one classifier is statistically better on a base set than another classifier . For each classifier, I select a training and testing sample randomly from the base set, train the model, and test the model. I do this ten times for each classifier. I therefore have ten estimate classification accuracy measurements for each classifier. How do I statistically test whether the $classifier 1$ is a better classifier than the $classifier 2$ on the base dataset. What t-test is appropriate to use?
