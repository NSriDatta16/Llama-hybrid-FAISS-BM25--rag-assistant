Open SQL Server Management Studio. Right Click your database -> Tasks -> Shrink -> Database Yes. The database remains live. Hard to say. It depends on how much free space there is in the 35Gb file. If the database is actually using all 35Gb for storage (rather than holding free space), then your database isn't going to shrink at all.
