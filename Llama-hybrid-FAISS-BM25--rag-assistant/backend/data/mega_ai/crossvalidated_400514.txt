Hessian of logistic loss - when $y \in \{-1, 1\}$

Logistic Regression has two possible formulations depending on how we select the target variable: $y \in \{0,1\}$ or $y \in \{-1,1\}$ . This question discusses the derivation of Hessian of the loss function when $y \in \{0,1\}$ . The following is about deriving the Hessian when $y \in \{-1,1\}$ . The loss function could be written as, $$\mathcal{L}(\beta) = \frac{-1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \sigma(y_i\beta^{T}x_i),$$ where $y_i \in \{-1, 1\},$ $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p,$ and $\sigma (x) = \frac{1}{1 +e^{-x}}.$ is the sigmoid function and $n$ is the number of examples in $X$ . I'm looking to calculate the Hessian for this Loss. $\nabla \mathcal{L}(\beta)$ can be calculated as follows: Let $l_i(\beta) = - \log \sigma(y_iz_i),$ where $z_i = \beta^{T}x_i$ , $$\frac {\partial l_i(\beta)}{\partial \beta} = \frac{-1}{\sigma(y_iz_i)}\sigma(y_iz_i)(1 - \sigma(y_iz_i)).\frac{\partial {y_iz_i}}{\partial \beta}$$ $$\frac {\partial l_i(\beta)}{\partial \beta} = -(1 - \sigma(y_iz_i)).y_ix_i$$ $$\frac {\partial l_i(\beta)}{\partial \beta} = ( \sigma(y_i\beta^{T}x_i) -1 ).y_ix_i$$ Averaging over all the $n$ examples: $$ \nabla \mathcal{L}(\beta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sigma(y_i\beta^{T}x_i) -1 ).y_ix_i $$ I'm not sure how to proceed with calculating $\nabla^{2} \mathcal{L}(\beta)$ . Any pointer is appreciated.
