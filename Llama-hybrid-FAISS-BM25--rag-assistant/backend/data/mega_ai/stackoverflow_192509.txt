I learned from Robert Vieira's Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming -- well written and comprehensive. I am pretty sure the 2005 version is very similar, just updated. Despite the 'professional' label, I found it a great intro (I had practically no database experience at the time). Also I second Erikk's comment. Download SQL Express and PLAY!
