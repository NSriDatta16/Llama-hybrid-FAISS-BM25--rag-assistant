This is a spatio-temporal clustering problem that is likely best solved with a Markov model. You could reasonable group this into machine learning or data mining. Develop your model using machine learning and then (the data mining part) leverage those pattern recognition techniques (that have been developed in machine learning). I think there are at least one or two threads on this over at Cross-Validated that go into more detail. Here are a couple of papers to look at if you are just getting started.
