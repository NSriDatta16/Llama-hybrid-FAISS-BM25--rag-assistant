CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) in Finance is a classic example of an underfit model. It was built on the beautiful theory that "Investors only pay for risk they can't diversify away" so expected excess returns are equal to correlation to market returns. As a formula [0] Ra = Rf + B (Rm - Rf) where Ra is the expected return of the asset, Rf is the risk free rate, Rm is the market rate of return, and Beta is the correlation to the Equity premium (Rm - Rf) This is beautiful, elegant, and wrong. Investors seem to require a higher rate of small stocks and value (defined by book to market, or dividend yield) stocks. Fama and French [1] presented an update to the model, which adds additional Betas for Size and Value. So how do you know in a general sense? When the predictions you are making are wrong, and another variable with a logical explanation increases the prediction quality. It's easy to understand why someone might think small stocks are risky, independent of non-diversifiable risk. It's a good story, backed by the data.
