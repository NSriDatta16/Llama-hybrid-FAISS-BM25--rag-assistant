How to represent facial features from video and classify high/low personality traits from facial features?

The dataset has 3-minute 30fps video conversations (no audio) of 150 extroverted and 150 introverted individuals. The goal is to classify them as "introverts" or "extroverts" based on their facial features. I have extracted 35-dim facial action unit features using open-face for each frame. Then took an average of features from 5400 frames (for each video) for each sample and used an SVM classifier, resulting in 70% ACC. What are other statistical measures to represent the entire data, instead of the average feature? What are some other deep learning-based approaches for extracting/representing entire time series of facial features from videos and classifying binary personality types ("introvert" or "extrovert")?
