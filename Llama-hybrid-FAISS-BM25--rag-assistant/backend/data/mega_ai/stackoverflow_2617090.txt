Why does asp.net mvc form submits itself on button clicks when javascript function error?

i'm new to the asp.net mvc, and while working on this, i used very basic asp.net mvc stuff like beginform, etc. i used a lot of jquery codes this round for client side validation, ajax data retrieval, and other gui works. and i used a combinations of html inputs buttons, etc and the asp.net mvc type of controls. what i noticed is that whenever i click on a button control, which sometimes are tied to either jquery oclick events, when there's a javascript error, the page will just go on and submit. why is this happening and what am i missing here? my bad for the dumb questions.. thanks Updates After poking around, i think i might have found out why... could it be because i put some jquery event handlers inside another function and didn't return false? function eventHandling() { //initialize controls $(".dobPicker").datepicker({ changeMonth: true, changeYear: true, yearRange: '-100:+0' }); $("a#hrefCountry").fancybox({ 'titlePosition': 'inside', 'width': '75%', 'height': '75%' }); //Event handlers part $("#imgbtnClear").click(function() { clearForm("#frmProductRegistration"); return false; // like this guy weren't there initially And if this was the root cause, why? care to share :)
