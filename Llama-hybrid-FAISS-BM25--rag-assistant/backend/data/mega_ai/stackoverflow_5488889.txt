I think you are doing a lot of work for little gain if you don't already have a performance problem. Yes, pay attention to what you are doing and don't make unnecessary calls. The actual connection and across the wire overhead for each query is usually really low so don't worry about it. Remember "Premature optimization is the root of all evil".
