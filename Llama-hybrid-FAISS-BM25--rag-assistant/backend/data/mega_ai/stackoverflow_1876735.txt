Should I use YAML or JSON to store my Perl data?

I've been using the YAML format with reasonable success in the last 6 months or so. However, the pure Perl implementation of the YAML parser is fairly fidgety to hand-write a readable file for and has (in my opinion) annoying quirks such as requiring a newline at end of the file. It's also gigantically slow compared to the rest of my program. I'm pondering the next evolution of my project, and I'm considering using JSON instead (a mostly strict subset of YAML, as it turns out). But which format has the most community traction and effort in Perl? Which appears today to be the better long-term format for simple data description in Perl, YAML or JSON, and why?
