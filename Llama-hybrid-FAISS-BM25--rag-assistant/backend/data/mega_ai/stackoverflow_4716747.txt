I also use git to track changes in my scientific code. i didn't want to use an external program because it limits portability of the code (if someone would want to make changes on MSVS for example). my solution was to use only the main branch for the calculations and make it output the build time using preprocessor macros __DATE__ and __TIME__ . that way i can check it with git log and see which version i'm using. ref: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html another elegant way to solve the problem is to include git log into the executable. make an object file out of git log and include it into the code. this time the only external program you use is objcopy but there is less coding. ref: http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/embedding-file-executable-aka-hello-world-version-5967 and Embed data in a C++ program
