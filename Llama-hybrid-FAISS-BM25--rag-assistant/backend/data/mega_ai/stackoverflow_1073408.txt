There is no "abuse" in simply not writing the field manually; and it is good to encourage all access via the property (not directly to the field) anyway! The biggest problem I know of is with binary serialization , where it gets a bit tricky to change back to a regular field without making it version-incompatible - but then... use a different serializer ;-p It would be nice if there was a "proper" readonly variant, and if you didn't need to use :this() ctor-chaining on structs, but.... meh!
