Do something special first time around in a Ruby loop

Let's say I have a loop like this: items.each do |x| if FIRST_TIME_AROUND # do something end # do the rest of stuff end is there a way in Ruby to write if FIRST_TIME_AROUND ? I vaguely recall reading something about this once, but I can't recall. EDIT: I do know about the (many) standard ways of doing this... I'm after the most elegant solution possible.
