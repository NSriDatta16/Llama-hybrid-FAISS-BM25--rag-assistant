Using CMake with CTest and CDash

I am going to use CDash with CMake/CTest on my C++ project. In order to enable CDash and customize settings, like "MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE" , "DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT" , I added the following lines in the root CMakeLists.txt set(MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/valgrind.supp") set(DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT "120") include(CTest) However, the generated "DartConfiguration.tcl" does not contain my settings at all ( MemoryCheckSuppressionFile is empty and TimeOut is still the default value ) I found that, for example, if I pass -DDART_TESTING_TIMEOUT=STRING:120 , it works , but it fails if specifying them in the CMakeLists.txt. Thank you in advance :) DartConfiguration.tcl # Dynamic analisys and coverage PurifyCommand: ValgrindCommand: ValgrindCommandOptions: MemoryCheckCommand: /usr/bin/valgrind MemoryCheckCommandOptions: MemoryCheckSuppressionFile: CoverageCommand: /usr/bin/gcov # Testing options # TimeOut is the amount of time in seconds to wait for processes # to complete during testing.
