I know you can hide drives using a registry setting: http://www.pctools.com/guides/registry/detail/148/ but this will not create the invisibility in searches that you want. I know this doesn't really answer your question. However, if nothing else, hopefully it will keep others from going down that road... =p On the other hand, Truecrypt is open source. I haven't had an interest in this subject myself, so I don't know how it works (beyond the fact that it uses a special storage driver in Windows), but you can check it out for yourself here: http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads2.php
