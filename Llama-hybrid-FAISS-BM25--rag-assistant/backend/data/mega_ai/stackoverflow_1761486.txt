The functionality you describe is handled by the extract php function, for example: // Source: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.extract.php $size = "large"; $var_array = array("color" => "blue", "size" => "medium", "shape" => "sphere"); extract($var_array, EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, "wddx"); echo "$color, $size, $shape, $wddx_size\n"; But i would strongly advise you to use one of the classes posted by Sergey or RageZ since else you'll be reinventing the wheel, there are plenty of lowprofile and highend template classes available in PHP, to many actually :)
