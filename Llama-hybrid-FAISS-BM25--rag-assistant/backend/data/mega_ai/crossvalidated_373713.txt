The presumptive appropriate approach would be mixed effects logistic regression, where the dependent variable is Response , the independent variable is Type , and Subject is treated as the random subject. This is the approach described in the answer by @Noah. Using a simple chi-square goodness-of-fit test or binomial test ignores the fact that the same subject is responding several times. A t -test is probably not a good solution considering that the dependent variable is binomial and not continuous, as well as the fact that a t -test ignores the repeated responses by each subject.
