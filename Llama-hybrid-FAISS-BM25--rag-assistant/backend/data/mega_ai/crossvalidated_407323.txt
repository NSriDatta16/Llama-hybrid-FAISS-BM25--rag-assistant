Holidays, weekends data were 0 how to model time series using python or R

I am analyzing sales transaction data for forecasting. Public Holidays and Weekend transaction values were '0' (Numeric Zero). To make my forecasts more accurate, how should I treat the public holidays/Weekends in the data? If I Omit Holidays data, am not getting proper model. Am using python for time series. Here is the Sample data 17-Dec-2018 3000 18-Dec-2018 3100 19-Dec-2018 3030 20-Dec-2018 3200 21-Dec-2018 3190 22-Dec-2018 0 23-Dec-2018 0 24-Dec-2018 3020 25-Dec-2018 0 26-Dec-2018 2900 27-Dec-2018 3030 28-Dec-2018 3089 29-Dec-2018 0 30-Dec-2018 0
