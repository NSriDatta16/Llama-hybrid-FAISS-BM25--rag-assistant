Drag and drop of TBODY elements in a TABLE?

I have a table where I want to support dragging and dropping of tbody elements (because I have pairs of rows which need to move together): ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I've tried various things, but am getting closest using jQuery UI sortable: $('table').sortable({ items: 'tbody' }); And you can indeed drag and drop the rows, but: When dragging the row, all the elements are bunched left. There's no indication of where the tbody will be dropped. Defining a placeholder has no effect (which it does when using sortable on other elements). There seems to be no way to say that the placeholder should be a TBODY. Any suggestions on either (a) how to achieve this with jQuery UI, or (b) another way to achieve this? thanks, Neil
