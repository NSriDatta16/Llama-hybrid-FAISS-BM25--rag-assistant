It’s because no one cares to predict yesterday’s weather, stock prices, coronavirus cases, or gamma ray bursts. When you have a time series, knowing the before and after could help you fill in a missing time period e.g. if you’re missing weather data from the first week of August, perhaps use the last week of July and the second week of August to speculate on what happened. However, that’s a different task from predicting what will happen tomorrow, where you can’t burn the candle from both ends. This is different from, for example, a speech recognition classification algorithm (“Did Dave say something about a dog or a cat?”) that has a time series as the input but nothing temporal as the output.
