I assume the column of values you gave correspond to some kind of time series, and there is an implicit "time" column with evenly spaced values that you've not mentioned. Given that, the question remains if you intend to fit a polynomial curve for prediction or forecasting. If the former, then the use of splines can be achieved using adaptive bases and cross validation to determine optimal breakpoints. Splines estimate piecewise polynomial trends, depending on the polynomial degree you specify (and the number of breakpoints). On the other hand, forecasting does not warrant the use of splines with breakpoints because the trend cannot be extrapolated beyond where the next breakpoint would lie had you observed the data. In either case, are you determining the $R^2$ value using external validation with an independent dataset? If so, then how did you arrive at a choice of 80% variation to determine an adequate predictive model? It seems arbitrary to me and you're more likely to fit noise with little generalization by doing so.
