That's because mRMRe does not perform multiclass prediction. If you have more than 2 levels in your factors, mRMRe requires that you define an order for them and will assume a linear relationship between the levels. If this is not applicable to your situation you can run multiple mRMRe on "made-up" binary classes as such: Example for 3 classes {Foo, Bar, Baz}: Foo vs. Bar+Baz Bar vs. Foo+Baz Baz vs. Foo+Bar And then average all the models.
