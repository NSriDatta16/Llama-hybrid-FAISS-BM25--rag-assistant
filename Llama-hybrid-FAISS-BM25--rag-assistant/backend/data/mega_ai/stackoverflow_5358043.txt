VBA Round Function

In one of my programs I need to calculate the average on a range of numbers. The problem is that sometimes the answer comes out to a huge decimal and I need to try and get that down to two decimal places maximum. I've seen something called Excel.WorksheetFunction.Round(...) but as far as I know it only works with a specific number or a specific cell. I was wondering if anyone knew how to implement this so that it will round all decimals in a range of cells. Excel.WorksheetFunction.Round(ActiveSheet.Range(g_first_Function_Col & "2:" & g_first_Function & g_totalRow).Select, 2) The code above attempts to use the round function on a range of cells. The g_first_Function_Col is some column (like column "H") and g_totalRow is the last row that has any values in it. When I try to run this bit of code it tells me "=" expected. Essentially I'm trying to select an entire column and round it. Thank you, Jesse Smothermon
