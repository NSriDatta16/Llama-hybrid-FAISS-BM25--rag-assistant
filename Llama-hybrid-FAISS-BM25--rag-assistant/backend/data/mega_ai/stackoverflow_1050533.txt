Is it possible to embed the sidebar with Google Maps?

We'd like to use Google Maps to keep track of local garage sales. We've created a map ( see here ) and we'd like to embed that map on our website. However, when we do, we lose the sidebar of the map that contains a list of all the garage sales. We're quite familiar with how to embed a Google; they've made the process quite simple. However, is there a way that we can embed the map and keep the sidebar list of garage sales?
