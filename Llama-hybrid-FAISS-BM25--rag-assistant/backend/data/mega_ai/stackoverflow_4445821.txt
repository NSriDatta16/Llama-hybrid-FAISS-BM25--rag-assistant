I cannot spot any major weakness in this scheme. However, it does not add any security over best practice salting; i.e. generating an storing a new per-user salt each time the user sets or changes their password. This scheme does add an extra point of attack. If there is a weakness in the way that the salts are generated (e.g. predictability), then it is likely to be easier to exploit if you restrict yourself to 10 salts all generated at the same time. That might give an attacker more leverage to guess what the likely salts are, and hence create rainbow tables. But the main problem with your approach (IMO) is just the complexity.
