Time series: What is my natural time period?

We are modeling univariate ts with R. Sampled daily since 1-1-2013 at five observations per week. We are unclear about how to decide 'natural time period'. Until now we just assumed 260 weekdays in a year (frequency = 260). We understand that our data is too short to allow discovery of yearly seasonals, and hence that is not in scope, we just look for non-seasonal model. So is it nonsense to specify frequency 260? Maybe we should select Week as natural time period and set frequency 5? How should we decide this, and how does it impact the modeling process?
