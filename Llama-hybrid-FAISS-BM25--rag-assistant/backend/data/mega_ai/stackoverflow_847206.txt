UI mapping in asp.net

I was just wondering if there is any easier ways to assign values to html controls from an object or vice versa in asp.net. To do it manually is just painful //assign value txtFirstName.Text = person.FirstName; //retrieve value var p = new Person(); p.FirstName = txtFirstName.Text; However to do it "pragmatically" is also kind of painful because it's got so many cases as you can see in this code , which is based on the ideas from this article . if ((ctrl as TextBox) != null) { var txt = ctrl as TextBox; if (p.PropertyType == typeof (string)) txt.Text = p.GetValue(data, null).ToString(); else if (p.PropertyType == typeof (decimal)) txt.Text = p.GetValue(data, null).ToString(); } else if ((ctrl as DropDownList) != null) { var dropdown = ctrl as DropDownList; dropdown.SelectedValue = p.GetValue(data, null).ToString(); } I couldn't find any other clever ways to automate this. Can some one point me a clever way of doing it because the form I am doing has literally more than 100 fields I just don't want code it manually. Thanks!
