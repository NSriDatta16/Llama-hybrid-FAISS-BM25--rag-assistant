How to get custom module configuration gui to send info to another web server?

Firstly, I have to admit I am new to Magento and PHP. I am writing the configuration for my custom module. I would like to allow entry of some information, then send that information to a servlet on my web server where it is processed and a response returned and displayed in the configuration gui in a read-only field. I am getting my guidance from various web articles and by looking at other modules' code. A module that does something similar is the PayPal module. However, it brings up a new browser window where the user logs in and enters their details. I just want to send the data gathered and wait for the response. In my system.xml file I specify a frontend_model. In that frontend_model, the _prepareLayout method sets the template to my template, and in that template I have an HTML button. I added an onClick event handler to that button which makes an AJAX call to my web site. Unsurprisingly (because of the same origin policy I assume) the AJAX call fails with a code of 0. I guess what I should be doing is when the user clicks the button, the request including the data they have entered in the other fields, is sent to the Magento server, and the AJAX call to my web site is made from there? Or perhaps my approach is completely wrong and there is a more appropriate way to achieve this? Thank you.
