Factor is a vector. The set of factors give you a coordinate system, a basis. Factor loadings are sets of coordinates in this basis. Let's say you have a $T\times n$ matrix $X=x_{ti}$. Imagine that it's a path of particle in n-dimensional space, where $t$ is time, and $i$ is the dimension. What factor analysis does is simply change the coordinate system from your current basis to something else, then your $X$ matrix becomes a $T\times n$ matrix $A=a_{ti}$. It's the same path in time, except in different coordinates. The actual coordinates of a point at time $t$ are called loadings or a score in PCA, i.e. each row is a particular point in time, a loading. The reason to transform the coordinates is usually convenience or clarity. For instance, these would be coordinates of circular motion in cartesian system (x,y): 0.8415 0.5403 0.9093 -0.4161 0.1411 -0.9900 -0.7568 -0.6536 -0.9589 0.2837 -0.2794 0.9602 0.6570 0.7539 0.9894 -0.1455 0.4121 -0.9111 -0.5440 -0.8391 Here's the same in polar system (angle,radius): 1.0000 1.0000 2.0000 1.0000 3.0000 1.0000 4.0000 1.0000 5.0000 1.0000 6.0000 1.0000 0.7168 1.0000 1.7168 1.0000 2.7168 1.0000 3.7168 1.0000 The polar system is obviously suited better for this process, as you can shrink the dimensionality of the system. It's essentially one-dimensional motion along the circle's circumference. Factor analysis is usually linear in some way, and doesn't do cool stuff like this, but still works for many processes.
