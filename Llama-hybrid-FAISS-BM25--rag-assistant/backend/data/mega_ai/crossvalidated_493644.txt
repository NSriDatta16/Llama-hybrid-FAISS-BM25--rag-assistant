Repeated-measure design with only three subjects but many replicated observations

I am interested in studying the difference between two therapies ('TH') using data obtained from a computational model. Three subjects are modelled and each subject receives both therapies for each level of two factors ('A' with 3 levels and 'B' with 5 levels). The dependent variable ('DV') is the response to the therapy. Unfortunately I cannot model more than three subjects, but I can easily replicate each measurement. So far 30 replicated measurements per condition are available. Here is a glimpse of my data frame: $ subject 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,... $ A 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1,... $ B 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 1,... $ TH 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,... $ DV 0.016009750, 0.008925725, 0.005316029, 0.015981987, 0.009186412, 0.004799236, 0.016079657, 0.009259483, 0.005482147, 0.016834199, 0.01158... From reading various sources, it seems that my analysis question is typically answered using a repeated-measure ANOVA or a linear mixed effect model. However I am facing a couple of issues. My number of subjects (three) seems to be too low for a mixed effect model as discussed here (five or six subjects appears to be a minimum). Is three subjects also too low for a repeated measure ANOVA? If so, what is the best alternative for my design? To make sure that the dependency of within-subject measures is taken into account, would it be appropriate to simply perform a three-way ANOVA for each subject? The next issue concerns how my replicated measurements should be dealt with. From reading this , this , this , and this , I understand that I should average these replicated measurements for repeated measures ANOVA. But am I not loosing some information by doing that? Can mixed models avoid this issue?
