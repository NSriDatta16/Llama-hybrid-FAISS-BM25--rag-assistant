have you checked the mysql log file? you can enable logging: /etc/my.conf check if something like the below 2lines exist in the mysqld section [mysqld] log-bin log=/var/log/mysql/mysql.log how large is your myisam table? also is there a specific reason you are using myisam tables. I there is no specific reason I would highly recommend switching to InnoDB (InnoDB plugin, or Percona's XtraDB) InnoDB is a 'crash-safe' storage-engine
