There is no k-means algorithm. K-means is the problem. Algorithms for it include MacQueen, Lloyd/Forgy, Hartigan/Wong and many more. Most of these algorithms (all but exhaustive search I guess) will only find a local optimum , not the global optimum. They are heuristics . Fast heuristics... It turns out the usual nearest-center heuristic sometimes even misses the local optimum , if cluster sizes vary much. Not by much. But rarely, points should not be assigned the nearest center. Global optimium search is IIRC NP-hard, so you do not want to use a perfect algorithm, unless you assume that P=NP.
