I really recommend you to use the fail-safe faux columns method. If you are not a layout expert (no offence, seriously), stay away from the padding/margin/overflow magic and the one true layout technique. The latter is elegant but it can cause unwanted side-effects if you are to do heavy JS/DOM manipulations and all (see the problems listing ). As slink said you have two overflow: hidden rules in your css: #main-container { overflow:hidden; } And #content { overflow:hidden; } If you disable/remove these you will able to use your scrollbars again. Unfortunately the padding / negative margin "hack" will be visible. I recommend you to completely remove this solution and use faux columns. Faux columns background can be added to your #main-content or even the #content div (not just like the example in the ALA article that sets the background image to the body tag). Good luck! Update: Sorry, let me correct myself: to use faux columns in your case it is better to set the current background to the html element and the faux background to body element.
