You can think about the raters as points that occupy a 35 dimensional space (one dimension for each trait) for each person. Then, you can measure their degree of agreement by measuring how far apart they are from each other in that space. The distance can be measured using the Euclidean distance (Pythagorean) formula. Below are a few examples of four raters rating four people on a total of 10 traits (for brevity). If a rater chose a specific trait, the person gets a score of 1 for that trait, otherwise 0. In this example each rater chose two traits per person. In the first case, all four raters have a very little agreement, and their total Euclidean distance comes out to be 14.63 for this person. In the second case, there's a little more agreement, and as a result, the total distance reduces to 13.14. The lower the distance, the closer all raters are to each other in this 10 dimensional space. In the last example, all raters agree with each other, so the total distance is zero. This is the best possible score. In this example, since there are four raters, there would be a total of six pairs (comparisons) for which the Euclidean distances need to be calculated. In your example, six rater would yield 15 pairs. For the aggregate measure of agreement, you can take the average distance across all people. Since the distance measure doesn't really have a very intuitive interpretation (like how a percentage value that goes from 0 to 100 would) -- you might want to create a spectrum that shows the range from lowest to highest score for this dataset.
