Using x to predict y when they are highly correlated

I am trying to use an organism's length (x) to predict weight (y), but length and weight are highly correlated (r=0.95). Are there any pitfalls I should be aware of because estimates of the two variables are in a sense measuring the "same" thing, i.e., size? I would be happy for someone to point out that this question has been asked before, but I don't see it on this site.
