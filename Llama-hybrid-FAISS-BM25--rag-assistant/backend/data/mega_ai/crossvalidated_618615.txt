When evaluating survival models, it is important to consider the covariate set and sample size used. Here are some tips to properly evaluate survival models of different covariate set and sample size: Use appropriate performance metrics: The most common performance metrics for survival models are concordance index (C-index), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and integrated Brier score (IBS). Choose the appropriate metric based on the research question and the characteristics of the data. Compare models using the same metric: To properly compare survival models of different covariate set and sample size, use the same performance metric. This ensures that the comparison is fair and unbiased. Use cross-validation: Cross-validation is a method that divides the data into training and validation sets. This ensures that the model is evaluated on data that was not used for training. Use cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the model. Consider the complexity of the model: When comparing survival models of different covariate set and sample size, consider the complexity of the model. A more complex model may fit the data better, but may not generalize well to new data. Use information criteria, such as Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), to balance between model complexity and goodness of fit. Interpret the results: When evaluating survival models of different covariate set and sample size, interpret the results in the context of the research question and the characteristics of the data. Consider the practical significance of the results, not just the statistical significance. By following these tips, you can properly evaluate survival models of different covariate set and sample size and make informed decisions based on the results.
