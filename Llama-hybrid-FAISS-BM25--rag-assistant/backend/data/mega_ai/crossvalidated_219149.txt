In my opinion, you can construct your response variable in that way, but I'm not sure about how do you could model it. If you could consider each year as an independent Bernoulli trial, your response variable would follow a binomial distribution, and then you could use a logistic regression to model the probability of the conflict to happen. Nevertheless, Iâ€™m not sure that you could consider each year as an independent Bernoulli trial. If a conflict occurred in a particular year, is it independent of having occurred the previous year, or the next year? I think it is not. Maybe you could use some kind of autorregressive model?
