Finding and using a single (best) decision tree from random forest to evalute a sample

Is there a way that we can find an optimum tree (highly accurate) from a random forest? The purpose is to run some samples manually through the optimum tree and see how the tree classify the given sample. I am using Scikit-learn for data analysis and my model has ~100 trees. Is it possible to find out an optimum tree and run some samples manually? Thanks
