Most OO languages currently in use are not fully object-oriented. Every language has idiosyncrasies and gotchas. So I'd say PHP is OO enough for most simple projects. I worked on the Zend Framework which is designed as an OO class library, with design patterns and such. One suggestion for PHP is that you should pay attention to its SPL component, which gives you interfaces for many basic classes. I think it's pretty weak if your teacher said, "put anything you want into the design document, UML diagrams are pretty." Design documentation is an important but woefully undervalued part of software engineering. Your teacher should be showing you examples or templates for good design doc.
