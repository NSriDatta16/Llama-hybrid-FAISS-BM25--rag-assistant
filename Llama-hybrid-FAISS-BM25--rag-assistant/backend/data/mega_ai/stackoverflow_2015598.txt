Implementing PHP Pagination for a SQLite query set

I'm looking for a good function for implementing pagination in a PHP site. The solution needs to work for vanilla PHP (no template language, no frameworks, etc). I'd like to be able to put something like the following in my code: Page content here. This would output something like the following: Page content here. 1 2 3 . . . Then, there is the issue of filtering my query. I could query twice, once to get a count of total objects and once with a limit clause to get the specific "widgets" that I need. Are there any simple PHP functions that can elegantly encapsulate this functionality, or is it something best done by hand? I think I've become spoiled by django-pagination , but this project requires a PHP solution.
