What is best practise for dimensionality reduction in rows of data

I was wondering what was best practise for dimensionality reduction in observations (as opposed to features) in a data-set? I often have data comprising of a multiple, random number of observations per participant. For example the data may look like this (R code). set.seed(999) df I want to model these data, for example to predict from x1, x2 and x3 which participant will be y == 'yes' and y == 'no'. I therefore need to produce 1 row of data from the multiple rows relating to each participant. I could just take be mean (or max/min/etc.) of each column (windowed by participant) library(dplyr) df %>% group_by(y) %>% summarise_each(funs(mean)) Or, i could arbitrarily combine rows df %>% group_by(y) %>% summarise(a1 = mean(x1) + mean(x2), a2 = max(x2) * 3) Which both reduce the observations per participant to 1. But are there better ways to do this? I feel like i'm losing to much information using this procedure. What is best practise under these circumstances? Thanks in advance.
