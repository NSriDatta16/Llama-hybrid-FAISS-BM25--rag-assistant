Efficient Query for Extended Details off an Association Object Pattern

Details A Person has many Objective s. Objective s have Person -specific details about Activity s. An Activity contains generic information such as a world record. A Person can organize an Event to attempt the Objective . A Person invites other Person s to watch an Event with an Invitation . Schema Note: Only backref's are listed on the example schema diagram, indicated by "(fk)". The arrows imply the normal relationship. Image Link Until I Get 10 Points To Use Image Tag Question I want most Event , Objective , and Activity details for all Invitation s one Person received (irregardless of status , but the status is still needed) displayed at once. Is there a better way to represent the problem before I try tackling a JOIN like this? I believe the Person -> Invitation Event is an Association Object pattern, but I am unsure of how to get the Objective and Activity information in a clean, efficient manner for each Invitation returned. Bonus : Provide sample SQLAlchemy query.
