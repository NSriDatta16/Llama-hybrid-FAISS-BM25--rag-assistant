is there a supported way to invoke the XML serialization using a file? If you mean "when loading from the local filesystem" then just give the file a .xhtml file extension. A test of this would be rendering &nbsp; recent versions of Chromium will actually halt rendering if they encounter this element. That isn't a very good test. It just means that the parser is a generic XML parser rather than one that is XHTML 5 aware. The specification says using them is 'unsafe' not 'forbidden'. According to the XML specification, XML processors are not guaranteed to process the external DTD subset referenced in the DOCTYPE. This means, for example, that using entity references for characters in XHTML documents is unsafe if they are defined in an external file (except for , &, " and '). If you want to do a proper test, then make the document non-well-formed. e.g. by leaving off the end tag for a paragraph (which is allowed in HTML but not in XHTML).
