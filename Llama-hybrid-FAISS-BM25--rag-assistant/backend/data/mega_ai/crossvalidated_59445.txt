I'd like to second what IrishStat has said and point you directly to two of Ruey Tsay's books: Analysis of Financial Time Series, Third Edition, Wiley, 2010. ISBN: 0-470-41435-9; 10-digits: 978-0470414354 ( book's website with some R code) An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R, Wiley, 2013 ISBN: 0-470-89081-3; 10-digits: 978-0470890813 Furthermore, I suggest investigating: Modelling Nonlinear Economic Time Series (Advanced Texts in Econometrics) (2011) by Timo Terasvirta, Dag Tjostheim, and Clive W. J. Granger. This book is very detailed and contains a great number of references. Chapter 6 of the book is where you should look.
