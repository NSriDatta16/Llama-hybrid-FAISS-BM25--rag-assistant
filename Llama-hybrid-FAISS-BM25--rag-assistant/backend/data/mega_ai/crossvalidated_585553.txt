My question is - how much of a problem are violation of the IID assumption causing in POT-method? It's hard to say, as this depends on the data. If the data is stationary, and the exceedences occur far apart, then probably not much. If all the exceedences occur in the same place then this would be more of a problem Is it possible to simulate more similar data, for which you know the true distribution? If so then you could use this to quantify the modelling error You say the time series is not iid, is it alternatively possible to fit a model to the data so the residuals look iid? That way you could perform POT on the residuals
