SVM: Getting number of support vectors number and relationship between C and alpha in Python sklearn SGDClassifier

I am using sklearn.SGDClassifier to train my SVM model with loss='hinge'. My questions are: Is there a way to get support vectors number by having this SGD model? I found this online but it is not helpful: How to identify support vectors in SGD svm? Does anyone can provide the formal relation between C and alpha parameter in sklearn.SGDClassfier as an SVM as well, with references if possible? Apparently, SVM's C is not an attribute in SGDClassifier. These two links are providing different relations and I am confused: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34556476/regularization-parameter-and-iteration-of-sgdclassifier-in-scikit-learn How does alpha relate to C in Scikit-Learn's SGDClassifier? Thank you very much for your help. :)
