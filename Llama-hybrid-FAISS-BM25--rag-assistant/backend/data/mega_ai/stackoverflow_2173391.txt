How to configure the starting point for dragging on an imagemap?

i have the following situation (please see image below after reading the following): .dragoverlay ( white rectangle in image) is a (jQuery) draggable div. it's the same size as the browser viewport. .items (small red square(s) in image) is an absolutely positioned div of size 0x0. The light blue items squares are absolutely positioned divs with an image inside and are located within .items . The dark blue polygons are imagemaps which belong to the items. I currently have the following html: div.items { position:absolute; z-index:98; } div.dragoverlay { position:absolute; z-index:97; background-image:url('../img/transparentpixel.gif'); } div.item { } When the white .dragoverlay is dragged, the red .items is moved accordingly. This setup is needed. How can I use the light blue areas in the items (just outside every blue imagemap) as a starting point for dragging? As if the user clicks the .dragoverlay area...
