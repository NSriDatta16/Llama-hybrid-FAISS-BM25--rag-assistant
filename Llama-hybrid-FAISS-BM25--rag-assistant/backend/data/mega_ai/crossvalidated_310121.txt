How to perform multiple logistic regression for a continuous dependent variable with values bounded between 0 and 1?

I'd like to model the response of three species functional groups (proportion of total abundance) to different environmental gradients. I thought a multiple linear regression could work well, but now I heard that I should use multiple logistic regression, because my response variable (proportion of total counts) is bounded between 0 and 1. However, when I try to perform logistic regression in R with my data, I have the following error message: In eval(family$initialize): non-integer #successes in a binomial glm! More specifically, here is my very simple code: test_clusters Then I have the error message commented above: In eval(family$initialize): non-integer #successes in a binomial glm! Someone know what's the problem? Any other suggestion about the more appropriate test for this kind of data would valuable.
