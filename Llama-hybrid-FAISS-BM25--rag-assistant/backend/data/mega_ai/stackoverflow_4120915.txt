CSS: Unordered List Styling

I need to create a CSS class that will allow me to list all the ingredients in a recipe. Here are the specifications for the unordered list: Left indent No bullet or other icon No space between heading (H2) and first item in list No space between items in list Space after last item in list I need to do this without effecting the regular paragraphs, regular unordered lists, or other settings. Good at HTML; poor at CSS, so explicit directions would be helpful.
