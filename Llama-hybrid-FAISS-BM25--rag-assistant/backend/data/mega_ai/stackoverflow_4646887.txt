This may help.. SubClass1 and SubClass2 will by definition be serializable However as advised pay particular attention to fields contained in both SubClass1 and SubClass2 . Paying attention to the below restriction described in the JDK. During deserialization, the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class. A no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is serializable. The fields of serializable subclasses will be restored from the stream. Be sure to make "un-serialisable" fields as transient or act as appropriate.
