These responses don't tell you that gacutil resides in C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1* by the way. I didn't have it in my v2.0 folder. But I tried dragging & dropping the DLL into the C:\WINDOWS\Assembly folder as was suggested here earlier and that was easier and does work, as long as it's a .NET library. I also tried a COM library and this failed with an error that it was expecting an assembly manifest. I know that wasn't the question here, but thought I'd mention that in case someone finds out they can't add it, that that might be why. -Tom
