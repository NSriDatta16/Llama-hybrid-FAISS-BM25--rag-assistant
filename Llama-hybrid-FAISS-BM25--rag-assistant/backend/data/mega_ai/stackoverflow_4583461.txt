jQuery - Drag of elements in areas - then not draggable any more

I have three div areas. Creating an element, which is draggable() with jQuery UI, I can drag it all over the screen. Dropping it in a special area, then I can not drag it any more. I created a full working demo: http://jsbin.com/enusu4/2/ There you can create a draggable element which is placed into the left green area. Dragging it to the middle or right green area, I can not drag the element. I increment the zIndex of the elements, but it does not work. Does anyone can help me, what's wrong? Best Regards.
