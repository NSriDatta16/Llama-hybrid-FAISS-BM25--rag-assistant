This doesn't seem like a machine learning problem. If the time between scans is less than the timeout period then you can simply keep track of how many devices there are in the space and know for sure. If not, then you can use the examples and come up with a heuristic based on the parameters you have (number of known devices) and derivative parameters (e.g. average time left in timeout periods) to estimate the number of devices in the space. I would play around with the data in a spreadsheet to find a good set of parameters and derivatives and only then decide how to solve this. I suspect that machine learning may not be necessary and that you can come up with a simple heuristic to predict the number of devices. For example, you may find that there are between 10% and 30% more devices present then the number of devices you are connected to and that the % greater is correlated with the average period. In this case a simple heuristic like this may be accurate enough: $$numDevices = numDetected * ( 1 + (maxPeriod/avgPeriod)*0.30)\,$$
