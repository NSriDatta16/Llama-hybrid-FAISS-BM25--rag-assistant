Using Magento Embedded ERP, how do I configure the Magento Client Computer on the server

I'm using Magento 1.4.1.1, and Maison du Logiciel's extension Embedded ERP 2.7.5.6. Apparently I need a MagentoClientComputer.xml file but it's not included in the EE-2.7.5.6.zip package at all! I looked it over more than once and I looked at the installed files of the Magento Client Computer program and can't find it at all. What am I supposed to do? What do I need to be able to configure the Client Computer settings on the server?
