How do I determine the points in a line, in order, from P1 to P2?

Hey guys. I'm trying to make a simple game for Android in which the player drags a space ship with one thumb and fires at enemy ships by tapping empty space with the other thumb. Thing is, to animate the bullets traveling across space, I need the list of points between the user's spaceship, and the end of the screen, the line passing through the place the user tapped. I know I have to parametrize the line, and have read some about the subject, but I can't quite grasp it, especially on how to convert it to code. The way I see it, I need to convert the line segment between the user's ship (P1) and the place the user taps (P2) the smallest possible piece, the rate of change between x and y, the slope, I guess. Once I have that I can just multiply the rate of change by the distance from P1 to get the desired point. But it ain't quite working. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: This is what I was doing. This is all to calculate the rate of change, which I use on the Beam's update method to update it's position by multiplying it by speed... Beam(Renderer r, float OX, float OY, float TX, float TY) { super(r); p.x = (int) OX; p.y = (int) OY; paint = new Paint(); paint.setColor(Color.BLUE); float X = TX - OX; float Y = TY - OY; boolean xPositive = X >= 0; boolean yPositive = Y >= 0; if(X
