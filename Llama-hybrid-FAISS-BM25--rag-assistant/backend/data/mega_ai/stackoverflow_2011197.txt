How do I get all instances that inherited from the same parent class in django

I have two models than inherited from the same abstract base class. I would expect to be able to get all instances from classes that are children of the base class with something like AbstractClass.objects.all() Of course I could join queries on all children but that's awful and it stops working if I add new children class. Is this possible with Django ORM ? What would be the elegant solution ?
