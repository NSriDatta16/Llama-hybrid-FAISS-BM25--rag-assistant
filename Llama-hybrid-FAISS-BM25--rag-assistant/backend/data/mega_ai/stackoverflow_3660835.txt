If your "remote" server is on a local windows network, you can simply copy the file from the server file system to a UNC path (\myserver\folder\file.txt) using the FileCopy statement. If not, you may want to look at using a Java agent, which would make more file transfer protocols easily accessible. In either case, be sure to understand the security restrictions on Notes agents - for your agent to run on the server and create a file on the server's file system, the agent will need to be flagged with a runtime security level of 2 or 3, and signed by an appropriately authorized ID.
