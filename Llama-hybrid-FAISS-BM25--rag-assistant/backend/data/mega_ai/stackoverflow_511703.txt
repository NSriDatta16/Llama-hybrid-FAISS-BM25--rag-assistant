"if I were to leave the company, they'd basically have nobody to maintain/add to it unless they retain on me as a consultant." Are you saying no one else can learn Python? I find that hard to believe. New technology is often introduced in small projects by knowledgeable people and diffused through the organization because the small projects were successful. Use Python. Be successful. Make your case based on your successes.
