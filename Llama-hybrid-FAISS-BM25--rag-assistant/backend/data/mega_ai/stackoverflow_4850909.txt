Qt designer - how to create QDialog?

It is possibility to create QDialog in Qt-creator like for example QForm (by clicking)? I've found several samples, but QDialog is created programmatically. I want to drag and drop buttons, listview and others components on QDialog. Now I can add new components only by modifying code. Thanks
