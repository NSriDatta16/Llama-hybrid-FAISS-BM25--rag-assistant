JQuery select() function issue in IE8

I am using IE8, I want to show a form with one text field as a dialog window and show the cursor pointer in the text field by default. This happens when user clicks on a link in the webpage. For this I have writter JQuery code as below. This works fine in Firefox but not in IE8 (that is cursor is not showing in the first text box). Any suggestions? $("#show_myform").click(function(event) { $("#myform").dialog({modal : true,draggable : false,resizable : false}); $("#myform :text:eq(0)").select(); });
