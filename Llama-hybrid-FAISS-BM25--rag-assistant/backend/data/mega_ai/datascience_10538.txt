What's the best way to rank aggregate imdb rating data?

I have an average rating of all votes as well as the total number of votes for all episodes of the TV show Always Sunny. Is it mathematically sound to?: 1) multiply each average rating by the total votes cast for that episode 2) take the array of all those values and normalize it so the lowest is 0 and the highest is 10 3) use that new value as the actual rating
