Are there any rules for choosing the size of a mini-batch?

When training neural networks, one hyperparameter is the size of a minibatch. Common choices are 32, 64, and 128 elements per mini batch. Are there any rules/guidelines on how big a mini-batch should be? Or any publications which investigate the effect on the training?
