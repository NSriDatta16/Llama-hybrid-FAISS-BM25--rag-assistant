Unless you use HTTPS throughout, you're vulnerable to HTTP sniffing, a la Firesheep. Eve, if you do use SSL, if the client page isn't SSL or contains any non-SSL Javascript (or non-SSL frames in the same domain), you're still vulnerable (and there's nothing you can do about it) To answer your stated question, it completely depends on your situation. EDIT : You should warn your clients (developers) in the documentation page to handle the key correctly. Beyond that, it depends on the average skill level of the clients. You should probably have a disclaimer of some sort (I am not a lawyer). It's probably OK.
