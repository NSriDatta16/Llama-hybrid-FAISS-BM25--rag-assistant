This is called a union and intended behavior of this type of record declaration. case Device : TInputDevice of ... is the "magic" here. In a union the storage of members is "shared". Edit: taking the record you have in terms of byte offsets (... under the assumption that sizeof(TSDLKey) = 4 ): ------------------------------------------------ 00 | Key | MouseButton | Axis | Which | Button | ---| |-------------|------|-------|--------| 01 | | | | | | ---| |-------------|------|-------|--------| 02 | | | | | | ---| |-------------|------|-------|--------| 03 | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------ By the rules I know, TInputDevice should be an enum type, otherwise you'd have to explicitly give Integer there: type xyz = record case integer of 0: (foo: Byte); 1: (bar: Integer); end; NB: it is customary for variant types to have one member describe which of the union members should be picked and valid (nested unions).
