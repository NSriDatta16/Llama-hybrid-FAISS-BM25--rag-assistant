In short: neither are appropriate and you shouldn't try to interpret them. Measurements from the same experimental units are not independent. If G1 , G2 and G3 come from the same 7 fish, then you cannot use a test or model that assumes independent observations. This is no different for non-parametric statistics. You can model this dependence using a linear mixed effects model. By assuming that these fish come from a larger population of fish with random, normally distributed deviations from the 'average' fish w.r.t. the concentrations of these chemicals, we can estimate a random intercept for concentration. In $\textsf{R}$, you can do this quite easily with the package lme4 : # A great package for mixed models if(!require("lme4")){ install.packages("lme4") library("lme4") } # A package for, among many other things, nice QQ-plots (including 95%-CI) if(!require("car")){ install.packages("car") library("car") } # Your data M Why does this matter? Your standard deviations (and thus any claims of significance) can differ quite a lot depending on how your model your data. In some cases you will underestimate your standard errors and in others you will overestimate them. Take for example your own data and try and run a normal linear regression and a mixed model, using the same fixed effect ( bodypart ): LM See the large difference in standard error? That's what happens when you treat measurements of the same fish as though they were independent. This answer is already getting quite long and I recommend you read up on random and mixed effect models, but I'll try to give you an intuitive interpretation of why this difference can be so large, simply by plotting your data: By calculating a random offset for each fish, we get a much clearer picture of what the effect of each body part is on the concentration. Of course you could argue that a linear model with a fixed effect for fish also sees that these are different fish, however: (1) Body parts are still very much nested in fish, so this wouldn't solve the dependence issue (2) Estimating 7 different offsets would be a huge waste of your small sample size, when instead you can estimate a single random distribution from which your fish' offsets come. I hope to have convinced you of the need to study mixed models a bit before trying out study designs with dependency.
