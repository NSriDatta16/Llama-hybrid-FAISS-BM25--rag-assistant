The difference is in how R and SPSS interpret the word "loading". Loadings in PCA should be defined as eigenvectors of the covariance matrix scaled by the square roots of the respective eigenvalues. Please see e.g. my answer here for motivation: How does "Fundamental Theorem of Factor Analysis" apply to PCA, or how are PCA loadings defined? This is the definition followed by SPSS. However, what R (unfortunately) calls "loadings" are non-scaled eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Therefore, your two plots should differ in scaling by a square root of the first eigenvalue. As the scaling factor seems to be $\approx 2.5$, the first eigenvalue should be approximately equal to $2.5^2=6.25$, as @whuber hinted in the comments above.
