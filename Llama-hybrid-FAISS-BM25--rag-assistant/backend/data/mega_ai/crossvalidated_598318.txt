The right sampling ratio for bootstrapped logistic regression

I am modeling a logistic regression of a binary outcome on several continuous and dichotomous variables and covariates. The sample is large, around 600k. The outcome variable is positive around 40% of the time, while some of the covariates have less coverage (not missingness), only occurring in around 10% of samples. Is there a "right" sampling ratio for each iteration of the bootstrap procedure? If I sample 20% of the existing data for each bootstrap I still have 120k samples and can quickly run more iterations. But I have not seen a good rule of thumb as to whether this is sufficient or if I want a much higher ratio.
