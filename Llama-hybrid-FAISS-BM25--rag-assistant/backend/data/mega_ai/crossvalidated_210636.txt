Yes, you should use a distribution that is designed to model the data you have. Don't think of dt as a model of prediction errors. It's your model of the distribution of your response variable conditional on the predictors. Your response is a rate. If you can model it with a beta distribution, you should model it with a beta distribution. Do beware the folk theorem propagated by Andrew Gelman: paraphrasing, it says that if your statistical computation is difficult, it is probably your model that needs to be revised. That said, statistical computation (and especially Bayesian statistical computation) is easier than ever with Stan , and issues like lack of conjugacy are no longer (by themselves) an obstacle. Beta regression in Stan is straightforward: see How can I model a proportion with BUGS/JAGS/STAN? for an appropriate parameterization that might set you at ease about priors. If you are using the correct distribution to model your responses, no, you don't need to transform your responses. You do, however, need to transform your predictors . Your model will be numerically unstable when the variable scales differ dramatically, and even when they only differ by small amounts it is hard to separate differing effect sizes from differing predictor variances. I heard Gelman talk at the beginning of last month, and he said that normal(0, 1) was his "new favorite prior." He is a big proponent of parameterizing your model in such a way that your parameters are all on the same scale, and I believe this is very reasonablw advice. If you read the above two points, hopefully you'll realize that it's not a big deal! But you absolutely can and should check the results of your entire model . Likely you will end up wanting to change something other than your priors.
