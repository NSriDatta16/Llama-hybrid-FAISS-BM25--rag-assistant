Order images in the correct order

This is a captcha where you have to select the side that makes more sense. I am trying to use machine learning trying to break it. My approach is to use Google's vision AI to extract keywords from those images and then use a markov chain and machine learning to predict the correct order. Is there a better approach in your opinion? What are the chances to get it working?
