Does NSHTTPCookieStorage persist across apps?

So I was just curious if the NSHTTPCookieStorage was persistent across applications, or local only to the current one. I want some cookies gathered in another app to be accessible in a search app. Is that how it works? Thanks! PS: This is on the iPhone or iPad.
