The "Some text!!" does not have a scope . Scope is a property of a named entity. More precisely, it is a property of the name itself. "Some text!!" is a nameless object - a string literal. It has no name, and therefore any discussions about its "scope" make no sense whatsoever. It has no scope. What you seem to be asking about is not scope . It is lifetime or storage duration of "Some text!!" . String literals in C/C++ have static storage duration , meaning that they live "forever", i.e. as long as the program runs. So, the memory occupied by "Some text!!" is never released. Just keep in mind (as a side note) that string literals are non-modifyable objects. It is illegal to write into that memory.
