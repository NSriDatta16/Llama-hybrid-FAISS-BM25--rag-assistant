I don't know if it's your case, but that happened to me when I started analyzing time series in R and the issue was that I hadn't correctly stated the time series period when creating the time series object to decompose it. There is a parameter in the time series function that lets you specify its frequency. Doing so, it correctly decomposes its seasonal trends.
