Shared Access Signatures have an optional component called a "container-level access policy." If you used a container-level access policy, that actually gets stored in blob storage and has a limit of five per container. If you don't use a container-level access policy, you can make as many Shared Access Signatures as you want, and the server isn't even involved. (The signature is generated locally, meaning in your web role instance.) Generated the signature does involve some crypto, so you may eventually peg the CPU, but I suspect it's "fast enough."
