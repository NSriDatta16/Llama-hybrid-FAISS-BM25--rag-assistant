what is the best performance mesure for spam filtering ?

I have a SVM model for spam filtering and the resultat are like follows : true negative : 115 , false positive : 15 false negative : 66, true positive : 64 We have these mesures: True Positive Rate (TPR) or Hit Rate or Recall or Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) False Positive Rate(FPR) or False Alarm Rate = 1 - Specificity = 1 - (TN / (TN + FP)) Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) Error Rate = 1 â€“ accuracy or (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) Precision = TP / (TP + FP) F-measure = 2 / ( (1 / Precision) + (1 / Recall) ) Which one would be the most accurate if want to have the least important emails going to the spam folder and the least spams going to the important emails folder ? I want to be less tolerant with having an important email going to spam folder
