If the values are missing at random and you are sure that your data matrix is of low rank, you can use nuclear norm basis pursuit method (also known as matrix completion ). The method (among others) is implemented in TFOCS . In many real-world applications, the data matrix has rarely full rank, so the assumption of low-rank matrix can be acceptable. On the other hand, the values might not be missing truly at random. Another approach would be to use Singular Spectrum Analysis ( SSA ), also known as the Caterpillar algorithm. It can be used for time-series data with missing values. This algorithm is not very well-known but in literature it is sometimes called "PCA for time-series data".
