WebKit, embedding, dynamic resources

I assume you can embed WebKit into another desktop app and send a string to it, say: Hello world! and it will display it inside the window. My question is, how do I send an image to it, if I have its compressed representation (JPEG dump) loaded in memory? E.g.: unsigned char image[] = {123, 183, 234, ... }; Related question, what happens if I write: at the URL end, there has to be web server, OK - but is there a way to display an image in WebKit without a web server?
