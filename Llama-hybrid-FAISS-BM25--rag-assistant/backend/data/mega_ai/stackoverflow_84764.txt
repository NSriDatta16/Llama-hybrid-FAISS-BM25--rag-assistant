I'm not a PERL programmer, but here's a little extra feature you might want to investigate. Have a look at the concept of external tables in Oracle. You create a table with a definition of something similar to the following:- CREATE TABLE MY_TABLE ( COL1 NUMBER(2), COL2 VARCHAR2(20 BYTE) ) ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL ( TYPE ORACLE_LOADER DEFAULT DIRECTORY SOME_DIRECTORY_NAME ACCESS PARAMETERS ( FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' MISSING FIELD VALUES ARE NULL ) LOCATION (SOME_DIRECTORY_NAME:'my_file.csv') ) REJECT LIMIT UNLIMITED; Note this DDL statement assumes you have a directory already created called "SOME_DIRECTORY_NAME". You can then issue DML commands to get data into or out of this table, and once the commit has been done, the data is all nice and neat in your file my_file.csv. After that, do your PERL magic to get the file wherever you want it to be.
