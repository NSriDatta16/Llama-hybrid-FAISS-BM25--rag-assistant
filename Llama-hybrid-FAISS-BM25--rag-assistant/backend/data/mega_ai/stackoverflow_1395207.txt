If you choose a hash you need to take into account collissions. Even with a large hash like MD5 you have to account the meet-in-the-middle probability, better known as birthday attack . For a smaller hash like CRC-32 the collision probability will be quite large and your WHERE has to specify hash and the full URL. But I gotta ask, is this the best way to spend your efforts? Is there nothing else left to optimize? You may be well doing premature optimizations unless you have clear metrics and measurements indicating that this problem is the bottleneck of the system. After all, this kind of seek is what databases are optimized for (all of them), and by doing something like a hash you may actually decrease performance (eg. your index may become fragmented becuase hashes have a different distribution than URLs).
