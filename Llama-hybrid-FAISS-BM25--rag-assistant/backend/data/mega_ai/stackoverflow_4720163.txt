Brute force attack permutations

Assuming an alphanumeric password of 8 characters the amount of permutations by my understanding would be. 26 lowercase 26 uppercase 10 digits So if you were to do a brute force attack on this password the amount of tries on average would be (62 ^ 8) / 2 However assuming you knew that the password was at least 4 digits long and therefore excluded any attempts on the first 4 digits would the answer to the remaining permutations not be ((62 ^ 8) â€“ (62 ^ 4)) / 2 ? Am I missing something here or is that the correct answer?
