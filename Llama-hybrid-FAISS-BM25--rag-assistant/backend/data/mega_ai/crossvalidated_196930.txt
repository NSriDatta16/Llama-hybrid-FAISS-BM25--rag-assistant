How to get R squared/goodness of fit for Tobit model in R?

I do a Tobit regression to analyze censored data. To measure the goodness of fit the authors of these papers use Efron's $R^2$. So my idea is to use this one as well. To realize my Tobit regression, I use the tobit() function of the AER package which is a wrapper of the survreg function. That works fine but I'm not able to get a $R^2$ of my model. In a similar study before I used a logistic regression and calculated the Pseudo $R^2$ with the Pseudo Rsquared function of the BaylorEdPsych package which worked great. Now I'm searching a solution like that for my tobit regression. So: How do I compute a goodness of fit measure like Efron's $R^2$ for my Tobit model in R ? I don't need a certain package, if someone could give me a R snippet of computing the measure with my model. PS: I also tried with VGLM from the VGAM package but no success.....
