The early stopping and watchlist parameters in xgboost can be used to prevent overfitting. If the watchlist is given two data-sets, then the algorithm will perform hold out validation as described here . Putting the test set in the watchlist will cause the algorithm to select the model with the best performance against the test set which can be considered as cheating. I was calling my algorithm like this train But I should have been calling it like this train_and_val I found this article very informative with regards to early stopping and xgboost XGBoost Validation and Early Stopping in R
