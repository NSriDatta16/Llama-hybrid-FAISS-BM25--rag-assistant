After raging hours of debugging and trying to solve the problem, I finally found out what's causing the problem. Please let me explain From Rails app, when I call ajax requests like jQuery.post( "/times/add"+ "?day_id=" + $('#day_id').val() + "&pool_id=" + $('#pool_id').val() ,null, function(data) { $('#container').html(data); }, "script"); , it seems JQuery expects the response to be a "script" (since I uses 'script' option in the jQuery.post method). But in my controller of the Rails app, I was responding to that request as follows: respond_to do |format| format.html { render :action => 'embed' } format.js { render :partial => 'embed_' + @size, :locals => {:timetable_entries => @timetable_entries} } end I was responding the request with a partial which is just 'html.erb' file which has mixed codes including JS, HTML and Ruby. And after testing for some hours, I found out that I still have various kinds of error in the firebug even without the javascript in the response data. It gives me "XML cannot be the whole program" error when I have no js code in there. So after reading this , I realize that I am returning the response data in wrong format. So I changed my controller to respond like this. respond_to do |format| format.html { render :action => 'embed' } format.js end which will basically expect 'add.js' file to process the javascripts. So I created the add.js and in there I put this. $("#container").html(" 'embed_' + @size, :locals => {:timetable_entries => @timetable_entries}) %>"); Then only I see no more errors in the browser. I hope this will save hours of frustrations for those who have same problem like me. Cheers.
