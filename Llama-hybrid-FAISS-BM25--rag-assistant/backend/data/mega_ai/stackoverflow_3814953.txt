sql server 2005 problem - defrag necessary?

I insert some data into a sql server 2005 database using NHibernate. Before I insert an object I check whether it already exists based on its primary key. Every 100000 or so lookups this seems to throw some exception (if I do the same via sql it takes ages as well). A defragmentation of the hard disk seems to help but seems a bit strange that I have to do this - or is this normal? BTW I know that I could use bulk insert but had to opt for NHibernate for certain reasons ... Thanks. Christian
