How to get Google to understand links that trigger Javascript?

I'm developing a website that helps people understand rap lyrics. Users see the lyrics of a rap song and can click certain lyrics to see an explanation: (click here for more) As you can see, each explanation has a permalink (in this case http://RapExegesis.com/2636 ). Here's what happens when you visit one of these permalinks in your browser: The app looks up the correct song and artist and redirects you to http://rapexegesis.com/lyrics/ARTIST/SONG#note-2633 (in this case http://rapexegesis.com/lyrics/Jay-z/Empire-state-of-mind#note-2636 ) When a song page loads, the app checks to see whether there's a "note-\d+" in the URL fragment If there is, it automatically open the correct explanation, and scrolls it into view Ideally Google and other search engines would associate these permalinks with their corresponding explanations. However, because Google doesn't understand Javascript, these two URLs look exactly the same to it: http://rapexegesis.com/lyrics/Jay-z/Empire-state-of-mind#note-2636 http://rapexegesis.com/lyrics/Jay-z/Empire-state-of-mind And therefore, http://rapexegesis.com/lyrics/Jay-z/Empire-state-of-mind looks exactly the same as http://RapExegesis.com/2636 to Google as well. Obviously this is not ideal. Any thoughts? Ideally I'd like to show search engines a different version of http://RapExegesis.com/2636 -- something like Lyric : Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry Meaning : "In the kitchen" refers to cooking up crack (cf. here , here , and here ) Vanessa and Angela Simmons, the twentysomething daughters of Reverend Run of Run-DMC , run Pastry , an apparel and shoe brand EDIT: The way I originally posed the question was a bit confusing. There are two separate issues: How do links to explanations on song pages work? How do URLs corresponding to standalone explanations work? This diagram ( full size here ) should make things a bit clearer:
