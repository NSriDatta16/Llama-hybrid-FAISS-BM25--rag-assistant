User inputed formula parsing (eval)

Good day all, I am trying to figure out how to allow users to call a method on some specified data. I would like to provide a predefined set of functions: Moving average, moving_ave(x,5) ..would be a 5 day moving average on x. 3*x+y....and so on... So basically, i will provide the users with various data series (x,y,z....) and a set of functions moving_ave, + - / * ....and they should be able to write simple formulas (restricted to the functions i provide). how can this be done? I will be deploying this on App Engine for Java . so for i have found out about JSR-223...but i'm not sure if its appropriate? I am thinking i can use the Eval function. Thanks,
