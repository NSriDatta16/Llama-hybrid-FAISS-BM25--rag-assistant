Regex or XML Parser C#

I have some word templates(dot/dotx) files that contain xml tags along with plain text. At run time, I need to replace the xml tags with their respective mail merge fields. So, need to parse the document for these xml tags and replace them with merge fields. I was using Regex to find and replace these xml tags. But I was suggested to use XML parser to parse for XML tags ([ Regex for string enclosed in , C# ). The sample document looks like: Solicitor Letter For the attention of: Dear RE: We were pleased to hear that contracts have now been exchanged in the sale of the above property on behalf of our mutual client/s. We now have pleasure in enclosing a copy of our invoice for your kind attention upon completion. .... One more note, the angle brackets are typed manually by end user in the template. I tried using XMLReader, but got error as my documents have no root tags on their own. Please guide if I should stick to Regex or is there any way to use XML Parser. Thank you!
