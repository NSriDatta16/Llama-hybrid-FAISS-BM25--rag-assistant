How to provide a workflow in C# application

I am building a project to automate the paper work in an organization. I have several tasks and i need to set a work flow for them using microsoft workflow item. I am using visual studio 2010 and C#. I am using microsoft SQL server for the database. Any ideas on how to implement that? It would be great if an example exists.
