Here's a simple approach: Imagine the ant performing its random walk on the cube for a long time (ignoring for a moment that you are interested in the time until the return to the origin point). By symmetry the expected proportion of time the ant will be at each corner is $1/8.$ So on average the time between visits to the origin must therefore be 8 steps. Since it's one minute per step, the expected time until the return to the origin is 8 minutes.
