Tensorflow has much more flexibility to do the things that you want. If you just want to train a standard CNN, then perhaps Theano will do the Job. If you want to do more funny stuff, like creating a new architecture, using a new learning rate schedule or test time augmentation, Theano is too much restrictive. I have also heard that Tensorflow is a bit more performant so it is better to use in production.
