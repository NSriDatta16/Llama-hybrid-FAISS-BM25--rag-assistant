Amazingly enough, that's given in their robots.txt. The link you're looking for is this one: http://www.facebook.com/apps/site_scraping_tos.php If you're not a huge organization already, don't expect to be explicitly whitelisted there. If you're not explicitly whitelisted, you're not allowed to crawl at all, according to the robots.txt and the TOS. You must use the API instead. Don't even think about pretending to be one of the whitelisted crawlers. Facebook filters by whitelisted IP for each crawler and anything else that looks at all like crawling gets an instant perma-ban. For a while users who simply clicked too fast could occasionally run into this.
