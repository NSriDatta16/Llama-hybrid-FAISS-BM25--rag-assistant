Lime Explainer: ValueError: training data did not have the following fields

I'm attempting to gather ID level drivers from my XGBoost classification model using LIME and I'm running into some odd errors. I'm using this link as a reference. Here is the overall code that I'm using: explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(Xs_train.values, class_names = [1.0, 0.0], kernel_width = 3) predict_fn_xgb = lambda x: trained_model.predict_proba(x).astype(float) data_point = Xs_val.values[5] exp = explainer.explain_instance(data_point, predict_fn_xgb, num_features = 10) exp.show_in_notebook(show_all = False) Key: trained_model: trained xgboost classification model class names: This is a binary classification model Xs_train: This is a (73548, 84) dimension training set. This was used to build the training_model Xs_val: This is a (4910, 84) dimension training set. The columns are the same with the training and validation set. data_point: one specific validation point Now, when I run this code, I get the following error: ValueError: expected res_time, email_views...training data did not have the following fields: f6, f49, f34, f21,... I don't know where the f# column names are coming from. Seems really bizarre and I believe I'm following the example correctly. Any help would be much appreciated. Let me know if any additional information is required.
