To answer your second question: When the view is executed, it tries to read a username from POST data. That means, your view should only be accessed after submitting the form (i.e. via POST together with username and password data) or you have to change your view: def my_view(request): if request.method == "POST": username = request.POST['username'] password = request.POST['password'] # gon on ... else: # just show the form Btw it is better to follow this tutorial than copy and pasting code fragments from a documentation page and try to get it working. These are just fragments, they don't contain all the needed code. No wonder that the code is not working. Read the Django book and then you can ask question if something is not working.
