I have a header file "MainEntryPoint.h" that contains the following text: #pragma once #if defined _MSC_VER #if !defined _WINDLL #pragma comment(linker, "/subsystem:windows /ENTRY:mainCRTStartup") #endif #endif I #include this file in the main.cpp file of any project that needs to be a windows rather than console app As I do cross-platform work I prefer to use the standard ( main() ) C / C++ entry point for all my projects. (The guard macro's automatically ensure it only applies to DevStudio builds and excludes messing with the entry point when building a dll).
