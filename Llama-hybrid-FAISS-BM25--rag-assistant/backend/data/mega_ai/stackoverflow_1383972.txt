Does one use WF and WCF together to build a messaging system?

I am looking to build an messaging infrastructure to facilitate communications between different systems in our organization. There are many way to go about this. I have looked into nServiceBus and MassTransit. How does WF/WCF fit into this - if at all? If it does, are there any good articles, documentation or books that focus on this type of solution specifically?
