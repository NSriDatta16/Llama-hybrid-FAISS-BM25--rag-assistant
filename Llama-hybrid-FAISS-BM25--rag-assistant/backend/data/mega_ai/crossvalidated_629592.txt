Importance of goodness of fit in Hypothesis testing

I am struggling with one question. Is goodness of fit of a model necessary when your purpose is to test hypothesis regarding a coefficient? To be specific, I am regressing formal credit access on gender (variable of interest) and other predictor variables. Logistic regression with svy prefix in Stata is used. It is observed that while full model is a good fit as per Archer-Lemeshow test, logistic models on sub-population are mostly not. Is it necessary that all the sub-population models should be a good fit?
