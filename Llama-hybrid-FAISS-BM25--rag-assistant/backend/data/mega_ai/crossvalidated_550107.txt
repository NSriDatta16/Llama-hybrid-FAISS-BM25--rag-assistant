In short, yes this is very possible, and probably even the generic situation. PCA components have the special feature that they are mutually uncorrelated. If we call your PCA components $x_a$ , then $$cov(x_a, x_b) = 0 ~~~ \text{for} ~ a \neq b$$ But they can still be correlated with some other variable, i.e. you can have $$cov(x_a, y) \neq 0 ~~~ \text{and} ~~~ cov(x_b, y) $$ at the same time. One can prove this mathematically, but the geometric interpretation of the sample (co)variance helps seeing this intuitively here: Say we label your datapoints by the index $i = 1 , \cdots , N$ , then we can think of each principal component as a vector $ \vec{x_a} $ by simply stacking the observed values together $$\vec{x_a} = (x_{a,1}, x_{a,2}, \cdots, x_{a,N} )^T $$ Now, looking at the definition of variance $$ var(x_a) = \mathbb{E}[x_a^2] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_{a,i}^2 $$ where we used w.l.o.g that the PCAs are centered, i.e. $\mathbb{E}[x_a] = 0$ . Now you can see that the variance of $x_a$ is simply the Euclidean norm, aka length , of the vector $\vec{x_a}$ $$ var(x_a) = \frac{1}{N} ||\vec{x_a}||^2 $$ Similarly, looking at the covariance $$ cov(x_a,x_b) = \mathbb{E}[x_a x_b]= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_{a,i}x_{b,i} $$ we recognise that as the dot product of $\vec{x_a}$ with $\vec{x_b}$ $$ cov(x_a,x_b) = \frac{1}{N} \, \vec{x_a} \cdot \vec{x_b} = \frac{1}{N} \, |\vec{x_a}| \, |\vec{x_b}| \, \cos(\phi_{ab}) $$ and $ cov(x_a,y) = \frac{1}{N} \, \vec{x_a} \cdot \vec{y}$ . Having this geometric interpretation of variance and covariance allows us to re-state the question in a way that makes the answer obvious: Can you have two orthogonal vectors, $\vec{x_a} $ and $\vec{x_b} $ , which each have overlap with some other vector $\vec{y} $ ? The answer to that is clearly yes... a simple example of that is the 2-d plane: say $\vec{x_a} $ points along the horizontal axis and $\vec{x_b} $ points along the vertical axis, then they are mutually orthogonal and any other generic vector in the 2-d plane will have some non-zero overlap with both of them This also answers your second question: no it's not useless to do a fit with multiple principal components and one response variable :)
