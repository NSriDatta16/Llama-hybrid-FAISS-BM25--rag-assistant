Patterns for item selection in component based application

We are currently building an application which visualizes thousands of entities, simultaneously, in different ways - for example in a geographical map view, or in a data grid. These entities are organized hierarchically, and so there are various meaningful subgrouping of entities. Also the map view lets you make arbitrary selections using a lasoo-type tool. What we need is for all views to be synchronized such that what you select in one view is reflected in the others. Each of these view components do not know about each other. Im looking for design patterns and/or open source applications which demonstrate approaches to item selction in a complex multi-view app.
