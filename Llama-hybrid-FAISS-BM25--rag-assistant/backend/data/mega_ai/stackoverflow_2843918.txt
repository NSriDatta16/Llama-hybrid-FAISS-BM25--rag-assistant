Could be that the inserts either: a) impacted table/index statistics such that a better execution plan for the selects was chosen. b) kept data required by the selects in the buffer. Might be interesting to capture perfmon logs for comparison, paying particular attention to 'Buffer Manager/Buffer Cache Hit Ratio' and 'Page Life Expectancy', along with usual suspects i.e. CPU, Physical Disk etc. Take a SQL profiler trace for the duration of both tests and run the output through a trace scrubber ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa175800%28sql.80%29.aspx ).
