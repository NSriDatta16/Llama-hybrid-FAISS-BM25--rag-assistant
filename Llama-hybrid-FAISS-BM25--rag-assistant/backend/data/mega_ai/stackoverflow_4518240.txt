As Mike says, look at the code created as part of a new DataBound application. Also, rather than displaying data in a grid, it's probably better to display data vertically in a column: And as a quick way to see what this might look like when populated: public partial class MainPage : PhoneApplicationPage { public MainPage() { InitializeComponent(); Loaded += MainPage_Loaded; } void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { // This would really be the data returned from the web service var sampleData = new WsData { Name = "Girilas & Gandhi Nagar", ID = "842", City = "Bangalore", Category = "Shopping Mall", Others = "AC Types: central\n AC, Split AC Windows\nACWhirlpool:\nMicrowave Oven ..." }; this.DataContext = sampleData; } } public class WsData { public string Name { get; set; } public string ID { get; set; } public string City { get; set; } public string Category { get; set; } public string Others { get; set; } }
