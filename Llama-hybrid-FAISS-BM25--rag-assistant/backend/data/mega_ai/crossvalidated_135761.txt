What is the name of this validation procedure?

I have a set of classified data. In order to test the precision of several algorithms- I split the data into train and test sets. For the test set I choose at random 30% of the data and the rest is for the train set. I do $N$ iterations in which I split the data this way and take the average precision of the $N$ iterations. Does this validation procedure has a specific name?
