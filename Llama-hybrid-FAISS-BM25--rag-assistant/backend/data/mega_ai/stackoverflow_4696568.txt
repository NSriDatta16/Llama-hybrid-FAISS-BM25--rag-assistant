Are you upgrading current products in your catalog from a previous version of magento or are these new products you creating in the admin? Please clarify what you mean by attribute and product options... not sure what you mean since magento uses attributes(global) and custom options(per product). My first attempt at helping you would be to uninstall any third-party extensions - it should lead you to the problem.
