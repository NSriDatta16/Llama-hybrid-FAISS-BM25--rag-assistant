We do this by storing the rules (or similar) in the Application state. We load the values in Session_Start (with a test to ensure that we only do it once) - I have a comment in Application_Start that states: "moved to session start because it seems to work better" Something like this: Application.Lock(); // Only load the rules if we haven't already if (Application["RulesCache"] == null) { List rules = LoadRules(); Application["RulesCache"] == rules; } Application.Unlock(); We're actually a little more sophisticated than this - but the basic premise is valid. Pragmatically, you'd want to encapsulate the load into a separate routine and probably provide a mechanism to update the cache without having to restart the application
