The manner you described sounds like a good way to implement this yes. I don't know if there are different approaches. I implemented something similar on a previous site (www.ponyhof.be) although there's no droppable implementation. You're welcome to take a look at the code, it's not really a beauty but it works. On this site I made one main page with an empty info panel (draggable) where I loaded info via Ajax. Since I made this site I learned some things that would have eased the implementation (so now I would make it differently). More specific, I would make better use of the jQuery's delegate-method which can automatically attach actions to links which are loaded via ajax (on ponyhof.be I attached them after ajaxComplete event was fired). But in general I think what you propose sounds like a good way of building such an interface and I didn't come across something better.
