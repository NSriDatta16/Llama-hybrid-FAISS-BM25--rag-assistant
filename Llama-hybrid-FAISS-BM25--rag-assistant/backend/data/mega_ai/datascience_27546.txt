Can PCA be applied to reduce dimensionality of only a subset of features?

Lets say I have a feature set of f0 to f1000 . I am thinking of applying PCA on f500 to f1000 reducing their dimensionality . Can I combine this reduced set with the features f0 to f499 as the feature space for training a learning algorithm?
