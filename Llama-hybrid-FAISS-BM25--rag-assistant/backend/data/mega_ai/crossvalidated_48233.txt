Variable selection and logistic regression

I am using Matlab, I have a $600 \times 9$ matrix with each row representing the 9 features which I am trying to evaluate using logistic regression. I understand that I need to perform feature scaling, but do I need to perform it on both the training and the testing set as well? I have 9 features, up to which degree do I need to perform regularization... up to which higher order degree for 9 features do I need to consider? How do I check which features are contributing more or less? How do I divide my training and testing set, which ratio is the most ideal?
