It looks like you might use multiple layers: one for each background and another for the rest in the foreground. So that you can apply animations and transformations on each layer separately. This is a solution that I have been succesfully using in Flex with Sprites: organized a display list using separated graphical objects layered one above another and moving/rotating/fading and whatever applied to any of them. As a design principle it should work in all graphical environments including iOS. The one thing to take into account: transformations applied on the superlayer of the children layers affect all sublayers at once.
