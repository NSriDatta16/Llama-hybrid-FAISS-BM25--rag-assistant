You could try a RegressorChain() to predict $\hat{y}_1,... ,\hat{y}_n$ and compare the results to a model where you predict $\hat{y}_{total}$ . RegressorChain() may help to pick up useful information regarding the $y_1,...,y_n$ in the modeling process: Each model makes a prediction in the order specified by the chain using all of the available features provided to the model plus the predictions of models that are earlier in the chain. You could also compare the sum of $\hat{y}_1,... ,\hat{y}_n$ to $\hat{y}_{total}$ and see if you can gain knowledge about the quality of prediction of a single observation ex-post. Finally you could average or stack the chained model(s) with the model predicting only $\hat{y}_{total}$ .
