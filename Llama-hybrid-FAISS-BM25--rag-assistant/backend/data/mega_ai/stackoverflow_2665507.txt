Custom title bar without padding (Android)

So I am using the techniques in this thread to use a custom background for my titlebar. Unfortunately the framework places my layout inside a FrameLayout ( title_container ) which has padding as seen below. (source: ggpht.com ) Is there anyway to remove the grey borders? The frame layout is defined in com.android.internal.R.id.title_container , so accessing the frame by ID would be fragile.
