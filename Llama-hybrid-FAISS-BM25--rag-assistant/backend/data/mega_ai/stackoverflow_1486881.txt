4D is a good option for vertial applications. I have worked for a company which used 4D to build a medical records and billing application for general practitioners and specialists. The rapid design and deployment features of 4D enabled the application to quickly move with market desires and legislated changes to medical record storage.The environment itself was not cutting edge, but it was integrated, cross platform and very productive. If you are entering a market with high vendor lock-in and a high barrier to entry, then I think proprietory integrated development environments are a good option.
