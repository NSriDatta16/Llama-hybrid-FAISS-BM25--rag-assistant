This is linked to causal inference. The potential outcomes/counterfactual model will be useful for conceptualization. One easy way to do this is to use the g-formula. The g-formula is essentially the same as do-calculus. For an introductory paper, I would recommend this article by Snowden et al. 2011 The key part of the application of the g-formula is the identifiability assumptions. Common ones are exchangeability, causal consistency, and positivity. This paper describes the conditions. Exchangeability is the assumption that there is no common cause of $x_j$ and $y$ . This is the d-separation rule of do-calculus. Causal consistency implies that you have sufficiently specified $x_j$ so that there is no difference in $y$ by residual differences in $x_j$ . You can think about this as assuming taking an aspirin in the morning versus night has no difference on mortality. Positivity is the assumption that all individuals have a non-zero probability of having all values of $x_j$ . Westreich & Cole provide further details. Having said that, I would be careful with the usage of machine learning for causal inference. In general, confidence intervals for the g-formula are calculated by bootstrapping. There has been a lot of work showing that confidence intervals based on bootstrapping procedures is invalid for machine learning algorithms, like random forests. For an example, see Naimi & Edwards . Lastly, since you mentioned that $x_j$ is a continuous variable, you will need to consider how $x_j$ is changed. You can imagine that everyone's $x_j$ is shifted by some quantity $\delta$ . Alternatively, you can set a threshold, $\gamma$ , where those below (above) are shifted to $\gamma$ . The remainder of individuals retain their $x_j$ value
