To extend and clarify what others have said: committing often and flexible pushing are not mutually exclusive. You do want to plan ahead, and make your commits such that you'll be able to adapt. This means two things: you need to make sure you really commit often, and you need to branch (as in git) frequently. If your commits are small, it'll be easier to reorganize them later should you need to selectively group together part of your work. And if your branches are well-organized, you may already have a branch which is exactly what you want to push. Compare these two: One branch, few commits: - A1 - B1 - C1 - B2 - A2 - B3 - C3 (master) Many branches, many commits: M1 - M2 (master) / o - A1 - A2 - A3 - A4 - A5 - A6 (topicA) |\ | B1 - B2 - B3 - B4 - B5 - B6 - B7 (topicB) \ C1 - C2 - C3 - C4 - C5 (topicC) Now, if you want to release any of those three topics as-is, all you have to do is merge it to master and push! If you want to release half of topicA, and that half is taken care of in commits A1, A3, A4, and A6, all you have to do is rebase topicA to place those four commits first, merge the last of them into master, and push. The remainder of topicA (A2 and A5) can hang around for further work. M1 - M2 ------------- X (master) / / o - A1 - A3' - A4' - A6' - A2' - A5' (topicA) (Commits denoted by A1', ... because with git, a two commits with the same contents but different parents are actually different commits.)
