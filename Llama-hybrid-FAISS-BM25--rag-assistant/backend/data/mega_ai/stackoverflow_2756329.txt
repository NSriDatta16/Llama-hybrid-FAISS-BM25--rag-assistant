I had a similar problem and solved it with the --omit option. This made it run much faster and reduced the size of coverage.xml from 2MB to 70kB. --omit=PRE1,PRE2,... Omit files when their filename path starts with one of these prefixes. I'm on Mac OS X, so I omitted the /Library/ and /Applications/ folders: $ coverage xml --omit=/Library/,/Applications/ On other systems, you may find --omit=/usr/ more helpful.
