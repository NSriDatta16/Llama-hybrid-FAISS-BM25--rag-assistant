What is the best way to black-list search engines?

I have built a photo community web application in PHP/MySQL, using CodeIgniter as a framework. All content is public so search engines regularly drop by. This is exactly what I want, yet it has two unwanted side effects: Each visit creates a session in my session table. Each visit of a search engine to a photo page increases the view counter As for the second problem, I am rewriting the call to my view count script to be called from javascript only, that should prevent a count increase from search engines, right? As for the session table, my thinking was to clean it up after the fact using a cron, to not have an impact on performance. I'm recording the IP and user agent string in the session table so it appears to me that a blacklist approach is best? If so, what is the best way to approach it? Is there an easy/reusable way to determine that a session is from a search engine?
