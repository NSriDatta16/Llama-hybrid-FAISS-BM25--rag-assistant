The auto.arima AIC procedure might work ok if there were no pulses, level shifts, seasonal pulses, local time trends, transient(changes) in parameters at particular points in time, transient (changes) in error variance at particular points in time. If you have any of these circumstances you may be at risk. While standard acf and pacf identification schemes are also subject to these "requirements" , modern procedures using robust EACF and other aggressively analytical procedures should be investigated. Your post is similar to many others reflecting on poor automatic identification leading to poor estimation results e.g. How to fit a model for a time series that contains outliers and What type of time series model would be good? and Auto.arima vs autobox do they differ? for recent activity on this important subject. You might want to post your data ,your potentially deficient model identification results and your potentially deficient estimation results and see if there are any takers to help you to come up with a potentially quality result.
