How to test the directionality trend and significance of a set of vectors?

I calculated a directionality map, where at each point (x,y) I have a jackknife sample (n=8) of 2d vector displacements $\vec{D}_k$ ( $k=1,...,8$ are the black vectors in the figure below; red vector -> "centroid" or average weighted by magnitude; magenta -> simple mean vector). The figure represents a single (x,y) position in the map. I want to know if these vectors have a "directionality trend" and if this trend is significant . For example: I could assume that if the sample vectors are (in average) pointing within a $\Delta\theta$ angle about the mean or centroid with p , then there is a trend and the mean direction is significant. $\Delta\theta$ is a free parameter, for example. I have very little knowledge of statistics (although I have implemented t-tests before, and I understand correlation, covariance, and can calculate it in the context of Statistical Physics). So the more details the better (I'm using MATLAB for this project). PS1: ChatGPT gave me many suggestions, although most of them didn't seem to directly apply here. One seemed useful: it suggested I could use the Wilcoxon signed rank test for each of the vectors' components separately; the nice thing is that it's implemented in matlab as signrank . The problem I see here is that this would compare to a zero median, and then it can only tell me if the trend is in one of the four quadrants relative to a median of the x or y coordinates of $\vec{D}$ . PS2: I thought of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix between the x and y coordinates of the $\vec{D}_k$ sample. It gives the ellipsis within which the vectors are... But then what? PS3: I found these two similar questions, but none of them exactly matches my problem, nor they have solutions that would be directly applicable here: Statistical test for comparing directional data How to test if two sets of vectors are statistically different from each other
