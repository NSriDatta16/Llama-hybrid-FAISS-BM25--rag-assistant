If you're using two-phase commit, then no. Everything that could go wrong is done in the prepare phase. There could still be network outage, power less, cosmic rays, etc, during the commit, but even so, the transactions will have been written to permanent storage, and if a commit has been triggered, recovery processes should carry them through. Hopefully.
