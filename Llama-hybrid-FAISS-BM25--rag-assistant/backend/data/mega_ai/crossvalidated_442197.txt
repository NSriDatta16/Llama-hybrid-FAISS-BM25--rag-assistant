Either the variable is stationary, or it has a deterministic time trend; the two are not compatible. (There is also a notion of trend-stationarity, which applies to a nonstationary series that becomes stationary once a deterministic trend is removed from it.) In general: If the variable is stationary, go ahead and use it in a VAR. If it has a deterministic trend, either detrend it first and use the remainder in a VAR or include a time trend as an exogenous variable in the VAR model. Regarding your case, the KPSS test has a null hypothesis that a time series is stationary around a deterministic trend (i.e. trend-stationary) against the alternative of a unit root. Hence, you cannot get a result indicating that the series is stationary (only trend-stationary). If you rejected the null, you would suspect a unit root; if you did not, you would assume a deterministic time trend. In either case, look at the two bullet points above.
