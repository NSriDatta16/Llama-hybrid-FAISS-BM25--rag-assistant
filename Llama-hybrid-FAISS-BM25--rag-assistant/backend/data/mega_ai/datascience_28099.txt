I guess you are trying to predict the future sales based on the data from two years that each store gathered. So I would suggest you to train model on each individual set for each store which will predict the forecast of the day for that store and feed the prediction to the separate model which will predict the overall forecast on all the stores based upon the individual store prediction, thus you can get individual predictions as well as overall forecast from the model. -> Based on your comments Remembers it is a bit time consuming but i think it worth spending for good results you can skip it and learn from tutorials where i learned alot (not promoting) They are not for your specific purpose but close to yours You can learn the whole process of prediction in the following tutorials Tutorials Here we go step by step what i had explained -> First normalize all the data sets from each store -> then Choose the algorithm you want to use -> then Arrange the store data in a organized way because you may get bit confused while training -> Initially Just pick one data set and tune the hyper parameters and understand working of those parameters carefully because your going to them a lot. -> When you get the point Start from the top to bottom of store list and Store the trained model for each store with similar names -> When your done with all the stores you will be getting predictions for each as you requested and then collect those prediction and average them and you would be getting approximate predication from all the stores
