The output of a convolution layer is computed as the following: the depth (No of feature maps) is equal to the number of filters applied in this layer (because each added channel is a result of one filter's feature map) the width ( the same for height) is computed according to the following equation $W=\frac{Wâˆ’F+2P}{S} + 1$ where $F$ is the receptive field (filter width), $P$ is the padding and $S$ is the stride. For more details see the examples in the following link CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
