A GUID column is not the best candidate for indexing. Indexes are best suited to columns with a data type that can be given some meaningful order, ie sorted (integer, date etc). It does not matter if the data in a column is generally increasing. If you create an index on the column, the index will create it's own data structure that will simply reference the actual items in your table without concern for stored order (a non-clustered index). Then for example a binary search can be performed over your index data structure to provide fast retrieval. It is also possible to create a "clustered index" that will physically reorder your data. However you can only have one of these per table, whereas you can have multiple non-clustered indexes.
