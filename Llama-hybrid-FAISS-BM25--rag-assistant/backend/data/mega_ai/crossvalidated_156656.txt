DLM package, issues about specifying models with time-varying coefficient

I've been working on DLM package for the past few weeks. I've read the package manual and the paper written by Petris "dlm: an R package for Bayesian analysis of Dynamic Linear Models", but I am still not sure about how to setup a dlm object for my model, stated as follows: I've got data for St, At, Wt and Xt, and I am interested in estimate three state variables (which are considered as time-varying) alpha_t , beta_t and gamma_t as well as one time-invariant coefficient c . Forget about the c*Xt part for now, and to simplify the problem, I consider alpha_t , beta_t and gamma_t as random walk. Then my R code for the model setup is: I have four variables to be estimated, which are the variances for the observation error and state error. My first question: Is this the right specification for my model ? (ad, WOMvolume,interaction are just the data) If so when I call fit I also tried another way to setup the model, like This time, when I called fit , it return the error " Error in dlmLL(y = y, mod = mod, debug = debug) : error code 2 from Lapack routine dgesdd " why is that? I am really not sure about how to setup my model using DLM. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks for your help in advance :) (response to F. Tusell) After some tryouts, I think I figured out how to setup my model using dlm(). Here is the code. But when I called dlmMLE function like fit error code 2 from Lapack routine dgesdd ". And I googled for the error, and it turns out that error code 1 from Lapack routine dgessdd should be a convergence problem. Is there any way get around the issue? Or does that mean my model does not have a solution? I am using R 3.2.0 on Mac OS X 10.9.5. Any help would be most welcome! (2nd edit in response to F.Tusell) I am working on some equation combining both time-variant and time-invariant coefficients. Say I have this, y, X1 and X2 are observed time-series data. Two coefficients are of interest here, one is time varying and the other is constant. Based on your previous replies, I setup my dlm like this, And I can get the state vector by "model3Filter$m". But it does not seem right since the second state variable I get is changing instead of constant. Anything wrong with my construction? Maybe FF or GG ? Appreciate so much for your help.
