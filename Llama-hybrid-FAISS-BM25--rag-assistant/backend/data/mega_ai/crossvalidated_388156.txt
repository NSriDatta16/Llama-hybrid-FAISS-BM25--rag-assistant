Maximum number of Fourier terms in forecast package

I am using the forecast package in R to get some Fourier components - namely, function fourier(ts, K, ..) . For a time series ts , K controls the maximum number of the Fourier terms one gets (sines + cosines of with different frequencies). However, if the period of the time series is specified as 7, K is automatically capped at 3 maximum, or for other periods, $\#\textrm{terms} = \frac{\textrm{Period}}{2}$ . Why is that? I thought Fourier series can be represented by an infinite number of components. Is there some practical issue?
