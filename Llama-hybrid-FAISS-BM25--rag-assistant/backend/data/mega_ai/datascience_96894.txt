What is fully connected layer additive bias?

I'm going to use PyTorch specifically but I suspect my question applies to deep learning & CNNs in general therefore I choose to post it here. Starting at this point in this video and subsequently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRlyw6LO5qo&t=1370s George H. explains that the PyTorch function torch.nn.Linear with the bias parameter set to False then makes the torch.nn.Linear functionally equivalent (other than GPU support of course) to the following NumPy line: x = np.dot(weights, x) + biases Note that in torch.nn.Linear bias by default is set to True : https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html Here is the PyTorch documentation for the bias parameter: bias â€“ If set to False, the layer will not learn an additive bias. Default: True Can anybody please explain what "additive bias" is? In other words, what additional steps is PyTorch doing if torch.nn.Linear bias parameter set to True ? Surprisingly I was not able to find much on this topic upon Googleing.
