CSS - How to prevent the DIV without content from shrinking

I have the following code: Hello world #sub-title-div { background: #FFE640; position: relative; top: 0px; left: 30px; width: 901px; height: 137px; line-height: 13px; } I found that if I remove the 'Hello World', the #sub-title-div will shrink and become invisible. Is there an easy method that I can do this more elegantly? Thank you
