I haven't come across any literature on choosing these hyper-parameters as a function of the problem specifications. But, it's my understanding that most are adopting Bayesian optimization methods to zero in on effective values. You specify a reasonable range, and by testing various combinations, you learn a model of how those hyper-parameters relate to the model's accuracy. It's worked well for me. Check out "Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms" from Snoek, Larochelle, and Adams ( http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf ).
