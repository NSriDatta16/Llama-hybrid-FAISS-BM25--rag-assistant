Handling mouse events dependent on modifiers

I've written a few relatively trivial GUIs in WxWidgets and Qt, and I'm persistently unsure how to architecturally handle the following situations: You catch a mouse event to do something to a graphical object in your GUI What you do with the object depends on which modifier keys the user is holding down At the start I usually do something like the following: void MyClass::mouseMoveEvent(QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent* event) { if (event->modifiers() & Qt::AltModifier) { // do something } else if (event->modifiers() & Qt::ControlModifier) { // do something else } else { // do yet another thing } } // Repreat ad-nausium for other mouse click/move events... Eventually, with similar if/else/switch code in lots of mousePressEvent, mouseReleaseEvent handlers, this seems a bit unwieldy so I try and encapsulate some of the repetition by putting the object into different "modes" depending on which modifiers are down. Nonetheless, I still feel I'm missing some nice elegant solution. I've tried to look at the code of various open-source tools but I've not found anything tangible (erm, simple) enough to point me in a different direction. Some tools (say, the GIMP) seem to have so many rich and varied tool- and modifier-dependent behaviours that I feel there's got to be a nice way of architecting this pattern.
