I assume to get the Expected Hessian matrix I need to run my maximum likelihood program multiple iterations to get multiple hessian matrices No, the expectation is based on the model. We're not getting some kind of ensemble-average, we're literally finding an expectation: $\mathcal{I}(\theta) = - \text{E} \left[\left. \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2} \log f(X;\theta)\right|\theta \right]\,.$ (though we might be finding it from a different expression that yields the same quantity). That is, we do some algebra before we implement it in computation. We have a single ML estimate, and we're computing the standard error from the second derivative of the likelihood at the peak -- a "sharp" peak means a small standard error, while a broad peak means a large standard error. You might like to see that when you do this for a normal likelihood (iid observations from $N(\mu,\sigma)$, with $\sigma$ known) that this calculation yields that the Fisher information is $n/\sigma^2$, and hence that the asymptotic variance of the ML estimate of $\mu$ is $\sigma^2/n$, or its standard error is $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$. (Of course in this case, that's also the small-sample variance and standard error.)
