WPF treeview with rounded corners

I have a treeview in a UI full of rounded corners, so I'd like the treeview to match. Is it possible in xaml to change the border of a treeview to have rounded corners? I've thought about hiding the border and putting the treeview inside a rounded rectangle, but this loses real-estate and seems in-elegant. Any ideas?
