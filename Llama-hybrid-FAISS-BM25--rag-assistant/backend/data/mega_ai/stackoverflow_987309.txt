As you obviously will have noticed from the answers you're getting, using conditional comments for this is so standard that people tell you to do that even when you've specifically said you don't want to. But if you absolutely have to have the user agent determination made at the CSS file level, what I would do is write a PHP script that outputs the CSS (rather than HTML) and analyze the user agent in PHP. If the file has to be referred to as stylesheet.css or whatever, Apache rewrites or MultiViews can be used to make a PHP script available under that name.
