You should have a look at TTTableItemCell.m in the Three20 framework. It follows a different approach, basically by having each cell class (with some predefined settings like font, layout etc.) implement a shared method + tableView: sizeForItem: (or something like that), where it gets passed the text in the item object. When you look up the text for a specific cell, you can as well look up the appropriate font, too. Regarding the cell height: You can check your tableView's width and, if necessary, subtract the margins by UITableViewStyleGrouped and the width an eventual index bar and disclosure item (which you look for in the data storage for your cells' data). When the width of the tableView changes, e.g. by interface rotation, you have to call [tableView reloadData] .
