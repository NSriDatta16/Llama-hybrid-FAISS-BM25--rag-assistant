"object", "class object" and "instance" terms has only historical distinctions. Currently there is even one article in Wiki for all of this:) Here additional proofs, that terms "object" and "instance" are quals (from "Object-Oriented Software Construction" by Bertran Meyer): An object belonging to the set of objects described by an ADT specification is called an instance of the ADT. For example, a specific stack which satisfies the properties of the STACK abstract data type will be an instance of STACK. Like an ADT, a class is a type: it describes a set of possible data structures, called the instances of the class. Abstract data types too have instances; the difference is that an instance of an ADT is a purely mathematical element (a member of some mathematical set), whereas an instance of a class is a data structure that may be represented in the memory of a computer and manipulated by a software system. The definition of “class” yields as a byproduct a definition of “object”. An object is simply an instance of some class . For example an instance of class STACK — a data structure representing a particular stack — is an object; so is an instance of class POINT, representing a particular point in two-dimensional space.
