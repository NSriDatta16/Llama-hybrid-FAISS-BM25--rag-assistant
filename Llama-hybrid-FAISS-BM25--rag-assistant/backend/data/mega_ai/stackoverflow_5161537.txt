If you need to get the field and values just for Unit Testing consider using Microsoft's PrivateObject Its there so you can check the internal state of data members during unit testing if you need to, which appears to be what you are trying to do. In your unit tests you can do the following: MyObject obj = new MyObject(); PrivateObject privateAccessor = new PrivateObject(obj); Dictionary dict = privateAccessor.GetFieldOrProperty("averages") as Dictionary ; Then you are free to get and set any values you need to from the Dictionary.
