CSS inline area cross browser

I would like to add some CSS fixed size blocks inline into a text paragraph and I'm having cross browser issues. I use div and inline-block and it works on Firefox. Under IE it fails ( inline-blocks aren't fully supported ). Is there a simple cross browser solution available? (The rationale for this is for the fixed size blocks to use background-image for the displaying of smileys. This allows sprites and smileys shown according to the stylesheet.)
