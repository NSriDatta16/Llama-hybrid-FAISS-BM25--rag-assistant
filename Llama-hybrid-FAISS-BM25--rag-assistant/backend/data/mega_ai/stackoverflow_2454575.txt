You could write PHP code in almost anything, and the file will be created as long as you add the .php extension to the new file. I wrote a few simple programs using Notepad and Notepad++ before going onto Eclipse PDT . To run your file, one out of many ways, you can start up your WAMPserver, browse to http://localhost and drag and drop your file into the browser. You could also put the .php file inside the www folder ( IIRC thats the name of the folder, my memory is a bit hazy ) and then browse to http://localhost/name_of_file.php . In either case, if successful, your PHP code should execute on the page.
