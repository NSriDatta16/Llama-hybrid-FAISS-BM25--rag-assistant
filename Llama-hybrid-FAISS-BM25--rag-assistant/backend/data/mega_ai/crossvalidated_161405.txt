Asymptotic test are problematic for variance parameters, because parameter space is bounded by zero. Moreover, the hypothesis you are trying to test, can't be true, as the parameter is continuous. Probability of $\sigma^2 = 0$ is exactly 0. What you can do to make inference on the variance parameters is to switch to a Bayesian implementation, where you would get the full posterior distribution for the variance parameters. For lme4 users, the MCMCglmm package is easy to learn. You could also use JAGS or Stan. For an example, where Stan was used to compare several random effects, see [1].
