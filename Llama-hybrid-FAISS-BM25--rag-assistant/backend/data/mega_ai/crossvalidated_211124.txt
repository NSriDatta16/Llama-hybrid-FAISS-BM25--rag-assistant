Is Naive Bayes suitable for large datasets with thousands of features?

I have a data set with 100 million rows and 15,000 categorical variables each with 0/1 values. My target variable is also a 0/1 binary variable. Is Naive Bayes suitable in terms of computational performance, and prediction? The main concern is the number of explanatory variables which may limit performance which is why I am not using random forests and SVMs.
