How can I know if I should group data on a time series?

I am working with a time series of 1 year, with power values every 15 minutes. There's an example in the link below concerning only 4 hours. I want to know if I can group the power values per hour. I think I'd probably do that using a statistical test which could evaluate the similarities. https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeD6u.png
