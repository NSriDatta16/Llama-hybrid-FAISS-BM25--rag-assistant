I was going to list a few methods here but all but one is junk. Do the string->user conversion on the server as you've been doing to generate a list for the auto-complete. By all means keep the auto-complete and do AJAX validation, but if you try and smuggle vital form data (like this) in the form via JS, something will go wrong at some point. Besides, if you need to handle non-js user-agents, you'll need to write this method in any way.
