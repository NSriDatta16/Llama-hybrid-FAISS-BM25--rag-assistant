It seems like simple logistic regression would work well. Hopefully this matches well to the data you have. I've tried to lay off jargon as much as possible. Let's confine our analysis to a single bus route for simplicity (you can simply repeat this procedure for other routes). The dependent/predicted variable you are trying to measure is a binary variable $y$; that is, $y=0$ if the bus misses the stop, and $y=1$ if the bus makes the stop. From your GPS data you can extract the value of $y$ for a bunch of previous bus runs. Let's say you have $N$ observations in this data. This is best conceptualized as a vector/list, $y= \{ y_1, y_2, ... ,y_N\} $. For example, $y= \{ 0,1,0,0,1\}$ would correspond to miss, stop, miss, miss, stop, for five observations. Now you want to develop a series of predictor/independent variables that you can use to predict $y$ for future observations. AccidentalStatistician has mentioned a few possibilities. Here are a few simple ones: Whether the bus stopped or missed the previous bus stop (call this variable $x_1$). This is also a binary variable. This could potentially be very informative, for example $x_1 = \{ 0,1,0,0,1\}$, would give evidence that $y=x_1$. Of course, there is no reason to just check the previous bus stop. To be complete, you could try using ALL previous bus stops on the line as predictor variables. Each will be a binary vector like $x_1$ above. The distance between the bus and the bus in front of it (call this $x_2$). In contrast to $x_1$, this variable is continuous, and could look something like $x_2 = \{0.53,0.9,0.72,0.81,0.62 \}$ where each entry corresponds the distance (e.g., in miles) between the two buses at the time of the stop (or averaged over some period before the stop). It might be more informative to measure this distance in minutes than miles. Time of day. $x_3 = \{8.5,9.2,10.1,11.2,14.9\}$ in hours. Day of year... You get the recipe by now hopefully. Feel free to come up with more ideas. The important step is figuring out what you think might be important in your data and distilling it into some simple form (e.g. zeros and ones). Once you have your data in this form, you can run a logistic regression to predict the probability that $y=1$ for any observed values of $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$ (where $p$ is the number of independent variables). If you have just one independent variable, $x$, the result will look something like this ( image source ) Here, the black dots are your observed values of $y$ plotted against your observed values of $x$. The red line is the predicted probability of $y=1$ for an arbitrary value of $x$ (here $x$ is a continuous variable). The following source explains how to fit a logistic model in R: LINK . I recommend the following textbook as an introduction to logistic regression and multiple linear regression (which has pretty similar motivations) LINK . And the following book for advanced understanding of logistic regression and other classification methods: LINK . This last reference will cover a lot of really important methods for variable selection -- it is really easy to come up with too many independent variables and over-fit your data: LINK . Don't do this!
