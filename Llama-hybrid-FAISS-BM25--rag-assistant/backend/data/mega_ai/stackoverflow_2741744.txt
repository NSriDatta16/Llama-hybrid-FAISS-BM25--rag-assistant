qt drop event get widget

I'm trying to, inside a dropevent method, find out which widget was just dropped. I tried looking at the docs, but they only have commands for images and text. How do I access both the item just dropped and which widget it was dropped on?(this is drag and drop inside of a QTreeWidget)
