You have got a situation where the temperature (a 1D variable) maps to a 2D plane (alpha and beta). For a single temperature, the alpha and beta can be anything along a single curve. If you would be able to add something like a secondary variable then you could better estimate which alpha and beta on the curve are most likely. An example could be the distribution of multiple measurements of the temperature. This could give some location information when this distribution is not the same everywhere. But in order to implement this, you would need to have information about the distribution of the error in the measurement (either obtained experimentally or determined based on theoretic considerations). Several ways that I imagine:The curvature of the iso-lines in the temperature field may relate to the skewness of the distribution of measured temperatures. The slope of the temperature field may relate to the variance of the distribution of measured temperatures. But you will need to know some more in order to design good priors to make a usefull bayesian model that incorporates these effects. If you want to build a bayesian model with only all information that you currently have, rather then finding ways to extend and improve your data then you have with a maximum a posteriori predictor: $$f(\alpha,\beta|T)f(T) = f(T|\alpha,\beta)f(\alpha,\beta)$$ and when $f(T|\alpha,\beta)$ is just a delta function (ie. there is no variation in $T$ for a given $\alpha,\beta$ ) then: $$f(\alpha,\beta|T) = \frac{f(\alpha,\beta)}{f(T)}$$ which means you end up picking the highest prior probability density for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the isoline of the measured temperature.
