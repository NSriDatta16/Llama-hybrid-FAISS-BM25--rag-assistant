how to use graph_model in reghelper correctly

I spent so many hours trying to create bargraph for lmer in R but I cant find a way to get each condition group mean to vary. I want to plot the following model ratings_long the code I used for creating the plot if (require(lme4, quietly=TRUE)) { ratings_long The plot looks like this But I want something like this I know it’s supposed to vary because I ran the lmer model and it says both intercept and slopes significantly differ, which means they are not constant. Any one aware of what is the problem and solution? The only thing that came up for me was from this site From https://rdrr.io/cran/reghelper/man/graph_model.html (here it says “Details If there are additional covariates in the model other than what is indicated to be graphed by the function, these variables will be plotted at their respective means. In the case of a categorical covariate, the results will be averaged across all its levels.”) , but this doesn't seem to work as well. Thanks in advance.
