Google Maps API - Strange Map "Offset" Behaviour

I'm adding a map next to a form on my web page. The idea is that people can sign up, and when they type in their address and click search, it place-marks their house, they must do this before they submit the form (geolocation has a large role on my site). Unfortunately, I have added the map, but within the map window the map itself appears to be offset. See the image below to illustrate what I mean: I can only drag the map from within the "mapped" part of the box. If I select the grey area to drag the map around, it fails. Any ideas what could cause this? EDIT: Here is my map-initialising Javascript, called on page load. geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder(); var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(52.428385,-3.560257); var myOptions = { zoom: 7, center: latlng, mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP } map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("adminMap"), myOptions); Here is my map CSS #adminMap{ float:left; width:270px; height:370px; margin-left:20px; } Here is my map HTML
