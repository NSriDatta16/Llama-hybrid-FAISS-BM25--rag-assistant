VC++ and MapPoint OCX control dialog issue

I am writing a VC++ MFC dialog based app which requires Microsoft MapPoint embedding in it. To do this I'm using MS VC++ .NET 2003 and MapPoint Europe 2006 to do this but am having problems as when I select "Insert ActiveX Control" no MapPoint control appears in the list of options. I have tried manually registering mappointcontrol.ocx with regsvr32 which appears to succeed but still the control doesn't appear on the list. Can anyone suggest what I am doing wrong here, and any possible solutions. Thanks Ian
