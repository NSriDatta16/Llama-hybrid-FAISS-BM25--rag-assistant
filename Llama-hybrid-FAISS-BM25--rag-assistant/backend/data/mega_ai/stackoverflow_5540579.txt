GetObjectContext returns nothing in VB6 COM dll, called from classic ASP

I am debugging this Active X dll using the VB6 IDE. I can see the execution get as far as an attempt to GetObjectContext. This method always returns NOTHING. This is happening on Windows 7 32 bit, IIS 7. (The application is working in other locations, one of which is Windows Server 2008 with IIS 7) I have Googled extensively and found many references to this relating to COM+, but there is NO COM+ involved in my scenario. Just plain old Server.CreateObject from a registered dll. I have ASP code as follows SET objCalendar = Server.CreateObject("SSYSDEV.Calendar") objCalendar.BuildCalendar("ADMINUSERS") SET objCalendar = Nothing The problem lines of the requested function in the dll are: Dim objHttpRequest As ASPTypeLibrary.Request Set objHttpRequest = GetObjectContext.Item("Request") Any help or suggestions, as always, will be greatly appreciated. I'm still getting over the shock of having to work with VB6 - I never thought it would happen! It's like being dragged back to the dark ages, in a very rough fashion that's causing blisters! P.S. I have also set up a COM+ component and had the ASP get the object that way, GetObjectContext returns an empty object in this case, which has no ASP objects in it. So this is no help :-(
