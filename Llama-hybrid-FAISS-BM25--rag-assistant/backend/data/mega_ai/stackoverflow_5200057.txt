There is a lot of talk about using or using but not one comment gave a solid example of the content that goes inside of these tags. My feeling is that and are not really that important as I cannot tell you the last time that I actually read a "list" of things on a website, newspaper or magazine -- online or in print. is much more versatile. If you are listing out ingredients for a cake, yes that is a list. If you are listing things out to pack for a hiking trip, yes that is a list. But what about a user-form of, for example, that lists some random things that are not really a list, nor a series of paragraphs, nor all "headers." Some things are dates, some are checkboxes and some are text. Div it up, if you ask me. A blind person would be mis-informed if it was marked up with and and they heard "Here is a list of ..." when it is just a hodge-podge of stuff, not really a list.
