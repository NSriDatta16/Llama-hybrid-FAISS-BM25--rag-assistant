Using MCMC for time series forecasts

I have time series data with me with weekly frequency. I have been asked to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for making forecasts with this time series. For this purpose, I need to know the underlying distribution for the time series (hypothesized from the time series) so that I can use this distribution along with the most recent value in the time series to get the next value using MCMC. Now there is Lilli.test in R (null hypothesis is that the underlying distribution is normal) for determining whether or not the time series follows a normal distribution. I was hoping that the p-value for this test for my time series data would prove to be large so that I could go ahead with the normal distribution hypothesis. But the p-value is small and so the distribution is not normal. I then applied the BoxCox transformation to make the data normal but the values returned were the same as in the original data. I am not sure why this happened. Can anyone explain? Also, given that the underlying distribution is not normal and, apparently, I have no way to "make it normal", how do I get an estimate of what it is? Is it even feasible to use MCMC for time series forecasts given that it appears to be difficult to estimate the underlying distribution? For using MCMC, I understand it is critical to know the underlying distribution. But I see no way of estimating it. Can someone help me with this? Thank you.
