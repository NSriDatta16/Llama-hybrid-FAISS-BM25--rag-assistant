I think most of them test concordance versus discordance and so they stress the degree with which the raters agree and so the fact that they will tend to vote yes a 10% of the time is not a factor. Sample size could be though because if the sample size is small you won't have many yeses to compare among the voters. That would be a problem for any test of agreement. So if you can afford it decide on a number of yes votes you would like to see on average for each voter. If that is 50 take 500 samples to be rated. Certainly, the Kappa statistic would be fine for this as will most others.
