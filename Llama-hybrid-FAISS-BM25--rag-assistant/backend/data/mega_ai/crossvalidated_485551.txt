1 neuron BCE loss VS 2 neurons CE loss

I built a custom version of YOLO that should only detect one type of objects , where the objectness measure (which tells how likely a bounding-box contains an object of any type), is learned using a logistic regression (BCE loss), with a single neuron. Since I have only one type of object, objectness is the only measure that I use at inference. My problem is that this neuron almost only has extreme outputs. Fed to the Sigmoid function $\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ , the values of $x$ are either very low (negative with high abs value) or positive very high, resulting in almost binary outputs, 0 and 1. This is very similar to a results that I got with MSE loss on a single neuron, so what is the benefit of using a logistic regression? Is it related to the nature of the BCE loss? Should I get objectness scores that are spread all over the range if I use CE with softmax on 2 neurons, one for negative objectness and one for positive?
