ropean research has focused on novel, complex problems, and has been performed with computerized scenarios. Europe In Europe, two main approaches have surfaced, one initiated by Donald Broadbent in the United Kingdom and the other one by Dietrich Dörner in Germany. The two approaches share an emphasis on relatively complex, semantically rich, computerized laboratory tasks, constructed to resemble real-life problems. The approaches differ somewhat in their theoretical goals and methodology. The tradition initiated by Broadbent emphasizes the distinction between cognitive problem-solving processes that operate under awareness versus outside of awareness, and typically employs mathematically well-defined computerized systems. The tradition initiated by Dörner, on the other hand, has an interest in the interplay of the cognitive, motivational, and social components of problem solving, and utilizes very complex computerized scenarios that contain up to 2,000 highly interconnected variables. North America In North America, initiated by the work of Herbert A. Simon on "learning by doing" in semantically rich domains, researchers began to investigate problem solving separately in different natural knowledge domains—such as physics, writing, or chess playing—rather than attempt to extract a global theory of problem solving. These researchers have focused on the development of problem solving within certain domains, that is on the development of expertise. Areas that have attracted rather intensive attention in North America include: calculation computer skills game playing lawyers' reasoning managerial problem solving physical problem solving mathematical problem solving mechanical problem solving personal problem solving political decision making problem solving in electronics problem solving for innovations and inventions: TRIZ reading social problem solving writing Characteristics of complex problems Complex problem solving (CPS) is distinguishable from simple problem solving (SPS). In SPS there is a singular and simple obstacle. In CPS there may be multiple simultaneous obstacles. For example, a surgeon at work has far more complex problems than an individual deciding what shoes to wear. As elucidated by Dietrich Dörner, and later expanded upon by Joachim Funke, complex problems have some typical characteristics, which include: complexity (large numbers of items, interrelations, and decisions) enumerability heterogeneity connectivity (hierarchy relation, communication relation, allocation relation) dynamics (time considerations) temporal constraints temporal sensitivity phase effects dynamic unpredictability intransparency (lack of clarity of the situation) commencement opacity continuation opacity polytely (multiple goals) inexpressivenes opposition transience Collective problem solving People solve problems on many different levels—from the individual to the civilizational. Collective problem solving refers to problem solving performed collectively. Social issues and global issues can typically only be solved collectively. The complexity of contemporary problems exceeds the cognitive capacity of any individual and requires different but complementary varieties of expertise and collective problem solving ability. Collective intelligence is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals. In collaborative problem solving people work together to solve real-world problems. Members of problem-solving groups share a common concern, a similar passion, and/or a commitment to their work. Members can ask questions, wonder, and try to understand common issues. They share expertise, experiences, tools, and methods. Groups may be fluid based on need, may only occur temporarily to finish an assigned task, or may be more permanent depending on the nature of the problems. For example, in the educational context, members of a group may all have input into the decision-makin
