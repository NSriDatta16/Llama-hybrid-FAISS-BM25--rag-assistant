The features I missed in your toy data was ensuring that you record bird species, number of birds, activities (e.g., feeding, roosting, mating, etc.), time of day (not too granular), day of year and weather conditions beyond just temperature, e.g., rain, snow, clouds, sun, barometric reading, as well as position or location. In fact, I would make these latter features "structural" in the sense of a possible study design around which you could build a kind of sampling frame for random viewing times and events. This would be useful since you likely do not have time to watch your garden all day long (maybe you do but I wouldn't assume that). One obvious question concerns how long you run your "observation" period. If you're doing this at your leisure, then in theory you could run it indefinitely. Bird species seems an important feature to observe and record in and of itself since some birds simply won't "land" anywhere near, e.g., a predatory bird or if such a bird is "circling" overhead, while other bird species share almost symbiotic relationships. Another consideration might be the extent to which there are "interlopers" in your garden such as squirrels or dogs that would interfere with the birds' landing or positioning. If you really are referring to your garden, then the possible positions or locations should be "mappable" in the sense of height from the ground and, almost like GPS coordinates, distance from the other possible locations in your garden. Given that information as a baseline and having developed a reasonably dense set of records for analysis, a number of possible methods for insight suggest themselves. One approach would be to leverage contingency table analysis since the "core" of your concerns have to do with species (categorical), location (also categorical) and time -- time of day, week of year, etc. (also discrete or discretizable). This approach would develop a set of parameters against which you could fill in "dummy" observations for prediction of the expected behavior. A good reference for this method, with specific applications to biological and species behaviors, is Stephen Fienberg's The Analysis of Cross-Classified Categorical Data . Another approach to this could be a network analysis of the interrelationships between the bird species insofar as you can learn which birds "interact" wrt positioning, are "friends" or cooperate (or don't) in some meaningful way. A good reference for this approach is Borgatti, et al, Social Network Analysis . Finally, a regression analysis would provide additional insight into which of the features you've been collecting information about matters most in terms of understanding where, when and how birds "position" themselves in your garden. Edit to original response This paper recently came to my attention, Experimental resource pulses influence social-network dynamics and the potential for information flow in tool-using crows . While not "spot-on" with respect to the OPs original concerns, it is strongly related and suggestive of both design and analytic issues that are worthy of consideration. As such, I'm sharing it as "grist for the mill." Here's the abstract: Social-network dynamics have profound consequences for biological processes such as information flow, but are notoriously difficult to measure in the wild. We used novel transceiver technology to chart association patterns across 19 days in a wild population of the New Caledonian crow—a tool-using species that may socially learn, and culturally accumulate, tool-related information. To examine the causes and consequences of changing network topology, we manipulated the environmental availability of the crows’ preferred toolextracted prey, and simulated, in silico, the diffusion of information across field-recorded time-ordered networks. Here we show that network structure responds quickly to environmental change and that novel information can potentially spread rapidly within multi-family communities, especially when tool-use opportunities are plentiful. At the same time, we report surprisingly limited social contact between neighbouring crow communities. Such scale dependence in information-flow dynamics is likely to influence the evolution and maintenance of material cultures.
