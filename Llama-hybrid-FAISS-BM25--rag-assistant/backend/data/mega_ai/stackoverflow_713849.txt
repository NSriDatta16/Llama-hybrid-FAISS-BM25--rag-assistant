It depends how you want to use XSLT; not sure what you mean by "natively". If you're just embedding a browser, MobileSafari will interpret XSLT for you. If you're just converting one XML document into another for processing, libxslt is not a bad choice. There's no difference using libxslt on the iPhone from any other platform. Given Apple doesn't include headers for it, it is likely they don't want you using the bundled copy. You are better off compiling a copy into your application instead, against the provided libxml2 library. If you want a more specific answer you may wish to pose a more specific question. :-)
