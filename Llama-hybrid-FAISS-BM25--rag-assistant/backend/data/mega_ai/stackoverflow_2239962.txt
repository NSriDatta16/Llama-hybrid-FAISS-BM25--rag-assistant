The proposed solution worked great for getting NUnit to run. Unfortunately, when I then got to my code coverage step, NCover started giving me: Profiled process terminated. Profiler connection not established. The best solution I found to this was to just use the "-x86" version of NUnit with NCover: NCover.Console.exe nunit-console-x86.exe --additional params-- Works now.
