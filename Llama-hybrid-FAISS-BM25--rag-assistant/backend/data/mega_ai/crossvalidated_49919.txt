What is a good distribution to model average sales

I would like to run a monte carlo simulation for a financial model what needs to predict sales. I have somewhat successfully done this if I assume the average order size is normally distributed (at say 80) and has a standard deviation (of say 30). However, the problem is that the minimum sale of course can't be less than 0. Can someone suggest a good alternative distribution (or technique for working with a normal distribution) to handle this problem (I am sure it must be a common enough scenario!). Thanks.
