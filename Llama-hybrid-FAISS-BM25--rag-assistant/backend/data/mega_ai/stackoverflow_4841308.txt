What are the important factors to consider while selecting a NoSQL solution?

I am evaluating (no specific use cases), just trying to understand the NoSQL (non-relational) solutions in breadth. So, I pretty much understand Dynamo in term of ( taken from Dynamo paper ): Partitioning --> Consistent hashing High availability --> Vector clocks Handling temp failures --> Sloppy quorum Failure recovery --> Merkel Trees Membership and failure detection --> Gosisp protocol My question is, what are the other ways of each of these 5 (may be more "problems") are dealed with in other solutions like: Bigtable based systems, Just key-value storage like Redis and BDB. other hybrid systems.
