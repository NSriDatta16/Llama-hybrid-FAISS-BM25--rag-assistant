For realistic and educational purpose, I may suggest to use Boston data set. It is on UCI repository , and popular in both statistics and machine learning community. In addition, it has "reasonable" amount of rows and columns (~500 observations, and 14 variables). In R, it is included in MASS package. A staring point can be using housing age and value to do the regression. Intuitively, older house is cheaper. d=MASS::Boston fit=lm(medv~age,d) plot(d$age,d$medv) abline(fit)
