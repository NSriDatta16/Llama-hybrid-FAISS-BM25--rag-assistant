Why does SVM considered as discriminative model?

I read in several places that SVM is a discriminative model, but SVM has no statistical aspects per se, by that I mean that is does not estimate any probablity, specifically the postirior distribution as a discriminative model should do. Shouldn't SVM be considered as nirther disciminative nor genreative, rather it finds a disciminative hyperplane in the feature space.
