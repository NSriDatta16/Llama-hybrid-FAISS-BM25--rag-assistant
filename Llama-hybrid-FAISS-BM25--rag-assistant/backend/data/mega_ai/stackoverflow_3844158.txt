Static or constant or what are they?

I just want to know how I can call certian classes in design pattern here, like which type are they classified in OO design (1) I use a class that has just named constants , this class is used directly other classes to get values of constants in it.I dont instantiate the class. (2) I use a class with full of static methods, this class is basically used by other classes as a holder of methods that are used by them. So again i dont instantiate the class. What are these kinda classes classified under OOdesign? Can I do it in a more elegant way?
