asp.net mvc - constructing views completely off custom fields in DB

i'm working on designing an asp.net mvc web app. There will be half a dozen (maybe more to come) different user groups of the app and they all work with similar but tweaked UIs, each with a few custom fields but all using the same objects. one idea for creating the UI is to store Control info with each field value in the database, and construct each view completely when we query the database. this sounds like a flexible way to create the Views without having to define a separate set of views for each user group, since each screen could have different fields depending on user group. It also sounds like it will be hard to control the layout. My question: is this a correct approach? Where's the middle ground between creating a drag+drop layout and driving the entire UI off DB fields? thanks!!
