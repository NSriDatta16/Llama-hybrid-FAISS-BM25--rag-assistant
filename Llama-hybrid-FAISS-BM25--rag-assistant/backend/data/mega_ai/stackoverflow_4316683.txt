I don't know of any out-of-the-box solutions for something like that. The only thing I'm aware of that might work for this is embedded reader/acrobat with a custom plugin that would handle the multiple searches & highlighting. IIRC, publishing acrobat plugins is easy, but to "reader enable" plugins requires that Adobe sign them for you, which involves some $$$. Decidedly non-trivial. "Retaining the actual formatting" isn't really possible. There is no formatting within PDF to retain. There's coordinates, glyphs, lines, and images (and stuff). No such thing as a word, or a paragraph, alignment, etc. It's all 'draw this shape there'. Most glyphs map to characters, but not all. Some lines look like glyphs, but are straight line art. It's possible to recreate the formatting information from coordinates and characters, but it's hard , and there's lots of things that can go wrong. The PDF tag really needs a FAQ that would cover things like this.
