What is the best database technology for storing OHLC historical prices?

Just for End-Of-Day data there will be billions of rows. What is the best way to store all that data. Is SQL Server 2008 good enough for that or should I look towards NoSQL solution, like MongoDB. Any suggestions? That would be cool to have one master db with read/write permissions and one ore more replications of it for read only operations. Only master database will be used for adding new prices into the storage. Also that would be cool to be able replicate OHLC prices for most popular securities individually in order to optimize read access. This data then will be streamed to a trading platform on clients' machines.
