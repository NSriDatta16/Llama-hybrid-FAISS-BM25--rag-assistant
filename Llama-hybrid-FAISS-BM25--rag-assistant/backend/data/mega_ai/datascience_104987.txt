What does it means (concretly) that a VAE encode inputs as distribution?

From this post we can read that VAEs encode inputs as distributions instead of simple points ? What does it mean concretely ? If the encoder consists of the weights between the input image and the latent space (bottleneck layer), where is the "probability distribution" in all that ? Thank you
