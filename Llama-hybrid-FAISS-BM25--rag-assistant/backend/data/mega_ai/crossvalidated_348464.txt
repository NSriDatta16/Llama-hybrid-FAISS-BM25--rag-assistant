How to make a prediction from baseline categorical variable – Logistic Regression - SPSS

For example: Let‘s say I have a categorical variable 'Hand' with two values 0=”Left” and 1=”Right”. DV is 'ReactionTestResult': 0=”Fail”, 1=”Pass”. One of the categories from variable 'Hand' will automatically be chosen as baseline and won’t be included in the model, thus I will end up with only one B coefficient after regression is complete. Let’s assume that Left was chosen as baseline. Then equation for predicting would be log(̂/( 1 − ̂ )) = Bconstant+HandBcoefficient*Hand. However, because left hand is baseline (and thus excluded from the model) and I only have coefficient for right hand, how can I then proceed to make predictions about how likely left handed participants would be to pass the supposed reaction test? Do I somehow need to derive coefficient for baseline, perhaps using Exp(B) values or something? Or is there nothing I can do and I simply can’t make predictions from left handed participants? Any help is appreciated. Started learning about logistic regression fairly recently and this is confusing.
