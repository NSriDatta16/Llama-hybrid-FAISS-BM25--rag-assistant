There might be some session cookie reminding the server about the former session. I know that FBConnect (Facebook API for iPhone) uses the following method when logging out to remove any cookie : - (void)deleteFacebookCookies { NSHTTPCookieStorage* cookies = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]; NSArray* facebookCookies = [cookies cookiesForURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://login.facebook.com"]]; for (NSHTTPCookie* cookie in facebookCookies) { [cookies deleteCookie:cookie]; } } You could try this (replace facebook url with yours). You could even add some NSLogs to watch for these cookies.
