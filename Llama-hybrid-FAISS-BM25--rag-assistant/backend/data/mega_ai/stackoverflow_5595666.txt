If you're publishing your application to Azure and you're using Session in any way (this includes MVC's TempData) then you will probably need to use some kind of central storage for session, rather than using the default "InProc" provider which just stores the user's session in the application's own memory. With azure, you can use, among others, SQL Azure or the AppFabric Cache (still in CTP). Here is a good lab for AppFabric: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg457897 And here's one for SQL Azure (not supported): http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlazure/archive/2010/08/04/10046103.aspx This is because you could have mutiple instances running or you instance could be moved at any given moment. It sounds like your application doesn't currently use Session State so you won't need to worry about it. (although, remember that the TempData dictionary uses Session under the hood)
