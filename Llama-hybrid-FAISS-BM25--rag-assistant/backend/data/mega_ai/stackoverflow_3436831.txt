There are a lot of pieces here, so let me break this down into sub questions for you: 1) How do I do serial communication in C#? There are plenty of examples on the internet. A quick search turns up this one and this one , both of which seem to be ok. There are also lots of questions here on SO about C# serial communication. 2) How do I control a modem? Modems are operated by some version of the AT command set . If you're familiar with manually operating a modem in HyperTerminal, you're essentially doing the same thing, but in code. For example, to test if your modem is paying attention (i.e., that your serial line is talking to the modem properly), you send AT , and see if the modem replies with OK . To dial, you send the modem ATDT . Once a modem establishes carrier, then whatever you send down the serial port is transmitted to the remote computer. 3) How do I communicate with medicare's electronic claims system? This one is up to you! I'd be surprised if they didn't have a web-based claims service though. I would expect that would be a lot easier than doing it over a modem.
