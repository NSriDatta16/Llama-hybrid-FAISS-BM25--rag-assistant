You'll need to write the user's culture to Isolated Storage The values are stored as a Key/Value pair: // Create an instance of IsolatedStorageSettings. private IsolatedStorageSettings userSettings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; // Add a key and its value. userSettings.Add("userCulture", "en-US-c1"); // Remove the setting. userSettings.Remove("userCulture"); Just default the value to something sensible and you'll need an option to allow the user to select their culture.
