The transformer API is the only XML-standard way to transform from a DOM object to a serialized form (String in this case). As standard I mean SUN Java XML API for XML Processing . Other alternatives such as Xerces XMLSerializer or JDOM XMLOutputter are more direct methods (less code) but they are framework-specific. In my opinion the way you have used is the most elegant and most portable of all. By using a standard XML Java API you can plug the XML-Parser or XML-Transformer of your choice without changing the code(the same as JDBC drivers). Is there anything more elegant than that?
