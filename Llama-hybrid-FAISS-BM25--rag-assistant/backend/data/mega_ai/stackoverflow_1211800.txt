The simplest approach is to do a linear interpolation (in RGB) between each consecutive pair in this sequence: #ff0000 red #ffff00 yellow #00ff00 green #00ffff cyan #0000ff blue #ff00ff magenta #ff0000 back to red This should get you pretty much the same result as sweeping through the hue values in HSV or HSL, but lets you work directly in RGB. Note that only one component changes for each interpolation, which simplifies things. Here's a Python implementation: def rainbow(): r, g, b = 255, 0, 0 for g in range(256): yield r, g, b for r in range(255, -1, -1): yield r, g, b for b in range(256): yield r, g, b for g in range(255, -1, -1): yield r, g, b for r in range(256): yield r, g, b for b in range(255, -1, -1): yield r, g, b
