I can think of several reasons why GWT is a better choice than Wicket, for typical business web apps: GWT is from Google. This may be unfair, but having a big and respected software company behind a tool is a huge advantage (safer to bet on it, more books and online resources, more third-party support, better IDE support, ...). Server-centric web frameworks like Wicket are outdated. Modern web browsers are very powerful and getting ever more so, therefore a modern web framework should help you take advantage of that. Coding directly in HTML and Javascript can never be as productive as coding in Java (from my experience, at least). Also, there are better tools for Java code (debuggers, static analysis, unit testing and code coverage, etc.).
