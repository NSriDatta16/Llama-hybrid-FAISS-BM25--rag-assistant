First, what kind of data are your time series? What you expect to obtain clustering them? Use correlation as a distance meassure it is expressive enough to define the clusters? Those questions are up to you to answer since are the particularities of your experimentation. Now, regarding the clustering process. There some specific meassures used to define similarity in time series. Regarding classification, the Euclidean distance is widely used with a 1NN classifier for time series classification. but sometimes in some context it is very particular and not so expressive, so there are other elastic similarity measures such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for example. Regarding your question, indeed you could use PCA to reduce dimension and then apply k-means to cluster the obtained projections. But once again depends in the characteristics of the clustering process, and the information you expect to obtain from it. Check this material
