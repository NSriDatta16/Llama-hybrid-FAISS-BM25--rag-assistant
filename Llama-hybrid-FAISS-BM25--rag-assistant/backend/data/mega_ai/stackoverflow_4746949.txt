admob says "Server replied that no ads are available"

i have added the admob test in my app as the pdf instructions were directing and everything works nice(in emulator and in my device).In order to stop the test mode and upload my new apk at the market i have to erase the test code from my .java file,right?i have tried it and i uploaded my .apk file in my device (from mass storage)but i cant see any admob...what is my wrong ? TEST CODE: AdManager.setTestDevices( new String[] { AdManager.TEST_EMULATOR,"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",}); AdView adView=(AdView)findViewById(R.id.ad); adView.requestFreshAd(); i checked my LogCAT view: 01-20 14:13:38.938: INFO/AdMobSDK(19582): No fill. Server replied that no ads are available (373ms)
