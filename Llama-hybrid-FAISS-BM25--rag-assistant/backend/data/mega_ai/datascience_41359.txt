Does this type of classification exist?

Im fairly new to data science and trying to see if a type of classification exists for my needs. I understand that a classification into 2 categories will look something like this: You have 2 desired outcomes and you try to build a model that classifies as 0 or 1 . If these models are not 100% accurate then you will: a) Miss some true values (outside edges of circles) b) Get some of the wrong values in each category (overlaps between circles) However, I am looking for something more like this: In this case, I want to predict only 1 , and I dont mind if some 0 s are included but want to make sure that as many as possible 1 s are predicted. In my mind, this is effectively just widening the orange circle (the classification of 1 s) in the picture. How can i achieve this?
