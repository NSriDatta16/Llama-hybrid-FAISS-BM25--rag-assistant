Here's a solution that uses two Scanner (as suggested in my previous answer ). Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in); scans user's input Scanner scores = new Scanner(stdin.nextLine()); scans the line containing the scores Note also that it uses a much simpler and more readable formula for computing the average. Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print("Enter your average: "); String name = stdin.next(); int count = 0; int sum = 0; Scanner scores = new Scanner(stdin.nextLine()); while (scores.hasNextInt()) { sum += scores.nextInt(); count++; } double avg = 1D * sum / count; System.out.print(name + " " + avg); Sample output: Enter your average: Joe 1 2 3 Joe 2.0
