I think this may be a case of ceteris paribus confusion . When travel distance is the only variable, the effect on the outcome is positive. If the outcome is a purchase, this might be explained by the fact that when an agent lives far away, a trip to the store is more expensive, so he is more likely to stock up if he's already there. People who live far away fill their carts all the way, but make fewer trips, compared to people who live closer. I would bet dollars to donuts this is also what you would find if you used only travel time in the model as your measure of cost. When you have both travel distance and travel time in the model, the sign of the distance coefficient gives you sign of the effect holding travel time fixed. When distance gets longer, but the travel time stays constant, the effect becomes negative. How might distance get longer, but travel time remain the same? If the speed of travel on the road became faster, perhaps because it was a highway with a higher speed limit. The comparison you are now making when both variables are in the model is between two identical people who both live $X$ minutes from a store, but one lives further away and takes a highway to get there. That agent is less likely to make a purchase, perhaps because traveling on the highway is easier than taking the local roads on gas usage, or perhaps this is the road he uses to commute to work and he passes the store on the way home (a kind of omitted variable in your model). To sum up, when the regressors are different, the coefficients corresponds to different thought experiment comparisons and the interpretation changes accordingly. The changing signs do not necessarily indicate multicollinearity. Variable selection should be driven by theory, careful thought, and your ultimate goals.
