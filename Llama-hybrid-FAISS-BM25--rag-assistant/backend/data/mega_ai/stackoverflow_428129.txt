There's no standard standard, as it were. There are most certainly plenty of in-house standards and conventions. And there are certainly known best practices. I stick to the following: Structure your CSS according to it's purpose That may involve separating out CSS concerns into different files (layout.css, colors.css etc). This may just as well involve clearly dividing up a single CSS file into clear sections along the same lines. Be as specific as possible Selectors have differing weights. ID-based selectors are more specific than class-based selectors. Chained selectors (e.g. body div#container div#content p ) are very specific indeed. Start out being as specific as you can, even if it appears you're being too specific. It's quite easy, later down the line, to merge together two very specific style definitions by removing one and making the other less specific. A style definition with loose specificity may target elements you did not intend in ways that are not immediately apparent or obvious. I think this is the most common cause of CSS frustrations ("Why on earth will this div not let me set a top margin?") Always specify every single style you wish to apply for a given defintion For example, if you want all your paragraphs to have pink text, set the text colour to pink and also set the margins/padding/background colour/font and so on. Don't rely on browser defaults to be suitably consistent. Certainly for the most commonly used elements the main browsers tend to use very similar if not identical default styling. If you set all the relevant styles yourself you know what the end result should be. If you only set those styles that are most immediately obvious, the end result will be (most likely) a combination of the browser defaults and your styles. This will eventually catch you out at some point. I think this is the second most common cause of CSS frustrations. Use id s for styling unique elements It's generally a good idea to apply an id attribute to any unique element that is going to be interacted with in any way. For CSS this will let you apply suitably specific styles more easily. Use an id on a unique page Pages that are significantly different in style and layout to the majority (homepage, search results, 404) should have an id on the body element. This gives you the specificity you need to ensure that your careful homepage styling doesn't get affected by styles you later apply to some internal content page.
