How to compute confidence interval for number to treat in a logistic regression?

I have built a multivariate regression model where $\mathbf x$ is the variable vector. Now I am asked to calculate the confidence interval for the number to treat (NNT) at $\mathbf x=\mathbf {x_0}$ which in turn requires to build the confidence interval for $p=Pr(1|\mathbf x=\mathbf {x_0})$. I'm using JMP which, to my knowledge, shows only point value and standard error of the parameter estimates but not the complete Fisher information. So I'm temped to use $\hat{p}=Pr(1|\mathbf x=\mathbf {x_0},\mathbf {\hat{b}})$ where $\mathbf {\hat{b}}$ is the vector of the ML parameter estimates, and then calculate $\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n$, but I doubt it is correct. Which is the simple way to do?
