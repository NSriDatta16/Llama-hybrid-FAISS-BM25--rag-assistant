I think you want to not have your host project compiling the plugin dlls. I think you want to have the plugins built in advance and perhaps embed the views in the assembly dll - this way, you can create the appropriate interfaces [Robert Harvey et-al] and let the host app rely on the fact that the dynamically loaded assembly's are ok. Perhaps you need to also create a plugin harness solution in which you (unit?) test the plugin as its developed/compiled - this seems necessary as some compilation errors in views dont show up immediately ( this post should also help with compiler errors in views - it worked for me).
