GLM distributions and link functions concept

There is something that i couldn't actually understand about GLMs. In wikipedia it says "(GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution". Does this mean logistic regression has a normal distribution as its error distribution ? I think it should have a binomial one. I couldn't even completely understand what an error distribution is... The thing is, what i understand with the GLM is that it helps to deal with data that has non-linear relations by using linear models. But the function uses residuals so the distribution shouldn't change much about its responses, so i think the link function is what makes the difference. Can somebody suggest me some sources for learning these models or clerify the misconception on my head ?
