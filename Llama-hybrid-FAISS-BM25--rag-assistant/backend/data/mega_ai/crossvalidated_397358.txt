validation vs test vs training accuracy, which one to compare for claiming model overfitting?

I have read on the several answers here and on the internet that cross-validation helps to indicate that if the model will generalize well or not and about overfitting. But I am confused that which two accuracies/errors amoung test/training/validation should I compare to be able to see if the model is overfitting or not? For example: I divide my data for 70% training and 30% test. When I get to run 10 fold cross-validation, I get 10 accuracies that I can take the average/mean of. should I call this mean as validation accuracy ? Afterward, I test the model on 30% test data and get Test Accuracy . In this case, what will be training accuracy ? and which two accuracies I compare to see if the model is overfitting or not? This is my first question on this platform so please ignore errors.
