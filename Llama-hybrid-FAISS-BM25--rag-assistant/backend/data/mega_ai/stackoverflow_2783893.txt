If your result type and your client type match (IOW, your sproc returns Select * from Client and you haven't modified the Client entity in the DBML since adding it), you can change the stored proc to automtically return IQueryable of Client instead of IQueryable of SelectClientsBySearchResult (see instructions below). Then no conversion is necessary. If they are different, there are a few different approaches. You can modify the partial class for your entities to add conversion methods to them, or you can use extension methods. Both of these approaches avoid overwriting when the code behind the DBML is regenerated. To change the stored proc return type: The DBML designer created the SelectClientsBySearchResult type for your stored proc when you added the stored proc to the DBML. This is the default behavior if you drag the proc from the server explorer to the procedures pane. Instead, drag the stored proc from the server explorer and drop it on the Client table. Now its return type is a collection of Client instead. I believe you can also change the return type after the fact (as it is now), but I don't have it installed right now and can't guide you through it.
