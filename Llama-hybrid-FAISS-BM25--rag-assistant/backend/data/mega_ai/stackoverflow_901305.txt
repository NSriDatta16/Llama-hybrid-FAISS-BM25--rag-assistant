In our organization, we have a selection of easy to solve non-critical tickets, which we tend to keep around as something to give to the new staff members as their first tasks. These tickets usually involve things around the main code base, occasionally containing new "nice-to-have" feature requests. Since they are not urgent/critical, it will not be a big deal if the junior developer makes mistakes. However, they get a sense of what it is like working on the real code, which helps to keep them focused and content.
