I redid your PCA in SPSS (I'm not R user). It was PCA based on covariances. I confirm your analysis. Eigenvalues (component variances) and the proportion of overall variance explained I 145.7983424 .9834567 II 2.4525573 .0165433 Eigenvectors (cosines of rotation of variables into components) I II X .7235615578 -.6902598583 Y .6902598583 .7235615578 Loadings (eigenvectors normalized to respective eigenvalues; loadings are the covariances between variables and components) I II X 8.736787614 -1.080991303 Y 8.334679634 1.133143904 Raw componenet scores (Centered XY data multiplied by eigenvectors) I II -20.36311916 -.33895962 -18.56100172 .10137150 -17.38502729 -.11464875 -15.35181292 .56792862 -14.69099392 -.18810082 -11.60576140 1.59724948 -9.86327828 1.97506923 -9.28526215 1.13224207 -7.96429587 1.06820882 -10.59402982 -3.13712683 -7.23731673 -1.06719832 -5.00792706 -.17898115 -3.05497611 .41946048 -1.94506575 .13418887 -1.52474156 -.87393809 -1.36451281 -2.15470883 3.87607199 1.88997907 2.31266941 -1.19757988 4.17269413 -.69654773 9.06852519 2.98675374 8.41574586 .85375121 10.33828396 1.42031271 9.41551294 -.99570731 14.59136448 2.98112427 12.07859576 -1.10160316 11.26433359 -3.40387930 15.31884763 -.60248432 16.52354240 -.78839862 17.12537318 -1.60626218 21.29756203 1.31848485 The component scores that you plotted as plot(pca_results$x) are these raw component scores printed above. The component scores on your biplot are these scores scaled to sum-of-squares=1 (sum of squares in each of the 2 columns was brought to 1). As for the loadings shown as red arrows on the biplot, they are, without doubt, rescaled loadings that I printed above. However - since I'm not R user - I can't tell you how exactly they were rescaled. But I suppose they linearly are related to the true loadings I printed. Biplots can be drawn in multiple ways, with various normalizations. I can't know how your R function exactly does it, and probably it is not too important to know it. Another my example, even more full, is here . It is the outputs of PCA and LDA (linear discriminant) analyses of iris data .
