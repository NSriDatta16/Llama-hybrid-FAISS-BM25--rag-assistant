Comparing time series data with different interval

I have time series data for one day (temperature) measured every 5 seconds and would like to increase the period between measurements and somehow calculate the level of error/similarity/correlation (I'm not sure which metric should be used) There is a plot where blue line is data with period set to 5 seconds, and orange one with period set to 10 minutes. By looking at this plot one can assume that it's quite good aproximation but I don't know what metric should be used to describe it best.
