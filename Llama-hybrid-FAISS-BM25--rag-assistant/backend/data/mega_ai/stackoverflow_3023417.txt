where does one define the creation of the database in the new Visual Studio Database project

I see that I can "Create a deployment Script and deploy the database" as a deployment action, howerver it's not clear where I script the actual creation of the database? I see under the "Storage" folder a sub folder for Filegroups, Files, and I'm guessing I could drop in a create database script into there, but how do I pick up the database name (which is set as a project property) Perhaps a better question would be where is this well documented?
