Why does a PCA component have negative values when all inputs are strictly positive?

Let's say I have X1, X2, X3, and X4. All four variables are strictly positive (no values below zero). The variables are on different scales. I do a PCA on the four variables' correlation matrix and get the first principal component, with loadings on X1, X2, X3, and X4 of 0.8, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.7 respectively. How come first principal component contains negative values? And is it possible to identify the value of the first principal component at which X1, X2, X3, and X4 = 0?
