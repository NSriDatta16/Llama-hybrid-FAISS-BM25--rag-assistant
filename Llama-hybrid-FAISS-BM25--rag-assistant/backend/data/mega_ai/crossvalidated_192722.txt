Dimension reduction using PCA in Matlab

I have a $152 \times 27578$ matrix, $152$ samples and $27578$ features, and I used the PCA function for the dimension reduction in Matlab. X = load(dataset); coeff = pca(X); It generated a $27578 \times 151$ matrix. But I don't understand what exactly it is generating and I am unable to understand what to do next. Can any one help me with the understanding? My main goal is to reduce the dimension of my original matrix.
