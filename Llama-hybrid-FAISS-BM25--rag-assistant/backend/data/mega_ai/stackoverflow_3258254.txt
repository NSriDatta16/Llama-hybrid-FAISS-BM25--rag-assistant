Capistrano 'reaper not found'

I'm new to deploying with Capistrano, and I'm trying the following: deploy.rb: set :application, "example.co.uk" # If you aren't deploying to /u/apps/#{application} on the target # servers (which is the default), you can specify the actual location # via the :deploy_to variable: set :deploy_to, "/home/example/#{application}" # SCM Options default_run_options[:pty] = true # Must be set for the password prompt from git to work ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true # Agent forwarding keys set :repository, "git@github.com:mongeese/example.git" # Your clone URL set :scm, "git" set :branch, "master" set :deploy_via, :remote_cache set :user, "james" # The server's user for deploys role :app, "example.co.uk" role :web, "example.co.uk" role :db, "example.co.uk", :primary => true set :use_sudo, false I get the following output: * executing `deploy:restart' * executing "/home/example/example.co.uk/current/script/process/reaper" servers: ["example.co.uk"] [example.co.uk] executing command ** [out :: example.co.uk] sh: /home/example/example.co.uk/current/script/process/reaper: not found command finished The "james" user can sudo. If I take out :use_sudo, I get the following error: * executing "sudo -p 'sudo password: ' -u app /home/example/example.co.uk/current/script/process/reaper" servers: ["example.co.uk"] [example.co.uk] executing command ** [out :: example.co.uk] sudo: unknown user: app command finished I'm obviously missing something completely, as Google only seems to turn up old results about this.
