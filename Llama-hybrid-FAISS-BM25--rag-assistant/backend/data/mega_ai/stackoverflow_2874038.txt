In the VS2008 menu, Project > Add New Itemâ€¦ > Data (category) > LINQ to SQL Classes A designer will open up. Open your database in the Server Explorer pane, and drag you tables onto the design surface. Edit after comments Here is an example of using LINQ to query the database in code: using(var db as NameOfYourLinqDataContextClass) { var myCars = from car in db.cars where car.owner_name.Equals("Jay") select car; foreach (var car in myCars) { myForm.myCarsList.Add(string.Format("{0} {1}", car.make, car.model)); } } Here I've queried the cars table in my database for any row where the value in the car_owner column is "Jay." Using this query, I concatenate the values from the make and model columns and put them in a list or something on my form. LINQ-to-SQL creates CLR classes based on the schema of your database. You create these query expressions "on-the-fly," which get converted into T-SQL queries behind the scenes and are executed against the database when the results are needed . That is to say that in the example above, no call is made to the database until the line foreach (var car in myCars) .
