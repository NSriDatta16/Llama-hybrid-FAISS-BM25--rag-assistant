1) on a product information page, a “buy now/add to cart” button that adds to a cart Maybe this question will help you(look at the question, not the answer :-) ) as it shows how to add an item to the cart by linking to a certain URL which would make it possible to do this from outside of Magento. 2) on every page, a view cart/checkout option Do you want to actually show the items in the cart or simply have a link to the cart/checkout? The latter would be trivial obviously. 3) on a checkout page, with additional content already in place, having the magento “checkout” block integrated in the page (and not the entire page generated from Magento). I think that should be possible, but would require you to look into the internals of Magento. To do this you would have to include Magento's JS and CSS files into your site fake a checkout request in Magento(by mimicing the bootstrap of Magento and injecting your own instance of Mage_Core_Controller_Request_Http with your fake URL of a checkout) capture the output of the fake request(that should be possible via the ZF if you can't figure it out you can still use ob_start and the like) print out the html code in your own site If you have had experience with the Zend Framework this shouldn't be too hard for you. As for the rest you won't have to do much really, since the (onepage) checkout is based on AJAX calls that probably don't interfere with you actual site. I can't tell you if this is going to be as easy as with osCommerce(haven't been using it), but I'm very positive that it should doable.
