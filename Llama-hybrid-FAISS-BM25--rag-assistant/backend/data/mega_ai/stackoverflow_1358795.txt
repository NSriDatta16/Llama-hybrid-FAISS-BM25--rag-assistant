If you want to execute the code after the breakpoint, up to another line, use JMarsch's "Run to Cursor" suggestion. If you want to SKIP the following lines, and resume execution at another point, you can use your mouse to drag the yellow arrow in the left margin of the code window - down to the line you want to execute next. This is also useful if you want to re-execute some code that's already run - just drag the yellow arrow UP to that line. I often use this to "Step Into" code that I've already done a "Step Over" on. "Set Next Statement" in the right-click menu has the same effect. -Tom Bushell
