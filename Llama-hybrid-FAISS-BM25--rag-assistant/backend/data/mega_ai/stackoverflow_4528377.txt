The way that you've phrased the question, the answer is yes, use browser detection to set simples CSS with JavaScript depending on the browser. But, I don't think this is what you really intend to ask. The more progressive approach is to use feature detection as opposed to browser detection i.e. "does the browser support x?" - if it does then do this, otherwise do something else. Sometimes however, this isn't always so easily possible to do in that it may not be so straightforward to write the code that allows to test for a feature. I'd say in these cases, the pragmatic approach may be to browser detect as specifically as possible, with a view to feature detecton in the future when there are known/reliable ways to test for a feature. If you could provide more details by editing your question, we may be able to help further.
