How does a moving average model for forecast work?

Excuse me for the question, I'm reading "Forecasting: principles and practice" by Rob J Hyndman. I'm stuck on this chapter: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/4 which briefly explains how a moving average works. the reason is that I haven't understood how the $e_{t-k}$ with $k \in [1,\ldots,q]$ (look at the formula at the link above) are computed. I would like to apply a simple linear regression using least min squares on the errors between the forecasts and the real values, but I wasn't able to understand which is the value to assign to these errors. How can I act to obtain them? Thanks in advance!
