When using multiple continuous instruments do I get a weighted Local Average Treatment Effect?

I have the following model: $y_i = \alpha + \beta d_i + g(x_i)+e_i$ Since I have reason to believe that $d_i$ is endogenous, I am using 3 plausibly exogenous variables ( $z_1,z_2,z_3$ ) to instrument it. Both $d_i$ and my instruments are continuous variables. My first stage regression takes the form $d_i = \gamma+\gamma_1 z_1+\gamma_2 z_2+ \gamma_3 z_3+f(x_i) + u_i$ Question1 : What is the interpretation of Local Average Treatment effect when there is one continuous instrument (say just $z_1$ )? Is it the treatment effect on all $i$ 's whose $d_i$ changes due to a change in $z_1$ ? Can I interpret that as the average treatment effect of $d_i$ over the support of $z_1$ ? Question 2 : When I have multiple instuments, like in my case, does the LATE become a weighted average of LATEs from each instrument?
