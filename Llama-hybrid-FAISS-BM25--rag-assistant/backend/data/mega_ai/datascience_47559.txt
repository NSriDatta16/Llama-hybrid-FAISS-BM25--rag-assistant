Cardinality vs width in the ResNext architecture

I was recently reading the paper Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks . One thing the author mentions in Section (5.1) is that increasing the cardinality (or, the number of branches), decreases validation error more than increasing the bottleneck width or increasing the depth. I understand the depth part, but I'm a bit confused about the width. Isn't the cardinality of a residual block the same as the bottleneck width? If not, what is the difference? Thanks!
