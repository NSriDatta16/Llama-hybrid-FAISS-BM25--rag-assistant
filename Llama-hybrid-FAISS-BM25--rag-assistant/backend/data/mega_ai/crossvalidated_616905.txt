Gibbs Sampler Initialization

I am trying to implement a Gibbs sampler with three blocks, that's not actually a full conditional Gibbs sampler. Say I partitition my parameter $X$ into three: { $X_1$ , $X_2$ , $X_3$ }. I inted to sample, in random order, $X_1|X_2$ and $X_2|X_1$ and then sample $X_3|X_2,X_1$ . I am running into trouble initializing the algorithm when the initial state $X$ has probability almost zero given the invariant distribution $\pi$ (i.e. $\pi(X(0)) \approx0$ ). If I sample $X_1|X_2$ first, the values are so off that I get an almost degenerate $p(X_2|X_1)$ , so that I cannot sample from it using numerical methods. $X_2$ is actually a matrix and a vector conditional on the inverse of that matrix. The problem I'm having is that I can only sample the zero matrix---which doesn't have an inverse---because of floating point precision. Am I simply running into a numerical problem, or is there something more fundamentally wrong with my Markov chain? If it were irreducible I should be able to reach a point within my target distribution in finite time. Is it cheating if I pick $X(0)$ such that $\pi(X(0))\gg0$ ? Would I be risking pseudo-convergence?
