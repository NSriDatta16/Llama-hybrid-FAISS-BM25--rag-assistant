In the context of this question ; java, c++, javascript the languages are still evolving. I can't say about other languages. The language standard/specification changes over time Libraries are added to supplement the language constructs e.g Boost, Google Collections, Apache Commons, jQuery Applications will rarely be bound to a single aspect of a language Across organizations/projects, coding standards change A project I worked upon recommended against using primitives When unfamiliar with the constructs used, I put in pseudo-code flagged with //TODO first .. then go in and find the actual API to use. IMO, the answer to your question is - there is no definite answer.
