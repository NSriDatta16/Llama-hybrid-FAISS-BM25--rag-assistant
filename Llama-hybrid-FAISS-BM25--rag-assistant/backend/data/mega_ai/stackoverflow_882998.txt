How can I use the Winforms WebBrowser control in a webapp?

I have developed a library to manipulate HTML to conform to our needs using the WebBrowser control, however I need this library to work on a web app and not a winforms app. The main issue I get is this: "ActiveX control '8856f961-340a-11d0-a96b-00c04fd705a2' cannot be instantiated because the current thread is not in a single-threaded apartment." I understand this is because the WebBrowser control needs to be ran in a STA Thread, but obviously a web app isn't an STA environment. Its a server side process though so its not in a page itself. Any ideas on how I can get round this? I considered setting the AspCompat="true" attribute on the Page tag of a hidden page and running it from that but I would rather a more elegant solution. Cheers
