How are Random Forests not sensitive to outliers?

I've read in a few sources, including this one , that Random Forests are not sensitive to outliers (in the way that Logistic Regression and other ML methods are, for example). However, two pieces of intuition tell me otherwise: Whenever a decision tree is constructed, all of the points must be classified. This means that even outliers will get classified, and hence will affect the decision trees where they were selected during boosting. Bootstrapping is a part of how a RandomForest does sub-sampling. Bootstrapping is susceptible to outliers. Is there any way to reconcile my intuition about its sensitivity to outliers, with sources that disagree?
