By storing overlapping projections in different sort orders, column stores based on the C-Store architecture (so, as far as commericial implementations go, Vertica) natively support secondary indexes. See http://db.csail.mit.edu/projects/cstore/vldb.pdf Also check out MonetDb, which treats "create index" statements as hints for its self-organizing engine.
