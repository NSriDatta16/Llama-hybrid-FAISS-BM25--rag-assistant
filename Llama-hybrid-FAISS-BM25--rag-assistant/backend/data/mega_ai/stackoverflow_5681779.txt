The only transform that'll be run automatically is the one to text plain, which is used for the full text indexing. If you're using Share, then Share will try to do two more transformations for you. Firstly, it'll try to generate a thumbnail (via the rendition service) when you view the folder with your file in it. For this to work, you'd normally define a transformer from your new mime type to image/jpeg. Additionally, when you view the document details in Share, it'll try to give you a web preview. If you'd like to have a PDF version of your document generated when you upload it, then you'll want to define a rule. You could do this with a transform content rule, or you could write a script to use the Rendition Service if you wanted a lot of control over it.
