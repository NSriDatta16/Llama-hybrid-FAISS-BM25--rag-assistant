How to import these postal codes into a normalized table?

I've got a CSV with some data that looks like this: A0A0A0,48.5674500000,-54.8432250000,Gander,NL A0A1A0,47.0073470000,-52.9589210000,Aquaforte,NL A0A1B0,47.3622800000,-53.2939930000,Avondale,NL But my database is normalized such that Cities and Provinces are in separate tables, each with their own ID column. So what's the easiest way to import this file into 3 separate tables and link the foreign keys properly? To be more clear, the tables are cities (id, name, province_id) provinces (id, code, name, country_id) postal_codes (id, code, city_id) countries (id, code, name)
