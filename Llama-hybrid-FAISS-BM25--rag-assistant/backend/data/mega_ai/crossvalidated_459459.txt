Both the Monte Carlo Markov chains (sampling-based) and variational methods (optimization-based) are for approximate inference in PGM alongside expectationâ€“maximization (EM). The problem arises from scenarios like calculating this complete likelihood function: $$Pr(Y|\alpha, \beta) = \int_x Pr(Y, X|\alpha, \beta)dX$$ where $Y$ stands for observed variables and $X$ for latent variables, and this function is intractable and we should address this problem using approximate inference. We can either use the sampling-based MCMC or the optimization-based variational methods. References: 1. Getting Started in Probabilistic Graphical Models
