If you want to generate primes from 1 to whatever, then the fastest way is probably a wheeled Sieve as implemented here , which can typically test more than 3,000,000 candidate primes a second on an average laptop (and that's using an unoptimized language like VB.net), and factor the non-primes to boot. In c++ it could be easily 5 to 20 times faster.
