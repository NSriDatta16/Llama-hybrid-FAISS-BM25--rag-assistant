how to organize images in threads?

im developing a forum and users will be able to upload pictures. i wonder how i should organize the folders for this? should they be sorted by threads or users? but how will they then be organized within these folders? and how could i couple some post's pictures to the database entry? eg, if the post got 5 images uploaded, should i have a one-to-many (one thread - many pictures) relationship where the pic entries contain the name of the pictures? i've never done this before. would be great if someone could give me some piece of advice.
