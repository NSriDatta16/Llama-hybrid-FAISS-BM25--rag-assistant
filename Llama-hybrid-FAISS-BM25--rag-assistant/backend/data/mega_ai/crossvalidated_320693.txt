To give a general answer, feature engineering in most cases is about extracting meaningful features from your data, so if you give more information to your model, it obviously should behave better. Say that your data consists of e-mail addresses in form ‘name.surname@domain.country-code’. If you used them as-is in your model, each person would be characterized by a unique e-mail, so this wouldn’t tell us much. It would tell us only that one e-mail possibly belongs to different person then another. With feature engineering, from such addresses you could extract information about possible gender (name), family background and ethnicity (surname), nationality (domain) and many more - it gives you pretty much information, doesn’t it?
