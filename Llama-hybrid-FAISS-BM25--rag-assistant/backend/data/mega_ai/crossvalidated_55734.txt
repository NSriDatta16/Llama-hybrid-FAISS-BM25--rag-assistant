Testing a dataset against a distribution with parameters estimated from that dataset

I am trying to figure out the best distribution to fit some data to, and I'm not sure if what I am doing is statistically correct. My data consists of 20 samples / year over 10 years. For each sample I have run a distribution fitting algorithm (using fitdistr() in R), to get the estimated parameters for each type of distribution. I am testing gamma, chi-squared, weibull and lognormal distributions. My next step was to then run a Kolmogorov Smirnov test, using the sample data, and setting the parameters as estimated from that data. I was going to find which distribution was the overall 'best' (lowest average p-value for all 200 samples), and say that this was the distribution my data described. I have read that using the KS test in this way is incorrect and the resulting p-values will be unreliable. I'm not sure if I can use the KS test in this way, or if I should do and maximum likelihood estimation.
