MS Access 2007: embedding tiff images in forms

my problem seems simple: I need to display an tiff image in a form, with the path of the image chosen from the combobox value. I had tried to use almost all the default controls + some activex objects (i.e. web browser control), but without any luck. My question is: what is the preferred, least obtrusive way to accomplish this task? Thank you.
