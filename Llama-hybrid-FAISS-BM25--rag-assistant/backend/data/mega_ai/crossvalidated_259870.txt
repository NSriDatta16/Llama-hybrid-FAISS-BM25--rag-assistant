Difference between multinomial logistic regression and multiple independent binary logistic regressions

Suppose dependent variable has more than two possible discrete outcomes. I wonder what is the difference between fitting a multinomial logistic regression model and several pairwise binary logistic regression models? Do they return the p-values of coefficients? # ------- Edit. I did a comparison between multinational logistic regression and binomial logistic regression in R. They gave a different result. Hope someone could help. Suppose I am interested in what is the odds ratio of being in pier and beach given one-unit of income increase. Fishing$mode has four classes, beach , pier , boat and charter . In the multinomial scenario, I used following code to get the p value. library("nnet") data("Fishing", package = "mlogit") fishing.mu the p value of the coefficient of income is 9.271562e-08. Then I fit a logistic regression using a subset of data, mode%in%c("beach","pier") . mylogit |z|) # (Intercept) 7.037e-01 2.126e-01 3.310 0.000932 *** # income -1.135e-04 4.817e-05 -2.356 0.018495 * # --- # Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 # # (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) # # Null deviance: 426.30 on 311 degrees of freedom # Residual deviance: 420.58 on 310 degrees of freedom # AIC: 424.58 # # Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 this time, the p value of the coefficient of income becomes 0.018495. Why does this happen? Did I miss anything?
