Yup that looks like a bug. Can you turn this into a test that uses Test::More and submit it to the RT queue and someone (probably me) will fix that. Note that if you Dump $obj->store you see that the trait is properly applied to the direct attribute but it seems that it's getting lost during the inheritance process. You can report bugs against MooseX::Storage in RT
