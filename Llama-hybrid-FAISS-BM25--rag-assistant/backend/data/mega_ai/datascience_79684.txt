Finding the worst affected industry due to COVID in terms of unemployment

My goal is to find the worst affected industries from COVIDâ€”19 in terms unemployment. In terms of the data I will use for this task, I have a time series county-wise unemployment rate data of each month and business distribution data. Business distribution data contains number of establishments in each county by their respective industries. (Manufacturing -121, Accommodation and Food Services -564, Construction-32 etc.) Unemployment rate data gives monthly unemployment rate in each county. From this data, what would your recommendation be to find the worst and least affected industry? Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
