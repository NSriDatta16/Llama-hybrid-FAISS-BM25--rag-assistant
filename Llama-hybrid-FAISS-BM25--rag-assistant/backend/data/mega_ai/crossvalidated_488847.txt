ML Model: Stock market price prediction model

I got asked this in an interview. "If you had a lot of data about a lot of stocks, how would you go about predicting the next price of a stock?" "What are advantages and disadvantages of using certain models/strategies?" The question seemed intentionally so open-ended, but I didn't know how to approach it. With some more thinking, I feel like one approach is to break stocks up by sector, since different sectors may have different relationships. Then, I could use PCA in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then use regression in order to predict prices. What do people think are other, better solutions?
