With jQuery and DOM, if you replace a DOM element with exactly the same DOM element with exactly the same DOM id ( so a div with id "div1" gets replaced by another div with id "div1") then the associated jQuery data with that DOM element gets lost. jQuery's pointer actually points to a ghost element which no longer exist on the page. To see the proof, fire up firebug in Firefox and simply go $("#layoutHeader") before and after your AJAX post. Click on the element returned in the console both the times. You will notice that on the second click (i.e. one after the POST returns) your firebug will point to a greyed out ghost element. Solution is to refactor your code a bit. Try this function handler(event,ui){ $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: '/SiteSetup/GetMarkup/' + $(ui.draggable).attr("id"), success: function (data) { $('.draggable').draggable('destroy'); $('#layoutHeader').replaceWith(data); $('.draggable').draggable({ revert: true }); } $('#layoutHeader').droppable({drop: handler}); } $(function () { $('.draggable').draggable({ revert: true }); $('#layoutHeader').droppable({drop: handler}); });
