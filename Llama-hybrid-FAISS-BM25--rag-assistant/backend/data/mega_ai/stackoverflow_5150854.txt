So this actually is a game theory question (economics) not a discrete math problem, re-tagging your question might attract the kind of attention you want. In game theory, the idea of a "solution" is usually Nash equilibrium . for zero sum games, it turns out the algorithm you want to solve this is a linear programming problem. See this wikipedia page for an example of how to set it up.
