Those are objects which are already been placed in the scope by the servlet container, so that it's accessible by EL (Expression Language), such as the PageContext , HttpServletRequest#getParameter() , HttpServletRequest#getHeader() and so on. Those are just for convenience so that you don't need to use old-fahioned scriptlets to grab them. So instead of for example you can just do ${pageContext.session.maxInactiveInterval} ${param.foo} ${header['user-agent']} ${cookie.foo} You see that they follows the JavaBean conventions to be accessed (i.e. you can just invoke the getters the JavaBean way). You see that I used the brace notation [] to get the user-agent , that's because the - is a reserved character in EL, so ${header.user-agent} isn't going to work, it would try to return the result of request.getHeader("user") - pageContext.findAttribute("agent") which is obviously not going to work. For an overview of them all, check the chapter Implicit Objects in the Java EE tutorial.
