What can cause autocorrelation in higher lag orders of returns?

I am fitting an AR(p) model to the daily time series of S&P500 returns. I have examined AIC/BIC up to 5 lags and both show that model with 2 lags is optimal. However, when I examine the residuals of regression, autocorrelation appears at 20+ lags, as shown below. What can be explanation for this? VOlatillity clustering/need for GARCH? MA? AR(30) solves it, but I don't know how to interpret all of this.... I hope that someone would like to help!
