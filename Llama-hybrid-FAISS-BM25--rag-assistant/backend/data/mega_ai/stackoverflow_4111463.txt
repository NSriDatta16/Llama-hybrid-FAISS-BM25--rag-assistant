How to better organize several projects in one solution and their respective unit/integration tests?

I am doing an AI project that currently had the following namespace/package structure: My ideia is to have some Unit/Integration tests for each one of the modules (probably not for all of them. Startup probably won't be tested). Each one of these "main" packages is in a different physical file. I'd like to know what you think would be better: Having for each physical file X.dll a X.Tests.dll Having a Tests physical file that has the whole lot of tests (doesn't seem like a good idea). Incorporating Breakthrough's tests in Breakthrough.dll, AI.GeneticAlgorithms in AI.GeneticAlgorithms.dll, etc. I kind of like this solution, as then I won't have my Visual Studio solution explorer cluttered with the the whole set of Test projects. Thanks!
