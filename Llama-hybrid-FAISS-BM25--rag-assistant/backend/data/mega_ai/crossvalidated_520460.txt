CausalImpact for a single individual time series of physiological data

I am using CausalImpact for the first time and I am not completely sure whether it would be statistically correct for my case. We wanted to test if the change of enclosure did significantly impact the daily heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) for one specific animal? Settings: Study Subject: One male Data: Daily heart rate average (HR) and hart rate variability (HRV) obtained from an implantable heart monitor. Treatment: Moving from one enclosure (housed with a female and 4 offspring) to another enclosure (singly housed) Pre-treatment: 16 days pre change of enclosure (including the day of change) Post-treatment: 15 days after the change of enclosure. Results and Plot from CausalImpact: Moving to a new enclosure decreased HR by 12% (CI: -15%, -9%; p = 0.001) and increased HRV by 13% (CI: 6%, 20%; p = 0.002). QUESTION: Is it possible to estimate the causal effect with sample from only one individual?
