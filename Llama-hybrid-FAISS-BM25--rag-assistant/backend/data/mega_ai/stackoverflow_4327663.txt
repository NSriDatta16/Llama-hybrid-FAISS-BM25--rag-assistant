This is hard to answer as a lot depends on what exactly your are doing with the tokens, file type values, and Target instances. However, I think the underlying theme here is that you need to replace if() statements with virtual method calls. For example, your code fragment could end up being if (tokenLists.supportsFileType(token)) tokenLists.getListForType(token).put_nextToken_into_this_list(); else return an_error(); The above tokenLists example could be generalized into a registry of TargetSpecificLogic instances, which combine all kinds of filetype specific methods. You Target class could implement a virtual method retrieveAllKnownFileTypes() , which the subclasses would extend, and which the rest of your code could evaluate. You Target class could implement a virtual method bool isFileTypeKnown(filetype) , returning true or false . ...and so on.
