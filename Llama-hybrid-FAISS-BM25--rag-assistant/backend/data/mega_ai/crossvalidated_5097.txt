How to assess overfitting?

This is a follow-up of the question I posted earlier . I am assessing the two RF models which are generated using two different set of features NF - Test_Accuracy > Training accuracy (500 features) HF - Test_Accuracy Testing and Training is done using independent data sets and the accuracy is derived from the average of a 5-cross validation. The difference between the models are in the number of features. I am afraid there could be a possible overfitting in one of the model (It is not clear to me which model could be overfitting, because I have used independent dataset and k-cross validation on the datasets). I would like to know what are the standard methods (tools/libraries) which can be used to assess overfitting.
