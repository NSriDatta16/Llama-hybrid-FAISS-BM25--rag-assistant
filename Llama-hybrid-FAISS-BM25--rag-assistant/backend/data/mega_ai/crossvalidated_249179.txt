Maybe I'm missing something, but there is no such thing as a polynomial with an end point. The x axis goes out to infinity, and the polynomial has a value for every x. As noted, you can force it through any particular (x0,y0), but it will continue to have changing y values at higher x values. I'm thinking you need at least two functions, one for x x0. They can be forced to have the same slope at the crossover point. Alternatively, if you are OK with doing it all numerically, just apply a moving average filter to generate a smoothed y value for every x. Savitsky-Golay filter functions are pretty easy to use.
