A brute-force approach would use a Taylor series expansion of $\exp(\cdot)$ at 0 and group terms appropriately to demonstrate the relationship. I have not attempted to do so myself but an inspection of the first few terms does indicate that the proposed relationship holds. Perhaps, there is a more elegant approach? $$\exp\left[\gamma_1 x^1\right] = 1 + \frac{\gamma_1 x^1}{1!} + \frac{\left(\gamma_1 x^1\right)^2}{2!} + \ldots$$ $$\exp\left[\gamma_2 x^2\right] = 1 + \frac{\gamma_2 x^2}{1!} + \frac{\left(\gamma_2 x^2\right)^2}{2!} + \ldots$$ $$\exp\left[\gamma_3 x^3\right] = 1 + \frac{\gamma_3 x^3}{1!} + \frac{\left(\gamma_3 x^3\right)^2}{2!} + \ldots$$
