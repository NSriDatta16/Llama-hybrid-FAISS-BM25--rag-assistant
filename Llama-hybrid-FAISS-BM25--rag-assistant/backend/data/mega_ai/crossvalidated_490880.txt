To add a bit more context to Robert's post, there is a way to formally test whether the model with the random intercept fits the data better than an OLS model without a random intercept (and no person "fixed effects"). Below is code to demonstrate the idea using the sleepstudy data in the lme4 package. library(lme4) data(sleepstudy) # First the random intercept model mlm1 Chisq) ols1 2 1965.0 1971.4 -980.52 1961.0 mlm1 3 1916.5 1926.1 -955.27 1910.5 50.508 1 1.187e-12 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 The null hypothesis of this likelihood ratio test is that the random intercept variance is 0; practically this would mean that there is no between person variation in average Reaction time values. The LR test is highly significant, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis. Thus the more complicated lmer model, which differs from the OLS model by 1 parameter (the random intercept variance) provides a better fit to the data. AIC and BIC are both reduced in the lmer model, further supporting the conclusion that the random intercept model does a better job representing the pattern of correlation in the data than the naive OLS model.
