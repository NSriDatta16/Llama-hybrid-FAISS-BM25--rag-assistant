One can think of a PCA as being like a FA in which the communalities are assumed to equal 1 for all variables. In practice, this means that items that would have relatively low factor loadings in FA due to low communality will have higher loadings in PCA. This is not a desirable feature if the primary purpose of the analysis is to cut item length and clean a battery of items of those with low or equivocal loadings, or to identify concepts that are not well represented in the item pool.
