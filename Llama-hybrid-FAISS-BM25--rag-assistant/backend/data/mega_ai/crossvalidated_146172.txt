Bounded and unbounded support vectors for nu-SVMs

How do we find out which of the support vectors for a nu-svm are its bounded or unbounded support vectors? For c-SVMs the test is easy: a support vector with $\alpha_i = C$ denotes a bounded support vector, while the others are unbounded. Whats an analogous test for nu-SVMs? Also it would be of great help if you could direct me to how to do this test for libSVM output. Thanks!
