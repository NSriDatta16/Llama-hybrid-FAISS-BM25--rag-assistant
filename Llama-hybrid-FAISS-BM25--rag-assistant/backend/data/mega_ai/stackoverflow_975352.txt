What version of eclipse? It is possible to launch the JDT compiler via ant. See: http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/guide/jdt_api_compile.htm See 'Using the ant javac adapter' Warnings and errors are attached to resources (such as files or CompilationUnits) in the Eclipse workspace. They are known as 'markers'. It may be easier to get the warnings as markers rather than via the compilation process directly. Another avenue to look into is launching a PDE build but I think this is overkill for your requirements and such build scripts can get very difficult to maintain with time.
