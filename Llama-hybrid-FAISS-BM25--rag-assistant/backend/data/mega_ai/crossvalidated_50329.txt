Factor analysis for categorical target variable

I'm doing some research into factor analysis and I've hit that barrier where I don't know what search terms to use. I'm trying to see if something is possible. Basically I have a data set with ~100 numerical variables. Each record also has a target variable which is a category. My ultimate goal is to perform knn on this data set. To reduce the dimensionality I ran PCA which gave a minor performance boost. My understanding is that PCA reduces the data set to variables which capture the most variance in the multi-dimensional data set. But this method doesn't even consider the category that each record has. Is there any method to reduce the number of dimensions, or identify key factors that specifically contribute to the target variable? This may be poorly worded, so let me know if it doesn't make sense and I'll try to clear it up. Thanks!
