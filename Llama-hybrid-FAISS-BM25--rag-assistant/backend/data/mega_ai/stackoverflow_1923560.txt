SEO Destroyed By URL Forwarding - Can't figure out another way

We design and host websites for our clients/sales force. We have our own domain: http://www.firstheartland.com Our agents fill out a series of forms on our website that are loaded into a database. The database then renders the website as a database driven website. /repwebsites/repSite.cfm?link=&rep=rick.higgins /repwebsites/repSite.cfm?link=&rep=troy.thompson /repwebsites/repSite.cfm?link=&rep=david.kover The database application reads which "rep" the site is for and the appropriate page to display from the query string. The page then outputs the content and the appropriate CSS to style the page and give it its own individual branding. We have told the user to use Domain Name Forwarding to get the users to their spot on our server. However, everyone seems to be getting indexed under our domain instead of their own. We could in theory assign an new IP to them, the cost is not the issue. The issue is how we would possibly accomplish this. With all of that said, them being indexed under our domain would still be OK as long as they would actually show up high in the ranking for their search term. For instance, an agent owns TroyLThompson.com. If I search Troy L Thompson, It does not show up in my search. Only, "troy thompson first heartland" works (they show up third) Apart from scrapping the whole system, I don't know what to do. I'm very open to ideas.
