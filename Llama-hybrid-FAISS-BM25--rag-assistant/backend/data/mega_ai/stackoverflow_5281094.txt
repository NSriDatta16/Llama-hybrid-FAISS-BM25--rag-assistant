Can't disable the debugging logs in latest version of Flurry 2.8.4 in iPhone

I'm using latest version of Flurry SDK for iPhone. It works better than the earlier version. But I can't disable the debugging logs in console, as per their instruction - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { [FlurryAPI setDebugLogEnabled:NO]; [FlurryAPI startSession:#FLURRY_ID]; } But still its logging in my console Flurry: Initialized session from scratch with startTime[2011-03-12 05:54:58 +0000] Flurry: Created active session with API Flurry: Session reports on close enabled[1] Flurry: Session reports on pause enabled[1] Flurry: Event logging enabled[1] Flurry: Finish starting session with apiKey Flurry: Sending sessions to server withTimeout[0] Flurry: Creating HTTP data from sessions Flurry: cacheTimeStamp[0] numCachedItems[0] Flurry: protocol[15] platform[2] agent[47]
