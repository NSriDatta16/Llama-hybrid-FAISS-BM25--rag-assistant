Test for difference of spatial/temporal distribution

I have the data of the average hourly consumption of electric power in 50 districst of a city, for the days of 2 months: DAY HOUR DISTRICT E.CONSUM 1 0 1 127.63 1 0 2 82.03 ..... 60 23 50 1.23 By some graphical comparison, it is pretty clear to me that the "behaviour" of the city is really different whether the days are working days or not, but I would like to perfomr a test to prove it. Here's what I tought: divide the dataset in 2, Working days and Holidays compute the sample mean over the days, in order to obtain 2 "histograms" for each district, one for the Working and another for the Holidays Now I need to test for the equality of 50 coupled histograms, any idea how to do it? Any idea on other ways to proceed is really welcome!!
