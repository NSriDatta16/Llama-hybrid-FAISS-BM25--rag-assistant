You need to create an URL that handles the pictures and returns the DB content into the response stream. As it happens at SQL Saturday #26 I had a presentation that showed exactly this. You can doaloand my slides from the link, go into Demo 2 and in the lotsOfPictures solution you'll find Picture.aspx.cs, that does exactly what you ask for: using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connStr)) { conn.Open(); SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand( @"SELECT picture FROM resized_pictures WHERE picture_id = @id AND picture_size = @size;", conn); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", pictureId); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@size", size); using (SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader( CommandBehavior.SequentialAccess)) { if (rdr.Read()) { Response.ContentType = "image/jpeg"; byte[] bytes = new byte[1024]; long offSet = 0; int countRead = (int) rdr.GetBytes( 0, offSet, bytes, 0, 1024); while (countRead > 0) { Response.OutputStream.Write(bytes, 0, countRead); offSet += countRead; countRead = (int)rdr.GetBytes( 0, offSet, bytes, 0, 1024); } } } } The important pieces of the puzzle are the SequentialAccess flag passed to the SqlCommand reader that will return a true stream, so the page does not load the whole image in memory before returnning. For a high performance server you should use async operations, like described in Asynchronous Pages in ASP.NET 2.0 .
