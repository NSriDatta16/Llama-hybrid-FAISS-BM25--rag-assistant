Learning material about time series

Possible Duplicate: Books for self-studying time series analysis? I am new to time series modelling altogether. But I am aware about regression modelling and some data mining algorithms like decision trees. I want to learn time series from scratch. My background is Mathematics. Please suggest me any good book/material/web resource for step by step learning with case studies. Thanks
