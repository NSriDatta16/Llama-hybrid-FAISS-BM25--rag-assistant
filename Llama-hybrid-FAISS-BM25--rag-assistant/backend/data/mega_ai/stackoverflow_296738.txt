How can I parse relative dates with Perl?

I'd love to know if there is a module to parse "human formatted" dates in Perl. I mean things like "tomorrow", "Tuesday", "next week", "1 hour ago". My research with CPAN suggest that there is no such module, so how would you go about creating one? NLP is way over the top for this.
