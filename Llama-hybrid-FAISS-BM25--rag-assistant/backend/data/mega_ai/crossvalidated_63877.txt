I am not sure if the following is what you want, but should you be interesting in a test for the hypothesis: “Is my observed realization of random variable X (1 if d > x, 0 otherwise) distributed as defined in expected distribution Y?”, use the Pearson’s Chi Squared test of independence / homogeneity. Note that this is not a method of time series analysis and will ignore the time dimension of your data, and will furthermore heavily depend on the choice of x.
