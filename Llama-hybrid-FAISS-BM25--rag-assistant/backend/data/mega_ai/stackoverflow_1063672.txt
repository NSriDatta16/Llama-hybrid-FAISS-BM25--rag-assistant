Give the final paragraph an id - #disclaimer, perhaps - then style that to have padding-top. Herkimer County Community College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or marital status in admission, employment, or in any aspect regarding the conduct of College business. and... #disclaimer { padding-top: 10px; } [EDIT] An alternative to this, based on your comments, would be to surround the article(s) in a div, and give that div.class a bottom-margin/padding style.
