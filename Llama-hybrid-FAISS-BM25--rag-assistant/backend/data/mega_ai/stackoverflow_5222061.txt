Create grouping variable for consecutive sequences and split vector

I have a vector, such as c(1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 17, 29, 30) and I would like to group together the 'neighboring' elements that form a regular, consecutive sequence, i.e. an increase by 1, in a ragged vector resulting in: L1: 1 L2: 3,4,5 L3: 9,10 L4: 17 L5: 29,30 Naive code (of an ex-C programmer): partition.neighbors Now I understand that a) R is not C (despite the curly brackets) b) global variables are pure evil c) that is a horribly inefficient way of achieving the result , so any better solutions are welcome.
