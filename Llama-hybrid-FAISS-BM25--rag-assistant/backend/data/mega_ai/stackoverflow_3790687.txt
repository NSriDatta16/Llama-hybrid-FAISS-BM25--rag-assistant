Hacking away the hex representation in a text editor is a stone knives and bearskins way to go about it. Instead, use Wireshark 's Follow TCP Stream feature . It's on the Analyze menu. It's also on the context menu you get by right-clicking a line in the packet list. This feature not only presents you with the plain text representation of the captured stream — which is what you wanted with your hex dump hackery — it interleaves both halves of the conversation in different colors so you can see each reply in context with the sent message that caused it. You can instead make it show you just the sending half or just the receiving half. It even does some rudimentary formatting, like interpreting newlines, very helpful with protocols like HTTP. It isn't always convenient to use the Wireshark GUI. For those times you must use tshark or tcpdump to make the capture, you can use capture files: $ tshark -w stuff-to-analyze.pcap -i eth1 host 1.2.3.4 and port 5678 You can run that on a remote Unix box you only have SSH or modem access to, for example. Send the stuff-to-analyze.pcap file back to your desktop workstation where you can load it up in Wireshark to analyze it.
