Instead of converting matrices into a single vector, you can follow the structure of convolutional neural networks for images , where the four matrices correspond to four input channels, and the elements of the same position are connected together by definition. If you don't need the assumption that an element is also related with its neighbors, you can use 1*1 convolutional layers and then fully connected layers. If you don't need the assumption that common patterns are shared across different positions, you can remove/relax the parameter sharing scheme.
