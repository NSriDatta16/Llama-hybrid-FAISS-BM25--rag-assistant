Not an answer to your question, but this solution is not optimal for a number of reasons: It depends on two servers being up. It is slower as the request has to be made twice. It takes up double the bandwidth, and if you use a PHP script, additional resources on the proxying server. Are you sure you have to do this? If you really do, look into Apache's proxying capabilities instead of a PHP script that can deal with the problem you describe (and several others, for example session management, and passing through the HTTP_REFERER and HTTP_USER_AGENT variables). Here is a tutorial for it. Note that this requires root access to the server.
