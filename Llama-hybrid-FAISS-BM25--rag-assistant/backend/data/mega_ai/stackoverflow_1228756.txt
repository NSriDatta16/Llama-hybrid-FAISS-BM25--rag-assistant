My personal favorite GUI designing software is Microsoft Visual Studio. It's very simple, literally drag and drop GUI design. While Visual Studio as a whole isn't free, different free "express" editions are available. The only difference is with the express editions is that you're limited to a single language. I would recommend trying out Visual C# Express which can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/ As for the C# language, it's a blend of C++ and Java. It's very easy to pick up if you've used either language before and is well documented at www.msdn.com.
