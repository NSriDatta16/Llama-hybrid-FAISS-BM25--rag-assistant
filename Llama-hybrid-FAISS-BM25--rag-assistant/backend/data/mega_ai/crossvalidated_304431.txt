(Practical) Applications or RNN

I have been googling for a list of practical applications of Recurrent Neural Networks for some time, but did not find a reasonable reference list. Most of the things are about text generation which seems to be rather for fun/academic research. I do not have anything against text generation. I am looking for a list of practical applications, with some direct commercial impact. I know that I can simply open scholar.google.com and search for individual contributions. Is there any list of 10-20 most remarkable applications? Can you help me with that list? Many thanks for any help.
