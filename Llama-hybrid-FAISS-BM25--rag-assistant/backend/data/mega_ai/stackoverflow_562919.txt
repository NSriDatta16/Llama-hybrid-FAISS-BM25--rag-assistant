Drag and drop image into a web form

We have a web page (HTML javascript and PHP mostly) that allows a user to upload an image. We have the normal browse button, and it works fine. However, we want to add the functionality to drag and drop an image into the text field instead. gmail allows you to do this in their mail app, so it's possible. The only way we've thought of to do it is to create a java applet that does all of this, but that ends up being very messy. Has onyone done this? how does it work? Edit: I'm using firefox on a Mac. Most of my users will be probably be using IE on Windows. thanks
