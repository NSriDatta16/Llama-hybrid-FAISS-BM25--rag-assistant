The great NodeBox Linguistics project and its follower pattern seems unsupported now, but if you could make them run - you can try the following, based on the RDF-Triple of: subject predicate object . It won't cover every permutation, and won't be 100% grammatically correct - but it's a good start. from pattern import en for subject in subjects: for object in objects: for v in verbs: predicate = en.verb.past(v) print(f'The {subject} {predicate} the {object}') The subjects and objects lists can be imported from any nlp nouns list. Same for the verbs list. You can go on and add present and future tenses, each with an appropriate "sentence template".
