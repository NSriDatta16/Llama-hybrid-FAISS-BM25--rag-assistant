Parameterized testing tools with automatic code exploration

I've checked and played a bit with Microsoft Pex . It's a very handy tool/library even though it's not as straight forward to write parametrized unit tests with it. But when used correctly it can provide much better test code coverage than writing manual unit tests. Not to mention time spent writing those tests either. And it integrates nicely with Visual Studio as well. I was wondering whether there are any other tools out there that let you write parametrised unit tests and run them so internal algorithm intelligently chooses values to provide full code test coverage? If some other tool/library was as easy to use as NUnit+Moq I'd be even more pleased. Pex has quite a steep learning curve (so does Moles I suppose). Are there any plans for NUnit to support parametrised tests with inteligent parameter choosing in the future maybe? Anybody has any inside info about it?
