What is the rationale for using scoring methods after logistic regression?

I generally come across scoring in logistic modeling (also other methods like discriminant analysis, etc.). I want to know what is the use of scoring of individuals after running a logistic regression (or any other method). Can anybody suggest me some literature on the use of scoring?
