One word: Organization. Separating each part of the page will allow each of them to be viewed/edited separately. This simple concept is very beneficial. For example, anyone in the team that want to handle login process can easily figure out that they have to edit login_form.phtml and they can be sure that editing login_form.phtml will less likely to unintentionally interfere with other functionalities. As of the best practice, here is how I do it (not exactly but similar). $Title = 'Blah Blah Blah'; $User = 'Jon Miller'; $ThemeName = "MyGreenPage"; $Contents = array("User", "Login_Form"); function Include($FileName) { if (file_exists($FileName)) include $FileName; } MyGreenPage.phtml : User.pcss : /* Some styles needed by User */ User.pjs : /* Some script needed by User */ User.phtml : Login_Form.pcss : /* Some styles needed by Login_Form */ Login_Form.pjs : /* Some script needed by Login_Form */ Login_Form.phtml : login form Let me remind you again that this is not that exactly what I do (what I do use OOP) so this may not exactly run as is and you may need to edit it.
