Probability of just two hashes accidentally colliding is 1/2 128 which is 1 in 340 undecillion 282 decillion 366 nonillion 920 octillion 938 septillion 463 sextillion 463 quintillion 374 quadrillion 607 trillion 431 billion 768 million 211 thousand 456. However if you keep all the hashes then the probability is a bit higher thanks to birthday paradox . To have a 50% chance of any hash colliding with any other hash you need 2 64 hashes. This means that to get a collision, on average, you'll need to hash 6 billion files per second for 100 years .
