The best way to work with hybrid CNN-SVM

I am working on a hybrid CNN-SVM where I aim to use CNN for feature extraction and SVM for classification. However, I am confused as after reading related works, I found many approaches: -Some use SVM instead of the softmax layer. -Some use SVM after flatten layer. -Others replace the activation function from softmax to linear and the loss function from cross entropy to L1-SVM. So I wanted to know which method is the correct one among these approaches.
