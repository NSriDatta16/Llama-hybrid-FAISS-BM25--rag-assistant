how to classify highly overlapping data after PCA and t-SNE?

I'm working on a classification (3 classes) of unbalanced weather data having 22 features. Even after applying PCA and t-SNE the data is overlapping. The best classification score achieved so far is using the tree-based method. What can be the reason for such PCA plot and what techniques I can implement to get more than 80% accuracy?
