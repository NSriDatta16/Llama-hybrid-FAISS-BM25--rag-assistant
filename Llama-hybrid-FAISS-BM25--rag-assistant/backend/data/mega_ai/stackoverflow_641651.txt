Actually the space is not part of the ContextMenu it is part of MenuItem. So just drag a MenuItem to your window in expression blend and create a copy of the control. Hope your ContextMenu declaration is as follows And inside your MenuItem ControlTemplate you can see the space as bellow. So remove the Icon and First Column of the grid I marked in the screen shot.
