How to turn on line number tooltip while scrolling infragistics ultrawebgrid

I once saw this feature in action but I don't know how to turn it on. The grid can show a tooltip with the current row number (or row ID) while dragging the scrollbar. This helps you to stop the scroll in the right place. I'm assuming some property will turn this on, but I can't find it. Maybe it is also dependent on the scroll mode? UPDATE: In the image below you can see an example of the tooltip I'm looking for. This is displayed while the scrollbar is being dragged (up or down). The number in the tooltip is the row number (you can't see it in this image, way to the left in the grid). This is the same grid that I am using now. Just from a very old build of our product. Somehow this tooltip was turned off. And no one knows how to turn it back on :( I'm pretty sure this is a built in feature of the ultrawebgrid. Not something that required extra coding. alt text http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6337/croppercapture.jpg
