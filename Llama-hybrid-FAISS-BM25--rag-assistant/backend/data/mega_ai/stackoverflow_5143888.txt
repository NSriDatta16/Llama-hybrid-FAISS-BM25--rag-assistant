A bitmap is a general data structure that maps complex data to a large set of bits. Each elementary information is mapped to specific bits. Bitmaps are mostly used to encode graphic data and images. Each image pixel is mapped to a bit (black & white image) or a group of bits (grey scale or color image). Usage guidelines: For platform specific bitmap API, prefer android-bitmap , [tag: nsbitmapimagerep], and rendertargetbitmap For bit storage structures regardless of encoding, use bitset , std-bitset , bitarray and other bit or bool containers. For data-structures encoding some specific information as a group of bits use bit-fields External references: Bitmap on Wikipedia Bitmap indexes on Wikipedia
