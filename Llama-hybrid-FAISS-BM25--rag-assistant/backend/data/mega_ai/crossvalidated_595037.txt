As a Bayesian, I am puzzled why the frequentist way of thinking is still the default. With Bayesian posterior inference you don't need special cases or different study designs to answer questions about superiority vs. questions about similarity/"equivalence". You just compute more posterior probabilities, and you capitalize on directionality. A single study can provide evidence for superiority, similarity, and harm, and can also address multiple response variables. Examples: P(effect > 0), P(effect > 5%), P(effect 2% and effect on response 2 > 3%). In general computing a probability that the effect is in an investigator-specified interval is more useful than finding an uncertainty interval attached to a given investigator-specified coverage probability.
