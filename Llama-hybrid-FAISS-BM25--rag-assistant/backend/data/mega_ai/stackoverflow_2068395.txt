Ok. So the problem was not TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL after all. Funny how a simple test helped figure that out. I had 2 theories that were about the LOD being picked differently, and both of those seem to be disproved by the solid color test. Onto a third theory then. If I understand correctly your scene, you have a model that's using a texture atlas, and what we're observing is that some polygons that should fetch from a specific item of the atlas actually fetch from a different one. Is that right ? This can be explained by the fact that a multisampled fragment usually get sampled at the middle of the pixel. Even when that center is not inside the triangle that generated the sample. See the bottom of this page for an illustration. The usual way to get around that is called centroid sampling (this page has nice illustrations of the issue too). It forces the sampling to bring back the sampling point inside the triangle. Now the bad news: I'm not aware of any way to turn on centroid filtering outside of the programmable pipeline, and you're not using it. Do you think you want to switch to get access to that feature ? Edit to add: Also, not using texture atlases would be a way to work around this. The reason it is so visible is because you start fetching from another part of the atlas with the "out-of-triangle" sampling pattern.
