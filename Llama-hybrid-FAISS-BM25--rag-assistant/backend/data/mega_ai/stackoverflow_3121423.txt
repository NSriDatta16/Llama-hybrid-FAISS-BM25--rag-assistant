How to edit the product images in zen cart?

I hate how it just shows each image and have to click each image to show the enlarged display. Anyway I can re-organize them and/or use a jquery gallery type plugin to go through the different product images? Something like the effect here would be perfect for the product images http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/fancy-thumbnail-hover-effect-w-jquery/
