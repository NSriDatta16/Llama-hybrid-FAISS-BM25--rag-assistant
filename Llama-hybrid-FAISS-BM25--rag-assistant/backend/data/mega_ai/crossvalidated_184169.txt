Q-Learning vs Fitted Q-Iteration

I am reading about Q-Learning in the context of Reinforcement learning - I understand that q-learning is a form on online learning where we are given a sequence of tuples as input. I am following udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-reinforcement-learning--ud820 and this survey paper: https://www.jair.org/media/301/live-301-1562-jair.pdf I also understand Value Iteration (VI) and Fitted Value Iteration(FVI). My question is does Fitted Q-iteration simply mean Q-Learning with some kind of state space approximation? Just like FVI is VI with a linear approximation for the state space?
