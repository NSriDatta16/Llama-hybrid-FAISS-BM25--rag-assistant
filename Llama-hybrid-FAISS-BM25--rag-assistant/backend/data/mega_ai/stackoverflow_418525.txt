It's definitely not a bad sign to trend to brute force, especially as a beginner because you may not know any better. Especially with Project Euler, it is a bad sign to implement a brute force method and not review the comments to learn a more efficient method. I often end up in the same boat you're in and that's actually why I started doing P.E. problems -- I was implementing a lot of brute force approaches and wanted to expose myself to more elegant solutions...
