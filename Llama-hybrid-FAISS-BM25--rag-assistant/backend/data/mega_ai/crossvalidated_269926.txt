What are possible reconstruction cost functions for Variational Auto-encoders?

In almost most papers and tutorials about VAEs, the reconstruction loss term is shown in this, Bernouli ditribution cross entropy form: $$ C=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{x} (y\ln(x) + (1-y)\ln(1-x)) $$ However, it is usually said that other cost functions are also possible. What are they, and what requirements they should meet, because the math behind VAEs is derived from approximating probabilities? Can, for example, one use usual square error: $||x-y||^2$, or mean-square-error one? How will the different magnitude of values induced by this (different) error term interfere with the training process? Thank you! Context notes I'm trying to make it work for continuous, non-normalized values in the range outside $[0, 1]$, including negative values.
