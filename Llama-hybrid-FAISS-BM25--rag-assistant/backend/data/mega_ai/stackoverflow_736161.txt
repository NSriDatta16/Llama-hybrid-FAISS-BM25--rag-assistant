This is a bug in FF (and apparently Safari 3.5/Win and Opera 9.5/Win): iframes reload if moved in the DOM tree. (jQuery sortable moves the node in the DOM tree when you drop it). See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254144 . The way I've gotten around this before is to designate some area attached to the iframes parent the "handle" for jQuery sortable to operate on. For example: +-----------------------+ | Drag Me | iframe here | +---------+ | | | +-------------+ You drag the "handle", and not the actual iframe container. On Drop, you re-arrange the handles, leaving the iframe where it is in the DOM. This worked well in my case but YMMV.
