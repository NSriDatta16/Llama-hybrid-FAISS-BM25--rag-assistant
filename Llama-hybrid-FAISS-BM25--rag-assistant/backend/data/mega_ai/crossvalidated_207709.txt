All these methods are discriminative. They do exactly the same computation at prediction time. The difference is at training time: optimization objective is different. For the same training data these models can assign different values to model parameters after training. Max-margin methods are generalization of SVMs to structured prediction; CRF is a generalization of Logistic Regression for structured prediction. In practice they should give similar results.
