Embedding a long UIWebView within a table view cell with various heights

I want to be able to embed a UIWebView into a tableview's cell (grouped style). The web view is long (longer than the screen), and I want it to display it's full length. So there is no scrolling within the web view itself, just on the table. ------------------------ | a normal table cell | ------------------------ | a normal table cell 2| ------------------------ | a long webview | | which doesn't scroll| | within itself | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ------------------------ The web view will have various heights so how can I discover the the height of the webview in order to adjust the height in heightForRowAtIndexPath?
