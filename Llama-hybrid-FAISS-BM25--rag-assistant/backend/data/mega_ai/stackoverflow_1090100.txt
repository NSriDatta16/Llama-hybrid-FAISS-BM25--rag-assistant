Do NOT consider performance. Consider meaning. ID "numbers" are not numeric except that they are written with an alphabet of all digits. If I have part number 12 and part number 14, what is the difference between the two? Is part number 2 or -2 meaningful? No. Part numbers (and anything that doesn't have units of measure) are not "numeric". They're just strings of digits. Zip codes in the US, for example. Phone numbers. Social security numbers. These are not numbers. In my town the difference between zip code 12345 and 12309 isn't the distance from my house to downtown. Do not conflate numbers -- with units -- where sums and differences mean something with strings of digits without sums or differences. Part ID numbers are -- properly -- strings. Not integers. They'll never be integers because they don't have sums, differences or averages.
