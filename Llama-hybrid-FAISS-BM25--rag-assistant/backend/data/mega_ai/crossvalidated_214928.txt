Prediction using fixed effects in glmm

I have the following generalized linear mixed effects model (mcmcglmm in R) with data based on this paper . Sex is a two level factor (M or F), Group a two level factor (LL, LO), Mort a continuous explanatory variable and Life a continuous response. What I would like to know is how to estimate the predicted Life from the model for the linear relationship with Mort for the four combinations of sex and group; mod2 = MCMCglmm(Life ~ Mort*Sex*Group, random = ~ Pop:Year, rcov = ~units, family = "gaussian", start = list(QUASI = FALSE), data = DF1) summary(mod2) ... post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp pMCMC b1 - (Intercept) 59.49914 58.09025 60.95132 1000.0 I'm struggling to find good literature that explains how to estimate the linear relationship when there are multiple categorical interactions occurring. What would the respective calculations be? Here are my attempts: $ Life_{F,LL} = b_1 + b_2 \times x$ $ Life_{M,LL} = (b_1 + b_3) + (b_2 + b_5) \times x$ $ Life_{F,LO} = (b_1 + b_4) + (b_2 + b_6) \times x$ $ Life_{M,LO} = (b_1 + b_3 + b_4) + (b_2 + b_5 + b_6 + b_7 + b_8) \times x$ What are the correct formula to get the predicted response for each group? Update ; after more thought I think $Life_{M,LO}$ might be this, where all of the terms without mort form the intercept and all those with mort form the slope: $ Life_{M,LO} = (b_1 + b_3 + b_4 + b_7) + (b_2 + b_5 + b_6 + b_8) \times x$
