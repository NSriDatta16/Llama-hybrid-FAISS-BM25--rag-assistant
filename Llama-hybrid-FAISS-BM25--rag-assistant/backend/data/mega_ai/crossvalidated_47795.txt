Logistic regression in R with large amounts of data

I am currently carrying out an investigation to find if certain factors such as playing home or away or position of a footballer affects overall pass completion using logistic regression. I am using R to compute my data. In my current section in which I am trying to analyse uses the data of every player to convey a general conclusion to whether or not the position of a player affects the successfulness of pass completion. so far I have computed: test.logit and my output was: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.28482 0.01256 22.67 the intercept is goalkeepers,position.Id 2 is for a defender, 4 = midfielder and 6 = striker Is this a good set of results to come to a conclusion? and with the large deviances?
