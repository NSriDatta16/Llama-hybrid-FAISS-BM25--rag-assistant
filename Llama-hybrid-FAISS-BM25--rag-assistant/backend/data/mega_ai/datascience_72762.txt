model.fit indefinite execution in Google Colab

I am working on image classification model. My model is build using CNN, tensorflow and Keras libraries. I am trying to execute my CNN multi-classification model in google Colab, and I am loading the data (image data) from my google drive (mount drive command). Everything is going perfectly fine, up to model.fit, at this point the model execution is indefinite (never-ending) in Google Colab. However the same model is working perfectly in Jupiter Notebook. So, can anybody tell me what is happening?
