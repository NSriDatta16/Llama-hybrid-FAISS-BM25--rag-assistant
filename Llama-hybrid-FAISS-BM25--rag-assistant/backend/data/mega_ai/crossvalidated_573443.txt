It is a mistake to go into your problem thinking that fewer parameters is better. Remember the bias-variance decomposition. You are reducing the parameter count to lower the variance, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily come with a small increase to the bias. It is totally possible that, by omitting relevant features, you bias the model too much to result in a decrease in MSE. This answer of mine does not address PCA, but it does address the idea of decreasing the number of parameters in an attempt to improve performance and why that need not help.
