Generation of orthogonal matrices "close" to identity

Suppose I want to generate a $n \times n$ orthogonal matrix $H$ (that is, $H^T H=I$) but with the property that $1-e Two approaches I had in mind: 1) use of Givens rotations/Euler angles close to 0 2) (edited) using skew-symmetric matrices $L$ close to 0 and evaluating $\exp L$ NOTE: Possible applications include Bayesian estimation of covariance matrices.
