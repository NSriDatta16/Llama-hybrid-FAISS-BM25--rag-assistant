It seems you have difficulty on understanding and manipulating 15 fixed effects in your model. Then you can fit an equivalent model which is clearer and more understandable than your original model. Let $X_{ij} = 1$ if type = $i$ and language = $j$ -th language in your list, =0 otherwise, for $i = 1, 2, 3$ and $j=1,...,5$ . Then fit a model: $$\text {logit}(P(Y=1)) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^5 \beta_{ij}X_{ij} + \text{ random part}$$ This model is equivalent to your original model, but each fixed effect $\beta_{ij}$ has clear meaning. Then you can contract linear combinations of $\beta_{ij}$ based on what you want and test/estimate them. In this model, $\beta_{ij} = \text{log(odds)}$ for type $i$ and language $j$ . Estimate the difference of mean log odds between EN and overall average: $$(\beta_{14} + \beta_{24} + \beta_{34})/3 - \text {(sum of 15} \beta_{ij})/15$$
