Simple answer: If your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Linq2SQL is an O/R mapper. it i not made to handle hugh amounts of binary data in an object. There is no way to do what you want the way you want it. Drop Linq2SQL for this specific part and use the SQL special syntax for partial read / writes (you can basically write only part of the blob / read part of the blob every SQK command you do). The same is true, btw., for pretty much every other ORM out there - BLOB storage is not something you have in mind when you create an ORM (been there, done that).
