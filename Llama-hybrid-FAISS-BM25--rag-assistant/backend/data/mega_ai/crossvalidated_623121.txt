The parameters of the simulation are not well calibrated. The CLT is an asymptotic result so, for a finite sample of any size, the actual sampling distribution of the mean is close to but not exactly normal. So, you can choose enough experimental replications to make a normality test arbitrarily powerful - that is to say, I'd reject the hypothesis that the distribution of the sample mean is normal with a given probability encroaching 1. Even if the sample size is 10,000 and the "CLT kicks in" as one answer states, I can change the number of experimental replications to 1,000,000 or more to get that test to reject normality almost every time. The AD test is not giving you false positives here, the data are not normal. You can understand this simulation a little bit better if you caveat the results by saying the $p$ value from the AD test is used as a pragmatic measure of similarity to the normal distribution.
