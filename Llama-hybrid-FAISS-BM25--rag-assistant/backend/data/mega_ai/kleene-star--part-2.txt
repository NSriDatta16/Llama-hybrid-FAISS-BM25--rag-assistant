, "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc", "aaa", "aab", ...}. {'a', 'b', 'c'}+ = { "a", "b", "c", "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc", "aaa", "aab", ...}. Properties If V {\displaystyle V} is any finite or countably infinite set of characters, then V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} is a countably infinite set. As a result, each formal language over a finite or countably infinite alphabet Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is countable, since it is a subset of the countably infinite set Σ ∗ {\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}} . ( L ∗ ) ∗ = L ∗ {\displaystyle (L^{*})^{*}=L^{*}} , which means that the Kleene star operator is an idempotent unary operator, as ( L ∗ ) i = L ∗ {\displaystyle (L^{*})^{i}=L^{*}} for every i ≥ 1 {\displaystyle i\geq 1} . V ∗ = { ε } {\displaystyle V^{*}=\{\varepsilon \}} , if V {\displaystyle V} is the empty set ∅. For the version of the Kleene star operator on languages, L ∗ = { ε } {\displaystyle L^{*}=\{\varepsilon \}} when L {\displaystyle L} is either the empty set ∅ or the singleton set { ε } {\displaystyle \{\varepsilon \}} . Generalization Strings form a monoid with concatenation as the binary operation and ε the identity element. In addition to strings, the Kleene star is defined for any monoid. More precisely, let (M, ⋅) be a monoid, and S ⊆ M. Then S* is the smallest submonoid of M containing S; that is, S* contains the neutral element of M, the set S, and is such that if x,y ∈ S*, then x⋅y ∈ S*. Furthermore, the Kleene star is generalized by including the *-operation (and the union) in the algebraic structure itself by the notion of complete star semiring.
