C++ 0x will contain Strongly typed enumerations where you can specify the underlying datatype (in your example char), but current C++ does not support this. The standard is not clear about the use of a char here (the examples are with int, short and long), but they mention the underlying integral type and that would include char as well. As of today Neil Butterworth's answer to create a class for your problem seems the most elegant, as you can even extend it to contain a nested enumeration if you want symbolical names for the values.
