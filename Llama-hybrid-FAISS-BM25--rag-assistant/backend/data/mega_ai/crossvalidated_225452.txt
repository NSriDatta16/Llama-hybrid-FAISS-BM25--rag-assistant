When someone says that "Hillary has a 75% chance of winning", they mean that if you offered them a bet where one person gets 25 dollars if Hillary wins and the other person gets 75 dollars if Hillary does not win, they would consider that a fair bet and have no particular reason to prefer either side. These percentages typically come from prediction markets. These summarize all the information available and typically outperform analytical methods of predicting most events. Prediction markets offer people the opportunity to wager on whether or not a particular event will occur. The payoffs are set by negotiation between the people on both sides of the proposition. Generally, people who have special knowledge about a proposition will be try to leverage that knowledge to make money, which has the side effect of leaking that information. For example, suppose there's a prediction market on whether a particular celebrity will live until the end of this year. The public knows the celebrity's age and anyone can look up the basic probability that the celebrity will die by the end of the year. If that was all that was known, you would expect people to be willing to bet on one side or the other of this proposition at roughly that probability. Now, suppose someone knew that celebrity was in poor health but was concealing it. Or even say lots of people knew that that celebrity's family had a history of heart disease that would reduce their odds of surviving. The people with that information will be willing to take one side of that proposition, causing the rate to adjust just as buyers push a stock price up and sellers push it down. In other words, when the odds are too low, people looking to profit push them up. And when they are too high, people looking to profit push them down. The price of the bet ultimately reflects the collective wisdom of everyone on the odds of the proposition occurring just as all prices reflect collective wisdom on the costs and values of things.
