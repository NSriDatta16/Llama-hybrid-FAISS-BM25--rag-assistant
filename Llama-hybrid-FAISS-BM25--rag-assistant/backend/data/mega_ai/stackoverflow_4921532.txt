Drupal modules VS size of apache processes

i have a question regarding the impact of the amount of enabled Drupal modules on the size of the apache processes. We are running a big drupal site with around 200 custom modules. i see the average size of the apache process is 48MB, now i was wondering, if reducing the amount of modules would reduce that process' size. And by reducing the amount of modules i mean i would merge some of them together, so the amount of functions and callbacks, etc. would be the same, just less modules as instead of splitting them in different modules (i did that to make code maintenance easier) i would have many modules merged into just a few. would that help? i would like to know what you have to say about this before refactoring my code.. ;)
