I would make a choropleth map of your model's residuals at the zip code level. The result is called a spatial residual map and it may help you choose a new explanatory variable to include in your model. This approach is called exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) . One potential workflow: for each zip code get the average residual make a choropleth map to see the geographic distribution of the residuals look for patterns that might be explained by a new explanatory variable. For example, if you see all suburban or southern or beach zipcodes with high residuals then you can add a regional dummy variable defined by the relevant zipcode grouping, or if you see high residuals for high income zipcodes then you can add an income variable.
