How can somebody apply PCA on a set of graphs? It is perfectly legal to apply PCA on a set of graphs. After all, one graph is just a point in a space, and given a distance measure (kernel) in that space you can apply PCA as usual. Is it possible to define a meaningful graph kernel for my problem, and then follow the typical procedure on the derived matrix of pairwise distances? That's absolutely fine -- once you have a matrix of pairwise distances you're back to good old PCA. If you're looking for some interesting kernels I would recommend you to search online for "graph distance measures" or "graph similarity measures," and you will find a lot of them. One particularly easy example is the Hamming distance, which is basically the number of edge additions or deletions needed to transform one graph into another.
