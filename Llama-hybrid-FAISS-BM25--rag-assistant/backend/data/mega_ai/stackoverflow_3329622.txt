If I understood you correctly The images are uploaded to Amazon S3 storage via your server application. So the Amazon S3 write permission has only your application. Clients can upload images only throw your application (which will store them on S3). Hacker can only force your application to upload image with same name and rewrite the original one. How do you handle the situation when user upload a image with a name that already exists in your S3 storage? Consider following actions: First user upload a image some-name.jpg Your app stores that image in S3 under name upload-some-name.jpg Second user upload a image some-name.jpg Will your application overwrite the original one stored in S3?
