Databases from scratch

How do I create a database management system from scratch? Are there any books, sites and tutorials with great quality? With great quality I mean that it should be simple to use and straight forward in explaining the concepts. Here are examples of caliber quality resources that I'm looking for: If I were to create an operating system from scratch, I would consider studying MINIX 3. If I were to create a compiler from scratch, the famous dragon book Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools is a good one. It would be great if there are working sample of source code available in C or any programming language close to C that would to justice to the task.
