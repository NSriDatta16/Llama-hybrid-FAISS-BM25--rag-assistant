Validation of survival analysis model

I am currently looking for evaluating/validating a survival analysis model on quite highly right censored data set. The thing is that i have many individuals in the data set. I wanted to use c-index as a KPI and the problem is that it is kind of N^2 while even for a 10-fold cross validation, I still have 10 000 positive events in my test set (and much more censored individuals). This make it quite impossible to use c-index directly. I wanted to know if it could be statistically relevant to perform stratified sampling on the test set to have an estimation of the c-index at each cross validation step ? I guess this would be dependent on the sampling factor. Is it something that make sense (I haven't found any publication on this subject) or should I just forget c-index ? I thank you in advance for your help. Update: I want to model churn prediction per customer for a Telecom company that is yet not data driven. For now i am not sure if I want to use time varying covariates so i only work with 'intrinsic' covariates. I focus on phone contract that ends before term (because client want to resume it). Like gender, region (economic feature engineering), type of contract (One-Hot Encoding). Currently I try to use simple models such as Cox Proportional Hazard, even if the proportional assumption is not verified, I just try to avoid over-fitting. I don't do parameter tuning yet. I use Cross-validation in order to ensure my model is robust enough. My dataset is quite huge (300 000 contracts) that cover 5 months. The contracts have different terms. So I made a kind of standardization by creating a lifetime of contract from 0.0 to 1.0 and add the duration of the contract as a feature. My management wants me to have kind of accuracy of the model which is quite weird because the censoring ratio is very high (95%). So i don't know yet how i will answer this question. But first I need to unsure the model is stable. Question Sum up : The goal is to predict early termination of contracts per contract for a Telecom company ( Probability that they will end early , and also the Survival function ). I currently use Cox Proportional Hazard function. I want to validate this model (it's the first one), assessing whether or not it is stable during Cross validation. I want to use c-index because of high ration (>0.95) of censoring. But C-index is N^2 complexity . I wanted to know if it make sense (statistically speaking) to perform sampling over the test set several time in order to be able to compute an estimation of c-index .
