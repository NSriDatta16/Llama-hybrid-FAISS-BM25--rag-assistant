If your response (number of re-admissions) ranges for example from 0 to 4 or so, you could use ordinal logistic regression. However, the maximum number of re-admissions in your model shouldn't be too high (maybe 3 or 4). Otherwise you could for example combine all cases with 4 or more re-admissions to a new category like 4+ or similar. However, I find the interpretation of the coefficients (at least using polr function from MASS -package in R) a bit tedious.
