GNU Unifont is the only one that covers all (or almost all, 63,000+) characters. Unfortunately it is bitmap and thus the rendering is pretty ugly. WenQuanYi Zen Hei or Arial Unicode MS are best if you need a TrueType font. They have roughly the same coverage (~35,000 chars), but WenQuanYi Zen Hei is open source (GPL) and Arial Unicode MS is proprietary.
