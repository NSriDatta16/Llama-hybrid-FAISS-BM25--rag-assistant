In this regression, then are only two observations and two fitted values, which are $\hat p_m=17/91$ for males and $\hat p_f=32/109$ for females. Converting to the logit linear predictor scale gives: $$\mbox{logit}(\hat p_m)= \hat\beta_0=\log\frac{ 17}{91-17} = \log\frac{17}{74}=-1.471$$ and $$\mbox{logit}(\hat p_f)=\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_1=\log\frac{32}{109-32} = \log\frac{32}{77}=-0.878$$ Hence $$\hat\beta_1= -0.878 + 1.471 = 0.593$$ Note that this type of closed-form calculation only works for logistic regressions with a single categorical factor, or for models that are equivalent to regressions with a single categorical factor, such as factorial models with all possible interactions. Logistic regressions with additive non-interacting terms do not admit closed-form estimators.
