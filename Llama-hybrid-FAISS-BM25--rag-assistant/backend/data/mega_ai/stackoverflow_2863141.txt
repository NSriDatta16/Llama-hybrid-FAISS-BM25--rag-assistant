There is no per-application limit for the cache directory. While Linux has a quota subsystem built-in , it is not used by Android. Applications share the cache filesystem without any real constraints. As it fills up, the Device Storage Monitor sends out an ACTION_DEVICE_STORAGE_LOW broadcast and calls a method of the Package Manager Service that sends a "freecache" command to the Install Daemon. The installd process then walks through the cache directory deleting files without regard to the owning application or modification date until the amount of free space available is above some threshold.
