Sorry, not a direct answer to your question, but if what you want is to pause the JVM at startup for debugging, you could use the suspend=n option in the JVM options, as in something like: -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xnoagent -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=2502,server=y,suspend=n That way, the JVM suspends automatically, waiting for a connection from the debugger.
