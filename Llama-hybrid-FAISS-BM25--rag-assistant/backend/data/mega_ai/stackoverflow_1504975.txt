How can I use grep to see if my word in a array has a match with list of word in dictionary and extract the exact single word?

Thanks for the answers... i am trying the different possibilities with all your answers. one thing: i could not be that much clearer in asking question to you all, ie. i m applying this RE in my local script/character(similar to Tibetan Script) and not in English word. foreach my $word (@list) { if(grep(/$word/, $dict)) # i have dict in scalar ($dict) { print "Matched and Found\n"; } else { print "Not Matched\n"; } } Focus is to extract on single matched, exact word. i tried using /\b$word\b/... that doesnot seem to work in our script... where our word is made up of multisyllable and each syllable is separated by (.)(Tibetan Tsheg). Additional information: For the beginner the most challenging feature of the Tibetan sentence is the lack of separation between words. ... Since there is no space after a word, the reader must figure out each word based on context and location in the sentence. Looking up these two letters in a dictionary might lead you to think that this sentence is starting with a reference to the surface of earth. However, the rest of the sentence, its context, and the lack of an agentive case connector, indicates that these two letters are not words by themselves, but rather the word "yesterday". From this you can see it's good to first evaluate a sentence as a whole, by identifying it's various elements, rather than translate it word by word. Emphasis added.
