Code Coverage and Silverlight 4

Is there any way to get Code Coverage metrics for Silverlight 4? I have been trying to get this up and running for some time. For a while there was code coverage in the Silverlight Unit Test Framework, but to my understanding it is now broken. Any ideas on how I can pull off some code coverage metrics in my application?
