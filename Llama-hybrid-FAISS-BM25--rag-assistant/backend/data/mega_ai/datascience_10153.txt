Generating a set of Rules that defines a Group of users ( Multivariate Analysis )

I am working on a Multivariate Analysis on my dataset, I have a large dataset of 50k users let's call it (Loyal Users) with various numerical attributes +13 tracking the user's activity and events within a timeframe. I want to come up with Set of rules to define this group of users so that i can come up with a common pattern. This is an example of the data that i am working on username Like Share Select Send Verify Register Alex 524 329 203 787 1 1 Kristina 197 186 286 120 0 1 Here is an example of rules that i want to make : If Share > 23 and Verify =1 and Like >120 then Loyal User would that be possible after doing a principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) ? And how can i do that ? Any ideas would be great.
