An ORM can be quite useful, if used properly and you understand what it's doing for you. You should definitely use one, if you already have some understanding of database design and querying. The point of the article, primarily, is that the concept of not having to learn anything about database design and querying somehow makes your life better is a fallacy. I prefer very thin layers of abstraction between code and database - I feel that lets me focus more on good user experience. I personally feel the press behind EF is encouraging new coders to ignore some necessary basics. I've worked with some of them, and think they were done a disservice. Of course, there are those that will very strongly disagree. No problem! I know developers who started off loving it, and now don't. But I also know developers that love EF and swear by it. I've used EF, LINQ to SQL and NHibernate and others over the years. Best advice: give it a try. Come to your own conclusion. (Disclosure: I'm the writer of the article you cited).
