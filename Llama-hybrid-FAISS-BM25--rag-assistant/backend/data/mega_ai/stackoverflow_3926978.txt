phone7, silverlight, move copy or rename files?

Is there any way in Phone7 to rename a file? I don't see anything in IsolatedStorageFile that exposes this functionality but perhaps I'm missing something? It seems like the best way to rename a file is to read its contents and write them to another file and then delete the original.
