"Stacks" and "heaps" are implementation details and depend on the platform (all the world is not x86). From the language POV, what matters is storage class and extent. String literals have static extent; storage for them is allocated at program startup and held until the program terminates. It is also assumed that string literals cannot be modified (attempting to do so invokes undefined behavior). Contrast this with local, block-scope (auto) variables, whose storage is allocated on block entry and released on block exit. Typically, this means that string literals are not stored in the same memory as block-scope variables.
