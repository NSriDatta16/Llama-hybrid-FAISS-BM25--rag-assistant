You might get what you want if you try setting placeholder in the .sortable() call, i.e: $("#list").sortable({ placeholder : 'placeholderClass' } Then make sure you have a class .placeholderClass defined, and you can choose what styles to apply when a block is being dragged - Not sure of this is what you want - just a suggestion. Check out these pages if you need more info.
