If you import somemodule the contained globals will be available via somemodule.someglobal . If you from somemodule import * ALL its globals (or those listed in __all__ if it exists) will be made globals, i.e. you can access them using someglobal without the module name in front of it. Using from module import * is discouraged as it clutters the global scope and if you import stuff from multiple modules you are likely to get conflicts and overwrite existing classes/functions.
