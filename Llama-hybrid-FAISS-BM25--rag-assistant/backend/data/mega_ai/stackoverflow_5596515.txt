First, I'd like to ask you to check most of the other answers. They are more complete, in that they treat more global issues of tracking the changes of a variable. Now, I'm assuming, from reading the snippet of code you provided, that you need to track if a string was changed by the user. So, in other words, you probably have a TextBox or other kind of control through which the user can change that value. This is where you should focus your attention: just consume the TextChanged event. If, however, I'm mistaken and your string comes from any other kind of external source, either use the wrapper class suggested by @Ryan Bennett or, if you are using .Net 4, use a dynamic container, which raises a PropertyChanged event whenever any property is changed.
