Figures and Segements are a high level programmatic way to define a path. They do not represent the internal storage used by the path itself since in general they are not memory efficient. The Mini path language that is used to define the vast majority of paths is a form of serialisation for the actual internal representation of a path. When such paths are created the programmatic sets of Figures are not generated. It would have been a nice addition to the API to have a method that could reverse engineer a mini language path back to a set of figures but as usual, nice to haves need to weighed against cost. Your options are:- use Xaml that includes Figures and Segment instances rather then the mini path language use XmlReader or XDocument to load the Xaml containing paths, find the path of interest, parse the mini language yourself.
