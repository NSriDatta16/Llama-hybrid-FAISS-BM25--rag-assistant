You should show us some code, because mysql_real_escape_string will not remove an apostrophe, but only escape them. Escaping means O'Hare will become O\'Hare so that it can be inserted as a string: 'O\'Hare' . Upon retrieval from the database, your value should still be the original O'Hare . So, if the apostrophe is 'lost' there likely is an error somewhere else in your program logic. The other option is to switch from using the MySQL library to the MySQLi or PDO library for accessing your database. The latter two support prepared statements. Prepared statements are generally thought as being the best practice for querying your database.
