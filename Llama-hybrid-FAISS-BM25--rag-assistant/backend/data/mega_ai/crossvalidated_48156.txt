"Average variation points" isn't really a statistical term. For "how many points, on average, a person gains or loses per day" I can think of two answers, depending on what you mean: $\frac{50 + 40 + 0 + 20}{4} = \frac{90}{4} = 22.5$ which treats "gains" and "losses" as absolute values and $\frac{50 - 40 + 0 + 20}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 9.75$ which treats them as positive and negative values.
