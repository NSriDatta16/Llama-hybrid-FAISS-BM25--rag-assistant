3 way ANOVA / Duncan test

I am runnig 3 way ANOVA between: specie * organ * treatment in Sucrose acumulation. There is interaction between organ*treatment, but no interaction between specie and organ or treatment. Should I discard specie factor and continue in a 2 way ANOVA (using organ and treament as factors)? I doing a Duncan test before ANOVA to know in which groups sucrose acumulation means are similar. Should I use alfa-bonferroni correction (alfa/number of samples, in my case 0,05/12) before running Duncan test or should I just use alfa= 0,05? Many thanks Andres
