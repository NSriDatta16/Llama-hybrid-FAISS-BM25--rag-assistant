How to perform (modified) t-test for multiple variables and multiple models on Python (Machine Learning)

I have created and analyzed around 16 machine learning models using WEKA. Right now, I have a CSV file which shows the models' metrics (such as percent_correct, F-measure, recall, precision, etc.). I am trying to conduct a (modified) student's t-test on these models. I am able to conduct one (according to THIS link) where I compare only ONE variable common to only TWO models. I want to perform a (or multiple) t-tests with MULTIPLE variables and MULTIPLE models at once. As mentioned, I can only perform the test with one variable (let's say F-measure) among two models (let's say decision table and neural net). Here's the code for that. I am performing a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (modified t): from matplotlib import pyplot from pandas import read_csv, DataFrame from scipy.stats import ks_2samp results = DataFrame() results['A'] = read_csv('LMT (f-measure).csv', header=None).values[:, 0] results['B'] = read_csv('LWL (f-measure).csv', header=None).values[:, 0] print(results.describe()) results.boxplot() pyplot.show() results.hist() pyplot.show() value, pvalue = ks_2samp(results['A'], results['B']) alpha = 0.05 print(value, pvalue) if pvalue > alpha: print('Samples are likely drawn from the same distributions (fail to reject H0)') else: print('Samples are likely drawn from different distributions (reject H0)') Any ideas?
