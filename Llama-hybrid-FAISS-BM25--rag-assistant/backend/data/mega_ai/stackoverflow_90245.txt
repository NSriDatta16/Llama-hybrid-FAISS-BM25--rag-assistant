Typically the POJOs are tested in some context. If you want to perform some logic THAT has to be tested properly (ideally before starting that logic implementation). As for the getters and setters; to test them is usually not necessary as the coverage is obtained by testing the logic:-) Try to check some coverage reporting tools like Cobertura ,Clover or try Emma and see what needs to be tested. I really like Clover reports showing the most dangerous threats in the code.
