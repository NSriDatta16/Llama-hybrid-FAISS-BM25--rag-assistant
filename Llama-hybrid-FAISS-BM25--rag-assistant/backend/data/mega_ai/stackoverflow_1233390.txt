Be careful of functions that return null objects. This got me once and isn't very clear within the debugger. Check this out: public class FooBar { public int ReturnInt() { return 0; } } public FooBar ReturnNullObject() { return null; } // Execution code: int exceptionalInt = ReturnNullObject().ReturnInt(); Edit: according to your edit, make sure IPAddressInstance isn't returning null. Edit: you might want to break the single line into a couple of lines. This should help. var ip = myOtherClassInstance.IPAddressInstance; var ipString = ip.ToString(); myClassInstance.myMethod(ipString);
