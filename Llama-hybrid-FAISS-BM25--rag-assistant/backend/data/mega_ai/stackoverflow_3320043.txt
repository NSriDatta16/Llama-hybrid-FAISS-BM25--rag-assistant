Elegant handling of a Collection Change that requires changes on the dispatcher thread

Here's my situation: I've got a User interface ItemsControl "ResultsPresenter" (WPF) pulling from a ListCollectionView that uses a BindingList "Results" from a non-UserInterface class as the ListCollectionView.Source property. Whenever I make a change to "Results" such as an add operation, I get a NotSupportedException, insisting that {"This type of CollectionView does not support changes to its SourceCollection from a thread different from the Dispatcher thread."} It looks as if this error is coming from the "Results" collection, but the error information seems distinctly WPF generated. I'd like to know why I am throwing this error, and how to resolve it WITHOUT exposing the class that contains "Results" to WPF related code. NOTE: This solution came about after it was causing this error while looking directly at the "Results" property for binding, the ListCollectionView was only introduced to try and remedy this situation and is more than likely not part of the problem.
