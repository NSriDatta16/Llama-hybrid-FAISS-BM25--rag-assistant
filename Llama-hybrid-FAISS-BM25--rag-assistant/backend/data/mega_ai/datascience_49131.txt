There are many potential issues that could cause this. What I would do is actually look at the training set you have created (write it to a csv perhaps) and make sure that everything is populating as expected. Is there a roughly equal distribution of all of the different potential classes? Do you have a good amount of data for each different categorical variable (in your case, player positions)? You only have 519 samples to choose from, perhaps you should simplify things down first by just doing a logistic regression and seeing if that works. Regardless, to get anything worthwhile I would recommend that you acquire more data, as it appears you only have at best 50 examples per each class.
