I sense two questions. One about the sample size (25%, why not a majority) and another about the sampling technique (is it truly random, sample 25% randomly on the entire company, sample 25% randomly in every department, or use some other distribution). 1) The sample size does not need to be a majority. The required sample size can be anything between 0 and 100% depending on the required accuracy for a given confidence or likelihood ratio. 100% certainty is never obtained (also not with a 50% or larger subset). Achieving such high accuracy is also not the point of sampling and estimating. See more on sample sizes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination If you get the law of large numbers you may also have an intuitive idea. The distribution of the averages of all possible subsets (and your sample will be one of them), will become smaller, and closer to the mean of the original distribution, if the size of the subset increases. If you select one person then there is some reasonable chance that you find an exception, but to find the same exception in the same direction twice becomes less likely. And so on, the larger the size of the sampled subset the smaller the chance of an exceptional subset. Eventually the distribution of the averages of all possible subsets has a variance equal to the variance of the original set divided by $n$ the size of the subset. Important note! Your estimate will not be dependent on the size of the population from which you sample, but on the distribution of that population. In the case of your 500 size department. The deviation of the averages of random subsets (of size 125) will be 11 times smaller than the original deviation. Note that the error in the measurement (the deviation of the average of the randomly selected subsets), is independent of the size of the department. It could be 500, 5000, or 50000, in all cases the estimate would be unaffected as long as they have the same distribution (now a tiny department might have some strange distribution, but that starts to disappear for larger groups). 2) The sampling does not need to be fully random. You can take the demographics into account. Eventually you would treat each department separately in this sort of analysis and correct for variations among the departments and how you have sampled in these, differently sized, departments. In this correction there are two important differentiations. One might assume the distribution among groups as a random variable or not. If you treat it as a random variable then the analysis becomes stronger (taking out some degrees of freedom in the model) but it might be a wrong assumption if the different groups are not exchangeable as random entities with no specific effect (which seems to be your case, as I imagine that the departments have different functions and may have widely different sentiment that is not random in relationship to the department).
