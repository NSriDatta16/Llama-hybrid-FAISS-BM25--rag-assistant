What Predictions can be done for Restroom/Washroom Data?

My company has installed sensors, which actually monitors the Restrooms/Washrooms in the Building. Currently the sensors collect data such as Ammonia, Nitrous and Visitors Count; All the data collected are time-series data and I have a huge quantity of those. My question is what type of predictions can be done that can add value to this business? Can I use the power of Data Science to avail something which can make my restroom more smarter?
