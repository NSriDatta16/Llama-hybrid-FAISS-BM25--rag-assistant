If in doubt under promise and over deliver: you want to be the person who is delivering more than they were expecting, not less. Based on this always go with the higher of any estimate. Slightly more complex: For a given potential delivery, if you plot the delivery times against the chances of them being happening, you're going to get a curve which is a variation of a normal distribution , and you can assume that a developers minimum estimates are going to be somewhere towards the left of the curve and their maximum towards the right. The area under the curve to the left of the single number you select as your estimate represents the probability of you successfully delivering on or before that estimate. So if you give a number at the very left hand side your chance of hitting is effectively zero, if you give a number at the very right hand side your chance is effectively 100%. What is less commonly realised is if you give the mean value (assuming your min and max averaged out give something approximating the actual mean) you'll only hit that deadline 50% of the time. Effectively if you use the mean you're going to miss the deadline half the time . I don't know about you but I don't like being seen as the guy whose misses half his deadlines. So you want a number which is going to give you something you hit, say, 90% of the time. Conveniently 95% represents the mean + two standard deviations but if you can't be arsed to calculate that (and most of us probably don't have the data) my experience says that: (3 x max + 1 x min) / 4 gives a reasonable result. Incidentally, what you tell the developer is the deadline is another question entirely. Personally I'd give him somewhere around ((2 x max + 1 x min) / 3) and have the rest as contingency.
