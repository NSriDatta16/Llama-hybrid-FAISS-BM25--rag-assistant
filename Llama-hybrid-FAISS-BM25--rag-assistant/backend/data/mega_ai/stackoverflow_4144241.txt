In my case the problem was solved by opening Window -> Organizer, selecting my device and removing the old Provisioning Profile under the "Provisioning" panel on the right. The old one was already marked with a red "x" symbol but the iPhone was still using it. Besides that profile, also the new one was showing up (with the same name) and after simply relaunching the application I had it running smoothly.
