When you are writing a loop, it is sometimes desirable to use the first form, as in this famous example from K&R: int c; while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) { /* stuff */ } There is no elegant "second-form" way of writing this without a repetition: int c = getchar(); while (c != EOF) { /* stuff */ c = getchar(); } Or: int c; for (c = getchar(); c != EOF; c = getchar()) { /* stuff */ } Now that the assignment to c is repeated, the code is more error-prone, because one has to keep both the statements in sync. So one has to be able to learn to read and write the first form easily. And given that, it seems logical to use the same form in if conditions as well. I tend to use the first form mostly because I find it easy to readâ€”as someone else said, it couples the function call and the return value test much more closely.
