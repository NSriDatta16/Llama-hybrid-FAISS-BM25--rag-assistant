Is it possible to fine-tuning BERT by training it on multiple datasets? (Each dataset having it's own purpose)

BERT can be fine-tuned on a dataset for a specific task. Is it possible to fine-tune it on all these datasets for different tasks and then be utilized for these tasks instead of fine-tuning a BERT model specific to each task?
