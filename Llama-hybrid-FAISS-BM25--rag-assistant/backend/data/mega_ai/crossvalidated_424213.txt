There are multiple ways to do it. One is to assume to transform AUC to cohen's D and then just sample data from 2 standard normal distributions D standard deviations apart. We can transform AUC to D according to a formula from SALGADO, Jesús F.. Transforming the Area under the Normal Curve (AUC) into Cohen’s d, Pearson’s r pb , Odds-Ratio, and Natural Log Odds-Ratio: Two Conversion Tables. The European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context [online]. 2018, vol.10, n.1, pp.35-47. ISSN 1989-4007. http://dx.doi.org/10.5093/ejpalc2018a5 Which in R code will work like this auc Of course, since we are sampling, this will produce the correct AUC on average, but the specific sample will not be exactly the required AUC.
