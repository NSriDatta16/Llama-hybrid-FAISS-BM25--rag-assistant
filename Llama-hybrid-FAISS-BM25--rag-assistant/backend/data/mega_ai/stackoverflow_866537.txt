This routine should really be a one-liner, like: Registry.LocalMachine.DeleteSubKey( @"SYSTEM\ControlSet...\etc..." ); You shouldn't need to open a RegistryKey object, because Registry.LocalMachine is kind of already open for you. If you do need to open a RegistryKey object to do something else, be aware that RegistryKey implements IDisposable, so now that you've created an object, you're responsible for disposing of it no matter what. So, you have to surround your code with try { ... } and call Dispose() in the finally block. Fortunately, this can be coded in C# more elegantly using using : using( RegistryKey key = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(...) ) { ... }
