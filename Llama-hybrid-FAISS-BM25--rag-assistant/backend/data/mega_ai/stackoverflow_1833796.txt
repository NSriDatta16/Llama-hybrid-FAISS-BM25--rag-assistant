How to benchmark php/mysql site

I would like to know how to benchmark a php/mysql site. We have a web app almost completed and ready to go live, we know how many people are going to be using it in a years time but have absolutely no idea how much bandwidth the average user takes, to how much time they burn up on the database etc. We need to determine the correct servers to purchase. Is there something server side linux that can monitor these statistics per user? So that we can then take this data and extrapolate it? If I am going about this completely wrong please let me know but I believe that this is a frequent activity for new web apps. EDIT: I may have asked for the incorrect information. We can see how long the database queries take and how long it takes to load the page but have no idea what load is placed on the server. The question I am asking is can we handle 100 users at once on average...1000? What type of server requirements are needed to hit 1M users. Etc. Thanks for your help.
