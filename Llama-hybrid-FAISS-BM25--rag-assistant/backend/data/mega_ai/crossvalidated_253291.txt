Interpeting residuals in a binary model (logistic regression, glm)

I know how to interpret residuals in a linear regression model. I am now working in a model that predicts a binary target combining numerical and categorical variables. My residual plots is as follows: If this were residual plots from a linear regression model I would be able to interpret them and notice that they are terrible. However I do not know if the same interpretation must be done when working with a logistic regression model.
