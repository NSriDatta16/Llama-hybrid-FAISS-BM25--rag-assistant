Proper usage of Merged Resource Dictionaries in Silverlight 3

As I read: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903952(VS.95).aspx , specifically the section labeled "Forward References With a ResourceDictionary": Static resource references from within any given resource dictionary must reference a resource that has already been defined lexically before the resource reference. Forward references cannot be resolved by a static resource reference. For this reason, if you use static resource references, you must design your resource dictionary structure such that resources intended for further by-resource use are defined at or near the beginning of each respective resource dictionary. Does this mean that I cannot do something like this in my App.xaml: Where Brushes.xaml contains SolidColorBrush, LinearColorBrush, etc, definitions that refer to the colors defined in Colors.xaml ? e.g. ? I define my colors in Colors.xaml like: #FFBF3C1F I'm getting a runtime error that states it cannot find a resource with key 'AppOrangeRed' for instance. What are the best practices for organizing Colors and Brushes so they can be reused (where appropriate, and I understand that colors are structs and brushes are reference objects, explained in http://weblogs.manas.com.ar/spalladino/2009/03/02/silverlight-xaml-guidelines/ ) Thanks Rob
