Correlated categorical predictors in logistic regression

Suppose I have three categorical variables, x, y, and z and I have a binary response variable r. I want to predict the response using the glm model. Should I check the association between x, y, and z with chisq.test? What if all of them are significantly correlated? I can't do the prediction?
