One option is to create a hierarchical system. The first stage could be a model that detects the presence of "dog" / "not dog". The second sage could be if "dog" is presence then the specific breed. Many Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed for images. Thus, classification of the video would happen frame-by-frame. Since this is a relative common task, find a pretrained CNN and see how well it performs on your specific data. If the performance is not acceptable, then label your data and fine-tune the model.
