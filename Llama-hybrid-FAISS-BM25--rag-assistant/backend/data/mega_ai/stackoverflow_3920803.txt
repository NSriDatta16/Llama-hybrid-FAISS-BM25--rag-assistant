I finally sought Apple Developer Tech Support for this issue and they looked through my code. The cause of the problem turned out to be conflicting gesture recognizers in different classes. It was a first responder issue, but for some reason, resignFirstResponder and becomeFirstResponder did not have any effect. I had to restructure the code and how the gesture recognizers were organized to get it to work properly. Thanks everyone for the help.
