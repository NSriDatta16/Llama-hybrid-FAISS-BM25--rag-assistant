Average data series using interpolation due to irregular intervals

I am planning to average driving routes (more specifically a 1-dimensional deviation of a optimal route) relative to the distance travelled. My problem is that I have this data sampled in (constant-interval) time, not needed distanc. However, of course the distance travelled (on a specific axis) is depending on speed, steering angle relative to the reference axis etc and thus not in regular intervals, which makes it hard for me to find a way to average over it... Using Jfreechart I could plot all taken routes I assume they do some kind of interpolation, as I simply specified the distance travelled as x coordinate... which is basically what I want to do, but I require an averaged series instead of multiples . Can anyone give me a hint on what to look for / or how you would implement such an average over irregular series?
