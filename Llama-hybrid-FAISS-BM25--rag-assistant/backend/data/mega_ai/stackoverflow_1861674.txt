readfile not working properly

I'm trying to download a file through my server to me, by streaming the download. This is my script: header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=http://user:pass@example.com/file.bin'; header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header('Expires: 0'); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); header('Pragma: public'); header('Content-Length: ' . $r[2]); ob_clean(); flush(); readfile($fileName); exit; example.com isn't what I'm really using, I just didn't want to show the real URL. :) When I go to this file in my web browser a download prompt does not come up and nothing happens. $r[2] is the content length in bytes of the file and $fileName is the same URL as used in the attachment header. I really don't know what I'm doing wrong.
