I've used states heavily and find them a far more elegant solution that lots of conditional code. Indeed, I initially avoided them for some of the reasons given above, but after the app became very complex, with multiple variant "states" I realized that I was fighting the framework. Frankly, I'd make the same observation about bindings. If you don't understand some of the subtleties, they can be your undoing, it's true. However, writing your own code to achieve the same thing seems like duplication of effort. Take a look at the generated code sometime and also read some of the good deep-dives on bindings out there.
