Does anyone have a better suggestion or are there just complete algorithms for this already available? Apparently you want to do information retrieval (IR) but without the information part: normally an important part of the IR process is the set of documents that the user is searching for (for example text, images video). This is important because knowing the documents which correspond to a query gives semantic information about the keywords. Now, if you only have the keywords available then there's no semantic to help with the clustering. So you are right that the only thing you can use is the spelling. i assume that by " simple fuzzywuzzy" you mean "fuzzy matching", i.e. using string similarity measures. I can think of two options: You can compare each keyword with each other with some string similarity measure such as Levenshtein edit distance, Jaro, or characters n-gram based Jaccard, cosine etc. You can represent each keyword as a vector based on the char n-grams in the word, then you can apply clustering with k-means for example. Topic modeling techniques wouldn't work because you don't have large text documents.
