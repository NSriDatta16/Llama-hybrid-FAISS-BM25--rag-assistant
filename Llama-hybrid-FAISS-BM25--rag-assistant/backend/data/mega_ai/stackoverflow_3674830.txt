Caching problem with asynchronous javascript loading with onload event

I am currently trying to load some js files asynchronously, so that they are not able to block the rest of the website. I mainly followed the descriptions found here: Asynchronous Javascript In terms of the non blocking loading of the javascript file this works great, but i got now the problem that the javascript file is cached and stays cached even if i change the content (also doing shift-reload does not help anything). My current code of loading the script looks like the following: (function() { function xx_async_load() { var xx = document.createElement('script'); xx.type = 'text/javascript'; xx.async = true; xx.src = 'http://myserver.de/myjs.js'; var el = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; el.parentNode.insertBefore(xx, el); } if (window.addEventListener) { window.addEventListener('load', xx_async_load, false); } else if (window.attachEvent){ window.attachEvent('onload', xx_async_load); } })(); If i call the code inside "xx_async_load" directly and change the myjs.js, the changes are getting recognized, but if I am loading this through the onload event it always stays cached and the changed are never recognized. Does anybody know a solution how I make the browser to recognize the changes in the cached files (problem appears in Opera, FF and IE work fine)? EDIT: If i look at the "Network" tab of Operas Dragonfly, there isn't even a request done on reload for the cached JS file, it seems that it is directly loading it from cache without even checking against the file on the server. EDIT2: I will test how long it stays in the cache. If its gone till tomorrow its fine. Else I can still propose the workaround with a date param (so accepting that answer). Thx again.
