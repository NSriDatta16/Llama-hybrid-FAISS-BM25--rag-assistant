To be specific about the questions you asked. Everyone doesn't make their own. See my previous answer for a link to the Eclipse packaging of third party libraries as bundles. If you can't find and already packaged version, you'll have to make your own. It is better to wrap binary dependencies in their own bundle than to include the jar as a binary into your code bundle. Pick whatever bundle name you want, its the package imports and exports that matter. Namespacing the bundle name with your project name will make sure you don't hit collisions. Getting access to the bundle storage area for scanning isn't impossible, but it tends to require OSGi runtime specific information on how/where the bundles get extracted. So it's possible, but not easy.
