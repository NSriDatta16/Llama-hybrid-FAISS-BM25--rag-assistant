I have found the example TDD/BDD in RSpec book very useful - http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book this could be some what rails oriented but in the book the author goes from defining the problem, to identifying the simple test cases to complex cases in an intuitive manner. The example in that book is about developing a game and its progress towards towards passing all the tests. Also this could be useful for you because you are talking about interfaces and the BDD is about testing behavior of the application(in your case algorithm).
