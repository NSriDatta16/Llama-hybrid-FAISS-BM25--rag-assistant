Help me calculate the interaction coefficient in logistic regression

Say we have a logistic regression of $ln(\frac{\pi(x)}{1-\pi(x)})=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3x_1*x_2$ . IE we have our predictors for $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and the final term is for the interaction of our two predictors. I'm trying to understand the math behind $\beta_3$ . Let's say $x_1$ and $x_2$ can only take on the values 0 or 1. I've looked up an explanation on the internet that says: " $\beta_3$ is the difference between the log-odds ratio comparing $x_1$ = 1 vs $x_1$ = 0 when $x_2$ = 1 and the log-odds ratio comparing $x_1$ = 1 vs $x_1$ = 0 when $x_2$ = 0." That is like saying "this is the difference between "a and b" and "c and d". Like are we comparing (a-b) - (c-d)? Or (a/b)-(c/d)? Or (a-b)/(c-d)? Like I just...wut I just CANNOT wrap my brain around this, no matter how many times I read it. I don't know what is being subtracted by what, what is being divided by what. It seems like there must be some sort of expression to derive $\beta_3$ based on everything we know about $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ but I just cannot get there. I'm really frustrated. Help?
