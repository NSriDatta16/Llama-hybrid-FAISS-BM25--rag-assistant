Reducing bias when forecasting retail sales with boosting model

I'm forecasting future sales for products in retail stores, using a LightGBM model. My model has a decent forecast accuracy, but the forecasts are biased (the average forecast error is negative, the model is consistently under-forecasting). Do you have any idea or tips on how to avoid bias when forecasting time series with boosting models? Here are some more details: I'm making forecasts at the Day x Product x Store granularity (i.e 1 forecast every day for each product in each store). The forecasting horizon is +7 days. I'm training a single model to forecast all products, stores and time horizons. The main features are lags of sales, calendar info (day of the week, month...), product info (category, price) and store info. Evaluation is made with a time-based cross-validation.
