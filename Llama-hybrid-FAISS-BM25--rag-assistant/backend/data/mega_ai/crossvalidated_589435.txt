PSM - matchit variable questions

I am estimating a propensity score for use in a logistic regression. For this, I am using the matchit command. I have a couple questions on variable inclusion when running PSM: Is there a limit/best practice on how many variables I should use in the match, similar to the one in ten rule for predictor parameters? Is there a problem associated with using a categorical variable?
