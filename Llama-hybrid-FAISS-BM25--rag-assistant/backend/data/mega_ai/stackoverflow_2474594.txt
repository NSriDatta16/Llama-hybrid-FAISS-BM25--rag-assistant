Actually, I'm going to offer another solution even though this question has an accepted answer. Create a conversion table in the database itself along the lines of: number as_one as_first ------ ----------- ------------ 1 one first 2 two second 99 ninety-nine ninety-ninth and just use a query (or sub-query or implicit/explicit join) to retrieve the textual value of the number you're interested in. This greatly simplifies the code out on the client at the cost of minimal storage and a bit of table set-up.
