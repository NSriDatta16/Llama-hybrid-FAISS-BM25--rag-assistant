Superficially, the time series approach is more convenient mathematically, whereas the human date is more convenient for presenting the data/results. On a deeper level, as you correctly noted, one could use day, month and year as three independent variables, particularly, especially if there are reasons to think that there are periodic variations (e.g., seasonal or related to the cycle of the solar activity). Whether it improves or worsens the things depends a) on the method used to analyze the time series (is it capable of capturing periodic movements on the scale of a year or several years?) and on the amount of data (more variables means more parameters, so this increase the risk of overfitting.)
