Note: Using htmlentities() in an UTF-8 encoded document should be avoided. See: Interfacing with Systems using other Charsets Common Problem Areas with UTF-8 Pay attention to (quoted from phpwact.org ): With modern web browsers and widespead support for UTF-8, you don’t need htmlentities because all of these characters can be represented directly in UTF-8. More importantly, in general, only browsers support HTML‘s special characters - a normal text editor, for example, is unaware of HTML entities. Depending on what you’re doing, using htmlentities may reduce the ability of other systems to “consume” your content. Also (not confirmed but sounds reasonable - from anon comment here), character entities (stuff like » or —) do not work when a document is served as application/xml+xhtml (unless you define them). You can still get away with the numeric form though.
