Warning message is because you appear to have fewer than 30 observations. cv.glmnet defaults to 10 folds, which amounts to fewer than 3 observations per fold. The warning message doesn't appear consequential to your concern. The simplest explanation for why all fitted coefficients are zero is because the data does not support a more complex model (i.e. cross validation error is minimized at large shrinkage). If you believe that some coefficients shouldn't be zero in the fitted model, you might consider: A ridge regression, which is less likely to zero out coefficients (may still arbitrarily shrink them, however) A Bayesian approach, where you set informative priors for coefficients you believe to be non-zero
