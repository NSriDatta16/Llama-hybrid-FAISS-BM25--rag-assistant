Basically you listen to NativeDragEvent .NATIVE_DRAG_ENTER, NATIVE_DRAG_DROP and NATIVE_DRAG_EXIT on the UI element that will receive the drop. All three of these events are raised with a NativeDragEvent, through which you can access data in various formats via event.clipboard. getData() , passing in a format specified by ClipboardFormats (eg. ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT) In NATIVE_DRAG_ENTER, you can accept/reject the drag operation via the static methods on NativeDragManager The classes you need are all in the flash.desktop package. Just experiment with various ClipboardFormats until you see the data you need.
