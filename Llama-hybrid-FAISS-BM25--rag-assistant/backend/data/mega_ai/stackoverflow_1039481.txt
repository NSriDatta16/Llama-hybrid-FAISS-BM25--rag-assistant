Where can I find an iPhone OpenGL ES Example that responds to touch?

I would like to find an iPhone OpenGL ES Example that responds to touch. Ideally it would meet these requirements: Displays a 3D object in the center of the screen like a cube Maps a texture to the cube surfaces Should move the camera around the cube as you drag your finger Should zoom the camera in and out on the cube by pinching Optionally has a background behind the cube that wraps around the back of the camera.(for example this could create the effect of the cube being in space) Has anyone seen one or more examples that can do these or at least render the cube with the texture?
