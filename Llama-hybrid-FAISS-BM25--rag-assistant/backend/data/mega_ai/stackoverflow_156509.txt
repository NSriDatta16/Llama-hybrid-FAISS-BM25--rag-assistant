I've found the solution. When you merge a document, it creates a new document with the merge results in it. Code fragment below explains. wrdDoc = wrdApp.Documents.Add(TemplateFileName) wrdDoc.Select() Dim wrdSelection As Word.Selection Dim wrdMailMerge As Word.MailMerge wrdDoc.MailMerge.OpenDataSource(DataFileName) wrdSelection = wrdApp.Selection() wrdMailMerge = wrdDoc.MailMerge() With wrdMailMerge .Execute() End With ' This is the wrong thing to do. It just re-saves the template file you opened. ' 'wrdDoc.SaveAs(OutputFileName) ' ' The resulting merged document is actually stored ' ' in the MailMerge object, so you have to save that ' wrdMailMerge.Application.ActiveDocument.SaveAs(OutputFileName) wrdApp.Quit(False)
