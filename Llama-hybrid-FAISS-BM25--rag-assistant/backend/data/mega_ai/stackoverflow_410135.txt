Average users still don't understand what OpenId is, what it's for, or how to use it. My parents would not be able to login to Stack Overflow, for instance. That being said, this is largely about user interface. There's nothing inherently preventing them from using OpenId - they just need a user interface that abstracts away OpenId from them, and just lets them login with their Google account (for instance).
