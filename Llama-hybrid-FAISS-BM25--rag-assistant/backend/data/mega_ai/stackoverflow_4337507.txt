I see there are two paragraphs which are not executed in the code starting 300- and 400- as they are not performed and are below the stop run. There may be i-o-control entries omitted for the output to the file and the output appears to be written to a file and not to a display screen or printer. This would depend any default settings or those of any external assignments or redirects.
