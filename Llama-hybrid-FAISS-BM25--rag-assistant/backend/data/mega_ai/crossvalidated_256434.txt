There is absolutely nothing wrong with computing correlations where one of the variables is categorical. A strong positive correlation would imply that turning your categorical variable on (or off depending on your convention) causes an increase in the response. For example this could happen when calculating a logistic regression where variables are categorical: predicting the chance of a heart attack given patient comorbidities like diabetes and bmi. In this case BMI would have would have a very strong correlation with heart attacks. Would you conclude that's not useful?
