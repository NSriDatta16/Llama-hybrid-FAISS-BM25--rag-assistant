(1) It's the CDF you'll need to generate your simulated time-series. To build it, first histogram your price changes/returns. Take a cumulative sum of bin population starting with your left-most populated bin. Normalize your new function by dividing by the total bin population. What you are left with is a CDF. Here is some numpy code that does the trick: # Make a histogram of price changes counts,bin_edges = np.histogram(deltas,numbins,normed=False) # numpy histogram # Make a CDF of the price changes n_counts,bin_edges2 = np.histogram(deltas,numbins,normed=True) cdf = np.cumsum(n_counts) # cdf not normalized, despite above scale = 1.0/cdf[-1] ncdf = scale * cdf (2) To generate correlated picks, use a copula. See this answer to my previous question on generating correlated time series.
