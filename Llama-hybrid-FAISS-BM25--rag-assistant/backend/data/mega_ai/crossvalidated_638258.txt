Correct interpretation of Bayesian credible intervals

I'm starting to learn about Bayesian statistics for my own personal education (this is not a homework question). Something puzzles me a bit about the interpretation of credible intervals. From the few things I've read so far, it seems that their interpretation goes along the lines of (e.g. for a 95% credible interval): There is a 95% probability that the true (unknown) estimate would lie within the interval, given the evidence provided by the observed data. (quotation taken from here ) This seems intuitive and straightforward, but shouldn't we add " and given the prior we defined " to the sentence above, to be perfectly accurate? (As the interval is affected by the prior, if I understood things correctly). Or is there a reason for not mentioning priors? In fact, I suspect that the presence of priors is implied with the word "evidence", but I'm not sure about it and would like some confirmation that I'm on the right track. Thanks.
