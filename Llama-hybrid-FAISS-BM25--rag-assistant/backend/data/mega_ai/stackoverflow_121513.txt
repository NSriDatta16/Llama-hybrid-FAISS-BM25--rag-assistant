Maybe this is not what you mean but... If I'm on a line in Eclipse and I enter double quotation marks, then inside that paste a multiline selection (like your xyz example) it will paste out like this: "xxxx\n" + "yyyy\n" + "zzz" Then you could just find/replace in a selection for "\n" to "" , if you didn't intend the newlines. I think the option to enable this is in Window/Preferences , under Java/Editor/Typing/ , check the box next to "Escape text when pasting into a string literal" . ( Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede )
