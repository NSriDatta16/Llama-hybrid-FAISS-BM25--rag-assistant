2d STL vector typeid

I have various 2D vectors and I want to query their differing types at runtime. It appears this is possible on an "empty" vector, e.g.: vector > myVec; cout The above returns "float" although I was expecting an exception as I've not pushed back any elements. Is it just luck that when accessing the memory at [0][0] without any bounds checking or iterator it succeeds? Or does the vector allocate some baseline storage when it is declared?
