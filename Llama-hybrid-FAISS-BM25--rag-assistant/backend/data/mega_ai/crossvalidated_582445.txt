This is an NLP problem, and while there has been much progress in recent years, those problems are still considered quite hard. In particular, your task sounds like sentiment analysis . The basic idea is to separate the text into sentences and then assign a sentiment (e.g. "positive" or "negative") to each of them. Furthermore, your approach seems to be a rule-based method. There are already a couple of rule-based methods developed for this task. You might want to look into those. To start, see here or here . But you could also think about applying some sentiment analysis machine learning model. This would be a supervised learning problem and for training, you would need many sentences that are already labeled with "positive" and "negative". And, if you want to use the state-of-the-art deep learning models, you will need a lot of such labeled data. This might be a problem in your situation. Fortunately, this is a very common problem, so you might benefit from some pre-trained sentiment models. Those are models that have been trained on large datasets and only need some fine-tuning with your data to adapt them to your problem. And for fine-tuning you don't need much data, so you might want to give it a try. I think a good start for learning about sentiment analysis with deep neural networks is this post. See also here , or here . If the deep learning approach is not for you, maybe because of the complexity and the computational costs (buying GPU hardware or cloud computing resources), you could still go for training an ML model, but a classic one. A useful library would be the python NLTK library.
