I think this may be the case if individuals are affected differently by time. In some individuals, time may increase the "trait", while in some individuals, time will decrease the "trait". But if you average it, then there may not be an effect of time since the effect varies from individual to individual. However, that this is the "best" model (lowest AIC and such, I suppose?) might indicate that time indeed has a pronounced effect in some individuals. The effect seems large enough to provide a better fit for your data. An example: you might have equal proportions of men and women in your data. What if time has a positive effect on trait for women, and a negative effect for men? On average, time will have no effect but if you would include the interaction between sex and time, you would see that time had a large effect. You might have a similar situation here. EDIT: A quick simulation to demonstrate that this may be the case: timeeffect And the best model is the last one, just as in your case.
