I am not sure what you mean by "the" confidence region. If I were to create a confidence region at a given confidence level $k_\alpha$, I would pick an HPD region$$\mathfrak{C}_\alpha=\{x;\ p(x)\ge k_\alpha\}$$ A first approach to create a confidence region on $Y=h(X)$ is to take the transform of $\mathfrak{C}_\alpha$ by $h$, i.e. $$\mathfrak{C}^h_\alpha=\{y;\ \exists x\ \text{such that }p(x)\ge k_\alpha\}$$which has at least coverage $\alpha$. But this may not be the HPD (i.e. smallest) confidence region because of the change of variable formula, which includes a Jacobian. Hence another approach is to take the pdf of $Y$ $p^h$ and derive directly the corresponding HPD region $$\mathfrak{C}^\star_\alpha=\{y;\ p^h(y)\ge k^\star_\alpha\}$$ When running an MCMC algorithm as in Haario et al (1999) it is possible to derive directly the HPD region by looking at the $100\alpha$% largest densities and constructing the convex envelope of the associated simulations.
