Reformat a large text file into one line strings (via BASH)

File1: hello - dictionary definitions: hi hello hallo greetings salutations no more hello for you - world - dictionary definitions: universe everything the globe the biggest tree planet cess pool of organic life - I need to format this (for a huge list of words) into a term to definition format (one line per term). How can one achieve this? None of the words are the same, only the structure seen above is. The resultant file would look something like this: hello - dictionary definitions: hi hello hallo greetings salutations no more hello for you - world - dictionary definitions: universe everything the globe the biggest tree planet cess pool of organic life - Awk/Sed/Grep/Cat are the usual contenders.
