In my opinion MVVM doesn't complicate an app, it just organizes code into separate areas. Of course there is a learning curve on how to accomplish this. In WPF there are a dozen ways to accomplish one task, so if you are unfamiliar with best practices and how WPF works it can seem very difficult. I believe to really harness MVVM you need to understand WPF. I believe the best book for that is this one. It starts at the beginning and constrasts winforms with WPF and then goes through every control type and helps you understand their role. You don't get to databinding until the middle of the book. It's a long read, but if you actually want to harness WPF and utilize MVVM I believe it's essential. Also this sample MVVM app article is good start to understand MVVM.
