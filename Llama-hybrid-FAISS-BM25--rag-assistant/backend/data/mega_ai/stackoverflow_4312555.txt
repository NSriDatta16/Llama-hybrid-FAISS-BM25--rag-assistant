First you should split your text to single sentences. Here's a simple, far-from-perfect way for doing this (I'm sure you could find plenty of more complete patterns elsewhere): 'Gsda asd. Gasd sasd. Tfed fdd.'.scan(/(.+?\.) ?/).map(&:first) #=> ["Gsda asd.", "Gasd sasd.", "Tfed fdd."] Then, you should join these sentences, keeping an eye of the paragraph length. You can use something like this: # using words as units, but sentences are just the same: s = ['foo', 'bar', 'beef', 'baz', 'hello', 'chunky', 'bacon'] LEN = 7 # minimum length of a paragraph s.inject([]){|a,i| if !a.last || a.last.length > LEN a ["foo bar beef", "baz hello", "chunky bacon"]
