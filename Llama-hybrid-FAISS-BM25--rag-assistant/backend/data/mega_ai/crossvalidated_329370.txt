Can we use backpropagation to fit other models?

It appears that backpropagation is exclusively used to train neural network models. Why not use it to fit other models. For example - Taylor polynomials: $$ f(x) = c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2...+c_n(x-a)^n $$ We can represent it in a graph and take derivatives backwards the same way as everything is differentiable including the center. Any thoughts? Thanks
