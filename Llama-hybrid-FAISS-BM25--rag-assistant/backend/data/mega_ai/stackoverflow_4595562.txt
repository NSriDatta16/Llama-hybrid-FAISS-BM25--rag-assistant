It looks like the StatFs class might be what you need to use. I'm not sure what path would be considered the root of the device, but I believe the result would be the same regardless of directory, as long as it's part of the internal storage. Something like this may work: StatFs stats = new StatFs("/data"); int availableBlocks = stats.getAvailableBlocks(); int blockSizeInBytes = stats.getBlockSize(); int freeSpaceInBytes = availableBlocks * blockSizeInBytes; If nothing else, the StatFs class should give you a good start on where to look.
