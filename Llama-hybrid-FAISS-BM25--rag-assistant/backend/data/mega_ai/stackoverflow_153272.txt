Generally, I start small, with inputs and outputs that I know must work. Then, as I fix bugs, I add more tests to ensure the things I've fixed are tested. It's organic, and works well for me. Can you test too much? Probably, but it's probably better to err on the side of caution in general, though it'll depend on how mission-critical your application is.
