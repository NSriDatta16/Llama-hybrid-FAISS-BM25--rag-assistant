How to recommend selection of one variable when the variables have p-values that are not statistically significant after applying holm adjustment

My task is recommend to a marron farmer who wishes to farm in a new location, and have four locations with different amounts of rainfall. amount of rainfall is the important factor for the farmer to qualify a location for setting up Marron farm. Multple comparisons were used to compare the locations and holm adjustment was used to control type 1 error rate. The analysis found that only two locations were significant different, the rest of the locations had p values > 0.05 which was set as alpha.of course the boxplot of the four locations was created and one location (Pemberton) even got an outlier way above all other locations, and its median line is above the other two medians though still overlapping with their boxes. My problem is how do i pick one location based on the analysis? Below is the table of p-values generated Table 2: Pairwise t-test results (p-values) Albany Bunbury Manjimup Bunbury 0.41192 - - Manjimup 0.14241 0.87340 - Pemberton 0.00031 0.13759 0.06522 Note: p-values have been adjusted to control the familywise type 1 error rate using the holm method.
