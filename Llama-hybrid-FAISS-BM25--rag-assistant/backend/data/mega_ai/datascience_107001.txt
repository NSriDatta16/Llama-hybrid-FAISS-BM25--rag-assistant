What you are looking for is a so-called sentiment-analysis in NLP. In this article, you will find an instruction on how to train a Convolutional Neural Network with a BERT Encoder for a sentiment-analysis . You could use this example and just replace the training data with movie reviews (positive / negative) with some of your labeled data. Definitely worth a try:)
