About Prime Generation in "C" - What is wrong with my code ? -

I'm a third year irregular CS student and ,i just realized that i have to start coding. I passed my coding classes with lower bound grades so that i haven't a good background in coding&programming. I'm trying to write a code that generates prime numbers between given upper and lower bounds. Not knowing C well, enforce me to write a rough code then go over it to solve. I can easily set up the logic for intended function but i probably create a wrong algorithm through several different ways. Here I share my last code, i intend to calculate that when a number gives remainder Zero , it should be it self and 1 , so that count==2; What is wrong with my implementation and with my solution generating style? I hope you will warm me up to programming world, i couldn't find enough motivation and courage to get deep into programming. Stdio and Math.h is Ä°ncluded int primegen(int down,int up) { int divisor,candidate,count=0,k; for(candidate=down;candidate
