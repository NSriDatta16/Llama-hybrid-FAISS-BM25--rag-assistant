Take a look at this post by John Resig , it explains the benefit of using DocumentFragments when doing large additions to the DOM. A DocumentFragment is a container that you can add nodes to without actually altering the DOM in any way. When you are ready you add the entire fragment to the DOM and this places it's content into the DOM in a single operation. Also, doing $("#myTable") on each iteration is really not recommended - do it once before the loop.
