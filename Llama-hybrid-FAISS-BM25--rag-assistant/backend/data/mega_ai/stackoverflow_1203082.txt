Injecting text when content is copied from a web page

I ran into a a site that injects a "Read More: " line at the end of any text that you highlight and copy from it's pages. I've never seen this before, and without severely digging into their code, I can't find the code that does this. Anyone know how this is done? Example: http://peaceful-parenting.suite101.com/article.cfm/how_to_keep_kids_from_climbing_on Copy a paragraph of text, and paste it into another application, and there will be a "read more" line afterwards.
