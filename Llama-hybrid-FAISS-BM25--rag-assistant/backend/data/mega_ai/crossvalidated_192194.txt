What is the appropriate statistical test when calculating the busiest day of the week?

We have 10 years of data and Monday is the busiest (most visits to the hospital) on average. If we wanted to assess whether that is true and report a p-value, what is the appropriate statistic? We believe the answer is chi-square as we found a peer-reviewed medical article from the Annals of Emergency Medicine (highest circulating journal for that specialty) that used chi-square for this very calculation. If chi-square is appropriate, what values do we use for observed and expected values for chi-square? One approach would be to list all the values for Monday as observed values, or all the means for Mondays averaged across a month, or all the means for Mondays averaged across a year. If there were no busiest or least busy days, we would assume that the visits would be the same every day of the week. That means our "expected values" for Chi-Square would be the mean of the visits for any given week.
