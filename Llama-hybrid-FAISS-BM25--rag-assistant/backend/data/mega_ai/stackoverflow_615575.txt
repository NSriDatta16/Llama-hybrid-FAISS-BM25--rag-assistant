MSDeploy triggers 401 Access denied error when trying to synch a site

I try to push/sync a IIS Site from a Win2003 Server to another. This is my command: msdeploy -verb:sync -source:metakey=lm/w3svc/68512112 -dest:metakey=lm/w3svc/68512112,computername=backup-09,username=Administrator,password=PASSWORD -whatif > msdeploysync.log I also tried the following msdeploy -verb:sync -source:metakey=lm/w3svc/68512112 -dest:metakey=lm/w3svc/68512112,computername=backup-09,username=BACKUP-09\Administrator,password=PASSWORD -whatif > msdeploysync.log I also tried msdeploy -verb:sync -source:metakey=lm/w3svc/68512112 -dest:metakey=lm/w3svc/68512112,computername=backup-09,username=Administrator@BACKUP-09,password=PASSWORD -whatif > msdeploysync.log This is the error: Fatal: Request to remote agent URL ' http://backup-09/MSDEPLOYAGENTSERVICE ' failed. Fatal: The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized. Fatal count: 1 I did run msdeploy/cmd as an administrator. I did try to access http://backup-09/MSDEPLOYAGENTSERVICE , it asked for my permissions, I entered the credentials above, it worked (empty site displayed). This is Beta 2 of MSDeploy Can anyone help me? I now even set up a domain controller for all the servers... still the same issues, whether I'm logged in as a domain controller, supply the local accounts, all variations trigger a 401
