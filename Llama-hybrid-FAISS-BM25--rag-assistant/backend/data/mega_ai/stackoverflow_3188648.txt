I use lowerCamel for class names and UpperCamel for IDs. This is quite important and I'm beating this old answer because IMO the hyphenated style should be discouraged, even underscore is better than hyphenated. Why? Because every other language can't have hyphenated variable names. For e.g., your IDE may or may not pick up auto-completion properly. (My IDE can't, it's VI :P) CSS being closely related to JavaScript, hyphenated classname also make it difficult to interop with JavaScript. Consider the following (contrived) jQuery: // For each of the following class, perform a function var funcs = { main: function(){ /* ... */}, toolbar: function(){ /* ... */ }, // Oops, need to use a quote because there's this hyphenated name 'customer-info': function(){ /* ... */ } }; // Woot, a O(n^2) function for(var className in funcs) { var func = funcs[className]; // maybe if we named it $('#some-selector')? The hyphen suddenly feels // like some kind of operator to me. Makes me nervous :/ $('#SomeSelector div').each(function() { if($(this).hasClass(className)) func(); }); } There's no clear advantage to using the hyphenated style other than subjective aesthetics. The disadvantages are that it stands out from every other programming language (OK, CSS may not be a programming language, oh well..) and that it is technically incorrect . The correct (huh?) way to represent a space is underscore. Consider this phrase "a self-addressed letter," how can I convert the spaces? a_self-addressed_letter (correct, preserves the original meaning) a-self-addressed-letter (ouch! if we convert it back we get "a self addressed letter"!) Also is it a best practice to always use all lowercase for css names, because they are case-insensitive? I guess in this case, it's a best practice to always use PascalCasing because it aids readability.
