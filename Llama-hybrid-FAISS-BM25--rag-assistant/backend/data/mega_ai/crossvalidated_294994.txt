Introduction To The Bootstrap , Section 17.6, recommends a different method than the one you describe. This is the ".632" bootstrap. For each bootstrap sample, approximately .632 of the elements will be used (some more than once). Train the model for this iteration on these elements, and calculate the train error (on the same elements), and the test error (on the elements not chosen). The train error obviously underestimates (as you note in the question). The test error, however, overestimates: it checks the performance of a model built on instances of which some were duplicated. A derivation shows that the approximation (for this iteration) should be a weighted average: 0.368 of the train error, and 0.632 of the test error. As usual in the bootstrap, confidence intervals are built based on the distribution of several of these approximations (each of which is the weighted average above). The book contains more details.
