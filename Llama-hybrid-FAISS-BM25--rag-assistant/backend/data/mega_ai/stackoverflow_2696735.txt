Why are you using the STL list? Unless you have very specific requirements, you should be using vector or deque instead. If your reason for using the list was to increase insertion efficiency, you should note that a deque offers most of the advantages of both list and vector because it is not required to maintain contiguous storage, but uses arrays as it's underlying storage media. EDIT: And regarding your desire for a list that offers operator[] , such a structure does not exist (at least, does not exist and still conform to the STL). One of the key design ideas of the STL is that algorithms and containers offer only what they can efficiently . Considering offering operator[] on a linked list requires linear time for each access, that's not efficient.
