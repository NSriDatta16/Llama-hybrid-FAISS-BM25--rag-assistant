Why is Mean squared error a good loss function?

I am currently studying the statistics behind machine learning and my question is why the mean squared error is a good selection for the loss function? Does it have good statistical properties (unbiased, consistent)? Or practical advantages? Someone told me that it is unbiased but I still do not see why it is even a estimator, since it is rather a function which evaluates your point estimator. I would appreciate any type of clarification since I could not find anything online about this topic.
