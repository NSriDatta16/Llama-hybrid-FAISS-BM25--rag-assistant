Code you've posted is rather inconsistent. findAll() method is not declared anywhere; plus service implementation implements Service but you're trying to autowire it into TypeService which is not going to work. If the first code fragment was instead written as: @Service public class TypeServiceImpl implements TypeService { and it was the only TypeService implementation in your app context, auto-wiring would have worked.
