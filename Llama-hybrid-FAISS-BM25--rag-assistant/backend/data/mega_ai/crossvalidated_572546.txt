what could be wrong with a Principal Component analysis that uses regression on dummy variables? (I am not looking for workarounds)

I have already checked the suggested links and they do not answer my questions; my question is simple and does not need to be reinterpreted. So please do not close the question until it receives its proper answer. What would question the credibility of a PCA used on dummy variables that generate components as the underlying continuous variables? I do not care if there are specific methods like tetrachoric PCA etc There is no mixture of variables. they are all dichotomous (0,1).
