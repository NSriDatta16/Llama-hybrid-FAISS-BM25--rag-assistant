Flat, conjugate, and hyper- priors. What are they?

I am currently reading about Bayesian Methods in Computation Molecular Evolution by Yang. In section 5.2 it talks about priors, and specifically Non-informative/flat/vague/diffuse, conjugate, and hyper- priors. This might be asking for an oversimplification but, could someone explain simply the difference between these types of priors and how that affects the outcome of an analysis/decisions I would make during the process of a Bayesian analysis? (I'm not a statistician and I am just starting out on the road to learning Bayesian analyses so the more it is in layman terms the better)
