You could try to apply Rubin's rules directly to the results of the multivariate regressions on each of the imputed data sets. You average the coefficient matrices (from coef() on each model) to get the pooled estimates of the coefficients, calculate variance among the individual coefficient matrices to get the between-imputation variance, and then average the coefficient covariance matrices (from vcov() on each model) to get the within-imputation variance estimates. Marshall et al show formulas (in Table 2) for significance testing once those matrices are prepared from the individual regressions.
