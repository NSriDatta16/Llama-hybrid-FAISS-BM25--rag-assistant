On the surface, using the WMI approach seems more efficient than iterating over the entire file system (assume for example the directory has 10's of thousands of files). But I do not know that WMI also doesn't do iterations. If it does, being closer to the metal (again, assumptions) it should be more efficient. For elegance, I concede the recursive method is cool. Performance testing should answer the efficiency question. And either can be elegant if wrapped in an extension method of DirectoryInfo.
