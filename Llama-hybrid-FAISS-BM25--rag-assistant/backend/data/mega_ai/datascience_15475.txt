roc_auc score GridSearch

I am experimenting with xgboost. I ran GridSearchCV with score='roc_auc' on xgboost. The best classificator scored ~0.935 (this is what I read from GS output). But now when I run best classificator on the same data: roc_auc_score(Y, clf_best_xgb.predict(X)) it gives me score ~0.878 Could you tell me how the score is evaluated in both cases? Thanks
