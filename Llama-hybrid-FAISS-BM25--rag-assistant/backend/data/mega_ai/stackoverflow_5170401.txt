Magento libraries working with jQuery issue?

Hi I am working with magento at the moment and want to integrate a jquery slideshow with rounded corners using jquery. However I am having a problem using jquery with the others, even though I have wrapped my code in: (function($) { $(document).ready(function(){ // code here }); })(jQuery); You can find a link to my js file here . I am calling jquery-latest from the jquery site/cdn, and the theme is default.
