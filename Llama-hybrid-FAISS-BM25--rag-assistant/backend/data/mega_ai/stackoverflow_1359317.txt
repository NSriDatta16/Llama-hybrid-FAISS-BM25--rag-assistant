mass change link in html website

I took over an old HTML based site with all hard coded links, no frames etc. Theres who knows how many pages that have a link to abc.html ( I've been asked to go through the pages and change the abc.html link to 123.html ( I could download the entire site from via FTP then use find and replace to go through all the files, then upload the changes. Problem is the site is poorly organized and heavily nested so theres probably several hundred mg of junk I'd have to download just to be sure. The other option is to change the html code of abc.html and put in something like We've moved, you are currently being redirected. And use some sort of redirect. Anyone have any other ideas on how to do this?
