You can create a website that has AJAX and is search engine compatible but it must be created such that the same information can be accessed without AJAX through the same URL. Search engine cannot execute Javascript and as such any content only available through Javascript will be inaccessible to the search engine. You need to either provide this content within the tag or within the page by default and have the Javascript hide it for your AJAX version. You cannot deliver a different page to a search engine such as Google as they will generally crawl a page both as their bot but also masking as a user by sending a user-agent string purporting to be say, Internet Explorer. This is their method for ensuring you're not trying to game the search engines and they're seeing the same content as a regular user.
