If the documents are modern Word 2007 format you can use direct XML-based manipulation, through OOXML . This is by far the better long term solution, though I realize it may not be realistic for an entire organization to change overnight. If they are older Word formats, you're probably stuck with server-side Word/Excel/Powerpoint/Outlook programmable object models, although you're not supposed to do that on the server ..
