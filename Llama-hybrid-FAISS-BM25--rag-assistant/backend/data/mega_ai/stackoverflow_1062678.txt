A half-baked object orientated extension to C. In embedded systems there is still a lot of C only projects. So every now and then somebody thinks his object orientated solution is all that is required to whip this project into shape ... leaving a massive maintenance mess somewhere down the line. Usually the person starts out with modest and noble aims but it just gets away from him, every time. He hands over to a different programmer that thinks this great. OOP in C, how neat and then butchers the already tragic code he does not understands. Soon it is beyond any repair. The worst one I have seen no driver could compile without including all the headers of the objects that is going to use it as well as the header files for that component user up to the highest level. Any programming language will become a monster if it is not used as intended.
