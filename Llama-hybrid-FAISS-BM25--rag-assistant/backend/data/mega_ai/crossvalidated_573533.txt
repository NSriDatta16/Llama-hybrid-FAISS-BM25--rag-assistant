The neural net will pick up also interaction effects, unlike your Cox model with (one-dimensional) splines. However, you will need a very large sample size to beat a well built additive Cox model in terms of predictive performance. Furthermore, working with neural nets requires a lot of practical experience (so many things can go wrong) and a bullet proof validation strategy. If you really want to sacrifice additivity, then I'd suggest to start with a survival random forest. There, you will also have to work with a clean validation strategy, but it is much easier.
