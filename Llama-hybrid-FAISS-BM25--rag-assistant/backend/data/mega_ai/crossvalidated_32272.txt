Possible range of $R^2$

Suppose are three time series, $X_1$ , $X_2$ and $Y$ Running ordinary linear regression on $Y$ ~ $X_1$ ( $Y = b X_1 + b_0 + \epsilon$ ), we get $R^2 = U$ . The ordinary linear regression $Y$ ~ $X_2$ get $R^2 = V$ . Assume $U What's the minimum and maximum possible values of $R^2$ on regression $Y$ ~ $X_1 + X_2$ ( $Y = b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_0 + \epsilon$ )? I believe the minimum $R^2$ should be $V$ + a small value, since adding new variables always increases $R^2$ , but I don't know how to quantify this small value, and I don't know how to obtain the maximum range.
