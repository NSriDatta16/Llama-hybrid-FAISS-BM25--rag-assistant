No matter what, I wouldn't recommend writing your own code from the ground up for this. You should use a parser. A quick search on CPAN suggests this family of modules . On the other hand, if your css is in an html file rather than a separate css file (shame on you), then you might end up needing a different type of parser. Either way, it's generally not a good idea to try to hand-roll your own quasi-parser out of regular expressions. Use a proper parser, and leverage someone else's work. On a slightly different tack, if you only want to extract some of the information from a file of any kind, then in many cases you don't want to put the whole file into an array first. (It can be memory intensive if the file is very large, and it's unnecessary.) It's easy to open the file and the process the items as you work through it line by line. #!/usr/bin/env perl use strict; use warnings; open my $fh, ' ) { # process $line # push @saved_items, $something } # Do more fun stuff with @saved_items
