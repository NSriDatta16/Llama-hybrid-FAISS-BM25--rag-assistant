How to strip Querystring from a field in T-SQL?

I have a SQL table full of logs that shows response time from my pages. For example: /MyPage1.aspx /MyPage2.aspx /MyPage3.aspx?index=4 /MyPage3.aspx?index=5 /MyPage3.aspx?index=7 However, I want to create a view that shows me the average load time for each page. To do this, I don't want the query strings included since I just want to group the pages by their URL before the question mark (so /MyPage3.aspx only shows up once). What string functions are appropriate here to strip out the query string?
