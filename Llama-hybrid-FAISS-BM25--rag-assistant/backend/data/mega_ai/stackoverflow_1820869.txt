Spring does not attempt to replace certain advanced parts of the JavaEE spec, such as JMS and JTA. Instead, it builds on those, making them consistent with the "Spring way", and generally making them easier to use. If your application requires the power of the likes of JMS and JTA, then you can easily use them via Spring. Not a problem with that.
