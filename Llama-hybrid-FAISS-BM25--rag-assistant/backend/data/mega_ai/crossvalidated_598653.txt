The Ljung-Box test uses the following hypotheses: H0: The residuals are independently distributed. HA: The residuals are not independently distributed; they exhibit serial correlation. Ideally, we would like to be unable to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we would like to see a p-value greater than 0.05 because this means the residuals for our time series model are independent, which is often an assumption we make when creating a model.
