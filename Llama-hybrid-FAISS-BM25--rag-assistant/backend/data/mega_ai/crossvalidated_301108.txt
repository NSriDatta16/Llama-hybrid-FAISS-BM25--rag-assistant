You should start with plotting your data, obtaining: The size of the plotting symbols are proportional to the square root of number signed up. We can safely disregard the smallest points, as they corespond to a sample size of 1. Apart from this, there is a nice falling tendency with distance. A logistic regression model could be used: mod1 |z|) (Intercept) 0.3005630 0.1093824 2.748 0.006 ** dist -0.0028817 0.0002891 -9.969 The deviance here is so large so overdispersion is indicated, so you should maybe replace the binomial family with quasibinomial . If your real data set is much larger, you could maybe represent dist with a spline function. For brevity, I replaced the names in your data table with names(dat) [1] "N" "x" "perc" "dist"
