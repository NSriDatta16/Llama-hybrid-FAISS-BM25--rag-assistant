How to tell if there is a homoscedasticity of the model based on this plot?

I am building regression model of cholesterol predicted by 4 dietary components. I want to check if the assumption of Homoscedasticity is satisfied. I plotted Residuals vs Laverage plot. Unfortunatelly I cannot tell from this plot whether we can say Homoscedasticity or not... I know in the perfect scenario the residuals should be spread quite equally, though this data set is quite big (25 dietary components), therefore I was wondering where is the limit of deciding: we can/cannot day there is Homoscedasticity. Maybe there are some other tests I can make to test that?
