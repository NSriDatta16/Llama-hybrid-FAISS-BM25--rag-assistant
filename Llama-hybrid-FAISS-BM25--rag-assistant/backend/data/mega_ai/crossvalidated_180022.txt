Ideally, you'd want to select as many covariates as possible to be included in your propensity score (PS) model in order to predict the probability of treatment assignment, but the problem with that approach is that you risk having some of those covariates being influenced by the treatment itself and this violates the ignorability assumption of propensity scores: that the treatment assignment and response are conditionally independent given the covariates. In addition, you risk including covariates that are not predictive of the treatment at all, in which case you will not reduce selection bias, but you will be adding noise, increasing the variance of the estimated treatment effect. You do not want to focus on the fit of the model or on the significance of parameters in your model, but on whether or not your resulting model is successful in covariate balance. If you do plan to use propensity scores, I'd suggest you look into gradient boosting methods for obtaining the probability of treatment assignment given the covariates. Research on this method suggests it typically performs better than simple, multivariable logistic regression models. Lastly, if you are using R, I'd recommend taking a look at the twang package. It is an excellent package for obtaining propensity scores and more importantly assessing how well they achieve covariate balance. For small to medium sized datasets, I think it is the best software around and I've spent a lot of time working with similar packages in SAS, STATA, and R.
