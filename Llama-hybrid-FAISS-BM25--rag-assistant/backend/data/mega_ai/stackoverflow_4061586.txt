For question 2, StringBuilder will perform better than StringBuffer. StringBuffer is thread safe, meaning methods are synchronized. String Builder is not synchronized. So if the code you have is going to be run by ONE thread, then StringBuilder is going to have better performance since it does not have the overhead of doing synchronization. As camickr suggest, please check out the API for StringBuffer and StringBuilder for more information. Also you may be interested in this article: The Sad Tragedy of Micro-Optimization Theater
