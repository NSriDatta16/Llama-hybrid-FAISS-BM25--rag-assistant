The following represent a few possibilities for calculating confidence intervals on $\rho^2$. Double adjusted r-square bootstrap My current best guess at an answer is to do a double adjusted r-square bootstrap. I've implemented the technique. It involves the following: Generate a set of bootstrap samples from the current data. For each bootstrapped sample: calculate first adjusted r-square for the two models calculate second adjusted r-square on the adjusted r-square values from the previous step Subtract model2 from model1 second adjusted r-square values to get an estimate of $\Delta \rho^2$. The rationale is that the first adjusted r-square removes the bias introduced by bootsrapping (i.e., bootstrapping assumes that the sample r-square is the population r-square). The second adjusted r-square performs the standard correction that is applied to a normal sample to estimate population r-square. At this point, all I can see is that applying this algorithm generates estimates that seem about right (i.e., the mean theta_hat in the bootstrap is very close to the sample theta_hat). The standard error aligns with my intuition. I haven't yet tested whether it provides proper frequentist coverage where the data generating process is known, and I'm also not entirely sure at this point how the argument could be justified from first principles If anyone sees any reasons why this approach would be problematic, I'd be grateful to hear about it. Simulation by Algina et al St√©phane mentioned the article by Algina, Keselman and Penfield. They performed a simulation study to examine the 95% confidence interval coverage of bootstrapping and asymptotic methods for estimating $\Delta \rho^2$. Their bootstrapping methods involved only a single application of adjusted r-square, rather than the double adjustment of r-square that I mention above. They found that bootstrap estimates only provided good coverage when the number of additional predictors in the full model was one or perhaps two. It is my hypothesis that this is because as the number of predictors increases, so would the difference between the single and double adjusted r-square bootstrap. Smithson (2001) on using the noncentrality parameter Smithson (2001) discusses calculating confidence intervals for the partial $R^2$ based on the non-centrality parameter. See pages 615 and 616 in particular. He suggests that "it is straightforward to construct a CI for $f^2$ and partial $R^2$ but not for the squared semipartial correlation."
