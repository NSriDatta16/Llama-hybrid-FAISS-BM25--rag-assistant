As you are probably aware, .NET 3.5 is an incremental change to the language building on features first introduced in .NET 2. This means that you can multi-target to .NET 2, .NET 3 and .NET 3.5. .NET 3 and .NET 3.5 brought some fairly fundamental enhancements by introducing new DLLs and uprating some of the existing ones to cope with new language features such as LINQ and Lambda expressions. From the previous paragraph, we can deduce that using .NET 3.5 assemblies from a .NET 2 application is perfectly possible, but the deployment implications means that you have to distribute the DLLs that are appropriate to .NET 3.5. This means that you'll probably end up having to use the .NET 3.5 redistributable.
