What if you need to keep the translational variance using a CNN?

I am building a CNN and I want to maintain translational variance. Most CNNs use pooling and stride which allows for the useful side effect of translational invariance, meaning that if a feature appears in a scene it will be picked up as the same feature. But what if the position of the feature in the scene is information I want to keep/maintain/learn? Do I just have a stride of 1 and don't do pooling? This question is similar: Translational variance in convolutional neural networks
