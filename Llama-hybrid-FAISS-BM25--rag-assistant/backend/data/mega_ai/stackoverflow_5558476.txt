The jQuery Mobile UI-Datepicker, just like any other datepicker widget, simply updates the value placed in the input box. If a user clicks the calendar day for today, the text '04/05/2011' will be placed in the input box. The widget does not do anything more than that. It is your job to take the value in that input box and do what you want with it. Typically, you will wait for a user to submit a form, grab the date they entered, validate it, and store it somewhere. As for where to store it, that is up to you. One good way to store things in a Javascript web app like this is using a cross browser storage library like store.js .
