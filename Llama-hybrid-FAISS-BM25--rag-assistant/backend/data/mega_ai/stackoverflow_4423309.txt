It is a pity, but there is no free extension for such purpose. But if you don't care too much about money, you may use this one: http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/webshopapps/extension/1357/webshopapps-product-matrix-shipping I am not a developer of this extension, but I have used it on one of my projects. It gives you all the functionality available in native table rates + you can define "Shipping Group", that is an attribute on product level. This attribute could help you with grouping of shipping prices per consignment.
