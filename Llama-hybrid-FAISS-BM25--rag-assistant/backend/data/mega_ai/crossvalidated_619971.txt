Symbolic knowledge (First-order Logic) as priors in the Bayesian deep learning

In Bayesian learning, priors play an important role. As per my understanding, most of the priors are statistical, and they used mean and variance value as prior. Then deep learning model uses the dataset and creates posterior distribution. Is it possible to use symbolic knowledge, such as the first-order logic (FOL) rule, as priors? As these rules are not statistical by default. If yes, what could be the possible way to start?
