How to make sense of this PCA plot with logistic regression decision boundary (breast cancer data)?

I have a breast cancer data with 13 features. I instantiate PCA and put the training data through and transform down into 2 dimensions. I get a data that is linearly separable which is interesting to me since I'm doing a binary logistic regression. I'm writing an article and showing the data with a decision boundary is a good image to show that the model worked. I train the logistic regression model on the 2-d data from the PCA. I plot the decision boundary using the intercept and coefficient and it does linearly separate the data. My question is, What does plot of the 2-d data from the PCA and decision boundary mean? What can deduce from that? Jupyter notebook to my work (It's the very last plot) Edit: Plot with the target class Plot with predict on x_pca
