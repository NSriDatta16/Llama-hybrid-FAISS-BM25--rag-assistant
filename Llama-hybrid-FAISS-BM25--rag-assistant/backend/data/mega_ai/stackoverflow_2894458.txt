I can't really make a case that this is better than the enumerate method, but it is less obvious to someone coming from a C perspective, so I thought I'd point it out for completeness: from itertools import izip_longest ' '.join(j + k for j,k in izip_longest(fillvalue='', *([iter(line)]*2))) In Python it's often preferred (or at least encouraged) to do something with generators or list comprehensions like this, instead of relying on enumerate . This is a variation on the grouper method from the itertools module documentation .
