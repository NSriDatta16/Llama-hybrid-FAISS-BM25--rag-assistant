LMER: Why do non-reference group individuals' random intercepts average to the reference group's intercept mean in LMER?

First time using LMER. Really appreciate any help! For df to illustrate my questions, I alter ToothGrowth as follows: data("ToothGrowth") ToothGrowth$len My LMER: model1 My definitions: fixedef[1] is the reference group (OJ) intercept fixedef[2] is the reference group (OJ) slope? fixedef[3] is the difference between OJ intercept and VC intercept? fixedef[4] is the difference between OJ slope and VC slope Question: If my definitions are correct, then why do VC random intercepts random_intercepts[1:3] average to the reference group (OJ) intercept? Should I add fixedef[3] to random_intercepts[1:3] for accurate random intercepts for non-reference group individuals? I've reviewed tons of LMER posts but none asking such a basic question are using exactly my model structure and I'm not sure how their output should differ in order to interpret their results/and their received answers.
