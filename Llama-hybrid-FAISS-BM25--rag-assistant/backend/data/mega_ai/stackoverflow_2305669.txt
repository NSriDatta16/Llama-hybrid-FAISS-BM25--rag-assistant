All About.... Z-Index?

This property make me confuse. well.. i searched in google: What is the z-index? The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order. Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed). Answer Source What is the z-index uses? The order of which the elements overlap one another. For that purpose, you can assign each element a number (z-index). The system is that an element with a higher number overlaps an element with a lower number. Answer Source Ok i understand now , it organize the elements and we can use any number ... the higher z-index number appears on all elements..ok nice. z-index and jquery ..very simple and very nice ...but i noticed from the answers that it depend on position property, so -->...(google).. What is the relation between z-index and position? demo--> >> source Ok ... so z-index and position are couple..must be together.. need more information :: dose it make any conflicts in browsers(IE7,IE8,chrome,...etc)? What are the z-index uses or what can we do with z-index(depending on the Tags)? ...etc? correct me if i understand wrong... Thanks in advance.
