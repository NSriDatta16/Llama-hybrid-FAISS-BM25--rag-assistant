I thought about this a little bit. Here is my answer. Not certain it is correct. I think it is clear that the survival function $$ S(t) = P(T > t) $$ would be estimated incorrectly. In this data setting, $S(0) = 70/320$, which is way off the population estimate (which should be around .0001). Therefore, the hazard function, $\lambda(t) = S'(t)/S(t)$, which is the baseline value for the cox proportional hazards model is wrong, so the covariate effects, which enter in the form $\lambda(t) \cdot e^{X \beta}$, would also be wrong. My only hesitance is that the baseline value is incorrectly estimated in case control analysis in logistic regression also, yet the other coefficients are estimated wrong. Maybe that's the case here too? Edit : Actually, I think this is wrong, because $\lambda(t)$ is never estimated in Cox regression. I'm starting to think it's actually OK to use this approach with prospective case control data and the logic seems very similar to the reason you can use logistic regression.
