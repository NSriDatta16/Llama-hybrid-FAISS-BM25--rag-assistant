ER Diagram (Drawing)

For a relational database that represents the current term enrollment at a large university, what is the ER diagram for a schema that takes into account all the assertions given: • 100 instructors, 200 courses, and 800 students. • An instructor may teach one or more courses in a given term (average is 2.0 courses). • An instructor must direct the research of at least one student (average = 2.5 students). • A course may have none, one, or two prerequisites (average = 1.5 prerequisites). • A course may exist even if no students are currently enrolled. • Each course is taught by exactly one instructor. • The average enrollment in a course is 30 students. • A student must select at least one course per term (average = 4.0 course selections). I have attempted several times to arrive at the answer, but I cannot. All help is valuable to me. I will greatly appreciate an MS Visio diagram (if time can be spared on this question) to help me visualize the solution. NOTE: I am not looking for RTFM responses.
