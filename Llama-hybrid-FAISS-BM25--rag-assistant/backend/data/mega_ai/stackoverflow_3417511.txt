How do I organize a set of actions across multiple models in CodeIgniter?

I have many models, let's say "Model1", "Model2" and "Model3". I have a certain group of actions that usually calls a method from each of these models and executes them in order: $user_info = $this->load->User_model->load( $user_id ); $this->load->Car_model->deleteCarsForUser( $user_info ); $this->load->Message_model->sendMessage( "Car deleted", $user_info ); That's a crude sample, no doubt. But these three steps are called in several places by several controller methods. Is there anyway for me to encapsulate them into one statement somehow?
