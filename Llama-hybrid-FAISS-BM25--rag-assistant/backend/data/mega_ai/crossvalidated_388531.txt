Would machine learning techniques help if the linear and nonlinear relationships is so weak?

I have a cross sectional data set at hand contains four predictors to predict one outcome, I employed bivariate analyses to check whether the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear or not. All the tests I employed (Linear, inverse, quadratic, compound, growth, exponential, logistic) indicate that the relationship is so weak and in some cases doesn't exist at all. The R squares I obtained for each independent variable are smaller than 5%. I already have my data transformed to the natural logarithm form and I don't think that using other transformation forms would change the outcomes, in addition it would be very hard to interpret the outputs if I used other transformation forms. So, in this case could machine learning techniques help? and which technique I should use? I have no prior experience with machine learning models but it seems that it's the only option I have.
