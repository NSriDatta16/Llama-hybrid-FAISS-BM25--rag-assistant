How does Perl's lib pragma work?

I use use lib "./DIR" to grab a library from a folder elsewhere. However, it doesn't seem to work on my server, but it works fine on my local desktop. Any particular reasons? And one more question, does use lib get propagated within several modules? Two situations: Say I make a base class that requires a few libraries, but I know that it needs to be extended and the extended class will need to use another library. Can I put the use lib command in the base class? or will I need to put it in every extending class? Finally, can I just have a use package where package contains a bunch of use lib, will it propagate the use lib statements over to my current module?
