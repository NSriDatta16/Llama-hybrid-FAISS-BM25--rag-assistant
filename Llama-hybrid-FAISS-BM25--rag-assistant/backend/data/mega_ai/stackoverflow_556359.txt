I don't know about anyone else, but we don't get anywhere near 100% coverage. None of our "This should never happen" CATCHes get exercised in our tests (well, sometimes they do, but then the code gets fixed so they don't any more!). I'm afraid I don't worry that there might be a Syntax/Logic error in a never-happen-CATCH
