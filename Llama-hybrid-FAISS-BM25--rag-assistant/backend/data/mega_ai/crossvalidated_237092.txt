Machine learning - Text extraction / pattern identification

I am new to machine learning, There will be set of paragraph and i need to extract postcode from each paragraph. (The postcode may not have the same pattern as they are obtained from different countries) The model should learn from the training data and should predict for the test data. Is there any R package to implement this, if yes, an small example can help. Updated with example: For example consider the below training set with Mdescription and Mcode S.No. Mdescription Mcode 1 "Pansaonic P4725 has 5mp camera" "P4725" 2 "Metallic Plate 06279 is 62*79 cm area" "06279" Here i need a machine learning model to learn to predict Mcode from Mdescription for new test data For implementing this are there any machine learning algorithm . I use R as programming language. Is there any R package available for training the model and using it to make new predictions?
