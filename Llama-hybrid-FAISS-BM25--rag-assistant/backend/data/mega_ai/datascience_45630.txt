A few years ago (2015), Google published a research paper about the effect a specific event has in a time-series model. You can read more details here Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models . In this GitHub page , you can find a detailed example and description of how it works. In short, This R package implements an approach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign? Answering a question like this can be difficult when a randomized experiment is not available. You train your model with pre-event data and after-event data and you get a plot like this one The first panel shows the data and a counterfactual prediction for the post-treatment period. The second panel shows the difference between observed data and counterfactual predictions. This is the pointwise causal effect, as estimated by the model. The third panel adds up the pointwise contributions from the second panel, resulting in a plot of the cumulative effect of the intervention. Running the following summary(impact) , you get a summary and the estimated impact the event had in your time-series data. The same library has been ported to Python as well. For example here
