Create an agent .jar file and load that using the -J option of javaws . -J arguments are passed directly to the target VM and are combined with the vm args in the .jnlp file, so you can load a local agent library in the same process as the application. Example: This agent library contains a premain method that stores the current PID (accessed via JNA ) in a text file. Assuming getpid.jar and jna.jar are in the current directory it can be launched with: javaws -J-javaagent:getpid.jar=pid.txt myapplet.jnlp This will start the applet after writing its PID to the file pid.txt .
