I'm afraid your question is (too me at least) a bit unclear. I get that your are trying drag a UIImage around a scene and drop it in drop-locations. What is unclear is you class hierarchy. I believe that you are going about it in a wrong way. You shouldn't have to subclass UIImage at all. Instead I would urge you to let the UIViewController manage the movement of the images. When you touch down on an image, you also touch down on its parent (containing) view. What you have to to is then reposition the UIImage (all handled by the UIViewController) as you drag the image across the screen. When you let go you check if your finger was inside your drop-zone on touch up.
