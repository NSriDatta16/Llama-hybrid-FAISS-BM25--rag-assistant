This just looks like a way to write interaction terms and polynomials (and is also not specifically related to time series regression). Multiplying out the brackets gives $$RV_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta_0RV_t + \beta_1 RET\cdot RV_t + \beta_2 RV_t^2 + \beta_3 RW + \beta_4 RM $$ Try something like n Output: > lm(y~x1*x2+I(x1^2)) Call: lm(formula = y ~ x1 * x2 + I(x1^2)) Coefficients: (Intercept) x1 x2 I(x1^2) x1:x2 0.08859 0.93306 -0.03421 -0.66431 -0.18097
