Are you using C stringification macro by any chance? If so, you need to change your code to look like this: #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp64 : enable \n This is because stringification process takes all whitespace and converts it into one space. However, C-preprocessor require "newline" to delimit the next line.
