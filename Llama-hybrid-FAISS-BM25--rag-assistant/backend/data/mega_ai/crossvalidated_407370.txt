Question 1 You find the mean and standard deviation of the first column and perform the z-score transform in that column. Then you move to the next column and repeat the process. Question 2 Elaborating on what Emma Jean wrote, consider the goal of machine learning. You want to make predictions about data that you truly haven’t ever seen. Indeed, speech recognition software ought to be able to make predictions about speech by people who haven’t been born yet (once they’re born and learn to talk, of course). So you completely hide the out-of-sample data, since the real application of your model will not get to see the data on which it will be making predictions. Getting back to question 1, if you want to develop a model on 100 observations (per column—each row is one multivariate observation) with 80 as development data and 20 for testing, you only calculate mean and standard deviation of those 80 observations, but you use those means and standard deviations to do the z-score transform of all 100 observations per column.
