None, just keep in mind the general rules for naming identifiers (no _ to begin with etc). Also, if your organization has a coding guideline, it is best to stick to it. Often, when defining your own template class, it becomes messy without typedefs -- so I'd create them there as handy shortcuts. However, if it's really a bunch of classes, I'd rather have it at namespace level.
