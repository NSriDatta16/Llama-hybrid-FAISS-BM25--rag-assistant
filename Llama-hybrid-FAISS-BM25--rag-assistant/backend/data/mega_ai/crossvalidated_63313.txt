How to combine multiple imputed datasets?

I need a single imputed dataset (e.g. to create a country group dummy from the imputed country per capita income data). R offers packages package for creating multiple imputed data (e.g. Amelia) and combining results from multiple datasets (as in MItools). My concern is if I can average all the imputed data to obtain a single dataset. If so, how can I do it in R?
