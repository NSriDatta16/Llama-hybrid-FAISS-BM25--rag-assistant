How to convert a hex value into a color name

Is there an algorithm (I've searched and haven't come up with much) that, given a hex value, is capable of returning the color name? It doesn't have to be anything too specific, any shade of blue coming back as just 'blue' is fine. Or short of that, is there a large list somewhere that consists of hex values and their corresponding color family. I've found lists, but they only seem to be a couple hundred colors long. I saw this post , but the solution there seems to only break the color down into three regions. EDIT I altered the RGB text file so that each color would only fall into the following color ranges: white grey magenta brown black blue green turquoise yellow orange red
