Updating report parameters based on parameter selection? (SSRS)

I've created a report in SSRS with two report parameters. I'd like the second to update it's values based on the selection in the first. The first is a list of sales agents, and the second is a list of distributors. Each agent can have many distributors. So if the report user selects an agent, I'd like only their distributors to show in list for the second parameters. Obviously the parameter values will come from a query, but I don't know how to make it rebind the list once they select an agent.
