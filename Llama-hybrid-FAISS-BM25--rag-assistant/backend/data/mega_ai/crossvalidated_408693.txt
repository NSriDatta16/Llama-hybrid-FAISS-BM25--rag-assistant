Finding the mode of the posterior distribution

I have the following hierachical bayesian model - $\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{c},\sigma^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{c},\sigma^2)$ $\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{c}_1,\sigma^2_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{c}_1,\sigma^2_2)$ $\sigma^2 \sim \text{InvGamma}(\alpha, \beta)$ . Here, $\mathbf{x}$ is a data sample. $\alpha$ , $\beta$ , $c_1$ and $\sigma_2^2$ are fixed known values. $\text{InvGamma}(\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{N}(\cdot)$ are inverse gamma and normal distributions respectively. The goal is to find the mode of the posterior distribution $p(\mathbf{c},\sigma^2|\mathbf{x})$ . The method that I tried is Gibbs sampling to generate samples of $(\mathbf{c},\sigma^2)$ and then finding the mode of these samples using mean-shift algorithm. However, the method is computationally demanding and I wanted to know any alternative approaches to obtain the posterior mode efficiently.
