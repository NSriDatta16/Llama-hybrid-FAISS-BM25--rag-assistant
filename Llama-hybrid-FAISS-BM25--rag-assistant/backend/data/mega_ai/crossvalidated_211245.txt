Dropping the normalization constant in Bayesian inference

Could anyone please explain to me (or provide a situation) where one would drop the normalising constant (or marginal probability term) from Bayes rule when performing Bayesian Inference? New to Bayesian theory so any help appreciated. Thanks in advance.
