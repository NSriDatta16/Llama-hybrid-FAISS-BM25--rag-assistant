Move sprite away from Touch? Cocos2d

Hey everyone, I'm new to cocos2d and Objective-C so I apologize if there is a simple solution. I am working on some code for a game I am developing. In this game I have a sprite on screen, and I would like this sprite to move opposite of the touch location. Example: Picture Example So far my code looks like this: -(void) ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //Determine location of the tap/touch CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; touchLocation = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL: touchLocation]; touchLocation = [self convertToNodeSpace:touchLocation]; I add my sprite to the scene in the init method like so: CGSize screenSize = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] winSize]; Ball* ball = [Ball ball]; ball.position = CGPointMake(ball.contentSize.width / 2, screenSize.height / 2); [self addChild:ball z:2]; I would like it so that wherever I touch on the screen, the sprite will move 20pixels opposite of that touch location. So if I touch to the left of the sprite, the sprite moves right, if I touch to the top, the sprite will move down..etc. Thanks for the help!
