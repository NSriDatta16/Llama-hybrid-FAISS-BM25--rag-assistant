Android ListView Selection When Image is Background

I have set an Android List which has image for background. Looks great, but when I select an item in the ItemList it covers up the picture in back with a default color. I would like to do something more consistent with the background to highlight the selection, like perhaps leave it transparent, but highlight border of the list item row? How could I do this or something else that fits better with an image. Also I notice dragging down on the list turned several of them black all at once. What can be done about this.
