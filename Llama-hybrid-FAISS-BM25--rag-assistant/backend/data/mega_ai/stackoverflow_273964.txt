How to change background-color on text links on hover but not image links

I have a CSS rule like this: a:hover { background-color: #fff; } But this results in a bad-looking gap at the bottom on image links, and what's even worse, if I have transparent images, the link's background color can be seen through the image. I have stumbled upon this problem many times before, but I always solved it using the quick-and-dirty approach of assigning a class to image links: a.imagelink:hover { background-color: transparent; } Today I was looking for a more elegant solution to this problem when I stumbled upon this . Basically what it suggests is using display: block , and this really solves the problem for non-transparent images. However, it results in another problem: now the link is as wide as the paragraph, although the image is not. Is there a nice way to solve this problem, or do I have to use the dirty approach again? Thanks,
