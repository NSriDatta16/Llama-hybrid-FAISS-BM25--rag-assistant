Better garbage collection: compacting at minimum (to eliminate memory fragmentation problems experienced today), ideally less CPU intensive at doing the collection itself (to reduce the "my game frame rates suck" complaints) JIT, as you cite Enough documentation that, when coupled with an NDK, somebody sufficiently crazy could compile Dalvik bytecode to native code for an AOT compilation option Make it separable from Android itself, such that other projects might experiment with it and community contributions might arrive in greater quantity and at a faster clip I'm sure I could come up other ideas if you need them.
