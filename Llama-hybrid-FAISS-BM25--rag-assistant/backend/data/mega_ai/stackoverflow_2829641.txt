According to this documentation there is no official support: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts - under "Author Parameters" heading. However, digging into the source code reveals otherwise: http://wordpress.taragana.net/nav.html?wp-includes/classes.php.html#query_posts . $author_array = preg_split('/[,\s]+/', $q['author']); for ($i = 1; $i To see if your comma-separated list is being used correctly I would go ahead and start throwing debug lines into the WP_Query::get_posts() function. For example, what is the final value of $whichauthor ?
