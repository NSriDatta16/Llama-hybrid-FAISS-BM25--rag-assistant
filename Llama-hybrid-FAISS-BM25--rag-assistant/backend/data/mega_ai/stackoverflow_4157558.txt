How can we install Security patches in Magento?

I got a question from my client can you update the Magento site with the security patches? . Can you guys please let me know that is there any module to install security patches or there are set of steps we have to implement one by one there on magento application. In either case, it will be really a great favor if you can specify the module name or steps. Thanks Pukhraj
