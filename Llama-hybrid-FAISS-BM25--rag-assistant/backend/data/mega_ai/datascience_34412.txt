Work experience in Data Science: Couple hours with A-level student

Our company has accepted an A-level student (18-year old, just before uni) for some work experience. The student will be with me for a couple of hours. I do data analysis and I'm quite busy at the moment. Not sure what I can show him in such a short time, and I would rather do it hands-on. Any suggestion? Some online resources?
