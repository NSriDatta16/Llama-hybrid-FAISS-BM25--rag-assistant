In SQL Server , there is BIT datatype. You can store 0 or 1 there, compare the values but not run MIN or MAX . In Oracle , you just use NUMBER or CHAR(1) . In MySQL and PostgreSQL any datatype is implicitly convertible to BOOLEAN . Both systems support BOOLEAN datatype which you can use as is, without the operators, in the WHERE or ON clauses: SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE col1 , which is impossible in SQL Server and Oracle (you need to have some kind or a predicate there). In MySQL , BOOLEAN is a synonym for TINYINT(1) . In PostgreSQL too (in terms of storage), but logically, it's not implicitly convertible to any other type.
