Finding the parameters of bimodal and trimodal univariate distribution with MATLAB

I am rather new to Matlab and never had a lot to do with statistics, so I apologize already for possibly being ignorant of quite a bit of important knowledge. It also would be nice if you could answer as simple as possible. Thanks ☺ My question is about finding the parameters of a univariate distribution. I get two sets of data, which I want to analyze automatically. The first set is bimodal, with the two distributions generally being separated completely. The second set has at least three modes. My data is about the fiber directions in a carbon composite. So if I have 2 general directions I get the bimodal distribution, but if I have 3, I get two high peaks and usually one or two smaller ones (the peak at 0° is wrong data I'm working on eliminating). I already played around a bit with mle, and got it to work for the bimodal case, but it takes ages, even when given good starting values. Right now I am splitting the bimodal in two and fit two separate normal distributions, but I would like to find a more elegant way. As for the 3-fiber case, I’m still without any working idea. I really appreciate any help with this :) The distributions
