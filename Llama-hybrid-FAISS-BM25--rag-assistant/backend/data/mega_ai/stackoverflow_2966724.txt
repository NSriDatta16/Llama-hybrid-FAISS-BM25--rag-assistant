Prevent DataGridDragDropTarget from Showing "Drag Shadow"

Is it possible to prevent the Silverlight Toolkit DataGridDragDropTarget from starting a drag-action? What I whant is to use one DataGrid only as DragSource and another one only as DropTarget. And the DropTarget-only-DataGrid should not show this "StartDragShadow" when pressing and moving the mouse over an item.
