Which machine learning problem is this?

I am not able to figure out what kind of machine learning is this: Training set: consists of sentences with object labels for object phrases Example: "This is a black chair. It is next to a large bed." Phrases 'This', 'black chair', 'it' were annotated with the label "chair" and phrase 'large bed' was annotated with the label 'bed' . There are 18 available labels that can be assigned. For an unannotated sentence, I want to predict the labels for each phrase in the sentence. For example: There is a study table in the corner of the room, behind it is a small chair. I would like the model to predict a label (available 18 labels) for each phrase that represents an object in the above sentence. Expected output: 'study table', 'it' -----> label 'table' 'small chair' -----------> label 'chair' Is this a classification, regression, or a different kind of problem?
