"Customer paid within X days" is presumably your binary response variable; call it R. However, what you want is a "propensity to pay score"; call it S; which corresponds to the probability that R = 1. So one formulation is, for every customer C, S = P(R=1|C). I.e. your propensity score is just the probability that the customer pays within X days. The problem then becomes, how to estimate P(R=1|C). There are lots of confounding factors. Are the relationships between your factors of interest and your response variable linear? Is willingness to pay between customers correlated? Etc. Since you have a binary response variable and probably mixed numeric/categoric data, I'd suggest starting out with XGBoost. It's easy to use, well documented and state of the art. You could also try GLM (e.g. logit or probit regression) but it'll almost always perform worse.
