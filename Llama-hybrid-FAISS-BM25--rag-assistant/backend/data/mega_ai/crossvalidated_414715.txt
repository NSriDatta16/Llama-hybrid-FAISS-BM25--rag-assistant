How to encode a nominal categorical variable? In part that will depend on which kind of model/algorithm you will use later, but the standard advice can be found here Where to find a guide to encoding categorical features? . If you have a categorical variable with many levels, see here Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? . If you are using a random forest, it might well be that the program will take care of the encoding, or have special requirements as to how you give it the variables. More ideas here: Random Forest Regression with sparse data in Python If some level occurs only once in the dataset, it might be a good idea to use regularization. Maybe that level occurs later in production while using the model!
