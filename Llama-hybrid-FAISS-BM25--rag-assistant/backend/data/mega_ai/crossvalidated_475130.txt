No apparent relation between two time series data

I have two time series data and I want to understand relationship between them for my a data science project that I am currently working on. The time series plots are given below : The plot of 1-differenced "daily-frequency" data looks like: The scatterplot of the two variables(in log-scale) looks like this - indicating, there is no correlation between the two variables. I even built a cross-correlation plot which looks like - which has the value ~0.4 at lag 0! I don't know how to analyze the data further to dig out possible relationships between the variables. I wish to build more features using "daily frequency" data with "Confirmed" being the response variable, but the graphs don't show any relationship between the two variables. Is there any transformation that can help visualize the relationship better ?
