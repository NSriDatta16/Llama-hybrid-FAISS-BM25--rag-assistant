Jeff Atwood talks about this in great detail: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids.html Guid Pros: Unique across every table, every database, every server Allows easy merging of records from different databases Allows easy distribution of databases across multiple servers You can generate IDs anywhere, instead of having to roundtrip to the database Most replication scenarios require GUID columns anyway Guid Cons: It is a whopping 4 times larger than the traditional 4-byte index value; this can have serious performance and storage implications if you're not careful Cumbersome to debug (where userid='{BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10}') The generated GUIDs should be partially sequential for best performance (eg, newsequentialid() on SQL 2005) and to enable use of clustered indexes
