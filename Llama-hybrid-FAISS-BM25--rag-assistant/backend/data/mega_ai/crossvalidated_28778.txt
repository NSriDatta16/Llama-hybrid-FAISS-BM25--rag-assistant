ROC curves are not informative in 99% of the cases I've seen over the past few years. They seem to be thought of as obligatory by many statisticians and even more machine learning practitioners. And make sure your problem is really a classification problem and not a risk estimation problem. At the heart of problems with ROC curves is that they invite users to use cutpoints for continuous variables, and they use backwards probabilities, i.e., probabilities of events that are in reverse time order (sensitivity and specificity). ROC curves cannot be used to find optimum tradeoffs except in very special cases where users of a decision rule abdicate their loss (cost; utility) function to the analyst.
