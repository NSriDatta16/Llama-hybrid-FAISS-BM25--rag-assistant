A mixed model is not indicated here, because you have only 3 individuals, so we would be asking the software to estimate a variance for a normally distributed variable (since random effects are assumed to be normally distributed) from only 3 observations of it. A more appropriate model would be: temperature ~ age + id This will take account of the multiple measures within id Edit: Gordon is right - see comment below - this approach will not work. id and age are collinear so you can't put them in the same model and instead you will need to take the average temperature for each id
