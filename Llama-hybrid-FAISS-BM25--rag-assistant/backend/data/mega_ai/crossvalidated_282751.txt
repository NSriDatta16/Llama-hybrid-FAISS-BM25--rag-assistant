I found the term I was looking for and that helped the literature search a lot. The correct term is Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) . There are multiple ways to perform MIL. Basically, either define your own loss function that calculates loss across "bags of instances", or simply combine the predictions that belong to a bag. The latter can be done by averaging or weighting confident predictions. There are other more intricate solutions as well, but I have not looked too deep into it. Some papers on the subject: Viola, Paul, John C. Platt, and Cha Zhang. "Multiple instance boosting for object detection." NIPS. Vol. 2. 2005. Xu, Xin, and Eibe Frank. "Logistic regression and boosting for labeled bags of instances." Pacific-Asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2004. Singh, Diveesh, and Pedro Garzon. "Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning to Perform Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification." Babenko, Boris, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Serge Belongie. "Visual tracking with online multiple instance learning." Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2009. Hopefully this answer will help furture people with the same problem as I.
