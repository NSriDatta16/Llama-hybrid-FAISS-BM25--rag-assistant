The idea of adding the InternalsVisibleTo attribute is a good one, but I think that the problem is that the Xml serialization code only looks for the public types in the assembly. To my knowledge there is no way to make XmlSerializer serialize or deserialize internal types, and you will have to either declare the types as public or write your own serialization code. Moreover, the XmlSerializer class documentation explicitly states that only public properties of the object will be serialized: "XML serialization is the process of converting an object's public properties and fields to a serial format (in this case, XML) for storage or transport", so it really looks like it's a design decision.
