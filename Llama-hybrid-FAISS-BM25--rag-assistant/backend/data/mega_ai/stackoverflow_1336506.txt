One tricky part is the fact that this login page sets a bunch of session cookies and appends some unique query string parameters for your session. Presumably, you'll need to retrieve good values from the server for each session you create. When you land on https://ssl.aukro.cz/enter_login.php , you get a 302 Found (which in practice is used for redirects). The full request looks like this: Date Wed, 26 Aug 2009 17:50:05 GMT Server Apache Vary Accept-Encoding Set-Cookie ws2=acda7c76687f; expires=Wed, 26-Aug-2009 18:20:05 GMT; path=/; domain=.aukro.cz Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma no-cache Location https://ssl.aukro.cz/enter_login.php?session=NmQ2YQFRBVABVgFRVFQAXVRXVFZXWlcHBVRVWAcGUF0OUVJWVVRRXFVUBFFTAAcGAFxUA1NSY2JkZQ%3D%3D&global_login_hash=e16bd60f566a0ae3752997bf21844c4ec2bd0d22&session_login_hash=fecd7825582b6d038d288f67c368090aa369c85d&url=OTFhY1hFRkYDHk4UR0YcV0xaEwweUkgZXEMTDEIeU1VaVBIQb1RARFZDTxNYQQ1YVm4FCkIMAzAxMjY%3D Content-Encoding gzip Content-Length 26 Keep-Alive timeout=2, max=9999 Connection Keep-Alive Content-Type text/html; charset=UTF-8 You'll need to grab the URL location and the cookie it sets ("ws2"). Then you'll need to drop onto that redirect URL you grabbed, and get the rest of the cookies it sets, which are ws2 , stsd_refr , and qeppo_login . You then need to fill in the POST body with the form elements as mentioned above and in the links you provided. Not knowing anything about this site you're trying to log into, I'd venture a guess that if you don't get good session variables and cookies and include them for each of your logical requests, your login attempts may fail. Long story short, just use Fiddler or Firebug to capture what a login session looks like, and mimic it using the techniques you've already seen.
