Let $\{X_t\}$ and $\{Y_t\}$ be two stochastic processes. Given, $\rho \equiv \frac{Cov(\Delta X_t,\Delta Y_t)}{\sqrt{Var(\Delta X_t)Var(\Delta Y_t)}} \neq 0$ . $\implies Cov((X_t - X_{t-1}),(Y_t-Y_{t-1})) = Cov(X_t,Y_t)+Cov(X_{t-1},Y_{t-1})-Cov(X_t,Y_{t-1})-Cov(X_{t-1},Y_t) \neq 0$ This means that not all, $Cov(X_t,Y_t), Cov(X_{t-1},Y_{t-1}), Cov(X_t,Y_{t-1}), Cov(X_{t-1},Y_t)$ can simultaneously be zero. Therefore, for difference series to be correlated, there should be a contemporaneous correlation or at least at first lag or both. This is also fairly intuitive, I guess - based on which you predicted the answer to No. Side note 1: In your question you talked about $X$ and $Y$ as random variables and then talked about time series, $x_t$ and $y_t$ . Please keep in mind that a time series may be a series of random variables (i.e., a stochastic process) not just observations coming from a single random variable. That's why we generally say two time series (or stochastic processes) are correlated (not random variables) in context of co-integration. Side Note 2: "...a foundation in cointegration studies, and the Engel-Granger approach, where if a long-run relationship between X and Y exists, there is also a short term relationship." Short-term relationship is not mandatory. What cointegration requires is that if two series, say $\{X_t\}$ and $\{Y_t\}$ , are $I(1)$ , but the regression $y_t=\beta x_t +\epsilon_t$ yields $\hat{\epsilon_t}$ such that $\hat{\epsilon_t}$ is stationary, then $\{X_t\}$ and $\{Y_t\}$ are cointegrated. Since IID $\subset$ Stationarity, $\epsilon_t$ might as well as IID. This would mean that while there is a long-term relationship, there is no short-term relationship between $y_t$ and $x_t$ (in fact, there would be no need to talk about "long" and "short" term relationship in such a case). Hope this helps.
