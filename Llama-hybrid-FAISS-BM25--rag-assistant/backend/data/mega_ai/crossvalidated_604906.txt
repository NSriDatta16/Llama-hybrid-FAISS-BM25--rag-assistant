How do I extract the extrapolation prediction when setting the gamma argument in the specaccum function?

I am trying to use the specaccum function from the R vegan package to develop species accumulation curves. However, I am trying to set the gamma argument to return the extrapolated number of species, but I do not know how to extract the results. Do I have to use specpool function separately? Here is what I am attempting: library(vegan) data(BCI) specaccum(comm = BCI, method = "random", gamma = "chao")
