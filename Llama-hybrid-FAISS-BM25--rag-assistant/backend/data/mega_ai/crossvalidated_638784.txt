Can ANOVAs or Student tests be conducted on any summary statistic at the individual level?

I am wondering if ANOVAs or Student tests can be performed on any summary statistic of performance at the individual level without any effect on type 1 and type 2 error. For example, consider a simple experimental design with a categorical independent variable and a continuous dependent variable. For instance, human participants either drink an alcoholic or a non-alcoholic beverage, and then perform 100 trials of a detection task. The variable of interest is the response time (RT) in each trial. Researchers generally compute the mean RT for each subject, and run an ANOVA or a Student test on these individual means. Would it possible to instead compute the median RT for each subject, and run an ANOVA or a Student test on these individual medians? I think this alternative approach is valid so long as assumptions of the test are satisfied, but maybe I am missing something.
