I heard a fairly substantial rumor that the data storage format used by sharepoint and by team foundation server, backed by SQL, was originally intended to replace the windows file system in windows 7. If this was the plan, then windows would have gained / (will someday?) gain a transactional data store for storing lists of data. This data storage method would probably be superior in every way to the registry. Given that, it's hardly suprising to see Microsoft minimize the use of the registry as they move forward with the .net framework.
