Most server processes grow as they run, until they reach some equilibrium size. This doesn't mean they have a memory leak - for example a server can allocate memory to long-running tasks which only gets freed hours later. And yes, leak detection tools can be fooled, giving both false positive and false negative results. Edit: Just had another look at your code - you have undefined behaviour. When you say: delete Sys_T; you are deleting something not allocated by you with new. You must not do that. The result of localtime is in thread local storage (probably) and is managed by the library, not by you. Also, though not an error as such, why are you saying: int messagelength=strlen(result.c_str()); when you could simply use result.size()
