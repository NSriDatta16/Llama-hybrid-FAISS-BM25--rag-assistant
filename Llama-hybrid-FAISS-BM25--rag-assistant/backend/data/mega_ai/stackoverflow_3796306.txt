There are two directories that are writeable: ./tmp and ./log (under your application root). If you wish to drop a file temporarily for the duration of the request, you can write to a filename like #{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp/myfile_#{Process.pid} . There is no guarantee that this file will be there on subsequent requests (although it might be), so this should not be used for any kind of permanent storage. http://docs.heroku.com/constraints
