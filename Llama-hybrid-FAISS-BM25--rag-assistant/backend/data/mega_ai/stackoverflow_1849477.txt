Setting multiple literals that contain the same text in ASP.NET

I have instances where I need to dynamically load 5-10 literals with the same text value. It seems like there has to be a more elegant way of doing it than setting the TEXT property of all the controls to the same value. Any methods out there that I'm not aware of? I thought about setting a protected property on my webform, and then using inline code on my aspx page. Is that a good approach? Edit: I should add that I also want to handle the situation where a designer could simply add another place to load dynamically to the aspx file on the web server without having to do another rollout.
