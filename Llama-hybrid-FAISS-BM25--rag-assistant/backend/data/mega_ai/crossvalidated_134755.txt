This is not machine learning. The tag should be logistic regression and maximum likelihood. I've corrected this. It is traditional to have $Y=[0,1]$ in formulating the likelihood function. But if you want to show that you can get the same result with any coding, choose character values instead of numeric to stay general, e.g., $Y=[A,B]$. Then write out the associated functions, avoiding software code until the very end.
