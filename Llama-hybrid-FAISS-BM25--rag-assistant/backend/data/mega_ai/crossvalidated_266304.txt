In Factor Analysis (or in PCA), what does it mean a factor loading greater than 1?

I've just run a FA using a oblique rotation (promax) and an item yielded a factor loading of 1.041 on one factor, (and factor loadings of -.131, -.119 and .065 on the other factors using pattern matrix). And I'm not sure of what it means, I've thought that it could be only between -1 and 1. Is it due to oblique rotation? And can loading exceed 1 with orthogonal factors?
