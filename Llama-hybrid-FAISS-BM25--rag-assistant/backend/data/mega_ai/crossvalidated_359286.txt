What you are really talking about here is null hypothesis testing, although you express it in the form of a confidence interval. So, my answer will be in those terms. First thing: If you truly measured your parameters in the population, then you don't use confidence intervals or null hypothesis testing. The difference between your populations is exactly what you measured. However, assuming you meant you measured things in a sample from each population, then the reason Statement 1 and Statement 2 are not the same is that in Statement 1 you are talking about whether you can reject the null hypothesis. This depends on $\alpha$, which is the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null is, in fact, true). In Statement 2 you are talking about the Power of a statistical test. This depends on $\beta$, which is the probability of making a Type II error (the probability of failing to reject the null when in fact the null is false). Suppose you have the null hypothesis $H_0: \Delta = 0$. If you get observed data where $p if $\Delta$ equals 0, then the probability of our data is small (equal to p). (If you want to know what the actual probability of the truth of the null hypothesis is, then you are going to need to move into the world of Bayesian statistics). Power is defined as $1-\beta$. It is the conditional probability that you will reject your null hypothesis if the null hypothesis is, in fact, false. Power analysis depends on four factors: 1) The effect size 2) The $\alpha$-level 3) The power level you want ($1-\beta$) 4) The sample size If you specify any 3 of these factors, you can calculate the fourth. So, if you want to know whether your test is powerful enough to detect a small effect size, you would enter the effect size, the sample size, and the $\alpha$, and you can calculate the probability that your test will detect that size effect. A common use of power analysis is to determine sample size. In this case, you enter the $\alpha$, the effect size you want to be able to detect, and the probability you want to have to be able to detect that effect size. This will tell you what size sample you need. G*Power is a free program that will allow you to do these analyses. There are lots of books, articles, and websites that cover the basics of power analysis.
