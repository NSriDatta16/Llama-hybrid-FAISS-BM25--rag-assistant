lmer: standardized regression coefficients

I have analyzed some data (the exact nature of which, I assume, is irrelevant for this question) using linear mixed effects models with the lmer() function from lme4. There has been at least one question about standardized regression coefficients previously , in which, obviously, there has been the recommendation to use the scale() function in order to obtain standardized predictors and outcome variables before entering these into a model. Furthermore, in a comment on an answer, @crash posted a link to an email by Ben Bolker, in which the latter provided a function, applying lm.beta() to "lmer-land". The function, as provided there, looks like this: lm.beta.lmer Yet, the "mod at X" and "mod at y" parts are hyperlinked and appear not to resemble executable R code. Specifically, when trying to define this function, R outputs Error: unexpected symbol in: "b so apparently R does not like the spaces. I am interested in how I would need to change the code of lm.beta.lmer() in order to successfully apply this to my lmer models, but my nooby R skills forbid me to do so. If anyone provided a useful answer to this, I would deeply appreciate this. Cheers, bunsen EDIT Thanks @Wolfgang, I was not aware of this. However, having changed the abovementioned code accordingly, i.e. writing mod@X and mod@y, I get the following output when applying the function to a model: >lm.beta.lmer(mod) Error in apply(mod@X[, -1], 2, sd) : no slot of name "X" for this object of class "lmerMod" Apparently, the code fails to access the Field X in slot pp of the lmerMod object (of which the first column is labelled "(Intercept)", so I assume it is the one that should be deleted). Since I get this error, I do not know, whether the Field y of slot resp of this object will be accessed, but I guess not. I have attempted various ways of changing the code in order to make it access the X and y fields of the respective slots, but failed. Which part am I doing incorrectly, or rather (since I do not tell the ways I've tried): which is a possible way to access these fields? I have noticed, that most likely I will be faster using the scale() function, but I am eager to learn a solution to my question. Thanks again!
