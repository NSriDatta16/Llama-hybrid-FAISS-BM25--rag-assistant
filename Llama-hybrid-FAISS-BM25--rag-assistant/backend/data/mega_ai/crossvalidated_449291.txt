I am not aware of specific work in this direction. You will likely need to "roll your own" approach. I would indeed use a NegBin distribution, with a time-varying mean for each series (whether you want to model this separately for each series, or connect the series in modeling via a hierarchical, panel or other approach is a separate question). In terms of the variance, you could use a separate variance for each time series, which is fixed for that series. That would indeed give intermittent behavior for low volume series, and "normal-like" behavior for high volume ones (still discrete, though). Each series would have a modeled spread appropriate to its history. I did something like this ( Kolassa, 2016, IJF ). More exotically, you would also model a time-varying variance for each series. For instance, variance is often higher in high season than in low (although this could already be captured by modeling overdispersion instead of variance itself, i.e., modeling the variance as a multiple of the mean, and treating this multiple as constant over time). You could do some thing like first modeling the mean using a NegBin time series, then use GARCH or similar for residuals. Or potentially use a state space framework that might allow you to model states for both mean and variance. Unfortunately, I do not know of any published work in this direction.
