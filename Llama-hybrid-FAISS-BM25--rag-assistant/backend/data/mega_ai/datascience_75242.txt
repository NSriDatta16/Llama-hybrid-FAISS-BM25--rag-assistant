Correct way to use k-means cluster- python-scikit-learn

I am working with Python, pandas and scikit-learn. I have a dataset where I have the number of sales per shop. I have the date and the hour of this sales and I want to forecast the sales for the next month. I have tried different approaches trying to forecast per individual shops, using all the data and different things but with a high error using ARIMA models. Then I realised that may be if I train a k-means cluster I can automatically group the shops that are similar between them and then train an ARIMA model to predict per each groups that my cluster has assing. The way I have done that is why I am posting this question, because I don't know if I have though it in a correct way. I have grouped per shop the sales and then I have calculated the average and the standard deviation per each shop. I have trained a k-means clustering with 4 clusters, to group the shops that has similar average and standard deviation. Do you think that is correct this procedure of grouping each shop calculate the the average and standard deviation per each one and group them in 4 clusters?. The reason for 4 clusters is for group the shops that has similar average and similar standard deviation like divide the data in quartiles.
