Convolution operator yields negative index of matrix

When I read about convolutional neural network from the internet, like this one , mostly I found that discrete convolution operator is defined as follow: $$C=I*F$$ $$C(x,y)={\sum_{a=0}^{k-1} }{\sum_{b=0}^{k-1}}I(x-a,y-b)F(a,b)$$ Where the size of $F$ is $k\times k$, Suppose that the size of F is $3\times 3$ and size of $I$ is $9\times 9$, then $C(1,1)=\dots +F(2,2)I(1-2,1-2)+\dots$ that is does not make sense when $I$ has negative index, how do I compute matrix $C$ ? does we change the way the matrix indexed?
