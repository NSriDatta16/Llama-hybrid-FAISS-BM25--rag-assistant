c# What is the different between static class and non-static (I am talking about the class itself not the field)

The syntax maybe wrong public static class Storage { public static string filePath { get; set; } } And public class Storage { private void Storage () {}; public static string filePath { get; set; } } I got this from an example on the internet. what is the use of the second one?
