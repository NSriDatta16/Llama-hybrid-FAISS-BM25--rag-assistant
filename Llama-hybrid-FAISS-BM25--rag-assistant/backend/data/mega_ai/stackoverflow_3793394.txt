You must be using VS2010. Pretty important that you mention this in your questions. Yes, I repro this in that edition. The IntelliSense parser was completely rewritten, squiggles support was one of its added features. There is a pretty basic issue with the File Type property as shown in the Properties window for a .c file. Only the "C/C++ Code" type is available. I however think it not unlikely that the parser can only parse C++ code. There's also a problem with C++/CLI source code files, there's no IntelliSense support at all for them. Hopefully it is on the to-do list. Remind them about it by filing a feedback report at connect.microsoft.com, they pay attention to it to set priorities.
