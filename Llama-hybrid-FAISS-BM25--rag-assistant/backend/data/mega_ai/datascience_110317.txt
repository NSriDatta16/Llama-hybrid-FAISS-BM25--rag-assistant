It is fine to leave the "from/to_address" in the model. It would be useful to choose an algorithm that learns to weight the feature appropriately. The current hexadecimal format would be encoded as a string in most machine learning algorithms. It might be useful to use feature hashing to encoding it into numerical values that are amenable to most machine learning algorithms.
