I've been using Assembla for a small team and loving it. The web interface is very elegant, and it gives me power and simplicity at the same time. My favorite feature is the strong ticketing system which allows me to create tickets on the web, assign them to developers, associate them with other tickets, estimate the time it takes to close the ticket, and aggregate those times graphically. It really shines, though, with its version control and ticket integration. Being able to specify that this commit is related to ticket #45, fixes bug #78, and closes ticket #32 is very nice. They offer version control hosting for multiple version control systems - including SVN and GIT. They offer free and paid packages. For more information, check out their usage videos here . Oh, and do let us know what you decide and why :)
