I think you are referring to a king of image auto captioning, and why not sentence alignement ! I suggest you to go over the paper Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions which is one of the references today (by M. Karpathy). The first step is about recognizing objects in an image and align sentences to them (done with R-CNN and BRNN) and the second is about generating new captions (CNN + RNN) Even though it may be quite difficult to deeply go through, there is some code available on GitHub and it has been remade by a a lot of people with various implementations. Here is the summary. Good luck !
