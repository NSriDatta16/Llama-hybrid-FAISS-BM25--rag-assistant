Google Maps and GMapCatcher... File/Directory Naming System

Does anyone have any ideas as to how GMapCatcher knows which folders/directories to store the tiles as? I know it is some combination of x,y, and zoom levels, but I really don't see how they are determining which folders the tiles get stored in, and was wandering if anyone had any insight as to how they determine what tiles to retrieve?
