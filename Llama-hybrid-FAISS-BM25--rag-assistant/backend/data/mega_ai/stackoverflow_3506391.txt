Maven-surefire-plugin and forked mode

So I have some classes that rely on a jar file that has native methods in them. I am running into issues when mocking the objects in this jar file...so I have found a solution that works. Using forkedmode pertest seems to fix this issue. However, there are 5 files affected by needing to be run in forkedmode...there are 130 other tests that do not need forking, and the build time with cobertura and everything is VERY slow as it is forking for every test in that pom... So my question is...is there a way to specify which classes you want to run in forkedmode and run everything else normally?
