Identifying the value of parameters of the prior distribution. Arbitrarily?

Referring to this Question , let's not use Jeffrey's prior for $\theta$ but use $Gamma(\alpha,\beta)$ as the conjugate prior for $\theta$ . Under quadratic loss function, the bayes estimator for $\theta$ is $$ \tilde{\theta}_{Bayes}=\frac{\beta(\alpha+\sum_{i=1}^{n} {x_i})}{1+n\beta}. $$ As opposed to the estimator in the Question , this Bayes estimator depends on the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . If I were to further estimate $(\alpha,\beta)$ , this will lead to hierarchical Bayesian, right? I am not interested yet in hierarchical Bayesian. Ultimately, my question is for simulation study, say after generating data from Poisson distribution, I would like to see if $\tilde{\theta}_{Bayes}$ perform adequately with comparison to $\hat{\theta}_{mle}$ , should I arbitrarily choose several pair values of $(\alpha,\beta)$ and compares the $\tilde{\theta}_{Bayes}$ with true $\theta$ ?
