How about 'hacking' this way. Have a dummy hidden textbox or hidden field control within the UpdatePanel. Perform a client-side copy of the actual textbox value to the hidden control when the button is clicked. Not elegant but should work. Additional Info: If the trigger is set as AsyncPostBack: The postback actually gets the values of all the controls outside the UpdatePanel. So my hack is not required at all.
