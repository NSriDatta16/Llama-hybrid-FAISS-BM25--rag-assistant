I think Sutton and Barto is still the standard. There are a lot of slide decks and notes from AI classes online, but they typically don't go into too much detail. Sutton and Barto is a little old, but they are preparing a 2nd edition of their textbook. A draft, dated January 2018, is available here ; it's linked from Sutton's webpage , which also has the full text of the first edition. I would look at this before tackling Kochenderfer et al.'s Decision Making Under Uncertainty . That book has some interesting applications (mostly in aviation) but it moves quickly and bounces around a lot. Szepesv√°ri's Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning is also good, but pithy--it takes about twenty pages to get to $\textrm{TD(}\lambda\textrm{)}$, vs. seven chapers and 150 pages in the newer Sutton and Barto. Other than that, you might try diving into some papers--the reinforcement learning stuff tends to be pretty accessible.
