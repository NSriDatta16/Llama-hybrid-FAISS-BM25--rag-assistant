What does "principled" mean, as in "principled Bayesian analysis"?

I am generally curious what the term "principled" means. It was used in the title of an unpublished manuscript, "Combining Computer Models in a Principled Bayesian Analysis". In addition, Zhang 2004 says "There are several advantages to a principled Bayesian analysis" here: Otherwise, I find relatively few google hits for the phrase. What does the term "principled" mean in this context? Zhang, 2004 Causal Inference with Instrumental Variables. Ch. 8 in Gelman and Meng, Applied Bayesian Modeling and Causal Inference from Incomplete-Data Perspectives. Wiley.
