As Marc said, third party tools and (serverside) webcontrols cannot be used. So slapping something together quickly by dragging and dropping a few controls on a form (like a grid and a dataaccess control) is no longer an option. But with the codegeneration etc. you can still make something quickly. And you still have the above option if you need something quick.
