The paper Bayesian Inference for Mixture: The Label Switching Problem says A K-Component mixture distribution is invariant to permutations of the labels of the components. As a consequence, in a Bayesian framework, the posterior distribution of the mixture parameters has theoretically K! nodes. To me, this answers the question : No. In general the posterior distribution is not Gaussian.
