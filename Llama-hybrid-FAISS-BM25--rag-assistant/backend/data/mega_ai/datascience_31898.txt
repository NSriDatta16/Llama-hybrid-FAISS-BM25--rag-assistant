Another thing to consider, if you are unable to refit the full model, but are able to access its fitted values (i.e.as score or probability values), you can try setting up a new logistic regression model with both the fitted values and the new variable as covariates for the same response variable. In this way you will see, whether all of the newly provided information was already captured by the existing model, or will the new covariate add further out of sample accuracy.
