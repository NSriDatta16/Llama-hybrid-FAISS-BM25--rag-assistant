There are several manifold learning algorithms for which it doesn't make a difference. Laplacian Eigenmaps and Isomap only depend on the distances between the points, and translating these points doesn't change that, so it shouldn't make any difference. Locally Linear Embedding also shouldn't depend on that, as it tries to approximate points using linear combinations of other points, and that should be invariant to translations. Of course there are issues that can stem from numerical errors, but they'll probably mostly depend on the method of obtaining distance matrix.
