Can you change the type in your object to an Nullable (int?). OwnerId is not a reserved keyword. If you think about it how can you map a DB null to an Int32. Value objects don't support null semantics so you really need to use a nullable type. As for the ModuleAnchorId I recommend that you turn showing sql on, and then post the sql to the nhibernate user's group on google. The nHibernate devs pay attention to that group.
