This is a modal window. running code on DOMREADY here is pretty pointless. There is no DOMREADY when you put some HTML into a div. I assume there's an onComplete event being fired by the lightbox/mediabox plugin that you can hook into and use it to instantiate your themeChanger Not seen the specifics of the plugin that you use but in pseudo code... new mediaBox({ width: nnn, height: nnn, title: "Change your theme", text: "your mark-up", onComplete: function() { new themeChanger(); // will set the listener which will work with the mark-up. } }); if the content of the window is being loaded through Request.HTML or whatever other method, you should also get an onComplete event you can plug into. I hope this makes sense, good luck edit i stand corrected - this is not even a class but a function-based plugin ( http://iaian7.com/files/webcode/mediaboxAdv/mediaboxAdv-1.2.0.js ) that uses element prototypes... it does not look as if it has support for events on content loaded. furthermore, it supports just 1 method that is suitable of supplying content in your case, inline which relies on the modal content already being hidden within the DOM. perhaps this is the source of your problem - if you look at http://iaian7.com/webcode/mediaboxAdvanced#inline - the hidden content is copied through the innerHTML , it uses just preload = $(URLsplit[1]).get('html'); and then in the startEffect function sets the contents of the modal window to the value of preload . this technique WON'T clone the events you may have done but just the HTML-events in mootools are in element storage and as such, tied to element UID. Perhaps you can modify the script to add a new option, like onComplete: $empty() that you can call from within the startEffect function once it has finished animating and has added in the content. good luck again. the best advice i can give you here - do not use this plugin for dialogue windows, its overkill and its not modular enough - such a shame because mootools could have been put to a great use here, it's not just a tool for DOM manipulation :)
