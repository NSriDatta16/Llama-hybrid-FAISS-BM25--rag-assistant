Invariance of average output given output maximization

Assume that here are two areas $a = {1,2}$ and that $(e_{i1},e_{i2})$ is IID Gumbel location 0 scale 1 for all $i$ . Assume further that $$w_{i1} = \mu_1 + e_{i1} \\ w_{i2} = \mu_2 + e_{i2}$$ and that individuals maximize output selecting the area $A(i)=a$ where $$A(i) = \arg \max_{j} \{w_{ij}\}.$$ What is the bias of the estimate $$ \frac{1}{N_1}\sum_{i\lvert A(i)=1}w_i - \frac{1}{N_2}\sum_{i\lvert A(i)=2}w_i$$ of the average treatment effect of an individual moving from area 2 to area 1?
