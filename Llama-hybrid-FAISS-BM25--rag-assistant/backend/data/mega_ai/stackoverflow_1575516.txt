Securing .net web services for flex/flash/AIR applications

What would be the best way to secure .net web services used by a flex application (both desktop and browser) that requires login? I thought about requesting the user and password in every method of the web service, and having them stored as variables in the flex app, but I don't feel like this is the most elegant way. suggestions? thanks
