what does the scale within a PCA mean

I am searching for an explanation what the x and y axis within a PCA analysis really means? I could not find any explanation on this topic, can somebody help me with it? So, just as an example (output of the psych R-package, available on CRAN): Principal Components Analysis Call: principal(r = Thurstone, nfactors = 3, rotate = "Promax", n.obs = 213) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix PC1 PC2 PC3 h2 u2 com Sentences 0.92 0.01 0.01 0.86 0.14 1.0 Vocabulary 0.90 0.10 -0.05 0.86 0.14 1.0 Sent.Completion 0.91 0.04 -0.04 0.83 0.17 1.0 First.Letters 0.01 0.84 0.07 0.78 0.22 1.0 4.Letter.Words -0.05 0.81 0.17 0.75 0.25 1.1 Suffixes Letter.Series Pedigrees Letter.Group 0.18 0.79 -0.15 0.70 0.30 1.2 0.03 -0.03 0.88 0.78 0.22 1.0 0.45 -0.16 0.57 0.67 0.33 2.1 -0.19 0.19 0.86 0.75 0.25 1.2 PC1 PC2 PC3 2.83 2.19 1.96 0.31 0.24 0.22 0.31 0.56 0.78 SS loadings Proportion Var Cumulative Var Proportion Explained 0.41 0.31 0.28 Cumulative Proportion 0.41 0.72 1.00 With component correlations of PC1 PC2 PC3 PC1 1.00 0.51 0.53 PC2 0.51 1.00 0.44 PC3 0.53 0.44 1.00 Mean item complexity = 1.2 Test of the hypothesis that 3 components are sufficient. The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.06 with the empirical chi square 56.17 with prob So, if I plot this, we have the Sentences at 0.92 on the X axis and at 0.01 on the Y axis (I skipped the 3rd dimension). What would a value of 1 or 0.5 actually mean?
