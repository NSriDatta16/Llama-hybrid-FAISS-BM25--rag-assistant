That's correct behavior. For most aspects, the emulator is just like a physical device that is nesxt to your PC. It doesn't know about your PC drives (you can share a PC folder by going into the Emulator configuration) and therefore can't see them. It also doesn't know anything about drive letters. If you want the emulator to use a file on your PC, again you can share the folder the file is in, then it would be located at \storage card\myfile.sdf . Note that the shared folder gets mounted as "storage card" on the emulator. I'd still recommend not doing this, though, since it's not at all extensible or scalable. The real solution isn't going to be running on an emulator on your PC is it? What happens when you test on real hardware that can't share a folder like the emulator? I'd say you should be deploying the database file to your device, whether that's the emulator or real iron.
