The Brand D market share has increased overall from Year 1 to Year 2, yet it has decreased in each of the three market segment (Cities, Rest of Urban, Rural). How is this possible? Note that Brand D's decline in each segment is pretty small (20.6% to 20.1% in Cities, 12.1% to 11.5% in Rest of Urban, 9.0% to 8.5% in Rural) so its performance is actually fairly static. It's even possible they may be due to random fluctuations rather than a systematic downwards trend; at any rate, the falls were not dramatic. There are two more important features to notice: Brand D's share varies substantially between market segments with (in both years) a strength in the Cities segment, a weakness in Rest of Urban, and worst performance in Rural. Also, market segments show dramatic year-on-year change in market share , far more so than Brand D's. The overall market is declining from 58,616 in Year 1 to 52,123 in Year 2. Despite this the Cities segment has risen from 33,081 to 34,375 so its share has increased from 56.44% to 65.95%, a rise of 9.5 percentage points . Rest of Urban fell from 4,452 to 4,125; proportionately, its share rose slightly from 7.60% to 7.91%. The more important Rural sector fell dramatically from 21,083 to 13,623 so its share dropped from 37.20% to 26.14%. These two variations, together with its relatively static performance within each segment, account for Brand D's overall improved share: its best segment, $\color{blue}{\text{Cities}}$, has risen markedly in market share while its worst segment, $\color{red}{\text{Rural}}$, has collapsed in share. Then Brand D's overall share is given as a weighted average of its share across each segment, weighted by the relative size of each segment, and in Year 2 those weightings are more favourable to Brand D: $$\text{Year 1 share} = \color{blue}{0.5644} \times 20.6\% + 0.0760 \times 12.1\% + \color{red}{0.3720} \times 9.0\% = 15.8\%$$ $$\text{Year 2 share} = \color{blue}{0.6595} \times 20.1\% + 0.0791 \times 11.5\% + \color{red}{0.2614} \times 8.5\% = 16.4\%$$ We can visualise these proportions using a spineplot (if you are unfamiliar there's some discussion of them on this thread ) in which the shaded area, showing the overall market share of Brand D, is formed from three rectangles whose individual areas correspond to the terms in the above sum. We can now see how slight the proportionate decline of Brand D in each segment is (the rectangles all decrease a little in height from Year 1 to Year 2), and how this is compensated for by the increased share of Brand D's best segment (the tallest rectangle becomes wider) and the decreased share of Brand D's worst segment (the shortest rectangle becomes narrower), so that the total area of the three rectangles increases. This is an example of Simpson's Paradox , also known as the "amalgamation paradox": the proportion or probability of one event may be lower than another across all subgroups, but higher overall. A very similar example is given in the Wikipedia example, using medical data from a paper about kidney stones . Success rates for treatments A and B varied depending on the size of the kidney stone: Treatment A Treatment B Small stones 93% (81/87) 87% (234/270) Large stones 73% (192/263) 69% (55/80) All stones 78% (273/350) 83% (289/350) We see that whichever the size of kidney stone, Treatment B has a lower success rate than A. However, overall, Treatment B appears to have a higher success rate than A â€” analogous to how Brand D had a higher overall percentage share in Year 2 than in Year 1, despite having lower market share proportions in each segment. The reason for this apparent reversal upon amalgamation is that the stone sizes were more favourable to Treatment B than to Treatment A: success rates are higher for small stones, and Treatment B was mostly used on small stones whereas Treatment A was disproportionately used on large stones. This matches the way market segmentation was more favourable in Year 2 than in Year 1, as a greater proportion of sales took place in urban areas, while the poor performance in rural areas became less important.
