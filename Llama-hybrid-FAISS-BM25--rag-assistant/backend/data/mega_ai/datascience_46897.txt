Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning

I'm new to deep learning, and especially to reinforcement learning. I would like to know if it's possible to predict which combination of hashtags (from a subset of chosen hashtags) would produce the most likes for a certain image. Is it possible to have a convolutional neural network with each hashtag as a label, and take something like reward = likes / followers as a reward in a reinforcement learning like scenario? In what other way could I face this problem? My goal isn't to predict the amount of likes, but to maximize the probability to get the most likes. I chose this title because I think the answer could actually be question agnostic: I could use the same knowledge to define which combination of stocks would maximize my investment. Thanks in advance.
