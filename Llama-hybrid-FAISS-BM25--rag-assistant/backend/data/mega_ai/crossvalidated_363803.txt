Are the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm invariant to the step at which we resample?

In a usual textual description (according to SMC in Practice book ) of a SMC algorithm for State-Space models, we usually expand the particles according to the distribution from the transition equation, or from a proposal/importance distribution, then we compute the normalised weights and do a resampling according to those weights. The description puts the resampling at the end of an iteration. However, in an article called Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo, the authors first proceed to initialise the weights, for a particles of size one, then choose the ancestors indexes, which is equivalent to a resampling and then do they extend the particles. The description puts the resampling at the begining of the iteration. Why would putting the resampling at the end or at the beginning be equivalent? The weights we'll compute will be different, which will result in different probabilities when we're doing the resampling. Does this have no bearing on how the algorithm works?
