I have a suspision. Isn't class-loading the root of your problem? I guess the direct reason for your problem is that some Spring class is loaded once and shared between these two WARs. I don't know the exact name of the class, but Spring needs to store some shared information (at least the reference to the application context) in some static field. Then when two WARs see the same copy of the class, then both applications see the same state of this static field. I guess in your setup Spring creates only one application context (when the second one should be created, Spring finds an existing application context and uses it instead). I see potential two reasons for such a problem: either this is a class-loading issue. I am not that into tomcat and have no clue how and if you can configure that, but typically in JavaEE application servers there's some way to configure class-loading for WARs. or this is a kind of memory leak. Maybe the class (and its static field) is re-used from some previous deployment (unlikely, your description tends to suggest you encounter the problem on a fresh instance of tomcat). You can rule out this possibility by making sure the problem appears just after your (re)started tomcat. UPDATE: If this is about class-loading, I would try to figure out which class (and its static field) is causing problems. This is probably not your class but some 3rd-party library class you use in your application. After reading http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html you can see that Tomcat uses different unrelated class loaders for each application. However both of them share the parent class loaders which they delegate to if they don't know the class. Again, I don't know your exact setup and some Tomcat peculiarities, but... Isn't it possible in Tomcat to put some library (JAR), like c3p0 or Spring, in some common 'lib' folder (the docs says $CATALINA_HOME/lib)? In such a case the classes from these JARs are loaded using parent class loader (the one called 'Common' in the tomcat docs). That implies they are loaded only once. To make the story short, I guess the reason is that one of the JARs in your $CATALINA_HOME/lib has some class which relies heavily on some static fields. Tomcat policy to load the JARs using Common class loader results in all applications sharing the state of these static fields. Have I told you this is only a suspicion and guessing?
