SwingBuilder like GUI syntax for Java?

Is there a library that makes it possible to write Swing based GUIs similar to the manner done by SwingBuilder in Groovy? I am hoping to develop a Java GUI application without embedding Groovy or another complete programming language in Java, and I find the standard Java syntax rather tedious.
