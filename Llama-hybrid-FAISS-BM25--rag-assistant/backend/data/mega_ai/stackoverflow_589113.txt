If you use a temporary variable to assign the name (as in your sample code) you will eventually have to copy the string to your MonkeyFish object in order to avoid the temporary string object going end-of-scope on you. As Andrew Flanagan mentioned, you can avoid the string copy by using a local static variable or a constant. Assuming that that isn't an option, you can at least minimize the number of string copies to exactly one. Pass the string as a reference pointer to setName(), and then perform the copy inside the setName() function itself. This way, you can be sure that the copy is being performed only once.
