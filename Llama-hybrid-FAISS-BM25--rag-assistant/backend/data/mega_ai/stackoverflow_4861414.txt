Javascript loading clients local media

This is new to me since I did something similar a few years back: This will provide a fakepath reference, IE, if I select test.jpg on my desktop it returns: c:/fakepath/test.jpg My problem is, I'm developing an online application that lets clients design a page, that is, they select images, drag them onto the page etc. My design ideally would be they select local files (that could be big in filesize) so there is no uploading involved immediately, I keep an array of the paths of the files and then at the end of the design process it saves the media and the positions of elements to the server. However, fakepath is preventing me from doing this! Do I have to upload the files each time? This would significantly slow down the design process.
