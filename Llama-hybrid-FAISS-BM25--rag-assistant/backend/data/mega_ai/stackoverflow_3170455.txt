Open row in DataGridView to Edit, DGV has SQL Backend in C#

Ok, so I've got a DataGridView for some Project Management Software, I want to be able to double click a row it opens a form and fills in the fields and combo boxes with the relvant data, so that I can change what ever needs to be changed. In this case the most important thing is changing the Status. As in the Project Management Software I have bugs and tasks, that have a status and that needs to be changed at some point obviously when the Bug has been resolved or the task completed. So I will show how the DGV is getting data for the bugs section: public void ViewAllBugs() { DataClasses1DataContext dc = new DataClasses1DataContext(sConnectionString); var Bugs = (from data in dc.GetTable () from user in dc.GetTable () from projects in dc.GetTable () from priority in dc.GetTable () from status in dc.GetTable () from category in dc.GetTable () where data.UserID == user.UserID && data.ProjectID == projects.ProjectID && data.PriorityID == priority.PriorityID && status.StatusID == data.StatusID && category.CategoryID == data.CategoryID select new { Bug = data.Name, Project = projects.Name, Priority = priority.Priority1, Status = status.Name, Category = category.Category1, Assigned_To = user.Username, Start = data.Opened_Date, End = data.Closed_Date, Description = data.Description, }); dgvBugs.DataSource = Bugs; } As you can see my approach is fairly simplistic. I will also show the code for creating a new Bug. The ComboBoxes have been DataBound using the GUI option as opposed to me actually hardcoding it in. public void CreateBug() { string sBugName = txtName.Text; string sDescription = txtDescription.Text; int iProject = Convert.ToInt32(cbProject.SelectedValue); int iPriority = Convert.ToInt32(cbPriority.SelectedValue); int iStatus = Convert.ToInt32(cbStatus.SelectedValue); int iCategory = Convert.ToInt32(cbCategory.SelectedValue); int iUser = Convert.ToInt32(cbAssigned.SelectedValue); DateTime dtOpen = dateOpened.Value; DateTime dtClosed = dateClosed.Value; DataClasses1DataContext dc = new DataClasses1DataContext(sConnectionString); Table tBug = dc.GetTable (); Bug nBug = new Bug(); nBug.Name = sBugName; nBug.ProjectID = iProject; nBug.PriorityID = iPriority; nBug.StatusID = iStatus; nBug.CategoryID = iCategory; nBug.UserID = iUser; nBug.Opened_Date = dtOpen; nBug.Closed_Date = dtClosed; nBug.Description = sDescription; tBug.InsertOnSubmit(nBug); dc.SubmitChanges(); this.Close(); } Now I know there a few bits of sloppy code in there, but i am new to C# and i personally think im not doing too badly. But if you can see anything that should be improved please feel free to mentiond that as well. My DataClasses1DataContext is organised so that there are Associations between the UserID, PriorityID, CategoryID, UserID, ProjectID and StatusID. So basically i want to be able to click on Bug1 (an example bug) in the DGV and that needs to open up a form (that i havnt made yet) and i need to be able to edit every piece of data in that Bug. If you require anymore information I'll be more than happy to supply it! Thanks, Brendan
