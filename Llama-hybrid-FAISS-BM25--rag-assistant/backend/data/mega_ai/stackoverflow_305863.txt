I have an application that implements the Infragistics MDI DockManager (not Tabbed MDI), but I think those are very similar. It should work when you handle the MDI form events. MDIForm.AllowDrop is set to true? Is the object you're trying to drag serializable? Try the DragEnter event instead of DragOver As a last resort: if everything else fails, try contacting Infragistics Support.
