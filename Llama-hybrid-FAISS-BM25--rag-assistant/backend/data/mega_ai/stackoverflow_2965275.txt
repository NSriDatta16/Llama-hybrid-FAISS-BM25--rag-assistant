Fair Question. Well to begin with AIR is not "a non-browser version of Flex" or "a non-browser version of Flash" ADOBE AIR is a run-time that hosts applications created in a variety of protocols including: HTML, JavaScript, AS3. If one is so inclined tools like ADOBE Alchemy will let users who prefer C++/ JAVA to compile code into SWCs and SWFs. From a designer's perspective ADOBE FLASH, DREAM WEAVER, and FLASHBUILDER provide seamless desktop application development. While from a developers stand point the same code used for web based content becomes available creating desktop application with little to no recoding. This is all without mentioning the ability to leverage existing E-commerce and web based marketing APIs and SDKs; creating a dynamic intelligent experience for the end user on the desktop.
