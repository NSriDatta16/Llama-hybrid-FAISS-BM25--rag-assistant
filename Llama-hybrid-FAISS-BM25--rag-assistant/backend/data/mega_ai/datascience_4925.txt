VM image for data science projects

As there are numerous tools available for data science tasks, and it's cumbersome to install everything and build up a perfect system. Is there a Linux/Mac OS image with Python, R and other open-source data science tools installed and available for people to use right away? An Ubuntu or a light weight OS with latest version of Python, R (including IDEs), and other open source data visualization tools installed will be ideal. I haven't come across one in my quick search on Google. Please let me know if there are any or if someone of you have created one for yourself? I assume some universities might have their own VM images. Please share such links.
