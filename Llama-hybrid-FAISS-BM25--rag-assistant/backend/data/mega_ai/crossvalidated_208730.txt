Reproducible benchmarks for the performance of statistical prediction methods?

There are many statistical models used for predictive modelling . These include famous methods such as naive Bayes, knn, SVM, random forest etc. I am looking for reproducible examples (preferably in R) that demonstrates the performance of various prediction methods. Where can I find such resources? Thanks.
