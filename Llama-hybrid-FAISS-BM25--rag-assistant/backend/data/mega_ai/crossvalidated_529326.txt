Joint distributions of a strictly stationary time series model

A strictly stationary time series model $\{X_t\}$ is by definition a stochastic process where $$(X_1,\ldots,X_n) \overset{d}{=} (X_{1+h}, \ldots, X_{n+h}).$$ Why does this imply that $(X_t,X_{t+h}) \overset{d}{=} (X_1,X_{1+h})$ and $\text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) = \text{Cov}(X_1, X_{1+h})$ ?
