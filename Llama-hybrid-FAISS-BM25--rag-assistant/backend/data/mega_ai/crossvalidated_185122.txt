Which is the right way to apply PCA on different sized matrices

I am working on human age classification where I have four descriptors, namely GEI , FED , UC and UR . Each descriptor has its own size as follows : GEI(11264, 284) FED(120, 284) UC(89, 284) UR(128, 284) I want to apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of all matrices (descriptors) in order to make all of them have the same size which have to be the size of the smallest matrix namely UC . I am doing this so I can sum all the matrices in order to have only one descriptor (merging). Do I have to apply PCA to all the matrices or it should be only done for the biggest one ?
