How is the property in eq 15 obtained for Xavier initialization

I am new in this field so please be gentle with terminology. In the original paper; " Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks ", I dont understand how equation 15 is obtained, it states that giving eq 1 : $$ W_{ij} \sim U\left[âˆ’\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right] $$ it gives rise to variance with the following property: $$ n*Var[W]=1/3 $$ where $n$ is the size of the layer. How is this last equation(15) obtained? Thanks!!
