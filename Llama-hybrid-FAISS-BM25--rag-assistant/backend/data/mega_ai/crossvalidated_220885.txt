As Richard Hardy comments , exponential smoothing methods like Holt-Winters typically do not allow for external regressors. On the one hand, extending the state space framework in which forecast::ets() is fitted to incorporate external regressors should be straightforward. You may want to look at Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing - The State Space Approach by Hyndman, Koehler, Ord & Snyder . However, I do not know of any implementation, so you would need to code this up by yourself. On the other hand, you could take inspiration from the way forecast::auto.arima() actually models external regressors . Contrary to first impressions, this is not an ARIMAX model, but a regression with ARIMA errors. This suggests a way forward: you could simply regress your time series against your regressors (using, say, lm() ), and then run your favorite exponential smoothing model fitting algorithm ( stats::HoltWinters() or forecast::ets() ) on the residuals from this original regression. This would do something different from a true state space model, but it might be worth looking at. (And if your Holt-Winters model gives you better results than auto.arima() with regressors, you may want to investigate your model and/or data a bit more. Perhaps your regressors are in reality not all that relevant. Or you have something else in your data that it hard to handle for auto.arima() , e.g., multiple-seasonalities , missing data, long seasonal cycles or something similar.)
