Taking these as given: $E(\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1})\approx \sqrt{4\lambda+1}$ $\text{Var}(\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1})\approx 1$ and assuming $\lambda$ is large enough that $(\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1})$ is approximately normal, then $P(-z_{1-\alpha/2} $P((\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1})-z_{1-\alpha/2} Further assume that $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ are large enough that the lower limit ($(\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1})-z_{1-\alpha/2}$) is non-negative. For $\alpha=0.05$ this means $Y$ should be at least $1$ (though for a reasonably good approximation you'll want it larger than that anyway) -- and the case $Y=0$ would require a different approximation, as it does for the double root residual. If your observed $Y$ is $0$ you simply shouldn't be using this sort of approximation there (and down that far any hope of a two-tailed $1-\alpha$ interval with $\alpha$ at typical values is gone as well). Then we can square all the terms without complication (we won't be flipping any inequalities, having to consider separate cases for $\pm$, or introducing any extraneous solutions): $P((\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1}-z_{1-\alpha/2})^2 $P(\frac14 [(\sqrt{Y}+\sqrt{Y+1}-z_{1-\alpha/2})^2-1] which is the required interval. Note that since $\lambda$ must be positive, we now require $Y$ to be at least 2 to get even a feasible answer for the lower limit at the 5% level (though it won't give a very good approximation for the coverage down that far) -- don't try to use this at all when $Y\leq 1$. Indeed I'd suggest using it when $Y\leq 4$ or so isn't a great idea; once you get much above $4$ it tends to work at least reasonably well at typical levels and nearby $\lambda$ values. (Your own utility function or circumstances may vary, don't take that value as in any way prescriptive or even worth quoting).
