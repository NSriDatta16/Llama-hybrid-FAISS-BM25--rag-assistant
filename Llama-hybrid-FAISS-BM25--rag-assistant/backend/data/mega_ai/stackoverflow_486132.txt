ArcGIS generally leverages an external database engine, so unless you are talking about an individual shapefile, your data is being stored in Access, SQL Server, or Oracle. Unless you have ArcSDE, it is probably Access. You can define data directly in the database and assign defaults there and then link to the tables from your map authoring tool. EDIT After your last comment I consulted with one of my more GIS savvy friends and she had the following to offer they will have to define the table and its defaults in the database and then join the table to the feature class via a common field. It is important not to join the date field to the feature class, in that case, the feature class would hold onto the values set up in the feature class and ignore the table value. Hope that is of some help.
