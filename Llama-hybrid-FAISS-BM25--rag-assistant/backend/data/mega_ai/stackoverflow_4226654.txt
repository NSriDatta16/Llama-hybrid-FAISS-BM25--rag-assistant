Windows Phone 7 doesn't show Icons inside ApplicationBar Buttons

I'm developing my first Windows Phone 7 application and I have to add an Application Bar with icons. I referred to this "How To" : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff431786(VS.92).aspx ("Creating an Application Bar in XAML" paragraph) But when I run Emulator I cannot see incons: I see the black circle with X in the center and event ApplicationBarIconButton_Click correctly raised. I'm using icon from WP7AppBarIcons.zip samples and my code is posted below: Obviously, I have a root solution folder named "images" containing the mentioned 48 x 48 icons. Thanks a lot!
