unique_together foreign key object properties

I've got two models: Common and ARecord. ARecord has a ForeignKey relationship to Common. I want to ensure that ARecord is unique with a combination of items from ARecord and Common. class Common(models.Model): NAIC_number = models.CharField(max_length=5) file_location_state = models.CharField(max_length=2) file_location_code = models.CharField(max_length=2) class ARecord(models.Model): common = models.ForeignKey(Common) coverage_code = models.CharField(max_length=6) record_type = models.CharField(max_length=1) class Meta: unique_together = ('coverage_code', 'common__NAIC_number') However, when I attempt to access the foreign key object property via the usual double underscore, I get a model validation error. `arecord.arecord: "unique_together" refers to common__NAIC_number, a field that doesn't exist. Check your syntax.` This seems like it should be possible and, a slightly different question was asked that indicates it is , but perhaps I'm missing something obvious?
