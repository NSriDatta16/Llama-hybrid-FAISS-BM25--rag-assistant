Composite Indicator - Negative Correlation Issue

I'm trying to build a composite indicator that aims to measure poverty. I'm planning to aggregate a series of variables using PCA. However I have a doubt, all the variables I want to include are positively correlated except for one (GDP is negatively correlated with all the other "poverty" variables). Is this going to be a problem when aggregating the variables? Is there a way in which I can solve this problem that does not include simply getting rid of the GDP variable? Thank you very much for your help!
