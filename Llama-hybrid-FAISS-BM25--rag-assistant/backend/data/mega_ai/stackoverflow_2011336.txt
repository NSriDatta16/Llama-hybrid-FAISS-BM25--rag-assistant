Using current technology there is no completely reliable solution to this, so don't get sucked in by marketing that implies there is. See this previous question on StackOverflow. You could combine a skin detection algorithm with pre-moderation to bring suspected problem images to the attention of the human moderator though. Just don't think you can skip the step of getting a person to look at the images. By the way, your company's security processes sound a bit weak. How did another employee upload images if only the head of product development should be able to do this? Make sure you store your passwords hashed and minimize access to production servers.
