how add different shapes partially on JPanel+image which is on JPanel

My Project is in Java Swing. I have a JPanel on which I am adding some images with .png extension (which are on JLabels) at center. Now I want to add a line which will be partially on the JPanel & partially on that image. Currently when I am adding a line, JPanel shows the line but when I resize the image & drag it to the image, the image hides the line. What can be done so that the image doesn't hide my line & shows it on image?
