Since the situation (as you have described) is so irregular, there doesn't seem to be a better way. Although, I can suggest an improvement to your jump table. You mentioned that you have errors and duplicates. So instead of explicitly assigning them to a closure, you can assign them to named functions so that you don't have to duplicate the explicit closure. var doAThingAndAnother = function (){ doAThing(); doAnotherThing(); } var tbl; // initialize it with the values ... tbl[0x42] = doAThingAndAnother; tbl[0x43] = doAThingAndAnother; Not that much of an improvement, but it's the only thing I could think of! You seem to have covered most of the other issues. Since it looks like the requirements change so much, I think you might have to forgo elegance and have a design that is not as elegant, but is still easy to change.
