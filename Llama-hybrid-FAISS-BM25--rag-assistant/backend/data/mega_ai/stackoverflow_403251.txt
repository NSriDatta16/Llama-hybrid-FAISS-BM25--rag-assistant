I would simply use GetOrdinal() at the start of the loop to find the column indexes first (and store in a variable). Then just check whether it is >=0 . This has the advantage of improving performance too (as long as you then use this integer for all access, not the name). And no, there is no elegant way of ignoring a particular exception. You could catch and swallow, but that is not a good approach.
