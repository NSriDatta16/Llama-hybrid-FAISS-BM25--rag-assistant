For answers to your questions: Should time be continuous or categorial? As some have already noted, your time variable does not have equal intervals, so it probably wouldn't make sense to use as a continuous variable here. Better to run it here as categorical and you can then use the contrasts against the intercept to understand how the average response changed between set times (which I assume have some theoretical relevance base on the selected times here). Should i handle pre and post timepoints differently? I'm not sure in what way you mean by this. I would assume you just leave the time points as-is unless you have some reason to change them. You can clarify what you mean there if that doesn't make sense. How is the data typically reported in scientific journals (I could not find much information on this)? I provide a more long-winded answer about how to do that here . I would suggest going through the articles I include with that answer so you don't miss anything, particularly Meteyard & Davies, 2020. On a final note, because your data is bounded between 0 and 10, you may want to consider which family you model this data with, as the predictions and consequently the residuals may behave strangely. Check the distribution of your response and see if it closely resembles something in one of the distributions listed here. For example, binary data is normally estimated with glmer using the binomial family because running a Gaussian family on it is constrained by the fact that data is limited to values that span $[0,1]$ . Some examples are given in Harrison et al., 2018. Some contextual information about bounded data in regression can be found here, wherein the answerer recommends logit or probit models for bounded response regressions. References Harrison, X.
