When I first looked at the source code for DotNetBlogEngine , I was impressed at how well it was organized. And it didnt couple any of its components to the interface, making it extremely flexible. It's not a terribly huge project either, not like trying to recompile your own linux kernal or something. So you can dive in quickly and have some fun with it.
