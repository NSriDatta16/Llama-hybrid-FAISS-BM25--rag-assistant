It's really a glorified multi select list. Since there is only 2 states "included" (selected) "excluded" (not selected). There is a pretty nice multi select widget that splits the selected and not selected items in to 2 columns and lets you drag and drop between then two: http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/
