I don't like to use it either but I have used it in one particular case that comes to mind. I have a local domain creation tool that was built to create/setup the initial customer sites that we host. There are about 20 sections to the creation process so I used #region blocks to divide the sections up...the only purpose being organization...but I've accidentally deleted entire blocks of code before because a collapsed region tag got selected in with other code...I wouldn't recommend getting in the habit of using them.
