Browser security sandboxing will prevent a web page being able generate a file and save it locally. The only local persistence you can use is cookies - you could look at JSON format for storing records with properties and values inside a cookie - limitations are the max size allowed of the cookie. There's a new local storage mechanism arriving with HTML5 which some of the latest browsers support. http://people.w3.org/mike/localstorage.html
