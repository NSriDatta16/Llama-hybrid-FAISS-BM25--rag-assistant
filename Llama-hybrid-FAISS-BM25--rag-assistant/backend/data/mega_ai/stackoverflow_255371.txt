How to migrate from MS Access to SQL server 2005?

I have a VB.NET windows application that pulls information from an MS Access database. The primary role of the application is to extract information from Excel files in various formats, standarize the file layout and write that out to csv files. The application uses MS Access as the source for the keys and cross reference files. The windows app uses typed datasets for much of the user interaction between the database. The standardization is done on the on each clients machine. The application is not... how can I say this...FAST :-). Question: What is the best way to migrate the DB and application to SQL Server 2005. I am thinking it might be a good idea to write the code for the standarization in and SSIS packages. What is the appropriate way to go about this migration? The application pulls data from 250 excel files each week and approximatley 800 files each month with an average of about 5000 rows per file. There are 13 different file formats that are standarized and out put into 3 different standard formats. The application takes between 25 min. and 40 min to run depending on which data run we are taling about. 95% of the appliction is the standarization process. All the user does is pick a few parameters then start the run.
