In general, more data is preferred, but not necessarily the raw full data, especially when it is imbalanced. The robustness of algorithms to imbalanced data varies from one to another, take naive Bayes as an example, the core formula of this algorithm is: $$\mathbb{P}(Y|X) = \mathbb{P}(Y)\mathbb{P}(X|Y)/\mathbb{P}(X)$$ We can see that the prediction probability $\mathbb{P}(Y|X)$ for any $X$ is proportional to $\mathbb{P}(Y)$, which in your case, is either $0.1$ or $0.9$, that is to say the original distribution of $Y$ has a huge impact on the result of prediction. In other words, naive Bayes can't handle imbalanced data very well. So what to do? a) You can choose another algorithm that does better job in this situation such as Random Forest b) Resampling your data c) Reweight your data by $1/\mathbb{P}(Y)$ ... and so on In conclusion, more data is better provided that it is well formed, and when it's not the case, keeping the integrity of it doesn't really make any sense.
