Duplicate: Order of XML attributes after DOM processing From the accepted answer : Look at section 3.1 of the XML recommendation. It says, "Note that the order of attribute specifications in a start-tag or empty-element tag is not significant." If a piece of software requires attributes on an XML element to appear in a specific order, that software is not processing XML, it's processing text that looks superficially like XML. It needs to be fixed. If it can't be fixed, and you have to produce files that conform to its requirements, you can't reliably use standard XML tools to produce those files. Credit to Robert Rossney
