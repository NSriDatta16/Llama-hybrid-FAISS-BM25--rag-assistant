The odds is the expected number of "successes" per "failure", so it can take values less than one, one or more than one, but negative values won't make sense; you can have 3 successes per failure, but -3 successes per failure does not make sense. The logarithm of an odds can take any positive or negative value. Logistic regression is a linear model for the log(odds). This works because the log(odds) can take any positive or negative number, so a linear model won't lead to impossible predictions. We can do a linear model for the probability, a linear probability model, but that can lead to impossible predictions as a probability must remain between 0 and 1.
