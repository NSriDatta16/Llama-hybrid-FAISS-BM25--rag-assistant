I don't know of a parametric test, but non-parametrically you could always do permutation- or bootstrap tests. I would avoid permutation in this case because there are actually only 9 choose 4 = 126 possible permutations as the response is only ones and zeroes. If you can make a confidence interval you can do a test, as they are two sides of the same thing. You simply reject if the $H_0$ value falls outside the $(1-\alpha)$-interval. If you want a p-value, find the smallest $\alpha$ for which the $H_0$ value falls outside. Bootstrapping is a nice non-parametric way to build confidence intervals for your parameters. There are many ways to build bootstrap confidence intervals of varying intricacy. I'll use my favourite, the very straight-forward quantile interval: use the empirical quantiles of the bootstrap distribution over your parameter. Below is R-code with results for such a test. NB that although you called $X$ time, I have assumed that it doesn't have time series properties. If that were the case, you'd probably have to do block bootstrapping, which adds another layer of complexity. library(plyr) # set up data x # your p-value mean(bootstrapped > 0) #> [1] 0.0922 I'd say there is weak evidence that $\beta_1 \leq 0$
