Interesting -- you can actually see the site redirecting from http://www.audaciousdreaming.com/test/index.php?page_id=18#Volunteers to http://www.audaciousdreaming.com/test/?page_id=18 ... so presumably it's the rewriting out of the index.php that's causing the problem. mod_rewrite, from what I remember, can't "carry across" the fragment, so relies on the browser to do that, and Safari isn't doing it. As a quick and dirty solution, could you simply change the links so they already omit the index.php and therefore don't get rewritten? That will presumably stop your site doing an unnecessary redirect, too, which can't be a bad thing...
