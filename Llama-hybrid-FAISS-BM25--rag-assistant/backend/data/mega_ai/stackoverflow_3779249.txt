301 redirects to all except robots.txt

We have moved our website to a new domain and want all pages of the old site to get removed from search engines. It's the same site, same content, just a new domain, so search engines are taking time because of duplicate content (maybe). We have added .htaccess 301 from our old site to new site as: redirect 301 / http://new-domain.com/ Now, to remove our old site from search engines, we changed our robots.txt on the old site as: User-agent: * Disallow: / The problem is, the search engines are fetching robots.txt from the new-domain.com because of .htaccess 301 redirect. How do I restrict 301 redirect for robots.txt?
