Multitask Gaussian Process on multiple multivariate time series

I am in the process of working with multitask gaussian processes (the ones introduced by Bonilla et al in this paper ). I am now interested in applying the MGP to multiple multivariate time series. More concretely, I have multiple patients, each of them is "described" by a multivariate time series (for example the patient's average heartbeat, blood pressure and glucose levels from 0 to 24h) Usually speaking, MGPs are meant to deal with one such multivariate time series (i.e, one patient). But what is the best way of extending this concept to multiple multivariate time series (i.e, multiple patients) I've been looking around the web for a bit, but it seems like there's a lack of research and pre existing implementations in this area. I found this paper which, among other things, implements what I'm asking for. Its way of doing things is sharing all the parameters (kernel parameter, inter task covariance matrix, task noise) across patients, and then training those parameters by "backpropagating" the error all the way back from their classifier instead of training the MGP on its own. I was wondering if any of you knew more on how to train such MGPs? I was thinking about, for example, training each one individually and then averaging each parameter, but I don't know how sound that is.
