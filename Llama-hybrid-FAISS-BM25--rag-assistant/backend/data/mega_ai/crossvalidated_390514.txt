What type of logistic regression should I use?

I am conducting analysis to assess agreement between self-report and lab data on adherence to a certain drug intervention. I know that medication adherence in the population of interest can be influenced by variables such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, etc.. I need to conduct logistic regression to determine to what extent these variables explain the level of agreement between self-report data and lab data. What type of regression should I use to achieve this?
