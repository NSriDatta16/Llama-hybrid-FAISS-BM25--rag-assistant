Use an enum or abstract base class in a game in Objective-C

Context : In a game, when each level is completed, a Rating is stored based on player performance: Poor, Good, Excellent . The ratings are later used to evaluate the game play as a whole. Question : Should the Rating object contain a rating choice as an enum {RatingPoor, RatingGood, RatingExcellent} or should I make an abstract base class Rating with subclasses RatingPoor, RatingGood, RatingExcellent. Other details Ratings don't have complex behaviors, they are just generated from play stats at a very low frequency like every minute. They're assigned to a collection and averaged at the end of a game to generate a Rank (like Cadet, Pilot, Captain, Admiral) . At the end of a level, the rating is shown as an icon (think stars, like in Angry Birds) . They also get stored when the player pauses or suspends the game. I would also appreciate knowing how to decide on enum vs. subclass, given this context.
