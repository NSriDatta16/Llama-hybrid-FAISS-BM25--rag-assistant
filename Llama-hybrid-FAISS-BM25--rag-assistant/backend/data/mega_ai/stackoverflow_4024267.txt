Saving Files in silverlight and asynchronous call backs

In Silverlight you have to save a file using the save file dialog. You can only open this dialog from a user event aka a button click I’m returning the data of a file from a web service call asynchronously How do i save this to file? If i ask them before the service call i can’t use the stream after the data comes back. If i ask them after i can’t open the save file dialogue. It’s a bit of chicken and the egg situation. Thanks. update i want to be able to save the users computer where they spectifiy not the silverlight isolated storage.
