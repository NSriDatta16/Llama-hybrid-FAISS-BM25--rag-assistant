How can I import the enviroment variables of a completed process in python?

I need to write a python script that launches a shell script and import the environment variables AFTER a script is completed. Immagine you have a shell script "a.sh": export MYVAR="test" In python I would like to do something like: import os env={} os.spawnlpe(os.P_WAIT,'sh', 'sh', 'a.sh',env) print env and get: {'MYVAR'="test"} Is that possible?
