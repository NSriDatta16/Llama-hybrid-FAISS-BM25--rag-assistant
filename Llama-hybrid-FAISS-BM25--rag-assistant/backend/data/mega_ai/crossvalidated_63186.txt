A collaborative filtering system is trained only using ratings on user-item pairs. When a user or item (in this case, movie) enters such a system for the first time, the system will not be able to generate a prediction for it. This is known as the cold-start problem. One way to mitigate this problem is by using some other feature-data about the movies, for example the genre, lead actors, etc. if available. In this case, it doesn't make sense to test the system on a movie for which it doesn't have ratings data. If a rating has to be generated for such movies, you may not be able to do much better than assigning the user-average rating, which is not very informative. The probe set can be built by taking the last three ratings of each user, and then removing those movies which occur only in the probe set. After validation, the final model can be built using all data points. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start
