jUnit testing Database operations

I'm developing an Android application with database storage. I want to test some classes that I use to access database. I've found ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 to test Activities but I haven't found anything to test classes. How can I do that? I haven't used jUnit before. Thanks.
