Elegant way to highlight chart data series in Excel

I want to outline the chart data range source(s) in a table, in much the same way that the GUI will outline a range in blue if the chart data series is clicked. The user can choose various chart views and the range highlight colours for each data series need to match those displayed in the chart. For the record, here are the methods I considered: Parse the chart series values string and extract the data range Do a lookup on a table that stores information on the ranges and the colours to be used In the end I went with option 2 as is seemed easier to implement and to properly manage the colours I would probably have to store them for method 1 anyway, negating its benefits. The highlight procedure is called from the Worksheet_Change event, a lookup is done on the chart name, the ranges and colours pulled from the table and then the cell formatting is carried out. The limitation of this method is that the range/colour data for each new chart view must be pre-calculated. This isn't much of a problem for my current implementation, but my be a limiting factor in future use where the charts might be more dynamic. So although I've got a version of this working fine, I'm sure there must be a more elegant way of achieving this. Any suggestions?
