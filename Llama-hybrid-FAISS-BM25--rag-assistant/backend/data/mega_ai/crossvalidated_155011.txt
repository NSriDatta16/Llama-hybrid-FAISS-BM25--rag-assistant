How to write down a logistic regression formula for continuous and categorical variables?

I have a logistic regression with five explanatory variables (x) and Y is binary. I will present a small work tomorrow on a powerpoint and wondering what the neatest way is to write my logistic regression? my variables: x_1: categorical, with the categories: teachers, biomathematics, economics and mathematics. Mathematics is the reference variable. x_2:age, continuous x_3: gender(Woman=1, man=0) x_4:preparatory course: (Yes=1, No=0) x_5: calendar, continuous I have received a total brain release and can not figure out how to write the nicely on the presentation. Could someone write down the formula to me?
