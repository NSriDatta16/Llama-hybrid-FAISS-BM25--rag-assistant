Z-test with no relevant sample size as I have a Gaussian probability distribution

I have two Gaussian curves, there are not samples, these are just probability distributions essentially. So I can do a Gaussian fit on them, or also a weighted average and weighted variance on the data, and I have get the mean and variance values. I would like to calculate some sort of measure that describes how different the two Gaussian curves are. Of course, the first thing that came to mind is the z-test, as it considers both the changes in the mean and the variance between the two curves, and spits out a single z-value to describe it. This is exactly what I want (as ultimately I want to be comparing the z-values of the 2 gaussian curves that I compute under different conditions). Problem is that the z-test equation has the sample number in there, which is not relevant to my case. Is there a way to do this, or is there another metric I can use? Thanks Edit: Example of the curves. My goal is to have a metric that describes the difference between the two curves, so that I can vary the input variable to maximize the difference between the output distributions. Edit: So this is actually kernel density estimation, so my data is as far as I understand is binned and each bin has some probability associated with it, when all the bins and probabilities are integrated they add up to 1. Unfortunately, the two distributions don't have the same bin size. Example: Bins Kernel Probability Estimate 1.10659307 0.007532385 1.107679891 0.007805255 1.108766712 0.008086891 1.109853533 0.008377697 1.110940354 0.008678085
