Question regarding statistical methodology that involves logistic regression

I used following simulated data using R to demonstrate my problem. require(lmtest) require(splines) x=rnorm(20 ,0,1) y=rep(c(0,1),times=10) Although my simulated data has 20 data points, the actual data set has about 75 observations. But the conclusions made based on both data sets are same. So i thought of using this simulated data to demonstrate my problem . The summary results based on actual data summary(X) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.000 3.000 4.000 4.588 6.000 10.000 The plots between Y and X as follows, Analysis based on simulated data Using this data my goal is to find the best logistic regression model that predicts Y based on X. My first step is to determine the type of relationship exists between Y and X using likelihood ratio test. That means i tried to determine whether the relationship is linear or non linear between Y and X by fitting following two models. After that likelihood ratio test used to determine which model is significant. I fitted a regular (linear effects) logistic regression model. fit1=glm(y~x ,family = "binomial") Then to check the non linear effects, i fitted this natural spline model . fit2=glm(y~ns(x,df=2) ,family = "binomial") To determine whether the spline model is significant, i used the likelihood ratio test. The results as follows, Model 1: y ~ x Model 2: y ~ ns(x, df = 2) #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) 1 2 -12.952 2 3 -12.757 1 0.3912 0.5317 Since the p value is large , the linear logistic regression model is significant compared to the non linear natural spline model. Then i examined the coefficients of logistic regression model, summary(fit1) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.2367 0.4987 0.475 0.635 x -1.1804 0.9331 -1.265 0.206 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 27.726 on 19 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 25.904 on 18 degrees of freedom AIC: 29.904 So What should be my next step in this situation ? Does this results says that there is no significant relationship between Y and X ? Or should i try some transformations for the independent variable ? Important note : I am so desperate to model this logistic regression model because , using the random forest method i found that X is an important predictor to predict Y. So I thought that using logistic regression model , I can be explored some relationship (linear or non linear) between Y and X. Can any one suggest any method to extend my analysis ? Any suggestion will be highly appreciated. Thank You
