Estimating effective degrees of freedom of a time series (of circular data)

I have a $1 \times N$ vector, x of instantaneous phases (in radians). To determine the 'systematicity' or 'non-uniformity' of this set of phases, I use the formula (in MATLAB notation): r=abs(sum(exp(1i*x))/N); this gives me a value between $0$ and $1$. To determine if the 'systematicity' of the phases is statistically significant, it is typical to use the Rayleigh test for non-uniformity of phases, whereby the test statistic is: z = N*r^2; and the p-value indicating probability of null hypothesis being true (i.e. uniform distribution of phases) is: p=exp(-z); in the case of consecutive phases values being independent, the above would be accurate. However, my vector of instantaneous phases has substantial autocorrelation, so the above value for $z$ should be: z=(effective-degrees-of-freedom)*r^2; Question : how could I arrive at an estimate effective degrees of freedom of this vector, x (i.e. vector of instantaneous phases in radians)?
