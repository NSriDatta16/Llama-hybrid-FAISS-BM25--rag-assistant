Azure: just HOW do I debug this?

I'm really loosing it here. Not being able to attach a debugger to a process is kind of a big deal for me. As such, I'm having a very hard time doing something to pinpoint the source of problems with an Azure-hosted application. What's worse is that the app works fine in the Development Fabric, even when using online Storage Tables, but can go quite haywire when uploaded and running online. I know IntelliTrace is one way to do it, but unfortunately, I've got a x86 machine, and the application uses RIA Services. As such, publishing it from my machine results in an error caused by RIA services. I can't build the application by specifying x64 the very same bug strikes again. (So far the only way that I know of to deploy a RIA Services Azure application is to set it to Any CPU and build / publish it from an x64 machine). So IntelliTrace is not available. Online Azure doesn't have something to resemble the nice console log window of the Development Fabric, and as such, I'm at a loss. Thus far I've been just trying to get things to work and not crash by commenting out sections of code, but given the time it takes to upload and start an instance, this is hardly optimal. Any suggestions would be appreciated at this point.
