global significance of glm model

I am a beginner regarding GLMs and R. I have built the following glm model: glmodel . I used the "summ" function from "jtools" package and i got this output in which there is this chi-square test: MODEL FIT: χ²(8) = 13.20, p = 0.00 Pseudo-R² (Cragg-Uhler) = 0.27 Pseudo-R² (McFadden) = 0.02 AIC = 4325.78, BIC = 4362.68 From what I understand it's a global significance test of the model, and the value 13.20 is the observed value of chi-square with 8 degrees of freedom. So I compared the observed value to the one in the chi-square table (15.51, α=0.05) --> I shouldn't reject the null hypothesis (H0: βk = 0 with k (1, 2, …, 8)). on the other hand, the p-value Is my understanding correct in the first place? If yes, is my model significant or not? I forgot to mention that there are some coefficients that are significant. Any help would be very appreciated.
