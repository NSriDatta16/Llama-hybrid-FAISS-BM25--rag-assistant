Stop serializing the object. Store the data relationally. Serialization is intended for short durations, say like streaming across the wire; not permanent storage. Instead of coding the fields into the class; it sounds like you might need more of dictionary sort of structure that can dynamically pull fields based on database configuration values stored by year. Then build a dynamic UI based on those values. Having to create a new class each year and test the code seems impossibly expensive to maintain.
