I looked into whether the Indy components could do this but found an old newsgroup response from Remy Lebeau that said: If...you want to look at the traffic that other applications are generating, then no, you cannot use Indy for that. That is outside the scope of what Indy is designed for. You would have to write your own NDIS driver for that kind of capturing. Or use a third-party sniffer API, such as WinPCap .
