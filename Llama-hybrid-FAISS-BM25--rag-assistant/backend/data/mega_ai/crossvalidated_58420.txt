Given known bivariate normal means and variances, update correlation estimate, $P(\rho)$, with new data?

I'm dealing with two correlated random variables which are modeled via a bivariate normal distribution. I have values for the means ($\mu_x, \mu_y$) and individual variances ($\sigma_x, \sigma_y$) of the variables (effectively the marginalize normal distributions). Given new observations of the random variables, could I update my estimate via a Bayesian inference for the correlation coefficient, $P(\rho)$? Thoughts so far: Starting with the sampling distribution: $P(x,y|\rho) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y \sqrt{1-\rho^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)}\left[ \frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-\mu_y)^2}{\sigma_y^2} - \frac{2\rho(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} \right] \right)$ We want to update the prior, $P(\rho)$ (not sure of the prior form) with some observation $(x_i,y_i)$: $P(\rho|x_i,y_i)=P(x_i,y_i)^{-1}*P(x_i,y_i|\rho)*P(\rho)$ What is throwing me off is the form of the prior distribution. I know for my process that the $\rho$ is bounded due to positive correlation. How can I factor this information into the definition of the prior? Additionally, could I implement this procedure in a recursive manner? Other thoughts: Perhaps I am overthinking this problem entirely. I could just compute the Pearson correlation coefficient directly given all measured data. However, my expected sample size will be small, and I also know bounds for the correlation ($0
