ASP.NET: localize content with mixed HTML formatting

In my application I have paragraphs with mixed static text and HTML formatting and links. I'm looking for a good localization solution that keeps resources decoupled from markup. Let's say we have the following paragraph: Let's have a cup of coffee and get energized . Using the standard resx solution forces me to embed the HTML markup and the link destinations in the resx string. This is bad because it couples markup/CSS/app structure with resources. The next best thing is to split the paragraph such that localized content never contains markup. In the above example I would have 4 para fragments: 1) "Let's have a" as plain text 2) "cup of coffee" as a link 3) "and get" as plain text 4) "energized" as bold text The problem with this solution is that fragmentation makes maintenace of resources a complete nightmare plus it forces a certain order of the paragraph fragments which might not fit the grammar of all cultures. For instance, in the translated language the proper translation might be Let's get energized with a cup of coffee . I don't think I can quite get away with not embedding markup into resources and that might not be a huge deal. Using proper markup/CSS (span, div, id, class) I can create abstractions that would lessen the impact of coupling. What do I do about the link URLs though? Thanks, Stefan
