How to create a Windows Media Player plugin in Visual Studio 2008

I've been trying to create a Windows Media Player plugin in Visual Studio 2008, and am having great difficulty finding the correct template. MSDN provides advice here , but it does not appear to be relevant to VS2008. Can anyone suggest how to start a WMP plugin in Visual Studio? EDIT: Ive accepted this answer because it worked for me, but I'm afraid it isn't the most elegant of solutions. If anyone has a better idea, please add it!
