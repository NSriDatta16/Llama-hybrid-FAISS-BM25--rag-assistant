This shifting is likely caused by the vertical scrollbar. If the page gets too large, then the vertical scrollbar will show up and push the paragraph's width a bit more to the left. You can see this good in the 1st paragraph of the given jsfiddle page when you shrink the browser viewport to about 1000x600. To fix this, you may consider to position a fixed vertical scrollbar. html { overflow-y: scroll; }
