How to enable multiple touches in an iOS app?

Here is the code: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([touches count] == 1) { // code } else { // code } } When I simulate the double tap with the Option key in simulator, the code always chooses the first part of my if statement, as if there were only 1 touch received. Why am I not receiving both touches?
