Is key-value store database a good option for full-text search storage?

Would it be a good option to use key-value store database like cassandra and riak for storing your texts, which will be used for full-text search? If it is not recommendable, what are the reason for not going this path? Anybody has any experience on using key-value store for full-text search store? Thanks for sharing.
