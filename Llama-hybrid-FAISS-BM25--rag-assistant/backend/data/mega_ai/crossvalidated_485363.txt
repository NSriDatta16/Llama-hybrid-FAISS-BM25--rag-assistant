The topic is old, but the questions interesting, so I would like to include some of available information regarding some questions. Statistical requirements/assumptions underlying Omega : Omega and omega hierarchical are based on parameter estimates (i.e., estimates of factor loadings and factor variances) that are derived for a certain CFA model. Hence, two vital statistical requirements need to be fulfilled: (1) Proper interpretation of omega and omega hierarchical requires that the target model fits the empirical data well (2) Parameter estimates need to be precise Brunner, Nagy, Wilhelm, 2012 Rule of thumb regarding sample size, or a ratio between variables and observations that should be considered? Similarly, the sample size should follow the CFA sample size definition, using preferably simulation methods, as those enabled by R simsem package . sample size needs to be sufficiently large to obtain trustworthy estimates of model parameters (Yang & Green, 2010).5 In general, a larger sample size is always better, and a sample size of N 200 allows proper estimation of model parameters (e.g., nonnegative variances of subtest-specific factors) under a large variety of conditions (Boomsma & Hoogland, 2001). There is also growing consensus that the required sample size depends on the properties of the model investigated and the data to be analyzed: A higher ratio of measures per factor and higher factor loadings may compensate for smaller sample size (Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998; Yang & Green, 2010). Thus, methodologists strongly encourage applied researchers to conduct Monte Carlo studies of the target CFA models to determine the required sample size (L. K. Muthén & Muthén, 2002).
