this is a pointer in C++, not a reference as in Java. Plus what you need is strcpy() not strcopy() Try this strcpy(this->stName, stName); strcpy(this->stMajor, stMajor); P.S : In C++ it is always recommended to prefer std::string over C-style arrays A much cleaner version of your code would be something like this struct Student { int stId; std::string stName; std::string stMajor; double stAverage; Student * next; Student():stId(),stAverage(),next()//prefer initialization-list to assignment { } Student(int stId, const std::string &stName, const std::string &stMajor, double stAverage){ this->stId = stId, this->stName = stName , this->stMajor = stMajor, this->stAverage = stAverage; } };
