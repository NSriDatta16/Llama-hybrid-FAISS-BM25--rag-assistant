MarshallingView in Spring to adjust output?

I have some POJOs which are the basis for this RESTful API I am working on. However, some of the responses I need to include some other information to make the API more complete. I really don't want to put these extra information in the POJO, but include it at the web service layer as if it were. It deals with "People" who have "Appointments". Each appointment only has one person. So, I have a RESTful call like /Patients/1 and it basically grabs the POJO for the Person and I am currently using XStream to serialize it and send it on its way. This works great, but I would like to do something like this: James ... other fields ... 2010-02-19 2010-01-01 Where next and prev appointment are not actually included in the Person POJO. I am looking for a good "spring way" to accomplish this. The client could do something like this /Patients/1/PreviousAppointment and /Patients/1/NextAppointment, but I am looking to cut the amount of calls (maybe pre-optimization?) and give them a way to get more information if they need it by using he href. It is very elegant using the XStreamMarshaller since all I do it hand the view the POJO or list of POJO and it handles it. But I need to doctors those up a bit before they are sent out. Thanks!
