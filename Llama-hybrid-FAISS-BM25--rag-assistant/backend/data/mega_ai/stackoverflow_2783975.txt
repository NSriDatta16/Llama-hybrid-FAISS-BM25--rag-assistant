Over the years i've learned that there is no good drag and drop tool for anything. Code, forms, layouts, at the end the best way to create something is going to the src. Since we're talking about mobile device here, good, optimized layouts are important. Therefore it's worth to spend some time and manually edit XML, it will make product better.
