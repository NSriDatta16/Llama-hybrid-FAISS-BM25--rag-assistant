Within Stanford's Course on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) you can find an implementation for k-Nearest Neighbor. I think the actual function for k-medoids can be applied to that. The course will give you a good overview when to use CNN and why they are preferred over the nearest neighbor methods in general for larger datasets.
