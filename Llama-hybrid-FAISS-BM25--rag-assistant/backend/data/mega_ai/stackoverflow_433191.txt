Java Applets are not dead. They had a bad history, for several reasons: Most platforms had bad browser plug-ins for the entire 90s, moving into the 2000s, and this gave Applets (and Java, to some extent) a reputation for slowness and large downloads. The actual Applet platform created a new VM for each applet, which further created sluggishness, especially in the startup of an Applet. many Applet developers weren't conscientious about minimizing the size of the jars they pushed down, even Further creating the impression of sluggishness The improvements which bring JavaFX also bring improvements to the Applet (they are one and the same). VMs can be shared and caching is better than before. In addition, higher average user bandwidth can help even poorly designed applet deployments startup quickly. If you look along the axes of install base and platform power, the Applet is still pretty high up, if not the top, in my opinion. JavaFX is cool, but it requires an additional runtime, and for many parts of it is just syntactic sugar on top of the Applet platform. Almost any problems Applets have today are shared by JavaFX for this reason
