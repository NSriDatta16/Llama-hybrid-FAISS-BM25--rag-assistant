Generally speaking, Flash has come a long way in terms of preventing exploits like key trapping, etc. The safest thing you could do would be to obfuscate the embedding code and have them only supply a SWF URL, that way they couldn't pull anything fancy in the embed object like allowing cross scripting, etc... In particular, you want to watch out for things like potential hackers trying to call JS functions from your blog JS files by using AS3's ExternalInterface.call() function... that would definitely be bad. However I think you can use embed techniques to turn this off.
