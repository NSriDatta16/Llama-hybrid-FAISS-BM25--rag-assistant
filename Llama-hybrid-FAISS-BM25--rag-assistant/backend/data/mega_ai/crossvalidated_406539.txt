The probability of observing $3$ heads from $6$ flips is $20 p^3 (1-p)^3$ . There are two possible values of $p$ : when $p=0.4$ this is $0.27648$ when $p=0.7$ this is $0.18522$ so the maximum likelihood estimate corresponds to the higher likelihood and would be $\hat{p}=0.4$ That calculation took no account of the fact that there were originally one coin with $p=0.4$ compared to four coins with $p=0.7$ . If you had, then the more likely value for $p$ would have $0.7$ , found by considering the posterior probability that the flipped coin had $p=0.4$ , a Bayesian calculation you were not asked for. If you had been, then the answer would be $\dfrac{\frac15 0.27648}{\frac15 0.27648 + \frac45 0.18522}= \dfrac{128}{471} \approx 0.272$ , which is higher than the original $\frac15$ but lower than the posterior probability of about $0.728$ that the flipped coin had $p=0.7$
