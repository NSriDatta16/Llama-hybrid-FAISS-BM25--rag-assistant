how to implement search for 2 different table data?

Using mysql and PHP I am using MATCH AGAINST clauses already. It is working fine against individual tables. Like if i want to search in shops table. No problem. What i want is to be able to search and DISPLAY results from different tables in a single result page. Eg if i type "chocolate clothes" i may get 4 results as follows: Shop1 result ShopItem1 result ShopItem2 result Shop2 result and of course the most relevant results should be ranked first. i have quite a few questions. design wise as well as implementation wise 1) should i change my design? i am thinking of having a separate table called search results that will contain data from both SHOPS and SHOPPRODUCTS table. however that means i have some data duplication. 2) should i keep my current design? if so, then how on earth can i get the search results sorted by relevancy across 2 different tables? i saw that rottentomatoes organised their search results in different groups. however, we prefer the search results not to be restricted by different types especially when we have paging that is going to be even more difficult to navigate UI wise. http://www.rottentomatoes.com/search/full_search.php?search=girl OR that is actually the best way out? I hope that someone can give me guidance on this kind of thing esp if you have experience in generating search results across what would seem like multiple tables. since by demand, i will put the table structures here CREATE TABLE `shopitems` ( `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `ShopID` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, `ImageID` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL, `description` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `pricing` varchar(45) NOT NULL, `datetime_created` datetime NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=31 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8; /*Table structure for table `shops` */ DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `shops`; CREATE TABLE `shops` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, `title` varchar(100) default NULL, `description` text, `keywords` text, `url` varchar(255) default '', `owner_id` varchar(255) default NULL, `datetime_created` datetime default NULL, `created_by` varchar(255) default NULL, `datetime_modified` datetime default NULL, `modified_by` varchar(255) default NULL, `overall_rating_avg` decimal(4,2) default '0.00', PRIMARY KEY (`id`), FULLTEXT KEY `url` (`url`), FULLTEXT KEY `TitleDescFullText` (`keywords`,`title`,`description`,`url`) ) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=3051 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8; i intend to search through the description and the name columns of the shopproducts table. but as you can see it has not been implemented yet. although the search for the shops is already up and running.
