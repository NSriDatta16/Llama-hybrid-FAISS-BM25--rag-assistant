Problem starting development server - ruby on rails

I've recently upgraded to Rails 2.3.2 with Ruby 1.8.7. Whenever I start the server like this: cd /myproject script/server It hangs. After I cancel it the only error information that I see is: ^C/Users/timstephenson/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/core_ext/load_error.rb:32:in `new': Interrupt The error began after upgrading. Looking in the server log in the project logs folder, nothing is written. Also nothing is in the development log. I'm using Mac OSX 10.5 I updated all the gems and cleaned out old gems. All old items came from and old computer with a PPC chip and Tiger. Before upgrading to 1.8.7 of Ruby and 2.3.2 of Rails, things were working even though ruby seemed to be compiled for PPC instead of i686. I can use script/console and interact with the models in my project successfully. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks
