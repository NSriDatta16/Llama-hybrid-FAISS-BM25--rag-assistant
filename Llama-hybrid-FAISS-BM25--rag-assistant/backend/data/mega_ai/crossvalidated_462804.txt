If the population variance $\sigma^2$ is known, then you should use it. Then a 95% CI for the unknown normal population mean $\mu$ would be a z interval of the form $\bar X \pm 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.$ If you decided to ignore the known value of $\sigma$ estimating it by the sample standard deviation $S,$ then a 95% t interval would be of the form $\bar X \pm t^*\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}},$ where $t^*$ cuts probability 0.025 from the upper tail of Student's t distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom. For small $n,$ the value $t^*$ is noticeably larger than $1.96,$ so the CI would tend to be larger on that account. However, there is no way to know whether the estimate $S$ is larger or smaller than $\sigma.$ For large $n,$ you'd have $t^* \approx 1.96,$ but but $S$ can still be either larger or smaller than $\sigma.$ The bottom line is that you don't know the relationship between $S$ and $\sigma,$ so it is not possible to know whether the z or t interval is longer. Consider the example below with $n=50$ observations from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=100,\sigma=15).$ set.seed(2020) x = rnorm(50, 100, 15); mean(x); sd(x) [1] 101.8843 [1] 16.67984 So $S = 16.68 > \sigma = 15.$ The 95% t confidence interval $(97.144, 106.625)$ from R is shown below. Its length is $9.481.$ If you want to check it by hand (within rounding error), then use $t^* = 2.01$ and $S = 16.68.$ t.test(x)$conf.int [1] 97.14397 106.62469 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 qt(.975, 49) [1] 2.009575 And the 95% z interval is $(97.727, 106,042),$ which happens to be shorter (length $8.316)$ because $\sigma pm = c(-1,1) mean(x) + pm*1.96*15/sqrt(50) [1] 97.72654 106.04212 The expected length of a 95% t confidence inter for a sample of size $n=50$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=100,\sigma=15)$ is about $8.48,$ based on the simulation below---shorter than for the t interval in the example above. Because the length of the z interval with $\sigma=15$ and $n = 50$ is not random, we can say that in this case the average 95% t interval is (a little) longer than the z interval. set.seed(2020) len = replicate(10^5, diff(as.numeric(t.test(rnorm(50,100,15))$conf.int))) mean(len) [1] 8.481077
