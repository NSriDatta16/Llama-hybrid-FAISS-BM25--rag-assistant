First, you need to find out the encoding of the source text if you don't know it already. The most common encodings for Japanese are: euc-jp : (often used on Unixes and some web pages etc with greater Kanji coverage than shift-jis ) shift-jis (Microsoft also added some extensions to shift-jis which is called cp932 , which is often used on non-Unicode Windows programs) iso-2022-jp is a distant third A common encoding conversion library for many languages is iconv (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv and http://search.cpan.org/~mpiotr/Text-Iconv-1.7/Iconv.pm ) which supports many other encodings as well as Japanese.
