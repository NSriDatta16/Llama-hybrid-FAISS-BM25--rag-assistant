I use both the PragProg Rails book and The Rails Way by Obie Fernandez. The first works well as an introduction, the second works better as a reference. If you have to choose one, honestly I'd go with RW. Ryan Bates' RailsCasts are essential. All of the peepcode rails material is worth purchasing. If you're coming from a mostly Windows world as I was, the Unix screencasts are just as important as the rails stuff. I bought the year subscription and haven't regretted it. Although I find the organization and overall tone not really my cup of tea, the content of Metaprogramming in Ruby has been extremely helpful in understanding many of the Rails idioms. I'd say understanding the techniques in this book are as essential as anything else. Once you're comfortable in the basic Rails framework, spend some time here. There will be a ceiling on your productivity if you don't dive in to metaprogramming concepts, and although it's essential to Rails, there's really nothing analogous to that style in the Java/.NET world.
