Random Forest with Test Accuracy of 1

I am running a random forest for classification of a data with three classes in R, and each class has around 20 samples. I am partitioning data into train and test in 80:20 ratio using caret package. As the sample size is low, I used a for loop 1 to 100 to build 100 models to see how accuracy changes with each partitioning. I obtained accuracy of 1 for all 100 models, and all test data can be classified 100% in two steps. Only change is in top n features based on gini index. I was using all top n features of 100 models, and using median of scores for the common features across them. I wanted to ask your suggestions as accuracy of 1 is indicator of over-fitting. Updating to add an example script to illustrate RF model I built; for (i in 1:100) { # partition set.seed(i) df.training.samples $type %>% createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE) df.train.data type df.predicted ```
