Data Mining of unstructured data usually falls under the category of "text mining". There are two different opinions on this. One opinion says that you need specialized tools to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP), since that is the only way you can derive semantic meaning. The other approach will transform the unstructured data into word matrices and then use standard statistical techniques to perform data mining ("bag of words"). In this case everything becomes data and order of words is not important. -Ralph Winters
