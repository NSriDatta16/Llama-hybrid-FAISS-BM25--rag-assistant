Bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of logistic regression classifiers

So I'm taking N bootstrap samples and training N logistic regression classifiers on these samples. Each classifier gives me some probability of being in a binary class and then I average these N probabilities to get a final prediction. My question is if I took the N sets of regression coefficients and averaged those and used that averaged set of coefficients in a logistic regression classifier and took the output probability as the final prediction, is this the same as taking the average of the resultant N probabilities as described in the previous paragraph?
