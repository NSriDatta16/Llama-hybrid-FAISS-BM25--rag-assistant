Rasmussen selects a vague prior by the provided selection of parameters, see the following quote from the paper you mentioned: The shape parameter of the Gamma prior is set to unity, corresponding to a very broad (vague) distribution Similar thing happens to Inverse Gamma prior. The reason behind selection of a vague prior is to make the prior less informative and reduce effects of the prior on the posterior. It is called Objective Bayesian approach to the prior selection. P.S. There is a theory behind selection of the most noniformative prior e.g. reference and Jeffreys priors try to reduce ammount of information in the prior.
