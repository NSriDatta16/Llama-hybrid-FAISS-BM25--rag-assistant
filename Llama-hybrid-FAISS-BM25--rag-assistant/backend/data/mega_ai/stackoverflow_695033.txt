I echo the suggestion of drawing them on paper first and then, if you feel the need, you can include an ascii version of them into the code. I normally use these three formats: to reason about memory: +--------+ 0 | | to reason about strings: 0 n +--+-- --+--+--+--+ | | ... | | |\0| +--+- --+--+--+--+ ^ ^__ q moves from the | end to the start p moves from start to the end to reason about bits in a word: xxxx yyzz 00tt 11ss \ \ \ \ \ \ \__ storage registry \ \ \ \ \ \___ always set to 1 \ \ \ \ \_____ temp value \ \ \ \______ always zeroed \ \ \________ zero flag value \ \_________ y register \_____________ x address I used to do something similar for finite state machines too but they tended to be too complex (and time consuming to do) so I now directly embed the graphviz code into a comment. Even not knowing about GraphViz it should be easy to guess how to draw the FSM diagram. digraph G { mode = hier LIMBO [style= filled]; node [shape = ellipse]; LIMBO -> HEADER ; HEADER -> LIMBO; HEADER -> TUNE ; TUNE -> LYRICS ; TUNE -> CHORD [style=dashed ]; TUNE -> LIMBO ; GRACE -> TUNE ; GRACE -> CHORD [style=dashed ] ; SYMBOLS -> TUNE ; SYMBOLS -> LIMBO ; overlap=false sep = 1.5 } These cover the vast majority of diagrams I need. For more complex ones I use GraphViz or OpenOffice Draw.
