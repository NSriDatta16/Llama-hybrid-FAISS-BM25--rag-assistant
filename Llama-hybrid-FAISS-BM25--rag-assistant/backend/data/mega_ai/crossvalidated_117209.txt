GLMM overfitting solutions

in GLMM faq page http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq there is a statement about overfitting: "One alternative (suggested by Robert LaBudde) is to "fit the model with the random factor as a fixed effect, get the level coefficients in the sum to zero form, and then compute the standard deviation of the coefficients." This is appropriate for users who are (a) primarily interested in measuring variation (i.e. the random effects are not just nuisance parameters, and the variability [rather than the estimated values for each level] is of scientific interest)" What exactly does this mean in practice, doe sit mean using offset() for the random effects that are now fixed effects? Also is there a way to diagnose overfitting other than very small random effect variance components? For instance how do you get the df for a GLMM that are reported in papers?
