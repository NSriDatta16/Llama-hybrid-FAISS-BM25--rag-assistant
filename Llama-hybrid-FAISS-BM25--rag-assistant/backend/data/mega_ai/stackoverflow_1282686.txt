Data structure for designing a cache with efficient insertion,deletion and the retrieval of highest value

I have to implement a cache with normal cache operations along with the facility of fast retrieval of the maximum element from the cache. Can you please suggest data structures to implement this? I was thinking of using hash map along with a list to maintain the minimum element. Suggest other approaches with better complexity.
