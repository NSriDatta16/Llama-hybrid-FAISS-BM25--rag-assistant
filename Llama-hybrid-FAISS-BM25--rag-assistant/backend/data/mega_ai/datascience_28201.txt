Another question you can ask yourself is whether you have a business goal to understand a system in such a way that gives you information about the inputs and their relationship and how changes to those inputs impact your outcome (prediction). A recent example of a problem I worked on that falls into this case is predicting the number of market leads by month (week, day) using spend by channel (TV, radio, digital). Here the goal wasn't just to predict how many leads would be generated given spend but also to have a framework to use to optimize lead generation around spend distribution (i.e., what is the most cost effective distribution of spend across TV, radio, and digital to generate the largest number of leads). Because of this business requirement, a neural network or SVM would not have met our goals because, while they would have provided a prediction of lead generation, they would not have provided the understanding of the inputs (spend by channel).
