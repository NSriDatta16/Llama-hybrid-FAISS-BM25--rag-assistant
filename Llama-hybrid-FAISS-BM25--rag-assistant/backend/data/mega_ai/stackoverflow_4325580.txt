The primary benefit I can think of is dynamic_cast. You can take a pointer to S and attempt to dynamic_cast it to anything that inherits from S- assuming that S offers a virtual function like a virtual destructor, which it pretty much must do as a base class. If you were, say, implementing a dynamically typed language, you may well wish or need for every type to derive from a base class purely for the purposes of type-erased storage, and type checking through dynamic_cast.
