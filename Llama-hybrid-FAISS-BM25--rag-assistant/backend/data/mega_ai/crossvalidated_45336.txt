Since we are testing for a uniform distribution, the values of each season should be equal. The most likely value for each season assuming a uniform distribution is the average of all the seasons. (13+24+18+25)/4 = 80/4 = 20 The formula for the Chi-Squared Statistic is given here. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson's_chi-squared_test ((13-20)^2)/20 = 2.45 ((24-20)^2)/20 = 0.80 ((18-20)^2)/20 = 0.20 ((25-20)^2)/20 = 1.25 Chi-Squared Statistic 2.45 + 0.80 + 0.20 + 1.25 = 4.7 The degrees of freedom are df=4-1=3 You should be able to figure out the rest.
