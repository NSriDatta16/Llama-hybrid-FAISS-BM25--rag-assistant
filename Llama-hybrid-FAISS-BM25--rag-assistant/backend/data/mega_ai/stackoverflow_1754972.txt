Launching applications silently?

My C++ application calls VLC as a subprocess. Is there a way to avoid having the GUI pop-up? I am looking for a Mac and a Windows solution. Hackish workarounds are welcome too. PS: I know there is such a thing as cvlc (command-line version of VLC), but I haven't found any builds for it online. You do get it when you make the build yourself, but that hasn't worked out yet on my Snow Leopard machine. I also need a Windows version, but I don't feel courageous enough to attempt making a VLC build myself on this platform. Solved All I had to do was add the "-I dummy" parameters.
