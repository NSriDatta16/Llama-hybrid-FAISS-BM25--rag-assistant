C# flags enum word size

If i declare [Flags] public enum MyColor { Red = 1; Green = 2; Blue = 4; White = 8; Magenta = 16; ... (etc) } Is there a way to determine/set the number of Bytes that this enum takes up? Also, what byte order would it end up in? (e.g. do i have to do a HostToNetwork() to properly send it over the wire?) Also, in order to call HostToNetwork, can i cast as a byte array and iterate?
