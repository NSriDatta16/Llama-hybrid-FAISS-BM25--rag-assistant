ISPSS: Cross-sectional time series analysis

I am trying to run a multiple regression in SPSS. I am using panel data with 4 independent variables. Of these, one is a dummy variable. Can someone please guide me through the process or give me some hints since I'm a beginner in this. I have 350 companies. These companies have a "score" (dependent variable) for 4 different years. There are 4 different independent variables (1 dummy) that are affecting the dependent variable. When i go to Analyze - Mixed model - Linear, i don't know how to proceed. I don't know what to put as "subjects" and "repeated", and i don't know which variables should be used fixed.
