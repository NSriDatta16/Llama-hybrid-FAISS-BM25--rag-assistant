Using R for an artificial neural network (ANN)? Or other frameworks?

I'm planning on starting a ANN classification project pretty soon. It will use 15 input variables (medical data with 25k records) to predict an outcome. I have been following the ML course on Coursera, where Octave is used, but I'm used to R . I've been reading about ANN in R and I got the feeling the solutions are not optimal. Main source of worry: this thread . Here it is said that R implementations of ANN are not great, and other frameworks are 'better'/faster. That's why I've been looking into Encog, and Encog Workbench, which is pretty neat. But still, using R would be nice. I could also consider using Octave. Can you comment on the quality of the R ANN frameworks? Would you advice me to still use R ? I really need the best accuracy I can get, as these data are most likely not be perfect.
