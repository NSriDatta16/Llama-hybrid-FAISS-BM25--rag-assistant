In comparing the exponential and Weibull distributions, why "rate" for exponential and "scale" for Weibull?

When comparing the exponential CDF with the Weibull CDF, we see: Exponential : ${\displaystyle F(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}}$ Weibull : ${\displaystyle F(x)=1-e^{-(x/\lambda)^{k}}}$ I understand how the exponential distribution models time to an event where occurrence intensity is a constant average (the $\lambda$ , or rate parameter), while the Weibull distribution is similar, except that the probability increases or decreases over time (expressed via the $k$ , or shape parameter). In the literature I've read, most of the focus is on how $k$ is the real distinguisher in this regard, and indeed that when $k=1$ , the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential distribution. My question is more about the other parameter: why does exponential have a rate $\lambda$ , while Weibull has a scale $1/\lambda$ ? What is the difference in meaning in this context between rate and scale? And why is scale expressed as an inverse of the actual parameter? I have even seen in the exponential distribution Wikipedia article that rate is sometimes called "inverse scale," but I am trying to get more of an intuition for the rate of the exponential distribution vs. the scale of the Weibull distribution beyond their being inverses of one another.
