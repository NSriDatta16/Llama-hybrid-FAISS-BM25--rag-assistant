I'd recommend starting on MVC. Webforms is arguably a hack - trying to make the web programmable using the same eventing model as winforms. You'll probagbly spend a signifcant amount of time trying to grok that hack. MVC benefits from a clean separation of concerns, is far easier to test, and encourages better architectures. What you'll lose (at least for now) is the ability to "drag and drop" a huge array of commercial asp.net components, and the designer shortcuts that Visual Studio might give you. Since it's so new, you may also be limiting your job prospects (although you'll probably gain a better core understanding of how the web works). But put it this way, I've been on MVC for about a year, and the idea of going back to webforms sends chills down my spine.
