What advantage does Gaussian kernel have than any other kernels, such as linear kernel, polynomial kernel and so on?

Gaussian kernel is so important in SVM as we know. The parameter gamma is designed for this kind of kernel. My question is what makes Gaussian kernel so unique? What advantage does it have over other kernels?
