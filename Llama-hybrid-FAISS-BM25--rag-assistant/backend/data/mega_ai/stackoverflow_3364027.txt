Everything looks correct except that I'm not sure how it behaves with no column header label defined. Try adding this node instead of your empty one: FileName Also make sure the file MyFormatFilename.ps1xml is in the same dir with the snapin when it is being loaded via Add-PSSnapin. Also, probably a duh, but double check for typos in the type name specified in the element. Update: I tried your XML as listed above and it works for me. I copied it into Notepad2 and saved it to C:\temp\test.ps1xml then executed: 1# $obj = new-object psobject 2# $obj.psobject.TypeNames.Insert(0, 'MyFullNamespace.RemoteFileData') 3# Add-Member -InputObject $obj -MemberType NoteProperty -Name Filename ` -Value 'some-remotefile.txt' 4# Add-Member -InputObject $obj -MemberType NoteProperty -Name Dummy ` -Value 'dummy prop' 5# $obj.psobject.TypeNames MyFullNamespace.RemoteFileData System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject System.Object 6# $obj Filename Dummy -------- ----- some-remotefile.txt dummy prop 7# Update-FormatData C:\temp\test.ps1xml 8# $obj Filename -------- some-remotefile.txt I would double check the full typename instance.GetType().FullName and also double check the contents of the format file. Make sure it is in the same dir that you registered the snapin from.
