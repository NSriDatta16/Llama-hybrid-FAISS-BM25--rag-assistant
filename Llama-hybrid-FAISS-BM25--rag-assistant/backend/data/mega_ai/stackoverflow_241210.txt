I had to do a similar setup, but I basically custom wrote the whole thing. I'm not sure how you're going to get around the problem of 'handing off' touch events from the child UIScrollView to the parent UISscrollView when you reach the edge. You might try overriding UITouchesBegan:withEvent: in your parent UIScrollView, and dumping directly to the child. Good luck!
