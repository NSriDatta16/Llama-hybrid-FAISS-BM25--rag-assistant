I agree with the other poster. Though this doesn't solve your immediate problem, if you have any control over the database, you should seriously consider creating a time/column, with either a DATE or TIMESTAMP datatype. That would make your system much more robust, & completely avoid the problem of trying to parse dates from string (an inherently fragile technique).
