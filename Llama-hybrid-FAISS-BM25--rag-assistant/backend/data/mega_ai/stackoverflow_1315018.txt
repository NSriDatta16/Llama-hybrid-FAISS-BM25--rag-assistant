You can stop the warnings with: #pragma warning disable warning-list #pragma warning restore warning-list where warning list is a comma seperated list of warning numbers. The warning means that the typelib you are importing contains something untranslatable into managed code but could be dealt with using pointer operations, in an unsafe code block. The code was untranslatable in .Net 1.1 as well, but the compiler wasn't smart enough to warn you about the trap you might walk into if you use one of the methods it's warning you about.
