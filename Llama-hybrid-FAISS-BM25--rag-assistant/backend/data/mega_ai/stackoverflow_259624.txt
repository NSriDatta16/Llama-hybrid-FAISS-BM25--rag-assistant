interesting questions! Like a lot of other performance-tuning questions, there are some tradeoffs. Possibly. It may be a better idea to load this handler inside an IMG href="", setting the sizes to 0 so it is invisible to the user. With heavy load this would be preferable, that way your handler can return immediately after queuing the operation. For most loads, however, it is probably just as quick to run a simple T-SQL query to increment a counter. Adding +1 to the value directly within your T-SQL query would probably be the best, "count = count + 1" etc. That would be quick to run and would result in subsequent retrieval of your data without aggregation. Hope this helps! Adam
