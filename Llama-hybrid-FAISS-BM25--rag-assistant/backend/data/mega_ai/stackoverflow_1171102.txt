There are upper and lower limits for the length of a line of text, after which it becomes very hard to read for the average user. This post talks about it in depth, but the answer seems to be that anything over 100 characters per line should be avoided. As long as you stay within these limits I would say that you don't need to cap the width of the site, just individual text sections. As usual the disclaimer of ' it depends on what you are trying to achieve ' will apply.
