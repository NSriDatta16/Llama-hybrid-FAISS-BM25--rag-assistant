A good place to start would be "Monte Carlo Analysis in Academic Research" by Paul Johnson in The Oxford Handbook of Quantitative Methods in Psychology, Vol. 1 . He has a .pdf of his lecture on Monte Carlo on his website: http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/stat/MonteCarloExperiments/mcExperiment-1.pdf , which has some good advice (like creating segmented functions instead of one giant for loop within for loop within for loop...). I would also familiarize yourself with all of the distributions you can simulate in R. Paul Johnson also has a ton of resources on each of these distributions. I would explore all of these folders: http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/stat/Distributions/ I took his Statistical Computing course, and the book we used was Monte Carlo Simulation and Resampling Methods for Social Science by Carsey and Harden. One of the reasons you might be running into trouble with your searching is that people don't always call these resources "simulation" but "Monte Carlo." You might get better search results if you looked for "Monte Carlo simulation." Searching this on Amazon got me: Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation using R by Jones, Mallardet, and Robinson Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R by Robert and Casella Monte-Carlo Simulation-Based Statistical Modeling by Chen and Chen ...among many others
