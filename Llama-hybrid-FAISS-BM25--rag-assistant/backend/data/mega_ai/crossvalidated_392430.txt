If photos are taken in a simple white background, and the object appearance are pretty distinguishable from the background. You do not really have to do as heavy as deep learning based method. The task might fall into multiple aspects in computer vision, for example, foreground/background segmentation using Markov Random Field / Conditional Random Field / GraphCut. If insisting using deep learning method, a look into the saliency detection topic might be helpful. This is a widely studied area with both traditional and deep learning methodology.
