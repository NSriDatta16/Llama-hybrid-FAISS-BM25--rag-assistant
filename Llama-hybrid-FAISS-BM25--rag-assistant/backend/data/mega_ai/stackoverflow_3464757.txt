Setting Mac OS X System Preferences is widely discouraged since it decentralises [and therefore defeats the purpose of] System Preferences. There are very few applications for Mac OS X that modify system behaviour/configuration legitimately, at this point I can't even think of one. The actual proxy information may differ between each version of OS X, but on my 10.6 system it is contained within the file: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist This is just a simple XML property list file that can be parsed and regenerated using the NSPropertyListSerialization class. Note that the password for proxies are stored elsewhere (I think you'll need to use the standard Keychain Services to obtain the password). The file above is read-only by non-root users, and read-write only by root, therefore if you actually do want to edit the contents of this file, your application must obtain root privileges. Apple has a programming guide on gaining these privileges.
