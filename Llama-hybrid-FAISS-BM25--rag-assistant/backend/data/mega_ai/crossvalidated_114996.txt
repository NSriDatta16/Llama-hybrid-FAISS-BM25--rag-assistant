The JMP documentation is a little unclear--it just cites a book: Robust Regression and Outlier Detection . However, it looks like the bracket contains the "highest density interval", or "highest probability density" interval. This is the smallest (i.e., shortest) interval that contains 50% of the data points. Suppose your data looks like this -30, -20, -10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 30. The 50% densest region runs from 1 to 6 because it contains half the data (six of the twelve points) and is the shortest interval that does so: it's five units long, while the next closest interval (2 to 10) is eight units long instead. The highest probability interval often shows up in Bayesian settings , sometimes as an alternative to confidence intervals. Here, they probably mean for you to use it a heuristic for detecting outliers.
