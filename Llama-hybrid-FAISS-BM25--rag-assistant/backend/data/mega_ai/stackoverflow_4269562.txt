ImageButtons/ImageViews and graphics resized themselves on my app

I compiled my application, and then reran it, and all of a sudden my graphics have all resized to much smaller versions of themselves...be it ImageViews, ImageButtons, etc... I did place a small icon in ldpi, a medium one in mdpi and a high one in hdpi - could that be what triggered the issue? I didn't change my code, so all of my ImageViews I am using as titles for layouts are still set to wrap_content, everything just got smaller. Any idea why this may be, or are there workarounds? I test on a Motorola Droid 2, btw
