I can't imagine any average figure is going to be useful. You're trying to derive a usage pattern (database size) via a front-end technology (web 2.0) and there's going to be no correlation at all. It's more useful to describe the particular use-case you're interested in and then perhaps you may get something more meaningful. But even then it's strongly dependent on the implementations used.
