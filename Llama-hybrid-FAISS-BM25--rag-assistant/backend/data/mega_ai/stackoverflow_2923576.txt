As @Sachin suggests Contat sounds be the better option. You have two different values queries, the strategy isn't the same. But, just a tip, I really appreciate Lambda Expressions: IEnumerable union = BuiltAgents.Where(p => p.OptimPriority == 1).Concat(BuiltAgents.Where(q => q.OptimPriority == 1).Take(5));
