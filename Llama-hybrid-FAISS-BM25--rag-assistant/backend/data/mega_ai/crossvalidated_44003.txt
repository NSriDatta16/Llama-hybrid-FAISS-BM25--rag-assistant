Learning ML/NLP from electronics & communication engineering background

I study Electronics & Communication Engineering. I like Computer Sciences. Out of pure passion, I even studied few programming languages like Java, Python etc I studied probability, math, computer architecture, Java, C at college. I think Machine Learning, NLP etc stuff are fun for me. I never studied these subjects but I can say with the idea I have on them. So, can you please answer the below questions I am even thinking to apply internships, can I apply in ML/NLP areas? What are the chances that I will get accepted? Is a strong knowledge in ML/NLP is required to pursue UG internship in those areas? Is a strong desire to learn not enough?
