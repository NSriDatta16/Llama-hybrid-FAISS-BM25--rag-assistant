What you are essentially trying to do is create MipMaps (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap ). If you start out with a power of 2 square image, then scaling down the image to half the size then using the scaled down image to reduce its size by 2 again should give the same results as taking the original image and scaling it down by a factor of 4. Each pixel in the half sized image will be the average of 4 pixels in the original image. Each pixel in the quater sized image will be the average of 16 pixels. It doesn't matter if you take the average of 16 pixels or the average of 4 pixels which where the average of 4 other pixels. So I'd say you'd be fine with successively scaling images down as you mentioned in option 2. If you want to be sure then try both ways and compare the images.
