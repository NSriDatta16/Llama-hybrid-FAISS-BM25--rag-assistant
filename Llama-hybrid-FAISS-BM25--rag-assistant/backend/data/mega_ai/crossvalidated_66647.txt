This entirely depends on how you formulate the problem: The frequentist may assume that there is an underlying random variable with true, yet unknown, parameters. In your example the random variable could answer "Yes" or "No" to the question of whether or not you guys are still together. Looking at the answer at any point in time would be a realization of this random variable and since you can repeat this - you have a process in time which is in the frequentist domain. However, this inheretly assumes a couple of things, namely a certain "independence" of these realizations. Because you assume that while maybe the realizations are influenced by outside factors or even past realizations, there is one underlying mechanic to this issue. Every day you spend together is a new run of your experiment of living together. Your girl, the Bayesian in your relationship, now says something different: There is not one variable with many realizations, but instead your whole life together is one single random experiment and the "realizations" are in truth just data from one single event. And this event, obviously, is unique and happens only once. And then, only if one starts to assume properties of this process, such as ergodicity, it is possible to infer things about the process. And this assumption means that during the one run you can observe, the observable parameters behave during their run much like they would if the experiments could be repeated and one would measure the mean of those runs. This is obviously a pretty strong assumption and it usually entails the interpretation that there are indeed realizations of a random process consisting of a series of random variables in time... However your girl will have nothing of that, rejecting the idea that you can gain insight about the total likelihood of your guys future by merely adding the probability that you guys are together at certain days. I don't think there is solution to this. Have a nice dinner maybe.
