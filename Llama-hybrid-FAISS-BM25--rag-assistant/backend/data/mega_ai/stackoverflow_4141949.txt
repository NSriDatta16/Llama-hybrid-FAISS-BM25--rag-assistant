First, you shouldn't really need to subclass QThread. The Qt documentation is misleading on this point . See this accepted answer for a similar question for lots of good info. Second, you can only correctly access the gui from the main thread so your call qlblRef->setText() would be a problem. Accessing the gui from a thread other than the main one can be done using signals and slots or postEvent() . You can read up on events here . Finally, this documentation is really required reading for working with threads in Qt. Pay particular attention to the section on threads and QObjects . Addition: To follow the advice above, you could certainly wrap your file reading code in a QObject subclass. An alternative (which I have little experience with myself) may be to try putting your code in QtConcurrent::run() and getting the result with a QFuture .
