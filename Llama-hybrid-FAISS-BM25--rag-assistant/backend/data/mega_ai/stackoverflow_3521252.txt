Generally, a layout handle of catalog_wizard_default will translate into the following Module-Controller-Action path: Mage_Catalog - WizardController - defaultAction() . I would suggest that you need to follow these instructions to copy CategoryController to app/code/local/Mage/Catalog/controllers and add an action called wizardAction(). Your layout will then be called . Unfortunately overriding/extended core controllers is quite complicated in Magento, so make sure you follow the wiki instructions carefully. Hope this helps. JD
