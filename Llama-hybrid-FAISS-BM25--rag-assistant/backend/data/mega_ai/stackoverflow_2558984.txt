I've not tried this but I think it would work. You can have two membership providers (i.e., ASPNETDB_1 and ASPNETDB_2.) These are specified in the membership provider section of the web.config. So you need a separate web.config in each subdirectory, which I know you can do. In the root of the site I guess you would not have forms authentication. You could have just a start page that asks the user to choose which subdirectory (or you can just use subdomains (firstdir.mysite.com, secondir.mysite.com) or http:/mysite.com/firstdirectory or http:/mysite.com/secondirectory. I am not sure of the advantage of this method over virtual directories, though, except that the root can contain some ASP programs that don't require authentication. I understand you are looking for an "out of the box" solution and don't want to "roll your own". However;the standard membership provider does allow you to establish a profile for each user -- then it is really easy to setup one user maintenance form with a listview for each of your separate users maintenance functions and filter by role or by profile value (e.g., organizational ID). Using the membership provider classes, I personally found this very easy to do out of the box (maybe an hour of creating maintenane forms if that using all drag/drop controls, SqlDatasource + listview -- no VB or C coding required). But, separate providers and webconfigs would do the trick as well.
