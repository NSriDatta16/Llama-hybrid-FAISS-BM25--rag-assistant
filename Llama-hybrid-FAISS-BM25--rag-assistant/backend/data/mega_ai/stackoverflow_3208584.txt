It would certainly help to have one, but not necessary at first. Get some experience programming for your iPhone, and once you feel ready, start working on something for the iPad. The simulator works great for most tasks. However, I wouldn't release any finished product to the app store unless it had been thoroughly tested on hardware. There are cases where it is necessary to have hardware. For example, I was doing some testing involving dragging your finger across the screen. I needed to step through the debugger while doing this. Using the simulator was impossible, since I couldn't lift my mouse pointer from the iPad screen and interact with the debugger at the same time. Having hardware allowed me to interact with the device, while working in XCode at the same time.
