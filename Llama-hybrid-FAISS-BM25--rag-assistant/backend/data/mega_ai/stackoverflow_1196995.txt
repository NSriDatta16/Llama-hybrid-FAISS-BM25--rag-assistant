How to extract extra data from LinqDataSource?

I have a simple wizard generated query in a LinqDataSource like this: I assign this data source to a DropDownList, using Id and Name as the DataValueField and DataTextField respectively. But when I selected a option, I want to keep the Coverage too, extracting it from the data source and storage in a HiddenField. It's a way to do this without making another query to the database? Thanks.
