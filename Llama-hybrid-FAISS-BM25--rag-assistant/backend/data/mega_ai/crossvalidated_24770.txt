Both C amd Gamma should be searched on logarithmic axes, and it is important to start from reasonable initial values (which will depend on the exact representation of the kernel etc). It could also be that you need to make the stopping criterion smaller. I regularly use NM simplex for tuning kernel machines, so I know from experience that it can be made to work. It is also possible to tune SVMs using gradient descent (see the work of Olivier Chapelle), if you don't want the additional programming, you can always approximate the gradients via finite differences (fminunc in MATLAB can do this for you).
