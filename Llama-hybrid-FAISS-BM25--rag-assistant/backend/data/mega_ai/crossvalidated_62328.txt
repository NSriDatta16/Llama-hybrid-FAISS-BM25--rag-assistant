The short answer is that separate chi-square tests or Fisher tests looking at specific questions are not the same as an over-arching GLM in effect asking several questions at once. Whimsically put, each separate test can't know about the other kinds of variations in the data. I guess most statistical people would, on the information you supply, encourage you to work with an overall model with infected/not infected as a response and species, sex, interaction terms, and whatever else as predictors. Small frequencies in some cells won't make matters easy, but there will be less adhockery and less of a mess of lots of little tests. You seem to be following the idea that there is a single correct analysis for your data that a statistically competent person should be able to tell you, but the best framework for you should also be chosen in the light of your scientific judgement about what is going on. For example, it's a matter of biological judgement about whether it makes sense to put different species in the same model. Expected frequencies more than 5 is a very conservative rule for chi-square tests. In any case the sensitivity of chi-square tests to small frequencies can be explored computationally rather than being treated as a matter of dogma. However, as a GLM is likely to be the better framework here, that is secondary.
