How is this verified?

$Z=\frac{\hat{\beta}-0}{se(\hat{\beta})} \sim\ \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ where $H_0: \beta=0$ $\hat{\beta} \sim\ \mathcal{N}(\beta, (\sigma_u)^2(X'X)^{-1})$ where $\frac{plim(X'X)}{n} = \sigma_{xx}$ I reckon that in equation (2), the latter is the covariance matrix for the variable $X$, and the former is a kind of variance concept applied to matrices; i.e., the average of the square of a variable, since the square of the average is zero(?) hence not included? Is this correct reasoning?
