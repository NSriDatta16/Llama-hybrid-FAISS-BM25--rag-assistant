MongoDB does not support joins, unlike RDBMS's like mysql. And that's because MongoDB is not a relational database. Modelling data in MongoDB in the same way as you do in an RDBMS is therefore generally a bad idea - you have to design your schemas in a whole different mindset. In this case for example, in MongoDB you could have 1 document per User, with the Rules belonging each user nested inside. e.g. { "ID" : 1, "name" : "John", "password" : "eek hope this is secure", "rules": [ { "ID" : 1, "Title" : "Rule 1", "Points" : 100 }, { "ID" : 2, "Title" : "Rule 2", "Points" : 200 } ] } This means, you only need a single read to pull back a user and all their rules. A good starting point is the Mongodb.org reference on Schema Design - what I'm talking about above is embedding objects.
