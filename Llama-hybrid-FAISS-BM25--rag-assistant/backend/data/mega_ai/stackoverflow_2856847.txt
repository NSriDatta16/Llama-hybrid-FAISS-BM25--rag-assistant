How does Python's website generate its online documentation?

Created using Sphinx 0.6.5. I know Python's documentation uses reStructuredText , but it has different sections like http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.6.html and http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html . How do you do this in reStructuredText? Do you run rst2html in a bunch of directories, keeping its structure? I know that it uses Sphinx (not rst2html directly as said by Thomas Wouters in an answer ), but how you should organize your rst structure with source code files in a repository so you have a full blown automated doc website?
