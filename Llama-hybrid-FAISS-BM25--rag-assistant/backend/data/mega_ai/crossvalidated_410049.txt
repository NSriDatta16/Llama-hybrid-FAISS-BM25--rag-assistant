The logrank test is the score test from a Cox proportional hazards model, so it makes the same assumptions as the Cox model. The LR test, among the three commonly used tests (the other two being Wald and score) is the gold standard. It is typically more accurate for all sample sizes. One way to see this is to note that even with complete separation, which occurs more often with logistic models than with Cox, the LR test is fully accurate whereas standard errors used in Wald tests blow up rendering Wald tests useless when complete separation (infinite regression coefficient estimates) is in play. The LR test also provides more accurate confidence intervals using confidence profiles. If you don't want to have to make approximations, Bayesian inference is exact.
