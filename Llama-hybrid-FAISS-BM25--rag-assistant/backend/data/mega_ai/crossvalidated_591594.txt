Why does my network not learn a single image perfectly?

I have a convolutional neural network that uses Resnet(18,34 or 50 doesn't matter) as the backbone and pretrained weights from ImageNet.When I try training it with a single image for 50 or so epochs, the loss first goes down to zero and stays there but after a while it spikes to very high values. Is this common and if it is, why? Theoretically, it should overfit the image right? The model should be like a function that spits out the same result for any image after a while. Note: I'm training for classification
