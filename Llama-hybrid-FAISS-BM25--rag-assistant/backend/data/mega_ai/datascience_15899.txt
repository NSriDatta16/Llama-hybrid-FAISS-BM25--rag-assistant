There are many ways in which you can compute a distance between time series, and the method to use will depend on your data. As stated by other answers, Dynamic Time Warping may be the way to go. However, this method assumes that there may be a non-linear warp between different parts of the time series. If you are not expecting warping or delays in the signal, something as simple as Euclidean distance may be a better way to go. Of course, you should apply Euclidean distance only after you applied some preprocessing (for instance, amplitude scaling). Take a look to this presentation , that introduces the pros and cons of these methods and discuss preprocessing in more detail:
