This was a good problem to solve by calculating a few numbers (in this case 2, 2, 4, 10, 28), and checking the Online Encylcopedia of Integer Sequences, in this case A284016 . There are $Binomial[2n,n]/(2n-1)$ ways for the couple to achieve parity for the first time with $n$ boys and $n$ girls. These are twice the Catalan numbers. So the expected value would be $$\sum \frac{Binomial[2n,n]}{(2n-1)2^{2n}}2n $$ but the sum is divergent: the expected number of children is infinite. Update: Here is a simple argument for the divergence. Consider a family’s first $n$ children, including simulated results for families who stopped with fewer than $n$ . For about $1/3$ of those families, the difference after $n$ children between the number of boys and girls is at least $\sqrt{n}$ , because the binomial probabilities for each gender approximately follow $N(n/2,\sqrt{n}/2)$ . In those families, the probability that the more numerous gender was ahead the whole time is at least $\sqrt{n}/n$ , by Bertrand’s ballot theorem . So at least $1/(3\sqrt{n})$ of families will not achieve parity until they have more than $n$ children. So the expected number of children is at least $\sqrt{n}/3$ . Since this holds for all $n$ , the expected number of children is infinite.
