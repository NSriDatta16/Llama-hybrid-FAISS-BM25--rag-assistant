Manually assigning a value to a feature level can be done. However, it is often better to allow the machine learning algorithm to learn the importance of different features during the training process. The general machine learning process starts with labeled data. If the labels are numeric, it is a regression problem. In the specific case of fake tweets, a regression label could be how fake is the tweet (say on a scale from 1 to 100). Typically fake tweets is framed as a classification problem, either fake or not. Then, encode the features. You have done that partly by one-hot encoding the presence of different features. Next, feed both the features and the labels into a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm will learn the relative weights of the features in order to best predict the labels. For example, it might learn that upper case is not predictive and a hashtag is very predictive of fake tweets.
