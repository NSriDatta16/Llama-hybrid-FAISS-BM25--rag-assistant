Classic ASP to ASP.NET 2.0 conversion

can i have some general advice on converting a classic asp site to asp.net? i've never worked with classic asp before and have only worked with asp.net 2.0 for the past 6 months or so, so this is completely new to me. i noticed that this site i'm wokring on uses a few 'include' files. i know i should probably take the code from the include files and copy them into their own class files. i've notice that there is no code behind file, that each page is written in it's own file (markup and code). also, and this is kind of throwing me off, there are no event handlers. are there any other helpful nuances between classic and .NET you can mention? one more question: i've notice in each file in my project that there is some code that is written above the markup, and some more below the markup. it seems it would be better if ALL the code was written above or below the markup, for organizational/readability purposes. unless, there's a reason for this. ??? thanks.
