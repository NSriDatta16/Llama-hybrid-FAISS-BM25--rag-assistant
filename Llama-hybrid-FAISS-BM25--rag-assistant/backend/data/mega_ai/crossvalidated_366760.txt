Methods to compute slope of curve tending to a horizontal asymptote

This is a follow-up question to ones I asked some time ago: Performing a linear regression on a subset of data ; and, Slope interpretation in simple linear regression . I have a number of data points, that, when plotted, form a smooth monotonically-increasing curve tending to a horizontal asymptote. That is the slope is decelerating towards zero. I am interested in whether there is statistical evidence that the slope of the curve based on the terminal data points is zero vs. the case when the slope is greater than zero. That is, testing $H_{0}: \beta_{1}$ = 0 vs. $H_{1}: \beta_{1}$ > 0 I estimate the curve slope via a linear model in R using lm() with an intercept term. I have two options which have been suggested to me, but I am having trouble justifying one over the other: (1) compute curve slope using a fixed number of terminal data points (e.g., 10); or (2) compute curve slope based on a fixed proportion of data points (e.g., 10%). Since at least 2 data points are needed to calculate slope, choosing the 2nd option with $n$ = 2 where 10% of the data is used in the computation makes little sense (as 2*0.10 = 0.2 data points). Thus, the choice between options (1) and (2) is dependent on the amount of data at hand. Typically, all available data is employed in calculating slope. My question is : can the choice between the two options be further justified, as not simply "cherry-picking"? In my case, the goal is to ensure that the null hypothesis is NOT rejected, which is counter to the norm of rejecting the null. In order to clarify my question, the data I have is as follows: specs means 1 1 1.0000 2 2 1.6750 3 3 2.1142 4 4 2.4214 5 5 2.6050 6 6 2.7391 7 7 2.8276 8 8 2.8780 9 9 2.9217 10 10 2.9490 11 11 2.9638 12 12 2.9769 13 13 2.9833 14 14 2.9887 15 15 2.9925 16 16 2.9929 17 17 2.9955 18 18 2.9967 19 19 2.9985 20 20 2.9981 which produces the following curve: The above plot depicts an accumulation curve of the number of samples collected ( specs ) versus the mean number of species found ( means ). Thus, we can expect to find approximately 3 species on average through the random sampling of 100 individuals. The computed slope estimate based on conducting a simple linear regression on the last 10 points (50% of terminal data points) occurring on the curve is 0.0033194 (one-sided p-value = 0.000175). This result is strong indication that further sampling of this species should not be ceased, as the null hypothesis of zero-slope cannot be rejected.
