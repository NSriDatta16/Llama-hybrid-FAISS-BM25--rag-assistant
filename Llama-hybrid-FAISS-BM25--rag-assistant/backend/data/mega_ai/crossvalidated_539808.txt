Practical use for heritability value at sub-population level?

For me as a layperson, heritability is something that much smarter people than me calculate, and there are several questions already on the forum about how to do that (eg, this and this ). I understand that such heritability values say something about variance at the population level, and are useful in comparisons with one another. However my question is, given a heritability value, what can one do with it in practice? For example, suppose IQ had a known heritability (actual heritability of IQ has a wide possible range, but let's simplify), would it then be possible to say something like: Given a heritability of 50%, parents with average IQ of 100 have a XX% chance of having a child with IQ ranging from YYY-ZZZ? Or given a heritability of 80%, parents with average height of 170cm have a XX% chance of having children YYY-ZZZcm tall? Or is there some other way that heritability can have a practical application at a sub-population level?
