I agree with @Tommi, you are keeping yourself from writing more code than you need, and also consolidating your ajax call to a single place instead of having 3 roughly identical ajax calls (or writing an ajax function and calling it from 3 separate locations). If this works for you and is not confusing, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. In fact, there are a number of ways to do what you're trying to do in an ugly and inelegant way, but this isn't one of them.
