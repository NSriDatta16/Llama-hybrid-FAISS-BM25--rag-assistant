Programming Multiple Variable PCA Ratios

I would like to generalize Paul Teetor's A Better Hedge Ratio , which uses prcomp() to determine the orthogonal regression ratio between two variables. I am hoping to generalize this to multiple variables, but am having trouble finding anything in the literature. Any suggestions?
