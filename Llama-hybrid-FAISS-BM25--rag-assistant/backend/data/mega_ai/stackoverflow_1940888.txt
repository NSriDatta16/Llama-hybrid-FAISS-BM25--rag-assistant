Can you link a TFS Work Item to a OneNote Task?

My company uses Team Foundation Server for project tracking. I use OneNote for personal organization. It would be really sweet if I could link a OneNote task to an associated TFS Work Item and track them together. Can you do this? Has any such integration been attempted in the past?
