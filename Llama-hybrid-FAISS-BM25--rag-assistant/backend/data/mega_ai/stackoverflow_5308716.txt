I'm glad you realise that bubble sort on the GPU is likely to perform terribly badly! I'm struggling to figure out how to get sufficient parallelism without having to launch many kernels. Also, you may struggle to work out when you're done. Anyway, to answer your specific question: yes, it's highly likely that you will have warp divergence in this case. However, given that the "else" branch is effectively empty, this will not slow you down. On average (until this list is sorted), roughly half the threads in a warp will take the "if" branch, the other threads will wait, and then when the "if" branch is complete, the warp threads can go back to being in-step. This is far from your biggest problem :)
