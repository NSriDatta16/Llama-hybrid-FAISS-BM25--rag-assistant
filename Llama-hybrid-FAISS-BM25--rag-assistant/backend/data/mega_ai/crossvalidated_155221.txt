This might not be what you're looking for, but have you considered logistic regression? Check out this page for some quick info on it. I know it's pretty easy to do in R, so I'm sure it would be easy to do in Stata (I don't use Stata though) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression The key part of logistic regression is that you explanatory variable(i.e. your group) must be categorical and only have two levels. Based on your data set above, this is true, but if you plan on adding more groups, then logistic regression won't apply. Using this type of regression, you can calculate probabilities and "log" odds with as much covariate (categorical, numerical) information as you want, so long as you fit the above assumptions. Hope this helps!
