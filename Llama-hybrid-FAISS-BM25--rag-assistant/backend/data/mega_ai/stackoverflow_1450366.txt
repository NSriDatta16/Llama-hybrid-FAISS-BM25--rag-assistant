I guess it depends... on what amount of test coverage are you targeting If you intend to follow the true definition of TDD where each and every line of code is tested via unit test cases- you may be looking for huge effort But it doesn't have to be that You can find your own balance... In my experiences- I haven't find this to double the time- though it does add a factor (20-25% ?) I mean- even if you didn't have unit test cases- you would still do manually unit test it- right ? Over the time of the project- you will see that the time spent on unit test cases is recvered quite easily For client projects- IMHO yes. They will hopefully appreciate the effort
