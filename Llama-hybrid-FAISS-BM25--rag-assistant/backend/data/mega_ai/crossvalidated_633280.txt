How do you calculate multiclass microaverage precision and recall?

I have a confusion matrix that is 4 class. Ground Truth Class A Class B Class C Class D Class A a b c d Pred Class B e f g h Class C i j k l Class D m n o p For macro-average precision and recall is easy: simply calculate the precision of each class and average them. For example, Precision of class A = a / (a + b + c + d) What about micro-average precision and recall?
