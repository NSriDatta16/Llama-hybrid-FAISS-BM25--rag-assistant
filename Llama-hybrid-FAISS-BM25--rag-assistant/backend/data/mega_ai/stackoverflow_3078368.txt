Can local storage be maliciously edited client-side?

Is a user able to edit localstorage (and sessionstorage) items? Specifically, would a malicious user be able to edit it like cookies can be edited? I am researching session info for a web application I am writing, and I had the idea of using localstorage for some items. Yes, I have looked into session variables, and I am probably going to use them, but I was just wondering this and could not find it anywhere. My project is built with jQuery and PHP. The interface is completely driven by jQuery, and I am using localstorage for some other info--that is why I thought of it. Thanks!
