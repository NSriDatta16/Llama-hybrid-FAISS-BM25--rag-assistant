I've run into the same problem. I ended up with a BAT, a Shell and eventual a DMG for Macs. I found this comment on automaded JRE installation for Windows using Nullsoft installer: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Java_Launcher_with_automatic_JRE_installation I think outside JNLP you will find hard to get automation for all platforms. However on my project, up for two year, I haven't seen complains about users having to get java by themselves. I believe most machines will have it already. Windows user complained about not having a shortcut, but that is easy to do using vbs. Also on the Mac DMG AppBundle, their is way to specify the JRE. Mac will have the lastest version, unless the are older PowerPC based machines. In that case no Java6. Of you end up with several launcher, I would recommend an automated update strategy.
