My first thought was to make a dot plot (top left chart below). I have a tutorial showing how to make Dot Plots in Microsoft Excel , and also I sell a program that makes them. But there is no horizontal line connecting low to high, so I decided to make only one series of dots, the Average, and use error bars to reach from the average down to the minimum and up to the maximum (bottom left chart). Then again, you can plot all three sets of dots, and add the error bars in the same way (top right chart). A final option is to make a stacked bar chart (bottom right chart). The first value is the minimum, and the bars are formatted to be hidden (no fill or border). The first visible series is the difference between the min and the average, and the second is the difference between the average and the max. These amounts are the same as the error bar lengths, not coincidentally, though having a bar span the axis requires some special fiddling. Here is the workbook I used to build these charts .
