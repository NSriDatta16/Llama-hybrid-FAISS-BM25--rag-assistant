XGboost is implementation of GBDT with randmization(It uses coloumn sampling and row sampling).Row sampling is possible by not using all of the training data for each base model of the GBDT. Instead of using all of the training data for each base-model, we sample a subset of rows and use only those rows of data to build each of the base models. This ensures that there is a lesser chance of overfitting which is a major issue with simple GBDT which XGBoost tries to address using this randomization.
