Presumably by "javascript" you mean more AJAX ? (Rather than JS modification of output... in which case it's just an extension of the view). There's no reason why your AJAX can't/shouldn't be routed through your MVC like any other component. Of course that may precipitate changes to the original MVC design, but perhaps that's an acceptable part of the course. Of course when using AJAX your view rendering could handled by JS embedded in the existing view - if data's provided as JSON rather than HTML fragments.
