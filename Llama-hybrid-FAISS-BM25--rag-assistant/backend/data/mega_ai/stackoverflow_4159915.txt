dropEvent() not getting called

I am trying to perform a drag and drop operation from a QTreeWidget to QGraphicsView. dragStart() works, and dragEnterEvent() works, but dropEvent() is never being called. Also the pixmap is not showing up until the cursor enters the QGraphicsView, which isn't a problem, but I just thought it would appear as soon as the drag started. Here is my startDrag function: def on_list_startDrag(self, supportedActions): #Retreive the item that was clicked on currentPart = self.ui.list.currentItem() part = currentPart.text(0) drag = QtGui.QDrag(self.ui.list) mime = QtCore.QMimeData() print(part) #retreive that associated graphics file icon = QtGui.QIcon('drawings/FULL/' + part + '.svg') pixmap = icon.pixmap(102,122) selected = QtGui.QImage('drawings/FULL/' + part + '.svg') data = pickle.dumps(selected) mime.setData('application/x-item', data) #mime.setImageData(QtGui.QImage('drawings/FULL/' + part + '.svg')) drag.setMimeData(mime) drag.setHotSpot(QtCore.QPoint(pixmap.width()/2, pixmap.height()/2)) drag.setPixmap(pixmap) drag.exec_() Here is the the dragEnterEvent: def on_workArea_dragEnterEvent(self, event): print(event.format()) if (event.mimeData().hasFormat('application/x-item')): event.accept() print('accepted') else: event.ignore() Finally the dropEvent code: def on_workArea_dropEvent(self, event): print('dropped') When I start the drag and drop operation is happening the cursor has the circle with the slash like the widget doesn't accept drops, but I set the QGraphicsView, workArea, to accept drops. Can someone please help me get the drop working and explain why the pixmap doesn't show up behind the cursor until the cursor is over the QGraphicsView. Thank you.
