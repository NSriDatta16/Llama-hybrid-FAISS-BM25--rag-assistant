How do I combine different groupings of the same data?

I'm not sure if I phrased that question correctly or if this is the even the right place to ask, but I'm currently at a loss. For some background, I'm a mobile developer with no real experience in data science, but I'm interested in learning, so I decided to start a side project. To clarify the question, if I know that weekly, on average, a person watches 21 hours of TV, 25-year-olds watch 20 hours, females watch 23 hours, and white people watch 18 hours. How can I calculate how much television a white, 25-year-old female watches? Is that even possible? My current thinking is that I find the proportion of each category, compared to the total average ( 20/21, 23/21, 18/21 ), then multiply them all together ( ~.89 ), and finally multiply that by the total average, giving me a value of ~18.78 hours. Is that right? Or am I completely off-base and making a mockery of statistics?
