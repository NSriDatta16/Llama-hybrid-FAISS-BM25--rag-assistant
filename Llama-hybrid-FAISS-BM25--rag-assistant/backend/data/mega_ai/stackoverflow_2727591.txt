Out of memory when creating a lot of objects C#

I'm processing 1 million records in my application, which I retrieve from a MySQL database. To do so I'm using Linq to get the records and use .Skip() and .Take() to process 250 records at a time. For each retrieved record I need to create 0 to 4 Items, which I then add to the database. So the average amount of total Items that has to be created is around 2 million. IQueryable objectCollection = dataContext.Repository (); int amountToSkip = 0; IList objects = objectCollection.Skip(amountToSkip).Take(250).ToList(); while (objects.Count != 0) { using (dataContext = new LinqToSqlContext(new DataContext())) { foreach (Object objectRecord in objects) { // Create 0 - 4 Random Items for (int i = 0; i Now the problem arises when creating the Items. When running the application ( and not even using dataContext ) the memory increases consistently. It's like the items are never getting disposed. Does anyone notice what I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance!
