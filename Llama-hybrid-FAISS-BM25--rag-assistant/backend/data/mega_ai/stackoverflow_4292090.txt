Organize SQL Server database

I have a licensing database set up for storing my cutomers' records. However, when I need to find someone, it is hard since it is not in alphabetical order.. And I cannot find an option to sort them in Visual Studio's Server Explorer. Here is a picture, notice the first name letters I did not cut off, they are not in order: http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/4946/captureeg.png So how do I fix this problem? Is there some secret button in VS I have to discover?
