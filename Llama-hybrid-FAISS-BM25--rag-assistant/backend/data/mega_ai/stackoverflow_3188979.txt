This is my suggested roadmap: Sun Java Tutorials / Core Java series Practice Design Pattern in Java and learn about the idioms most used and popular in the Java world. Effective Java (anyone who has read this has come a long way in learning Java and avoiding common pitfalls) Java Concurrency in Practice Code Complete Browse StackOverflow regularly to keep up with what other people are doing with Java :) Somewhere when you are reading Effective Java, you can read/practice Jave EE and some frameworks among those you cited and others. I also second @Will's point about ambition , and may I add say that a spirit to do things in a "correct" way while staying pragmatic is also important.
