You could just send and return the yr variable to the function each time. For your code above you would need to have a x_yr variable and a y_yr variable. It may not be very elegant, but it would work. If you only want two instances of this function (as above with x and y) then you could make two functions that are identical except in name like xintegrator and yintegrator. Or, you could have yr be an array and have a parameter sent when calling integrator specifying which value in the array to use.
