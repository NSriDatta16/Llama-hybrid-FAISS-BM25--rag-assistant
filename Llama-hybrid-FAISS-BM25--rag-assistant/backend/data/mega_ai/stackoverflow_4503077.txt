Excel Formula/VBA code that will sum only cells containing values only (skip any cells containing formulas)?

Is there a formula that will sum ONLY cells that contain a value (not cells with a formula)? For example, say in column A of a spreadsheet I have a mixture of entered values and formulas that return values. If I use a sum formula at the end it will naturally sum all of the numbers in the selected array regardless of whether they are entered values or values resulting from a formula. (Maybe some kind of SUMIF & VBA code combo..) In case my description wasn't clear, here is a hypothetical spreadsheet set-up where i would need this formula: A 1| 400 2| =SUM(B1:B3) 3| =AVERAGE(B1:B3) 4| 200 5| 100 6| =COUNT(B1:B3) 7| I want the sum Formula in this cell (A7) to return the value 700 (the sum of the values above).
