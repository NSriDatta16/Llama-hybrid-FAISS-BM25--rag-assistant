What you want to do ( and what I have done ) is to: Take these (what I would assume) non-standard daily or hourly readings and "bucket them" into periods. For each transaction and for each kind of machine, create a time series. This sequence of values can then be analyzed for things like daily, weekly, monthly, and memory effects using a Transfer Function. This analysis could yield the detection of level shifts and trends using Intervention Detection schemes. There may also be one-time effects that need to be identified and neutralized (anomalies) in order to not distort model parameters. There may be changes in daily patterns over, error variance, or other model coefficients over time. There may be ( read:will be! ) holiday effects around known holidays. Particular days of the month may have an effect. Particular weeks of the month may have an effect. There may be weekend - effects. Lots of things to explore and find out. With that, I say that if you wish to post some daily data from a 3-4 year period I might be able to help further. If you wished to downsize this to hourly forecasts this could also be done at a later stage. A useful model not only characterizes/describes historical data but also can provide early warning as to the onset of change. Unusual values do know have to be specified up front but arise detecting values inconsistent with the past.
