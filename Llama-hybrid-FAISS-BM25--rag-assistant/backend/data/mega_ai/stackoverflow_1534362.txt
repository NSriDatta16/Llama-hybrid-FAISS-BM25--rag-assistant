FPGA for 3d rendering/modelling

I am an experienced C#/.NET developer (actually this is all irrelevant because FPGA is like another level of complexity). While my level of ability is not expert like in C# as I still sometimes look stuff up (but not very often, though I struggle with some syntax/advanced concepts), my boss does FPGA and recommends I get involved (easing myself in, I am surprised I am not being discouraged as I am a junior developer and it's a complex technology). Thus my question is, what is the best way to learn FPGA? I am gathering books etc. I am looking at scalable 3d modelling and rendering (ideally in a windows app where the user is waiting for an instant response) and CUDA is popular but not as fast according to my boss. Is FPGA the way to go for this sort of project? Thanks
