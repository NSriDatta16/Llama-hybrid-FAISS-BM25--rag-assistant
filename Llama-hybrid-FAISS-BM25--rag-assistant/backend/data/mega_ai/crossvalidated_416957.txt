What is wrong with your reasoning? In 1. you minimize the expectation of each term before taking the sum. You say I Want to emphasize that each event has a different probability of occurring and in that case, well, it is correct to minimize each term individually, but you have one parameter for each observation. Logistic regression means to model those $p_i$ 's by letting them depend on some covariates, you haven't told us about covariates. Lacking them, you can do no better than the rather unhelpful estimates of 0 or 1. Question 2. is potentially more interesting. You ask should I interpret the Brier score such that if I minimized the expected Brier score then I am making more accurate predictions? Well, the Brier score is just one of many other proper scoring rules and then the question becomes which proper scoring rule gives "best" predictions ? Then of course you would need to define what you mean by "more accurate predictions". One paper asking this question is Choosing a Strictly Proper Scoring Rule . One could also ask if there is a theory of using proper scoring rules as inference functions, one paper is Minimum Scoring Rule Inference .
