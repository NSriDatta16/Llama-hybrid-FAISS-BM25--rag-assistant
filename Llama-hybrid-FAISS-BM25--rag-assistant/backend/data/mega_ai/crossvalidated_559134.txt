As a preliminary I would say that direct answers to your questions depend on several things that are not clear from your question, and that you have quite likely not considered. Also, discussions about multiple testing often include some seemingly incompatible opinions. For example, a strict "frequentist" might say that they are necessary but a Bayesian that they are unnecessary. "Correction" for multiple comparisons is only needed if you want to control the global false positive error rate within the Neyman–Pearsonian framework that fixes false positive error rates in the long run. The long run error performance relates to the test procedure rather than the data and so it can be thought of as 'global'. An alternative approach, sometimes called 'neo-Fisherian' (or 'neoFisherian' https://www.jstor.org/stable/23736900 ) focusses on the local evidence in the dataset regarding the particular null hypothesis of interest. The data contain the evidence and as the data come from this study (i.e. not from any notional 'long run') we can think of an evidential evaluation as 'local' in contrast to the 'global' long run error rates. Both the Neyman–Pearsonian and neo-Fisherian approaches are fully 'frequentist' because they are both derived from the interpretation of probability as a long run frequency rather than something like a fractional level of belief or certainty. The contrast to the frequentist methods are Bayesian. You do not seem to be asking about Bayesian methods and so I will not attempt to describe them here beyond saying that they are like the neo-Fisherian in being concerned with local evidence rather than global long run errors. (I am not experienced with Bayesian approaches.) The best approach to use depends on the nature of inferences that you wish to make and, critically, on whether the study has to stand independently as definitive. If the latter is the case then consider using a Neyman–Pearsonian decision procedure and deal with your question of what constitutes a family after delineating carefully the most critical inferences. If your study is in any sense preliminary or hypothesis generating then the neo-Fisherian approach is advantageous because it allows you to rank the interventions and to quantitate the relevant evidence. That will allow sensible design of follow-up studies (to be done by you or others). In my opinion, most studies and most parts of a study can be thought of as preliminary and so the neo-Fisherian approaches are most useful. I know that this answer may not directly help you, but it might help you to get closer to "wrap [your] head around" the real issues. I have an extensive chapter that you will find relevant here: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/164_2019_286 . There is a section that directly addresses multiple comparisons, but you probably should look at the whole thing.
