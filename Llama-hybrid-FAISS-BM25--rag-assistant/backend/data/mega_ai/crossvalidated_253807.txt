Understanding Interactions in R

I would like to interpret interactions and their confidence intervals in a logit model. My model looks like: model.3 The output: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.742068 1.036340 0.716 0.473962 Gender -0.168875 0.439052 -0.385 0.700508 NRS05 0.158400 0.289230 0.548 0.583924 NRS06 0.551517 0.322361 1.711 0.087105 . NRS07 -0.694288 0.340947 -2.036 0.041715 * Meds 0.863118 0.376975 2.290 0.022045 * Gender:Meds 0.946943 0.465266 2.035 0.041823 * The response (ref level: NRS=0), Gender (ref level: Gender=F), and Meds (ref level: Meds=0) are all binary. The OR for a patient when Gender=F and Meds=0 is then exp(coeff.intercept). The OR for a patient when Gender=M and Meds=0 includes the intercept. The OR for Gender=M,Meds=0 is then exp(coeff.intercept + coeff.Gender). But what about for the interaction? I would like the OR for patients treated by males and given meds compared with when patients are treated by females and given meds. I've then: exp(coeff.Gender + coeff.interaction) Is this correct? Why is the intercept coefficient not included? Some information in a previous post seems to be conflicting ( Interpreting interaction terms in logit regression with categorical variables ) The top answer refers changes in the baseline, while a link out to "COMMUNICATING COMPLEX INFORMATION: THE INTERPRETATION OF STATISTICAL INTERACTION IN MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS" J. J. Chen, 2003 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447969/ ) does not talk about the intercept at all. Thanks!
