How to deal with class imbalance in a neural network?

Suppose we have a game and its action space contains two possible actions: A and B . We have a labelled dataset of state-action pairs but 95% of actions are A and only 5% are B If we train a neural network, it will always output A as it will choose the most probable class to decrease its loss. Are there ways to solve this problem?
