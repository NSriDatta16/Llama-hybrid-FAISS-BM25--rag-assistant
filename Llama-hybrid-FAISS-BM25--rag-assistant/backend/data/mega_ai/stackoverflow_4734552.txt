This is by design. FillMode.Wireframe only draws edges of each triangle as lines. That's all. Do a first pass with a solid fill mode and depth writes on and a color mask ( RenderTargetWriteMask in D3D11 terminology), and a second one with depth test on (but depth writes off) and wireframe mode on. You will probably need depth bias too since lines and triangles are not rasterized the same way (and their z can differ at equal fragment position). BTW, this technique is known as hidden line removal. You can check this presentation for more details.
