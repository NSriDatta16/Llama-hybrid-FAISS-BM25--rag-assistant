I personally have never solved a problem by applying ideas from nature. However, I have solved problems by applying other people's solutions inspired by nature. Many graph layout algorithms, and layout algorithms in general, are based on mechanics (springs, rubber bands, gravity) or simple insect-like behavior (follow your leader, maximize/minimize distance). And, of course, I like object-oriented programming, which was developed by Nygaard and Dahl for simulations of physical real-world objects, and was perfected by Alan Kay, a microbiologist who modeled OO explicitly after the way simple cells can form complex organisms capable of complex behavior. So, in a sense, everybody who does OO, is indirectly deriving his program from nature.
