Yet another method is to compute the median of all pairwise averages or do bootstrapping. Update: The median of all pairwise avarages is called the Hodgesâ€“Lehmann estimator . This estimator has usually a high efficiency. This encyclopedia entry by Scott L. Hershberger says: While both the median and Hodges-Lehmann estimator are both preferable to the sample mean for nonsymmetric distributions, the Hodges-Lehmann estimator has larger asymptotic relative efficiency with respect to the mean than the median Bootstrapping may be less relevant and more computational intensive, but you could take a small random sample of the data with replacement and compute the mean of that subsample, do it many times and compute the median of all the means. In both cases you do no longer have to pick a value among the values of your data (when you compute the ordinary median), but instead you pick among many averages from subsets of the data.
