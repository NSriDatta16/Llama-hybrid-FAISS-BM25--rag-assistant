I think you should use the progress sub inherited from LWP::UserAgent $ua->progress( $status, $request_or_response ) from the docs: This is called frequently as the response is received regardless of how the content is processed. The method is called with $status "begin" at the start of processing the request and with $state "end" before the request method returns. In between these $status will be the fraction of the response currently received or the string "tick" if the fraction can't be calculated. When $status is "begin" the second argument is the request object, otherwise it is the response object.
