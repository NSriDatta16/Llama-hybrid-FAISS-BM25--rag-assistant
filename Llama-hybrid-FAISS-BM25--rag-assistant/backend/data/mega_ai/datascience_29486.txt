A model, loosely speaking, is a simplification of some thing or process. For example, the shape of the Earth not actually a sphere, but we might treat it as one if we are designing a globe. Similarly, assuming the universe is deterministic, there is some natural process which determines if a customer will buy a product on a website. We might construct a something that approximates that process, which we could give some information about a customer and which tells us if it thinks that customer will buy a product. A "machine learning model", then, is a model constructed by a machine learning system. (Apologies for this not being a rigorous answer, but I hope this is still useful.)
