As an admitted statistical novice, it seems there are a few concepts from the statistical paradigm not yet grasped, as well as a few errors in interpretation. Think of equation (1) as the "true" model. The $\gamma_j$ are indeed constant scalars, but we don't know what they are. The error term $\epsilon$ is there to indicate that the responses will not match the deterministic portion of the model exactly. There will be variance. Neither equations (1) or (2) are written in matrix form. All quantities are still scalar. The $\hat{\gamma_j}$ terms represent estimates of the "true" but unknown $\gamma_j$ terms. Once you've collected some data and estimated them, then they can be regarded as constant scalars. But thinking more generally, before the data is collected, they are random variables that depend on the data. The values calculated via least squares represent only one possible realization. This perspective is key to understanding the remaining derivation of the JN method, which uses the variance of the $\hat{\gamma_j}$ terms. Once data is collected and $\hat{\gamma_j}$ are estimated, equation (2) can be used to predict responses for new observations. It is meant to represent the average response for given predictor/moderator values (technically it is a conditional expectation), and the error term is assumed to have zero mean, so it is not included. I hope this gets you started.
