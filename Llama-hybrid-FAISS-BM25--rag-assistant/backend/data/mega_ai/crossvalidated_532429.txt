It's some sort of a panel data . You can define a N/A like value of your choice (e.g. -999 if numeric) for the data that's not available. Tree based algorithms (e.g. random forests) get along well with that sort of information. Each row can be a training sample. The IID assumption of samples is violated but this is also the case in most time series designs. Note also that your validation and test sets should respect the time order of your samples. Ideally, you can split by events (e.g. event id) such that training, validation and test sets don't contain the same events at different stages to prevent data leakage.
