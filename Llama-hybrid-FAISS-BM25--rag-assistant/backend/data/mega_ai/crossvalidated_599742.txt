Are ARMA models used to model the noise in a time series?

If we have a time series $y_t$ and we want to model it, is the following intuition about the ARMA model correct? $$Y_t=f(\beta,t) + e_t $$ where $e_t \sim$ ARMA. So there is a decomposition of a deterministic part $f(\beta,t)$ and a stochastic part (the noise) which can be modelled by an ARMA process.
