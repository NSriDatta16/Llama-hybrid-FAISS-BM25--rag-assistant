If you want to give a message in a popup window, you could put a message besides your iframe as a separate sibling element, displaying like a caption below the video. Since you can control the content of the window (for example, perhaps the popup loads yourwebsite/popupPlayer.html which contains an iframe), you could perhaps add a window.onunload trigger that communicates back to the main page. Alternatively, you could do (less elegant but more quick to code) var myWin = open('...'); then periodically check the myWin.closed property. Note that some browsers have popup blockers which may interact weirdly with what you're doing.
