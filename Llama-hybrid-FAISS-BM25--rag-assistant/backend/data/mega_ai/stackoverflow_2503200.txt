SQL Server keeps track of some things for you, so try running some of these queries on your system: Wayback Machine: Uncover Hidden Data to Optimize Application Performance here is an example from the link: --Identifying Most Costly Queries by I/O SELECT TOP 10 [Average IO] = (total_logical_reads + total_logical_writes) / qs.execution_count ,[Total IO] = (total_logical_reads + total_logical_writes) ,[Execution count] = qs.execution_count ,[Individual Query] = SUBSTRING (qt.text,qs.statement_start_offset/2, (CASE WHEN qs.statement_end_offset = -1 THEN LEN(CONVERT(NVARCHAR(MAX), qt.text)) * 2 ELSE qs.statement_end_offset END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2) ,[Parent Query] = qt.text ,DatabaseName = DB_NAME(qt.dbid) FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) as qt ORDER BY [Average IO] DESC; the link contains many queries including ones for: Costly Missing Indexes, Logically Fragmented Indexes, Identifying Queries that Execute Most Often , etc...
