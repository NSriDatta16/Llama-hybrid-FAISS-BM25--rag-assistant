IE wrong paragraph using CSS float layout

I am learning XHTML and CSS and I got into trouble. On my learning page I am using CSS float layout. I have floted:left side menu, and to properly render text into content section I have set its margin to be exact same size as left menu. My problem is, that text in paragraph is wrongly shifted from the place where side munu ends. This happens only in IE 8, Its OK in Chrome. Please help. This is the site....
