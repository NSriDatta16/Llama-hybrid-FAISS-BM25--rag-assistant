It's definitely a bad idea. That said, it looks like it's probably possible. Something like (untested): var appDir:File = File.applicationDirectory; // uses app: URI, can't be written to var appPath:String = appDir.nativePath; var writeableAppDir:File = new File(appPath); var newFile:File = writeableAppDir.resolvePath("writeme.txt"); The nativePath and applicationDirectory documentation in the File class are full of warnings against this. Follow them. From the docs: Modifying content in the application directory is a bad practice, for security reasons. If you want to store application-specific data, consider using the application storage directory (File.applicationStorageDirectory). If you want any of the content in the application storage directory to have access to the application-priveleged functionality (AIR APIs), you can expose that functionality by using a sandbox bridge.
