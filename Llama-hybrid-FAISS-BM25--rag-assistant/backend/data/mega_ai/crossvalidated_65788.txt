If every observation is on the same scale (i.e. the same performance metric was used each day), then in general I would not recommend normalization, since the scores already have comparable location and spread information. Since the Z-transform of a random variable is a linear transformation that does not change the sign of the variable, and since the correlation operation is invariant to linear transformations that preserve sign, z-transforming columns and then clustering on columns with correlation distance will not be different than using the raw scores (See http://www.randomservices.org/random/expect/Covariance.html just after #8). Z-normalizing rows (within employee) will wipe out their average performance, which may be highly inappropriate, depending on your goals. If you are clustering days based on employee performance, presumably you would like a cluster of "high performing days", and a separate cluster of "low performing days." If this is the case, DO NOT use correlation distance, since it ignores mean differences. For example, correlation distance assigns a very low distance (=high similarity) to day 1 with scores (11,12,13,14,15) and day 2 with scores (2,2,3,4,5); and assigns a much higher distance to day 1 and day 3 with scores (12,13,12,13,12). This is probably not the sort of result you want. You probably want something like euclidean distance. It is imperative that you think carefully about your goals here and select normalization methods and distance metrics (not to mention clustering algorithms) accordingly.
