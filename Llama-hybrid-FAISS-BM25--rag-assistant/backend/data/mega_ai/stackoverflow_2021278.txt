Starting Development for Google Chrome....Getting Started Issues!

Our organization has decided that my project will be developed for internal use with the Google Chrome browser. So yesterday I started looking around the internet for just how I would go about doing that. I found the WebKit.org development tool and have been trying to install it using the instructions found here: http://webkit.org/building/tools.html I am installing on a Windows machine that does not have Visual Studio 2005, so following the directions I downloaded Visual C++ Express 2005. Now I am at: Install the Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK, then follow steps 2 and 3 of “How to: Use Visual C++ Express Edition with the Microsoft Platform SDK.” Except I can't follow steps 2 and 3 because when I go to try and run the program all I have in the menu is: Start -> Programs -> Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition -> Visual Studio Tools -> Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt which opens a command prompt. Can anyone tell me what I've done incorrectly? Additionally, do you HAVE to develop in WebKit? Or is that just the best way to work with the Chrome engine? Thanks! Leslie
