I think you're referring to WSRP From the docs http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/10953/wsrp-faq-draft-0.30.html Does WSRP have a concept of sessions? Yes. In a GetMarkup call, the Producer may optionally return a SessionContext, which contains a sessionID to identify the session. This should not be confused with a session which could be established between a user-agent (browser) and a Consumer.The Consumer should supply this sessionID on future invocations of getMarkup and performBlockingInteraction in order to not lose state the Producer is storing for the user's interactions. If a Consumer does not invoke this portlet before this interval, the Producer may terminate the session associated with the sessionID. For more information, search for sessionID in the WSRP Specification.
