Java has its fair share of criticism these days but in the area of tooling - it isn't justified. We are spoiled for choice; Eclipse, Netbeans, Intellij are the big three IDEs. All of them offer excellent levels of searching and Refactoring. Eclipse has the edge on Netbeans I think and Intellij is often ahead of Eclipse You can also use static analysis tools such as FindBugs, CheckTyle etc to find issues - i.e. excessively long methods and classes, overly complex code. If you really want to leverage your Python skills - take a look at Jython. Its a Python interpreter written in Java.
