Thanks for your help Macarthy. I ended up doing it this way SpellingScore.select("AVG(`spelling_scores`.`score`) AS average_score, AVG(`spelling_scores`.`time`) AS average_time, COUNT(*) AS question_count, user_id AS user_id").where(:user_id => users).group(:user_id).includes(:user).order('users.last') At least I've retained some ActiveRecord chaining.
