I don't think there is a core function that does this exactly and efficiently. Hence I would do this with loop/recur as follows: (loop [x initial-value] (if (pred x) x (recur (f x)))) Loop/recur is very efficient since it requires no additional storage and is implemented as a simple loop in the JVM. If you're going to do this a lot, then you can always encapsulate the pattern in a macro.
