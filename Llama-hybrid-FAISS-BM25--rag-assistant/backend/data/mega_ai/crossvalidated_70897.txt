One answer to your question is that least squares is a standard way to fit Gaussians to "some x and y data". However, your data are special in that they are fractions (probabilities) that must lie in [0,1]. What you are doing is fitting a curve which is for probability densities, so it is unaware of the upper limit. The fitted maximum exceeds 1 and is for a value of x just less than 0. So, from one point of view you fitted an impossible curve. Densities greater than 1 are certainly possible but probabilities greater than 1 certainly are not. You could scale your probabilities to densities, assuming that each is for a bin width 0.1. However, that would then ignore the fact that your largest value is the largest possible value, so you can't win everything either way. What you should be doing is a largely open question, as you would need to tell us more about your problem and your data to get better advice. But various comments spring to mind: Even if you have a really good reason to be focusing on Gaussians, I would think of other models too, asymmetric as well as symmetric. The data are presented as if already on a scale with time interval 0.1 s. If your data are finer, you should use exact times. If this is the actual time resolution, then be advised that the data are rather coarse for discriminating between possible models. Naturally, there may be excellent scientific or technical reasons for your time interval. One model popular in ecology for proportional abundances has been called the Gaussian logit, which in your terms is a logit for y fitted as a quadratic, with predictors x and x $^2$. Taking each value to represent 100 repetitions, I fitted this model in Stata: clear set obs 7 gen x = (_n - 4)/10 mat y = (10,45,90,100,60,10,5) gen y = y[1,_n] gen xsq = x^2 glm y x xsq , link(logit) family(binomial 100) gen py = y/100 twoway function invlogit(_b[_cons]+ _b[x]*x + _b[xsq]*x^2), ra(x) || scatter py x , scheme(s1color) legend(order(1 "predicted" 2 "observed")) xla(-.3(.1).3) ytitle(proportion) A reference for this model is Jongman, R.H.G., ter Braak, C.J.F. and van Tongerren, O.F.R. 1995. Data analysis in community and landscape ecology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The model fit is not especially encouraging. Note that in turn a limitation of, or more neutrally a fact about, this model is that it can never predict a maximum value of exactly 1 (or a minimum value of exactly 0). This model does concur with your least-square result in fitting a maximum for a negative x . However, you (apparently) don't have enough data for much more flexible models to be tried comfortably, unless there are parsimonious physically- or psychometrically-based models tailored to the purpose that can be tried.
