Undo is called rollback in SQL. Once you've done a commit , you can't undo it without getting into restoring backups. Note that doing a rollback will undo an entire transaction, which means every update, insert, and delete since the transaction began, which is usually since the last commit or rollback. This means that if you do two consecutive updates, you can't undo just the second one. Some databases provide "savepoints" which do allow this.
