I'm with Jason S -- use a C compiler if at all possible, even if you end up embedding a few lines of assembly language in your ".c" file using the "__asm" keyword. If you must write entire programs in assembler for the PIC, the recommended function call convention is at PIClist: PIC Paging and PCLATH .
