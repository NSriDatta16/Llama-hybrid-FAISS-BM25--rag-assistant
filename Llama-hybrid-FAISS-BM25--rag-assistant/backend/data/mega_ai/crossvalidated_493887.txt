Determining trend statistic for two time series

I have two time series: one with reported scatter plot points, and a solid line that represents a fit to the data based on other variables. Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gizOAV8ZjaATLm-Ihw4tc-PqZhDwTGyXibJUG20dvqk/edit?usp=sharing While the fit does not cover the magnitude exactly, I am more interested in the seasonal trend of peaks and falls, and how the fit line follows these. Is there some sort of statistical test that can represent this? R^2 does not do so, correct?
