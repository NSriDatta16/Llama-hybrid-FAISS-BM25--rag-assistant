On the terminal run systeminfo Example: C:\WINDOWS>systeminfo Host Name: ... OS Name: Microsoft Windows XP Professional OS Version: 5.1.2600 Service Pack 2 Build 2600 OS Manufacturer: Microsoft Corporation OS Configuration: Member Workstation OS Build Type: Multiprocessor Free Registered Owner: ... Registered Organization: ... Product ID: ... Original Install Date: 17/04/2009, 10:23:23 AM System Up Time: 0 Days, 0 Hours, 51 Minutes, 11 Seconds System Manufacturer: Dell Inc. (etc...) I believe there may be other ways also to find such info. For example, PCWizard shows some more detailed info about install date, boots since install, uptime, time since logon, etc.
