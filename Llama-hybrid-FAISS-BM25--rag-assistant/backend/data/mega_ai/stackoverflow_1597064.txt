It should be O(n*m) where m is the average length of a string in the list. For very small values of m then the algorithm will approach O(n) Build a hashtable of counts for each string length Iterate over your collection of strings, updating the hashtable accordingly, storing the current most prevelant number as an integer variable separate from the hashtable done.
