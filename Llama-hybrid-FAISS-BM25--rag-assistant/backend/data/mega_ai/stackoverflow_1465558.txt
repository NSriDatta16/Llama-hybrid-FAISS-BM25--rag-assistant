I am using the 'using' statement just as you described in your question to guarantee that the Brush, Pen, Font, whatever resource is disposed of properly. In my code, I find the using statements cleaner than having explicit .Dispose() calls scattered throughout. But that's just my preference. I agree with the answers above though: regardless of whether you prefer using statements or .Dispose calls, it's pretty important to clean up the resources manually, rather than relying on the garbage collector. (I was relying on the garbage collector at first and performance problems began to surface, even before things in the app were getting complicated.)
