You could try scapy . It's a python library to manipulate packets. You could capture a pcap session, with tcpdump , wireshark, whatever, and then replay the captured packets in arbitrary order with scapy. a=rdpcap("/spare/captures/isakmp.cap") for pkt in a.reverse(): sendp(pkt) Depending on how you catpured the packets you may need send(layer 3) rather than sendp(layer 2)
