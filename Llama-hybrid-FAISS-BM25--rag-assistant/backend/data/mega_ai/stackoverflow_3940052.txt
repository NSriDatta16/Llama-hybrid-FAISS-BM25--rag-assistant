Sql query building

I am just confused in building a SQL query. I tried to run it in pieces successfully but I have not been able to build it as a whole. This is the case: In table 'userseaches', user Rushi has been searched three times with different searchID's(primary key in 'searchtable') 10, 11, 12 . When I searched with searchID 10 I got 110 results, with 11 got 112 and with 12 I got 115 results. Now what I have to do is getting searches of ID's 11 and 12(latest two searches) , i.e 112 and 115, and getting the usernames of those users who are newly added in last search(112) i.e three users. I tried this with small pieces but it is hard to make it in whole. Please feel free to ask for details. Thank you in advance. ok below are the 3 tables: table mastersearches having fields : ID Name srchtime 1 aron 22:10:10 2 rushi 12:12:14 table usersearches having fields : ID masterID Name nooffriends 1 2 rushi 110 2 2 rushi 112 3 2 rushi 115 table searchtable having fields : ID searchID Name friends 1 2 mike 25 2 2 paine 51 . 112 2 kumar 87 113 3 bandy 23 . 227 3 ganua 15 ok. Now I want to just fetch three newly added users for the searchID 3. Now I tried with this (I got two ID's with searches with this query): select Name from usersearches where searchID in (11, 12) gave all the followers: But it is not able to fetch that newly added friends.
