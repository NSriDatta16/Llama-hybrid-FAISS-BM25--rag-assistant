C# WPF Text with links

I just found myself a new challenge: Make a Word Processor that is in handling more like the web than plain text. Designing a nice framework for this is what i cant wait to start with, but i do need to know what the possibilities are at the GUI side (it will probably have loads of GUI challenges). So the basic thing that I need some sort of Control where I can make parts of my text clickable / mouse-over-able. I'm kinda new to WPF and not sure how to do this. Has anybody an idea how to make this? Are there examples? Are there already controls for this? Thanks in advance EDIT: I found out some way to do it with a richtextbox: // Create a FlowDocument to contain content for the RichTextBox. FlowDocument myFlowDoc = new FlowDocument(); // Add paragraphs to the FlowDocument. Hyperlink myLink = new Hyperlink(); myLink.Inlines.Add("hyperlink"); myLink.NavigateUri = new Uri("http://www.stackoverflow.com"); // Create a paragraph and add the Run and hyperlink to it. Paragraph myParagraph = new Paragraph(); myParagraph.Inlines.Add("check this link out: "); myParagraph.Inlines.Add(myLink); myFlowDoc.Blocks.Add(myParagraph); // Add initial content to the RichTextBox. richTextBox1.Document = myFlowDoc; I now get a nice hyperlink in my textbox... except when i click it, nothing happens. what am i missing here?
