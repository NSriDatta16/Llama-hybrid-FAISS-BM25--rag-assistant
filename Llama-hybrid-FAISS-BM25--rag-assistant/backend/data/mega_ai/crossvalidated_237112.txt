Comparisons between simulation methods are only about efficiency as they all produce an output that is supposed to be from the same target distribution. Hence, you cannot expect one simulation method (like MCMC) to produce more rare events than another one, as those rare events are supposed to occur at the correct (and rare) rate. The inverse cdf transform approach, namely to return $F^{-}(U)$ when $U$ is $\mathscr{U}(0,1)$, as distributed from $F$. is mathematically correct. It may become inefficient when computing $F^{-1}$ is too demanding. If the software of your choice includes a code for this inverse, there is no need to seek further, unless you are worried at the precision of the inversion (but then need to find another method with a higher numerical precision!). If the inverse cdf is not coded and requires a heavy coding investment, it is more efficient to seek generic methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which suffer from the drawback of not guaranteeing simulations that come exactly from the target. These are asymptotic methods in that the distribution of the simulation only converges to the target distribution when the number of Markov steps grows to infinity (except in special cases where convergence can be validated after a finite number of steps). But these also are generic methods that require less coding and planning, hence more efficient methods in the sense that computer time is rather cheap, when compared with the coder's own time.
