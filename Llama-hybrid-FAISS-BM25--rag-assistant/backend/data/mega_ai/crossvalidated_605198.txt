Power Regression Unit Conversion

Say I have fit parameters $a, b, c$ for a power regression model (using SGD and a MSE loss), $$y = ax^b + c.$$ Suppose the derived $a, b, c$ fit the data very well. Now suppose $x$ undergoes a change in units, so that $\tilde{x} \equiv x + \alpha$ , and now I want to fit a model $$y = a'\tilde{x} ^ {b'} + c'.$$ Is there a way to leverage the previous $a, b, c$ for fitting the new $a', b', c'$ ? Perhaps either by some formula converting $a \rightarrow a', b \rightarrow b', c \rightarrow c'$ , or some way to initialize $a', b', c'$ to facilitate learning? I find that I get stuck in suboptimal minima when using SGD with $\{\tilde{x}, y\}$ , and cannot fit as good a model as with $\{x, y\}$ . I think this is an interesting problem, because in theory units should not affect the ultimate goodness of fit our model achieves.
