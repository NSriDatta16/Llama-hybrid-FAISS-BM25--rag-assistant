Website Structure

I'm pretty new to php and i'm trying to decide the best way to organize the pages and, using PHP, deliver them. The two (basic) ideas I've had are: A bunch of individual pages all with PHP includes to have the header, footer, and menu. A single main page that has the menu, header, and footer, along with an include for the main content. The page name comes from a variable in the URL. Does anyone have any other suggestions or ideas? This is pretty basic stuff, but figured I'd see if anyone has any better ideas. Thanks
