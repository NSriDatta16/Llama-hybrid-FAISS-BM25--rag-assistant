This is not possible. The best you can do is compute the difference in means for each gene, but in a new tissue sample this difference may be of a different size. This means there is a variance attached to the difference in means and you would need to know (or estimate) the size of this variance to be able to identify the genes with the strongest effect size (or lowest p-values, for example). I can think of one helpful alternative analysis. You could try to cluster the genes into $k$ groups based on the two tissue samples. This would help you to identify groups of genes that on average differ.
