Test if one of many factors improved performance

We give customer surveys and obtain millions of customer satisfaction scores every year. We have 100 measurable factors related to the scores, such as service type, date, zip code, etc. One department worked on improving one of the factors (e.g., checkout time) this year and would like to see if their work positively affected the scores. But we would like to exclude the impact of other factors. This is the method I can think of: Create a predictive model (e.g., random forest) with the 99 factors besides the one got improved as the predictor variables, and customer satisfaction scores as the response variables. Train the model with last year's data (before improvement), and use it to predict this year's scores. Somehow check if the model is accurate enough (maybe hold some of last year's data to test), and check if the actual scores this year are significantly higher than the predicted ones. Is there any standard method to do this kind of study?
