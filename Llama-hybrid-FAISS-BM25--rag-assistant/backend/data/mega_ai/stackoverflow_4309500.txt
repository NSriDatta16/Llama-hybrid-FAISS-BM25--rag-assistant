I don't see a good reason to ditch JS flash embedding. SWFObject is pretty ubiquitous these days (pseudo-standard even!), and even Adobe recommends using it . It makes sticky things like handling player version requirements and allowing the user to update their Flash plugin easy and straight forward. SWFObject aside, it's my opinion that being able to use client side logic to embed content for any plugin will always be the way to go; it affords more opportunity to read into your user's environment, and deliver the appropriate content. I suppose an argument can be made that it adds yet another requirement on the client side to deliver your content, but I think the vast majority of user's will have JS enabled... especially the users who are willing to consume Flash media. Hope that helps :)
