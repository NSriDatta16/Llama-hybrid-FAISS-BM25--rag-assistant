how to create an element inside a tiny mce editor?

I want to create a node such as paragraph, h1, h2 etc inside a tiny mce editor. Could not find any reference in documentation. :( I have tried following code. It works perfect in FF but not in IE. Kindly help. tinyMCE.activeEditor.selection.setNode(tinyMCE.activeEditor.dom.create('p', {id : 'paraId'},'new paragrapg created')); Thanks
