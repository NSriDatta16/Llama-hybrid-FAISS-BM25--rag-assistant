As others commented the lasso-type regularization can be used within NL contexts-I think the important is what are you referring to by nonlinear model? is that it is nonlinear in its predictors or inits estimation? for non linear parameters you can look at splines or GAM, GBM or xgboost( which they are both based on boosting framework, similar to random forest). the latter two give you variable importance... the first two give you the significant factors and their p-value.
