Free schedule/timetable GUI library for .NET

Does anyone know of any good free libraries providing Windows Forms controls for displaying schedules/timetables in .NET? I'm really looking for something similar to what the guy who asked this question was seeking, with a couple of differences: I don't need any help organizing the underlying data or generating the schedule (that's all set) -- I just want a clean way of displaying it. I'm actually looking for a custom control in Windows Forms, not an ASP.NET control. One thing I've considered doing is just using a TableLayoutPanel control, but ideally I'm looking for something that will be more straightforward code-wise (as in, something actually designed for displaying a timetable) and sharper-looking visually.
