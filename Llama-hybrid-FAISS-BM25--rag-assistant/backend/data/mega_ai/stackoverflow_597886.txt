"Getting started" questions for NUnit (or NUnitLite) and .NET CF

I have an existing VS 2005 Std .NET Compact Framework application that I want to do some major refactorings on. Currently there is no unit testing in place, but I want to add this before messing with the code. I have no practical experience with unit testing, even though I know the theory (just never got around actually implementing it; I know: shame on me :-)) Here are some questions I am pondering at the moment: a) As a beginner, should I use NUnit or NUnitLite (which claims to be easier to use)? b) Should I aim for running the tests on the mobile device or on the desktop (except for device-specific code of course)? Currently the desktop looks more appealing, especially for including the tests in automated builds... c) How is the class that I want to test usually included in the test project? My application is a .EXE file, i.e. I can not just reference it like a .DLL assembly from the test project (or can I? Never tried this ...). I checked various NUnit tutorials but either found no mention of that, or one tutorial suggested to copy and paste the class that I want to test into the test project (yuk!). Should I link to the original source code file in my test project? What about private methods, or dependencies on other classes? d) Should I start modifying my original code to allow better testability, e.g. make private methods public, decouple etc.? This is a bit like refactoring before being able to test, which does not sound good to me ... Or is it better practice to not touch the original code at all in the beginning, even if this means less code coverage etc.? e) Should I look into any other tools or addons that most people use? Thanks in advance for any answers (I also appreciate answers if they are only to one or some of the above items).
