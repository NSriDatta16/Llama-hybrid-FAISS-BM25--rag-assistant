Text manipulation in Java

I have a string with this format: "key=some value|otherkey=other value|key3=yet another value" I need to create a function with this signature: public String update(String all,String key, String value) Where all is the previous string, key the given key to replace (or add) and value the new value. I thought about some solutions but they are hard to read and not very elegant. I was hoping one of you guys could come with something that looks better. PS: I have no problem in using regexes but it needs to be done without any 3rd party lib, just the standar java lib. Thanks!
