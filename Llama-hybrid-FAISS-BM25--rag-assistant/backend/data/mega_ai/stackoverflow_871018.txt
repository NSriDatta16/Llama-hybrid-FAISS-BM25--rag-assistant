I found a way to handle events raised by objects in the DataTemplate. (1) attach event handlers to the ItemsControl (2) to find out which item the event applies to, treat the OriginalSource as a FrameworkElement, and get its DataContext: void Node_DragStarted(object sender, DragStartedEventArgs e) { var os = (FrameworkElement)e.OriginalSource; var vm = os.DataContext as ItemViewModel; if (vm != null) // do something with the item ViewModel }
