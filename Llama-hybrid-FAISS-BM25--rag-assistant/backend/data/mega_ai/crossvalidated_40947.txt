Can confidence interval be equal to zero?

Good day! I'm doing a study on appropriateness of empiric therapy, and did a logistic regression using the outcome (death or survival) as dependent variable with age and blood culture result as independent variables. The results showed that the odds ratio for age is 2.97E006 CI:0. I asked the technical support of the software I'm using if this was an error result. I only have 107 cases and there were no cell values with zero frequencies in the 2 independent variables. The tech support reply was, it is an undefined confidence interval. What does it mean to have an undefined CI? Is it safe to report a result of a zero CI, in medical field.
