A variable (singular) can and usually does vary. A variate (singular) never varies - it is a realisation, a raw value. A deviate is the output of a calculation, not a raw datum. As the name suggests, every variate becomes a deviate once subtracted from the mean, for example. The deviate-du-jour divided by the average deviate is the T statistic. ie The SNR.
