The latter approach is preferred since the time difference must be invariant/constant for an ACF/PACF to be useful for model identification purposes. Intervention Detection can be iteratively used to estimate the missing values while accounting for the auto-correlative structure. One can invert the time series-- i.e. , go from latest to earliest to estimate missing values--and then reverse the process (normal view) to tune the missing value estimates.
