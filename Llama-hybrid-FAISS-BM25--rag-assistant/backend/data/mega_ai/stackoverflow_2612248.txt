There's probably some object or outlet in ThirdViewController.xib that you've forgotten to configure or misconfigured. Compare and contrast ThirdViewController.xib and GamePlayViewController.xib, paying close attention to how you've configured ThirdViewController.xib's class names and outlets. In particular: Make sure your File's Owner is properly set to ThirdViewController. Make sure the view outlet of the File's Owner is properly connected to its view.
