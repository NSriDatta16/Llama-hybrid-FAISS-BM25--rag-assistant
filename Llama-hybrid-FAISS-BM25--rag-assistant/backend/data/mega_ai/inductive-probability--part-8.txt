he ubiquitous factual "why" question. For example, for the condition F is "Why do apples fall?". The answer is a theory T that implies that apples fall; F = G m 1 m 2 r 2 {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}} Inductive inference is of the form, All observed objects in a class C have a property P. Therefore there is a probability that all objects in a class C have a property P. In terms of abductive inference, all objects in a class C or set have a property P is a theory that implies the observed condition, All observed objects in a class C have a property P. So inductive inference is a general case of abductive inference. In common usage the term inductive inference is often used to refer to both abductive and inductive inference. Generalization and specialization Inductive inference is related to generalization. Generalizations may be formed from statements by replacing a specific value with membership of a category, or by replacing membership of a category with membership of a broader category. In deductive logic, generalization is a powerful method of generating new theories that may be true. In inductive inference generalization generates theories that have a probability of being true. The opposite of generalization is specialization. Specialization is used in applying a general rule to a specific case. Specializations are created from generalizations by replacing membership of a category by a specific value, or by replacing a category with a sub category. The Linnaen classification of living things and objects forms the basis for generalization and specification. The ability to identify, recognize and classify is the basis for generalization. Perceiving the world as a collection of objects appears to be a key aspect of human intelligence. It is the object oriented model, in the non computer science sense. The object oriented model is constructed from our perception. In particularly vision is based on the ability to compare two images and calculate how much information is needed to morph or map one image into another. Computer vision uses this mapping to construct 3D images from stereo image pairs. Inductive logic programming is a means of constructing theory that implies a condition. Plotkin's "relative least general generalization (rlgg)" approach constructs the simplest generalization consistent with the condition. Newton's use of induction Isaac Newton used inductive arguments in constructing his law of universal gravitation. Starting with the statement, The center of an apple falls towards the center of the Earth. Generalizing by replacing apple for object, and Earth for object gives, in a two body system, The center of an object falls towards the center of another object. The theory explains all objects falling, so there is strong evidence for it. The second observation, The planets appear to follow an elliptical path. After some complicated mathematical calculus, it can be seen that if the acceleration follows the inverse square law then objects will follow an ellipse. So induction gives evidence for the inverse square law. Using Galileo's observation that all objects drop with the same speed, F 1 = m 1 a 1 = m 1 k 1 r 2 i 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}=m_{1}a_{1}={\frac {m_{1}k_{1}}{r^{2}}}i_{1}} F 2 = m 2 a 2 = m 2 k 2 r 2 i 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}=m_{2}a_{2}={\frac {m_{2}k_{2}}{r^{2}}}i_{2}} where i 1 {\displaystyle i_{1}} and i 2 {\displaystyle i_{2}} vectors towards the center of the other object. Then using Newton's third law F 1 = − F 2 {\displaystyle F_{1}=-F_{2}} F = G m 1 m 2 r 2 {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}} Probabilities for inductive inference Implication determines condition probability as, T → F ⟺ P ( F | T ) = 1 {\displaystyle T\to F\iff P(F|T)=1} So, P ( F | T ) = 1 {\displaystyle P(F|T)=1} L ( F | T ) = 0 {\displaystyle L(F|T)=0} This result may be used in the probabilities given for Bayesian hypothesis testing. For a single theory, H = T and, P ( T | F ) = P ( T ) P ( F ) {\displa
