Choosing between multinomial logistic regression or binary logistic regression for interchangeable variables

I want to estimate how likely a disease is associated with symptom (dummy hypothesis). Say that I want to assess which of avian flu, swine flu, and common flu is more commonly associated with fever. In this case, I can use binary logistic regression However, it's also possible to say that "I want to estimate if fever is more common in avian flu, swine flu, or common flu", in which I should use multinomial logistic regression. The problem is, if I use multinomial logistic regression, when I use avian flu as the reference and compare avian flu vs common flu, the estimates are different when I invert the reference category i.e., using common flu as the reference category and compare common flu vs avian flu. This makes interpreting the results harder. In this case, is it valid to use the 1st hypothesis: "which disease is more commonly associated with fever" and use binary logistic regression instead? In that case, changing reference category of independent variables are much easier than changing reference category of dependent variables Which are the best approach? Thanks in advance
