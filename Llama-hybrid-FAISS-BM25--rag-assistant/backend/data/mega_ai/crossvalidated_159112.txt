Testing whether sampling (convex polytope) is uniform

Currently, I am sampling points from: i) a convex polytope (i.e. Ax ii) a high dimensional simplex The algorithms I am using are hit-and-run and a simple version of Bayesian bootstrap. I want to know whether my sampling is uniform. From a holistic point of view, what would be some good tests to see whether my sampling is truly uniform or not? I am confused as to how to begin. (My implementation is in R. The sampled points are N dimensional vectors, and the simplex and polytope are represented by matricies. Both general ideas and specific implementation would be much appreciated. Thank you so much!)
