You can manually add each word index as additional vector to the word embedding, and this applies to a set of word embedding techniques, like Glove. For example, while forming the words representation from a sentence, you get each word embedding from Glove dictionary, and let us assume that it returns 50 vectors. Now add additional vector that represents the word index, so the new word embedding consists of 51 vectors, I tested this technique and was helpful in enhancing my model's performance. Check this Python code: words_embeddings = [] for i in range(len(sentence)): single_word_emd = glove_dict[ sentence[i] ] single_word_emd.append(i) words_embeddings.append(single_word_emd)
