Neural Networks are still used for two reasons. They are easy to understand for people who don't want to delve into the math of a more complicated algorithm. They have a really good name. I mean when you role into a CEO's office to sell him your model which would you rather say, Neural Network or Support Vector Machine. When he asks how it works you can just say "just like the neurons in your brain", which is something most people understand. If you try and explain a support vector machine Mr. CEO is going to be lost (Not because he is dumb but because SVMs are harder to understand). Sometimes they are still useful however I think that the training time is often just too long.
