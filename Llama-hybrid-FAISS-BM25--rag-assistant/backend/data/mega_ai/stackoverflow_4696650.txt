I find the technique described in The Humble Dialog Box very effective in test-driving my GUIs. Essentially, each GUI class is broken up into 3 classes and an interface: (1) the logic controller, which defines how the logic of the GUI behaves (changing labels, are things enabled? etc) fully testable and has no dependencies on the actual GUI, but does depend on (2) the view interface, which defines how the logic controller will interact with the GUI later. (3) The actual GUI class, which is a very thin wrapper to the real GUI library. Finally, (4) the fake view, which you use for testing to prove that your logic controller will manipulate the GUI correctly. It may seem like a lot of work at first, but I encourage you to try it. I have had very few problems with my GUIs since I started doing this. The up-front work saves major headaches (and time) later.
