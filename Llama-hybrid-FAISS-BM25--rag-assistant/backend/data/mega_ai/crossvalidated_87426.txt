Easily speaking: Target population is the population you are interested in your study; Study population is a sub population that you are taking from the target population for doing your study Theoretical population is the same as target population, which is the population you want your study to be generalized to. For example , you want to do a study: the average height of all men between age 20 to 30 in Canada , then the target and theoretical population is all men between age 20 to 30; and your study population would be say all men between age 20 to 30 in Ontario.
