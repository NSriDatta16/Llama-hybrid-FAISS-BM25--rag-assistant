Can I deal with a missing not at random column by creating a new column? (Feature engineering)

Task: Binary classification Example problem: Let's say we have two feature columns A and B. A has no nulls and is a binary column if a user completed an action (=1), 0 if they didn't. For all users that completed the action, B is the resultant score. As a result, B has nulls for those that didn't complete the action (missing not at random as the nulls are dependent in B are due to A). To deal with this missing not at random problem, is it possible to create a new variable that is equal to 1 if the user completes the action and achieves a certain score, 0 otherwise? The column B is valuable but I'm trying to find a good way of dealing with the nulls. A B 1 94 0 0 1 45
