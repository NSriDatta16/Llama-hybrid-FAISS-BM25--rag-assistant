Get Yule Walker estimates from autocorrelations

I'm looking to be able to estimate parameters of an AR(2) time series using the sample autocovariances. I have: gamma_hat_0 = 130 gamma_hat_1 = 111 gamma_hat_2 = 60 gamma_hat_3 = 9 and I need to estimate the parameters: phi_1 phi_2 sigma_sq My first thought was to simulate the time series and extract the parameters estimates that way, but I can't find a way of simulating an AR(2) process using just the autocovariances. Is there a way? Am I approaching this incorrectly, would a mathematical approach be easier? If so, is there any resource that people know of to show how I can estimate the model params from the autocovariances?
