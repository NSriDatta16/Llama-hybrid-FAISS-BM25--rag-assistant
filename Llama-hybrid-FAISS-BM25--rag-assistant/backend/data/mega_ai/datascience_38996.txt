Yes, you can fine-tune your embeddings while using pre-trained word vectors. If you are using tensorflow, in your tf.get_variable parameter, set trainable=True . The reason it will work is that the only 2M words will be taken from the pre-trained embeddings. Those embeddings will already be close to a local optimum and can be further optimized in very few iterations.
