If you are using 2.0, you can encrypt the viewstate. See this Channel9 article . AES is good enough encryption for the US military and federal government. While DES could be cracked in hours, AES requires 150 trillion (with year 2001 hardware) years to crack AES. Even with faster and more distributed hardware, your viewstate is not worth the resources required for a malicious user to crack it. Unless you think the machine keys are somehow insecure, I'm not sure what security risk encryption poses. As for performance, viewstate with sensitive data is a tradeoff between storing data in valuable memory server side or using valuable CPU cycles to encrypt data (especially in 2.0 where you can configure " server side viewstate "). You may want to gather some empirical evidence with your work load and specific hardware to find out what the true trade offs are. If it isn't too late to design your application to store state in session instead of viewstate, you may also want to consider SqlSessionStore,which is secure (server side) and doesn't use much server side memory. If you are using 1.1, then all the discouraging advice about putting sensitive data into viewstate is 100% correct because decoding viewstate from 1.1 (or unencrypted viewstate from 2.0 for that matter), is a trivial task.
