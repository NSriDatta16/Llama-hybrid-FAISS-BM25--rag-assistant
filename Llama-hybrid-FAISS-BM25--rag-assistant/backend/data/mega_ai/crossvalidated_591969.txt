Since terminology is so confusing someone invented the term "self-supervised" to describe autoencoders learning mode: I now call it “self-supervised learning”, because “unsupervised” is both a loaded and confusing term. … Self-supervised learning uses way more supervisory signals than supervised learning, and enormously more than reinforcement learning. That’s why calling it “unsupervised” is totally misleading. by Yann LeCun (2019. 04. 30) AI602: Recent Advances in Deep Learning: Lecture 07 Essentially, "unsupervised" means "learns from data not curated by humans" which is not what "not supervised" in the colloquial sense of the word "supervision" actually means. Self-supervised better describes how an autoencoder really works.
