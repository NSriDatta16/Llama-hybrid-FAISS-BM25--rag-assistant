forecasting imputed data

My data set consists of a 15 year time series of monthly water quality measurements (10 different measurements). The data set has ~30% missingness. I applied multiple imputation using the Amelia II package, and imputed 10 data sets. I want to forecast several of these variables separately using ARIMA models. My question is, for any given variable of interest, if I fit an ARIMA model to each of the 10 imputed data sets, and average the models using Rubin's rules to create a single model, if I want to forecast values using the combined model, what data do I forecast on? In other words, once I have a combined model and want to use it for forecasting, which of the 10 data sets do I then use as a basis to calculate future values? Should I average the values of the 10 sets and apply the combined model to that?
