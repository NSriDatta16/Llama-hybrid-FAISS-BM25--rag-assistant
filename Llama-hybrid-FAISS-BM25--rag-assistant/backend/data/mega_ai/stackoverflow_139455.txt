We always use Gannt charts in the project planning. They are always useful - after everything is said and done Gannt chart is one of the best tool to visualize your project. It is however a tool. If the tool is used properly it is effective. It if it is not it could be counter-effective. You need to know how to plan your project properly. You need to understand what should be included in the the list of task and how. For example for an IT project it is almost always useless going down to the level of individual assignments (create a table for storing using data ). Keep it on the story level ( allow users to login ), assign the whole team to it and the planning will become much easier. Later on you could always go down to the individual tasks level and you could create a separate project plan to handle the assignments for an separate task.
