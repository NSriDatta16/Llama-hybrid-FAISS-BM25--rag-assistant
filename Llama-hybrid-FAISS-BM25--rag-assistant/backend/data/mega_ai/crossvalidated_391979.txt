How to predict routes using clustering data

I've been working on a ship route prediction algorithm such that given the past and current trajectory of a ship I am able to estimate the future one. The trajectories are represented as a sequence of coordinates (latitude,longitude). This is what I have done so far: Route clustering: Using past information of ship trajectories within an area of interest, group these routes according to proximity and similarity, as illustrated in this image: Classification: Given the past and current trajectory of the target ship, determine its corresponding cluster, e.g. the black line is the current trajectory and it should be associated with the blue cluster: Prediction: Predict the upcoming trajectory. I was successful in steps 1 and 2 and I'm trying to figure out how to proceed with step 3. First I tried to perform linear regression to each cluster in order its "identifying route" and then try to overlap it with the black line. Unfortunately this is not good in many scenarios, e.g. by moving the line it may end up overlapping land when the cluster is near shore. I tried to use a neural network trained to accept sequences of (lat,lon) points as input and output the next ones, but I had little success in terms of precision. I wonder if I am looking at this all wrong and if there are better approaches to address step 3. Does anyone have any suggestions?
