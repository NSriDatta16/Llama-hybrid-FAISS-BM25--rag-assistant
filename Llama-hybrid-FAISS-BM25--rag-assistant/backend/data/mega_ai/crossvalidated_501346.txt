Multiple comparison correction for confidence interval

I am trying to understand multiple-comparisons adjustment for confidence intervals. I came across the following links on the topic, but a few things are not clear to me. Stanford lecture: Section 2 on Multiple confidence intervals and Section 3 on Coverage after selection Cross Validated: Simultaneous and selective confidence intervals Cross Validated: Selected parameters and candidate parameters All these links talk about the distinction between these two cases: (i) when a set of parameters are selected from the candidate parameters, (ii) when all candidate parameters are used. Is there a difference in how you adjust for multiple comparisons in these two cases? Here is a concrete example: I have done 10 regression analyses, which I have grouped into two groups of five analyses. The grouping is based on domain knowledge. Let's say group 1 is related to a certain type of plants and group 2 is related to certain other type of plants. Now within each group, I have five confidence intervals. Currently, I am doing the following steps to account for multiple comparisons: Select significant associations in each group, and denote the number of significant associations by s1 In each group, apply Bonferroni correction to construct confidence intervals for the selected associations. Is this a valid method? Or should I apply Bonferroni correction to all five confidence intervals (instead of s1 and s2)? Additionally, is there a way to apply FDR to these confidence intervals?
