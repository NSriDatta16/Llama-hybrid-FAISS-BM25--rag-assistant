What are the implications of a perfect fit model?

I perform logistic regression with a relatively small dataset (N=65), using 12 parameters (11 variables, one constant, no interactions), which results in a perfectly fitting model (in SPSS). I have a few questions about this: Is it correct to say that the model saturated, or is that only the case if there are less data points than parameters? Is there a difference between a saturated model and an overparameterized model? What should I do, if anything, with the fact that this does model result in a perfect fit? I perform this test as a robustness check, iterations of the model that leave out some of the parameters corroborate the main findings. I don't necessarily need coefficient estimates of this model, because I'm mostly interested in the signs and I obtained those from a previous test (same regression, but differently defined variables). Thank you in advance.
