Out of the box, mvn site should at least generate an index page (and leverage the name and the description from the POM of your project) and a basic set of reports (About, Issue Tracking, Project Team, Dependencies, Project Plugins, Continuous Integration, Source Repository, Project License, Mailing Lists, Plugin Management, Project Summary). If you want to customize the set of reports, you can configure the Maven Project Info Reports Plugin (in the reporting section) to include only the reports you want: ... org.apache.maven.plugins maven-project-info-reports-plugin 2.2 dependencies project-team mailing-list cim issue-tracking license scm ... ... If you want to customize the site, you'll need to provide a site descriptor ( src/site/site.xml by default). In that case, you'll have to include a entry for the above reports. If you want to add content , you'll have to provide it using one of the supported format (e.g. APT, FML, XDoc). Most of time, APT is used nowadays. Check the documentation of the Maven Site Plugin for more details.
