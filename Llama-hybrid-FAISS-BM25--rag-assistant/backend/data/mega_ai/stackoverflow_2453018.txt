stackoverflow isn't meant to be for subjective questions and discussion, so to keep it brief: is it viable in a large environment? Yes, it's already in use in large environments, both across open source foundations and corporations. A lot of what Maven provides through it's centralisation, reuse and easy sharing is designed to facilitate multiple different teams or organisations collaborating. Like anything - you'll get out what you put in. Spend the time implementing the infrastructure you need and designing the organisational structure and project patterns that you'll need and it will pay back dividends. I'm sure for more details you can find plenty of examples (positive and negative) across the web and particularly on the users@maven.apache.org list.
