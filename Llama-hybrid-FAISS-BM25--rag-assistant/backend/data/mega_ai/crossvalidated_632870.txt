What are some good resources on Bayesian unconditional power analysis, besides John Uebersax's article?

I refer to the article " Bayesian Unconditional Power Analysis " by John S. Uebersax (2007). I'd like to explore the subject further. I haven't checked yet the references that the Uebersax's article mentions, but I was wondering it there are other good references or resources about the subject. I'm looking preferably, but not necessarily, for resources that use numerical examples, to check if I do not misinterpret some formulas or algorithms.
