I am downloading a file using Python urllib2. How do I check how large the file size is?

And if it is large...then stop the download? I don't want to download files that are larger than 12MB. request = urllib2.Request(ep_url) request.add_header('User-Agent',random.choice(agents)) thefile = urllib2.urlopen(request).read()
