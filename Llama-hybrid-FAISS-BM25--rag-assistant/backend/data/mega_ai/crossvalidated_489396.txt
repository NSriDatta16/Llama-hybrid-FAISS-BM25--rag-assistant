Cross validation confusion on the concept

I am getting confused with the concept of cross validation in machine learning. Suppose I have divided my training set in 3 folds: A,B,C. When I am training my model using 3 fold cv, I am training it as follows: On A,B (validating on C) On B,C (validating on A) On A,C (validating on B) So essentially I am training my model on each fold (A,B,and C) twice. My question is how will this method be any different from training the model on entire training set (ABC) twice, since even with cv each fold is used twice for training? Any guidance on this confusion will be very helpful.
