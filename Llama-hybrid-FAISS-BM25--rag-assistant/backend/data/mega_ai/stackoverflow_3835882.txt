Objective C / iPhone: How do I extract the actual unicode date format strings for the current region?

According to this site: http://iosdevelopertips.com/cocoa/date-formatter-examples.html there is a class that handles formatting, which takes in a set of constants/enums (e.g. NSDateFormatterShortStyle) to the "setDateStyle" property/method. Somehow the NSDateFormatter knows to retrieve the proper locale-specific date format. What I want is to be able to retrieve the default formats based on the user's choice of region format. I have a feeling it is stored in NSLocale, but that does not seem to expose anything that will retrieve the format strings. Is there a way to extract the formats? It has to be in memory somewhere; I'm hoping the retrieval mechanism is exposed somewhere. I've looked in several places, but the only answers I get are a lesson on how to create an NSDate from a custom format.
