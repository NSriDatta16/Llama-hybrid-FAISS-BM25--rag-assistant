There are occasions when getters/setters are appropriate but an abundance of getters/setters typically indicate that your design fails to achieve any higher level of abstraction. Typically it's better (in regards to encapsulation) to exhibit higher level operations for your objects that does not make the implementation obvious to the user. Some other possible reasons why it's not as common in C++ as in Java: The Standard Library does not use it. Bjarne Stroustrup expresses his dislike towards it (last paragraph): I particularly dislike classes with a lot of get and set functions. That is often an indication that it shouldn't have been a class in the first place. It's just a data structure. And if it really is a data structure, make it a data structure.
