Quantile regression does not give expected result regarding costs

I want to predict the length of an event. When I underestimate the event length it costs me 2€ (per minute) while an overestimation costs 1€ (per minute). To capture this price inbalance I tried using LightGBM quantile regression with alpha=0.67 (67% quantile). My expectation was that this would perfectly translate my business objective into a machine-learning objective but out of curiosity I ran several checks with many different runs and it turns out that the 71%-quantile creates the lowest costs for me on average when I do an overall cost calculation with the aforementioned numbers using the actual and the predicted values of the different models. How is that possible?
