In Eclipse, why additional plugin break the Android plug-in?

I had Eclipse running with the Android plug-in and I decided to add the Emacs plug-in. I downloaded and it worked. Then I decided to go back to the Eclipse key bindings and the Android plug-in disappeared. I could not update it, because Eclipse said it was installed, but it was not showing up in the menu. I had to re download Eclipse, and reinstall the plug-in. Why don't different plug-ins cooperate? I had the same issue when I tried to download the Blackberry plug-in alongside the Android plug-in (in different workspaces) and that also did not work. The only solution is to have two separate Eclipse each with a different plug-in. Am i doing something wrong or is Eclipse that fragile! Thanks for any comments.
