You dont need K-means, you need to build a time series/ state based model based on history that predicts the probability of opening door in next time stamp.So steps would be- 1) build an expected relation using time series/regression/ state based model.[like for regression you can have variables- day or night, hour of the day, weekday weekend, difference of time in opening gate again etctec.) 2) forecast door opening probability in next time stamp. 3) compare with actual data( door open or not). 4) difference of 2 and 3 is 'degree of abnormal behaviour'
