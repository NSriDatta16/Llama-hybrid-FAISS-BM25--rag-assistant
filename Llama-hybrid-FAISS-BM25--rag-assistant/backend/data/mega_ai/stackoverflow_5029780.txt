We iteratively evaluate PR. PR(x) = Sum(PR(a)*weight(a), a in in_links) by map ((url,PR), out_links) //PR = random at start for link in out_links emit(link, ((PR/size(out_links)), url)) reduce(url, List[(weight, url)): PR =0 for v in weights PR = PR + v Set urls = all urls from list emit((url, PR), urls) so the output equals input and we can do this until coverage.
