it was suggested to me to take the PCA of just normals and then project the patients into this space but how to do that is unclear This is not difficult. Let's say that your control subjects data is combined in one matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with 25 rows and 2000 columns, and your patients' data -- in one matrix $\mathbf{Y}$ with 12 rows and 2000 columns. When you do PCA of your control subjects, you will get up to 24 (number of subjects minus 1) principal axes. Each principle axis is a vector in 2000-dimensional space. If you take the first principal axis $\mathbf{u}$ then you can project your control data onto this axis, obtaining $\mathbf{z_x} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{u}$. This is the first principal component, it consists of 25 values, one for each subject. Now if you need to project patients on the same axis, you simply compute $\mathbf{z_y} = \mathbf{Y}\mathbf{u}$. This will be a vector of length 12, the projection you were looking for. Note that I would rather take two first principal axes and not just one, because then the projection onto this two-dimensional space can be nicely plotted as a scatter-plot. You can plot all your controls as black dots, and all your patients as red dots, this will give you a clear visualization.
