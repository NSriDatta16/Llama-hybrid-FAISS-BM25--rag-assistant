Another approach would be to use the NSDictionary method writeToFile; which will write an NSDictionary (which sounds like it would solve your storage needs). Then to reinflate the data on startup you would get a path to the plist file (written by writeToFile) and then the NSMutableDictionary initWIthContentsOfFile: path. Take a look in "iPhone SDK Application Development", by Jonathan Zdziarski, at Chapter 11: Application Settings. Or take a look at the more detailed File and Data Management chapter of Apple's iPhone Application Programming Guide. I was in the same boat as you, thinking I'd need SQLLite to store data downloaded from a web service. I replaced the web service with a simpler process that handles JSON requests and returns my data in an NSDictionary format. Then I use the JSON SDK 2.2 for the iPhone to take the incoming JSON data and store it in an NSDictionary. Then when I can easily store the data in the plist as mentioned above. This is working for me, but depending on what you are doing with your data maybe you need something different. Good luck.
