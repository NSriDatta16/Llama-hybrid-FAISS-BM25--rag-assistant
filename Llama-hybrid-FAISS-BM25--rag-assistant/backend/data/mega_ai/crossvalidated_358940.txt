How is the family of distributions with PDF proportional to $(1+ax^2)^{-1/a}$ called?

Consider a family of distributions with PDF (up to a proportionality constant) given by $$p(x)\sim \frac{1}{(1+\alpha x^2)^{1/\alpha}}.$$ How is it called? If it does not have a name, how would you call it? It looks quite similar to the family of $t$-distributions with PDF proportional to $$p(x)\sim \frac{1}{(1+\frac{1}{\nu} x^2)^{(\nu+1)/2}}.$$ When $\alpha=\nu=1$ we have $t$-distribution with 1 df, aka Cauchy distribution. When $\alpha\to 0$ or $\nu\to\infty$, we get Gaussian distribution. This family of distributions appears in Yang et al., Heavy-Tailed Symmetric Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, NIPS 2009 , but they don't use any name to refer to it.
