The re-phrasing of your problem suggests another approach. For each $x_i$ you appear to have $(y_{i,low}, y_{i,high})$ . You might consider two sets of points in $R^2$ , respectively made of $(x_i, y_{i,low})$ and $(x_i, y_{i,high})$ , $i=1,\ldots,n$ , and search for a (linear, quadratic, whatever...) separator doing discriminant analysis. If your points can be nearly separated by a low order function, that might work all right. You might want to check linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines (SVM) . I have a feeling, though, that what I suggested in a previous answer might work best.
