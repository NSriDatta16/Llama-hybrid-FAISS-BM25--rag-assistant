My advice is to begin with a thorough grounding in Statistics, for which a lot of classic and unambiguous material is available online. Topics that you should have a firm grasp on include regression, correlation, hypothesis testing and the bias-variance tradeoff. You don't have to go into too much theoretical depth into any of these topics but you should know what these are before you start studying machine learning. Your study in machine learning should include developing an understanding of hypothesis spaces, Bayesian analysis (can you explain the difference between MLE, MAP and optimal Bayes?), Expectation Maximization, logistic regression, clustering (especially k-means), max-margin classifiers (SVMs), overfitting (can you explain what it is in terms of bias and variance?) and feature selection. Linear algebra is helpful but can be done without in many cases. As someone who does research in data mining and has worked closely with several companies, I can tell you that if you seriously want to go into machine learning, it is NOT enough to simply know how to code something using Weka or R. Those are easy enough to use once you know the concepts. When companies hire data scientists, they want someone who can take the raw data and do something useful with it. A good grasp of fundamentals is obviously essential, since each company's data has its own quirks (and will typically be too big for you to try 'everything'). Good luck!
