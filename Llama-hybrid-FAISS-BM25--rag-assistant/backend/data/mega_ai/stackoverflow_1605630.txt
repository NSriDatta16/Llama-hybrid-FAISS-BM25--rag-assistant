Executing a method from another class in Java... and more

I have a method that returns a list of items called findItemByPIdEndDate() and its found inside MngtImpl.java class. Now I'd like to execute this method every once in a while, hourly lets say so here is what I did so far : This is CronSchedule.java import org.quartz.CronTrigger; import org.quartz.Scheduler; import org.quartz.SchedulerFactory; import org.quartz.impl.StdSchedulerFactory; import org.quartz.JobDetail; public class CronSchedule { public CronSchedule ()throws Exception { SchedulerFactory sf=new StdSchedulerFactory(); Scheduler sched=sf.getScheduler(); JobDetail jd=new JobDetail("job1","group1",CronJob.class); CronTrigger ct=new CronTrigger("cronTrigger","group2","0 * * * * ?"); sched.scheduleJob(jd,ct); sched.start(); } public static void main(String args[]){ try{ new CronSchedule(); //Class where cron is created }catch(Exception e){} } } Now with this one I have problems. This class is called from the class above based on time constraints (* in parenthesis) and it executes method of MngtImpl class. import org.quartz.Job; import org.quartz.JobExecutionContext; import org.quartz.JobExecutionException; import com.rosa.MngtImpl; public class CronJob implements Job { public void execute(JobExecutionContext arg0) throws JobExecutionException { try { MngtImpl pers = new MngtImpl(); pers.findItemByPIdEndDate(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } Here is the method I try to invoke from the above class. This method is found inside class named MngtImpl.java public List findItemByPIdEndDate() throws Exception { List list = null; try{ Session session = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession(); Query query = session.getNamedQuery("endDateChecker"); list = query.list(); }catch (HibernateException e){ throw new DataAccessException(e.getMessage()); } return list; } Now here is what I'd like to do. I need to run this this above method based on some amount of time(which I could specify anytime). I need to make a bean inside bean factory xml file that actually instances this scheduler and calls this method, and I tried this by calling CronJob.java from CronScheldule.java which calls method from another class and I made a bean which maybe working or not But its not working as I expected and its pretty complicated, may I get some help with code please? Thank you I encounter the following exception: java.lang.NullPointerException 11:10:46,410 ERROR [STDERR] at com.packftc.RulesManager.exception(RulesManager.java:25) 11:10:46,410 ERROR [STDERR] at org.drools.agent.RuleAgent$2.run(RuleAgent.java:442) 11:10:46,410 ERROR [STDERR] at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Unknown Source) 11:10:46,410 ERROR [STDERR] at java.util.TimerThread.run(Unknown Source) This is obviously wrong way of doing this I've tried like zilion things so far : Here is what I'm trying to do in simple words, I want to execute findItemByPIdEndDate() method from MngtImpl class every lets say minute. Method is functioning properly I wrote a test and it passes it. So what do I do now ? Thank you
