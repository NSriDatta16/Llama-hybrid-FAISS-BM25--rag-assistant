Quickly experimenting, I notice that a code fragment like... do { Debug.WriteLine( DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.TotalMilliseconds.ToString() ); } while ( 1 ); displays the same number multiple times, then jumps to a new number displayed multiple times, etc. The gap between these sets of numbers is consistently 15.625ms which I notice is 1000 / 64. Looks like Windows timers have a granularity of 1/64th of a second. If you need better than that then I feel your pain, but that's the framework you have to fit within. (Windows isn't a hard real-time OS and doesn't claim to be).
