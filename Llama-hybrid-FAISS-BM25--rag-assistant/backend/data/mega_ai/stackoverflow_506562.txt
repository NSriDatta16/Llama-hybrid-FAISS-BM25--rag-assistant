Is there any way you can get the build property files to reflect relative paths rather than hardcoded paths? Assuming that your task involves organising the main folders into tags, branches and trunk , I'd think the subfolders/files (atleast to an extent) will retain their relative location(s)? If I were you, I would consider fixing my properties files to become more generic and independent of absolute paths.. Hope this helps.. Cheers!
