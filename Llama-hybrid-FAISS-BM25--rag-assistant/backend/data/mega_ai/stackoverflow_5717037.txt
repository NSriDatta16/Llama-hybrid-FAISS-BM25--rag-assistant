eyecon Colorpicker - color not changing in click event

I am using the jquery based eyeCon color picker(http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/). When I click and drag the mouse over the colored area, the color is changing. But when I just click on the colored area, then the color is not getting updated. I digged its source and found two functions named downSelector() and moveSelector() getting invoked on mousedown and mousemove respectively. I just added a call to moveSelector() on the downSelector() function passing its own ev object. But it doesnt work and throws the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'cal' of undefined It might be because the ev object for mousedown and mousemove are different. But I need to update the color on mousedown event. Any suggestions? thanks in advance :)
