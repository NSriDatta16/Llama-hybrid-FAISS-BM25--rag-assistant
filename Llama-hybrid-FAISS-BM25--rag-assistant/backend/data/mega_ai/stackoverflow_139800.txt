Option 1 is the best as it allows you to use the designer for laying out the contents of the UserControl and also makes it easy for different developers to work on different UserControl instances at the same time. Option 2 is a bad idea because if you want to change the layout the designer will generate some new code and your cut-paste will have to be corrected by hand. Option 3 is going to be 10 times more work then using the designer to organize the layout. Option 4 has no benefit over the UserControl but you need to make some changes to the TabPage class in order to allow it to work as a design surface. So I would stick with option 1.
