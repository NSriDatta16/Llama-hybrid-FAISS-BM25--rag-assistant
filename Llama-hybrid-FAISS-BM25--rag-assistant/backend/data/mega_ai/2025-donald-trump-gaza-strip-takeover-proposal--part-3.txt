 welcomed additional talks. In July, Netanyahu met with Trump and reiterated support for the plan of relocating Palestinians, saying it was "free choice" if Palestinians wanted to stay or leave. The US and Israel were working to identify cooperating countries for the plan. Analysis Quincy Institute's political scientist Annelle Sheline has argued that Trump's plan for Gaza would not only constitute ethnic cleansing, but would also destabilise the Middle East, since the displacement of Palestinians into Jordan would provoke a period of social upheaval that could topple the Jordanian monarchy and create an entirely new state in the region. She argued that if such an event were to take place, the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood could seize control of the country. This view has been supported by Paul Piller (fellow at the Quincy Institute) who argued that the displacement of Palestinians into Jordan would effectively end the Jordanian-Israeli peace agreement of 1994 and risk the overthrow of the Jordanian monarchy. Oraib Rantawi, head of the Amman Al Quds Center for Political Studies, said the plan would affect Jordan's demography, identity, and security. Egyptian officials warned that the inflow of hundreds of thousands of Hamas militants into the Sinai border resulting from the plan would destabilize the region and put Egypt's peace agreement with Israel in jeopardy. Also at the Quincy Institute, Rabwan Ahari has argued that Trump's proposal signals a clear and substantial departure from America having "even the pretense of supporting a two-state solution." They further argued that this plan amounted to a statement that Palestinian displacement was the goal of US policy surrounding the region. Legal experts such as Janina Dill (co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict) have weighed in on Trump's rationale, saying that the argument that it would benefit the people living in a territory is no justification (legal or otherwise) for seizing it by force. The Brookings Institute's Natan Sachs reiterates this point and adds that the proposal would be incredibly difficult and expensive to pull off, as well as risking "the implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire-hostage deal." In Haaretz, Dahlia Scheindlin described the alleged plans as "bereft of logic or fact", and analysed the ways in which the far-right in Israel (and elsewhere) had seized on the plan, criticizing the "fuzzy, fake math" being used to suggest that Palestinians would support Trump's move. CNN's Stephen Collinson wrote that the plan would also be unpopular at home in the US, given that, in his words, Trump "partly owes his rise to a political base wearied by sending its sons and daughters to war in the post-9/11 era." fr:Dominique Vidal, a French expert on the Middle East, compared this proposal to the Madagascar Plan, a prelude to the Final Solution. Al Jazeera said that Trump does not have the ability to carry out his plan whether legally, militarily, or diplomatically. Reuters said that it was not clear if Trump would move forward with the plan or if the proposal was an extreme negotiation tactic. Critics have said his first term was full of exaggerated foreign policy announcements, of which many were never implemented. Trump has said repeatedly that he wanted to end "ridiculous" wars and prevent the start of new ones. Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a Gazan analyst and Atlantic Council fellow, said that Trump's vision could not believably be considered an option and that it was transparently impossible. He wrote that Trump may be trying to pressure Arab nations into action through threatening to take over the Strip and communicating that he would become involved if there was not Arab initiative, including finance from Gulf nations. Alkhatib added that regardless of Trump's intentions, his statements have been damaging and have further contributed to the perception of the unhelpfulness of the United States.
