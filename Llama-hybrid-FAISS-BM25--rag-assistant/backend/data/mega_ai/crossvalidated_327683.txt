Comparison of multiple means with different sample sizes

Given four classes, each with a different number of students: Class A: 41 students; Class B: 39 students; Class C: 38 students; Class D: 30 students; Each class took an exam and garnered the following average scores: Class A: 27.80; Class B: 18.87; Class C: 19.24; Class D: 21.00; If each class were ranked according to who got the highest average score, how should the calculation go about? P.S. It's fairly obvious that Class A would be ranked as first. However, I can't say the same for the other three. Though Class D has the second highest average, it has only 30 students, which may make a direct comparison with Classses B and C unfair.
