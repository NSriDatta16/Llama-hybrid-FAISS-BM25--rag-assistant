Yes, I think for a company, or at least one product in the company, it is best or at least easiest to have a centralized setup model. You are trying to make a single coherent product, after all. However, DVCS instills a different working spirit and mode which you may or may not want to encourage in your team. In particular, it increases experimentation (just use a local copy, and you're not bothering anyone). It is easier for maintenance of old versions, or if you do a lot of client-specific changes that need to be kept track of without putting them in the actual product. It is invaluable when you have a team that works offsite a lot. In my company engineers often make last minute changes on site, where for security reasons they don't have internet access. Central VCS simply do not work for this scenario. So there is a central repository, but the fact that you can work in a decentralized manner is invaluable. DVCS is a superset of centralized VCS in terms of workflows. Of course, you can still choose to use a centralized VCS if you don't think you'll need (or want!) the additional options.
