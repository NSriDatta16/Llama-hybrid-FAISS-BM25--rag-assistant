Will I miss anomalies/outliers due to PCA?

My final goal is to detect anomalies (outliers) in a high dimensional space. I was planning to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality as to be able to notice such anomalies better. But then I thought about it and made a counter example how PCA could even make things worse, even though the space has less dimensions. Here's an example. From the first picture we can obviously see that the red point is an anomaly. When we perform PCA and get to 1 dimension this phenomena gets lost. I'm expecting that this could happen in the case of reducing not from 2D to 1D, but from N to M (M I'm only looking for confirmation and additional thoughts on this, how big of a problem can this be? I'm guessing that we can loose quite of important information for the price of less dimensionality, as correlation between features can be lost. EDIT: Here is also the case when we project onto two components. In this case the phenomena is kept (as expected), but I must emphasize that my initial goal was to reduce the dimensionality, which is not achieved in this case.
