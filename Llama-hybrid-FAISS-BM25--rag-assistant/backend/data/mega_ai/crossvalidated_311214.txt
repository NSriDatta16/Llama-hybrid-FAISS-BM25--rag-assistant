How to update our trained neural network models with new added features?

In linear regressions $Y=\boldsymbol{\beta} \boldsymbol{X} + \varepsilon$, at first we had features $\mathbf{X}_1$, and trained our model $$ \widehat{Y} = \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1 \boldsymbol{X}_1 $$ Later, we came up with some new features $\boldsymbol{X_2}$, and we didn't need to retrain the models to get parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}_1$, we can just train a model $\boldsymbol{\beta}_2 \boldsymbol{X}_2$ to fit residuals $Y - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1 \boldsymbol{X}_1$ using least square estimation: $$ \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_2 \boldsymbol{X}_2 \approx Y - \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1 \boldsymbol{X}_1 $$ Combining these two, we have our model: $$ Y \approx \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1 \boldsymbol{X}_1 + \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_2 \boldsymbol{X}_2 $$ However, it is more complicated for deep neural networks. Suppose our neural network using features $\boldsymbol{X}_1$ is $$ Y = \boldsymbol{W}^{(3)} g_2\left( \boldsymbol{W}^{(2)} g_1\left( \boldsymbol{W}_1^{(1)} \boldsymbol{X}_1 + \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)}\right) + \boldsymbol{b}^{(2)} \right) + \boldsymbol{b}^{(3)} $$ where $g_1, g_2$ are group of activation functions on units of each layer of the neural network. If we have some new input features $\boldsymbol{X}_2$, could I ask if there is any method that we don't need to retrain the entire model and only use data with features $\boldsymbol{X}_2$ to update the initially trained model? And obtain a new model $$ Y = \boldsymbol{W}^{(3)} g_2\left( \boldsymbol{W}^{(2)} g_1\left( \boldsymbol{W}_1^{(1)} \boldsymbol{X}_1 + \boldsymbol{W}_2^{(1)} \boldsymbol{X}_2 + \boldsymbol{b} \right) + \boldsymbol{b}^{(2)} \right) + \boldsymbol{b}^{(3)} $$ that not only can hold the precision of the initially trained model and can capture the contributions of the new features to get higher accuracy? The reason why I ask this is retraining the entire DNN model cost too much time. Thanks in advance if anyone can help.
