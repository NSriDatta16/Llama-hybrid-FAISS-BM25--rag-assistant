I don't think it's possible to get the POST data, but others might have a way. An alternative solution would be: User logs in: login.aspx User directed to Flash content: content.html embedding content.swf Flash requests config.xml from server: content.swf makes HTTP request for config.xml.aspx Server provides user's configuration in config.xml.aspx In your init() function, you'd make the URLLoader request to get the configuration, and you'd do the configuration in the Event.COMPLETE handler. Another possibility is to use HTTP cookies--not handled natively by Flash, but you can get to them via Javascript--see this CookieUtil class.
