I think this data should be analysed using a linear mixed-effects model, but it doesn't seem to make sense when using buildmer?

I can't give the exact data because it's sensitive, but I have the following information about the data: 3 continuous variables which are within subjects (scores for test separated by time). 1 categorical variable with 4 levels which are between subjects (condition). 1 continuous dependent variable (average test score not divided by time). I want to find out whether test scores over time (my 3 continuous within-subject variables) are significantly different from each other and whether this effect is moderated by the condition that the test was taken in (my categorical between-subject variable). I assumed the best way to do this was by using a linear mixed effects model in R, with the code shown here: lmer(dep_variable ~ cont_ind_variable_1*condition + cont_ind_variable_2*condition + cont_ind_variable_3*condition + (1 | Subject), data=data) However, I assume this model is too complex for the data, since I get the following error message: Error: number of levels of each grouping factor must be So, I used the buildmer package to simplify my maximal model to reduce the number of observations, like this: buildmer::buildmer(dep_variable ~ cont_ind_variable_1*condition + cont_ind_variable_2*condition + cont_ind_variable_3*condition + (1 | Subject), data=data) But my output suggests cutting the random intercepts for subject, which I don't think makes sense since subjects are repeated across continuous variables, just not across my categorical variable: Call: stats::lm(formula = dep_variable ~ 1 + cont_ind_variable_1 + cont_ind_variable_2 + cont_ind_variable_3 + condition + cont_ind_variable_3:condition + cont_ind_variable_1:condition + condition:cont_ind_variable_2, data = data) I'm not too familiar with linear mixed effects models, but there seems to be something off about what I'm trying to do and I can't put my finger on it? Do I need to aggregate data or something like that?
