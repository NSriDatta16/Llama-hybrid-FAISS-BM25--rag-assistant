Just for completeness, you have two more options RODBC which is very mature and feature-complete but doesn't correspond to the DBI framework as the PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, ... interfaces do. You also need to fiddle with ODBC setup files which can be tricky. But ODBC may be useful for other data access uses too. RdbiPgSQL from the BioConductor project which is also mature but uses yet another protocol that was to compete with DBI and never took of. This PostgreSQL package is featureful though. But as a RPostgreSQL maintainer/co-author I am glad you found this one. As the other poster suggested, try library(RPostgreSQL) before issueing commands. If you encounter other problems, feel free to email me off-SO with a bug report. Edit : There is another option of embedding R inside PostgreSQL using Joe Conway's PL/R .
