How do you structure your comparison functions?

I frequently encounter situations, especially with sorting in C++, where I am comparing a series of fields in order to compare a larger structure. A simplified example: struct Car{ Manufacturer make; ModelName model; Year year; }; bool carLessThanComparator( const Car & car1, const Car & car2 ){ if( car1.make My instinctive approach seems cumbersome, especially for more than 3 fields. How would you structure this series of comparisons in C++? Do other languages provide a more succinct or elegant syntax?
