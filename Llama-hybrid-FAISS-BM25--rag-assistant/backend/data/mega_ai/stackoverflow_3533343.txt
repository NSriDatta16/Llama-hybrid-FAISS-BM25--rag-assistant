I would answer by another question: how is the Erlang runtime implemented under the hood ? Chances are it's implemented in C or a similar system language (I doubt they did it all in assembly). Or at the very least, that the concepts they express can be expressed as efficiently in C. Now, why do you find it so strange that an optimized C version (the shootout certainly does not show average level code) would beat the Erlang version, considering that Erlang adds its own level of complexity / indirection ? Whatever the type of benchmark, it's always possible for a C implementation to beat the most polished program in another language... built on top of C, simply because you take the C-version it generates then removes the bits that you don't need. On the other hand: how much time did it take you to write your code ? what's your degree of trust that it does the right thing ? won't deadlock ? which one would you rather maintain ? Sometimes "faster" just isn't worth the cost.
