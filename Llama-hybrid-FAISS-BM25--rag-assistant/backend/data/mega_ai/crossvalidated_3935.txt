You are correct in saying that the 95% confidence intervals are things that result from using a method that works in 95% of cases, rather than any individual interval having a 95% likelihood of containing the expected value. "The logical basis and interpretation of confidence limits are, even now, a matter of controversy." {David Colquhoun, 1971, Lectures on Biostatistics} That quotation is taken from a statistics textbook published in 1971, but I would contend that it is still true in 2010. The controversy is probably most extreme in the case of confidence intervals for binomial proportions. There are many competing methods for calculating those confidence intervals, but they are all inaccurate in one or more senses and even the worst performing method has proponents among textbook authors. Even so called ‘exact’ intervals fail to yield the properties expected of confidence intervals. In a paper written for surgeons (widely known for their interest in statistics!), John Ludbrook and I argued for the routine use of confidence intervals calculated using a uniform Bayesian prior because such intervals have frequentist properties as good as any other method (on average exactly 95% coverage over all true proportions) but, importantly, much better coverage over all observed proportions (exactly 95% coverage). The paper, because of its target audience, is not terribly detailed and so it may not convince all statistician, but I am working on a follow-up paper with the full set of results and justifications. This is a case where the Bayesian approach has frequentist properties as good as the frequentist approach, something that happens fairly often. The assumption of a uniform prior is not problematical because a uniform distribution of population proportions is built into every calculation of frequentist coverage that I've come across. You ask: "Are there ways of looking at confidence intervals, at least in some circumstances, which would be meaningful to users of statistics?" My answer, then, is that for binomial confidence intervals one can get intervals that contain the population proportion exactly 95% of the time for all observed proportions. That is a yes. However, the conventional use of confidence intervals expects coverage for all population proportions and for that the answer is "No!" The length of the answers to your question, and the various responses to them suggests that confidence intervals are widely misunderstood. If we change our objective from coverage for all true parameter values to coverage of the true parameter value for all sample values, it might get easier because the intervals will then be shaped to be directly relevant to the observed values rather than for the performance of the method per se.
