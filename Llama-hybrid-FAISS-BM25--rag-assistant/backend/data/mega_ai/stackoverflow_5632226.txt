You probably don't. AFAIK, for example with HTC's "Sense", Facebook credentials are stored as a sync account in the accounts api. Since I think it is not encouraged to override common Android use cases, you will have to find out which Accounts they are storing. For this, try to find out how android.accounts is working. The SampleSyncAdapter deluivered with the SDK dev sample applications also is a good place to start.
