Literature for Cross Validation on Sparse Data?

I've read a lot about Cross Validation to estimate prediction error, specifically for selecting the number of components in a PCA model (I'm not doing SVD/PCA, but it's very similar), but I can't find much literature on using CV for really, really large sparse data. Could anyone help me out with paper links, personal experience, or other techniques for estimating prediction error? Also, are there any special concerns for performing CV on Poisson type data?
