ACF and PACF seems to be pointing to two different processes

I have the following ACF and PACF plots for a time series. I'm very new to time series so I might be interpreting this wrong, but it seems like the ACF is indicating an MA(1) process because it tails off after lag 1 but the PACF looks more like an MA(3) based on the 95% CI lines. Am I interpreting one or both of these plots incorrectly?
