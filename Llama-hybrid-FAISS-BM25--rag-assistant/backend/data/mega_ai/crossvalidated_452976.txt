Equivalence between Mahalanobis distance and PCA (mathematical proof)

From this article and this post it emerges the strong connection between Mahalanobis distance and PCA. In particular in the first article I reference it says: " the squared Mahalanobis distance is equal to the sum of squares of the scores of all non‚Äêzero standardized principal components" I would like to have a mathematical proof or at least some reference where I can read the proof. Many thanks
