99.99% durability. What does it mean?

Amazon S3 offers two plans: Storage (Designed for 99.999999999% Durability) and Reduced Redundancy Storage (Designed for 99.99% Durability) Designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year. Heres the link So if I have 10 000 files I can expect to loose one in average with the second plan per year? am I interpreting that correctly? Edit: Maby I have to put it more clearly: How do you interpret especially the "designed for" part. If for example offer 99,9% availability I guarantee that and pay a penal for every hour more or something like that. But if I design the system for 99,9% availability, I choose the parts with the knowledge that the system will probably have a downtime of 0.1% on statistical average. That does not necessarily mean that I guarantee anything. Its just what the system is designed for...
