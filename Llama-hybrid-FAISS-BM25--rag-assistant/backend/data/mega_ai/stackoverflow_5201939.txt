Since there are no upvoted answers, I'm going to mention ChaiScript (Yes, I'm a co-creator of the project). It's a header only scripting engine designed solely for embedding in C++ applications. It has full 64bit support and works with MSVC, G++ and MinGW. The only external dependency is boost. Where it does not win is speed. If you need to do a lot of calculation in the script itself, well, I argue that you are using scripting wrong. The higher level the function you can expose to the scripting engine, the better.
