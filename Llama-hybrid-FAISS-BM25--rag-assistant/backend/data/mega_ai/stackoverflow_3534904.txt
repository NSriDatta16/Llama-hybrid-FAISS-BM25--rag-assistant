Just off the top of my head: There are many toolboxes that Octave does not have, as I discovered when I tried to do homework in a Machine Learning course two semesters ago. Octave has a much inferior debugger. It was almost impossible to work with. Matlab is much faster for many types of operations. Matlab's plots are a lot nicer. Octave doesn't have a native GUI. There are GUIs for Octave, but they are inferior to Matlab's native one.
