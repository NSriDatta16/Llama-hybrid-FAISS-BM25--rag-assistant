Compiling D with Code::Blocks

I'm having trouble compiling D programs in Code::Blocks. Here's what I'm doing: In accordance with my organization conventions, I have unzipped the Digital Mars D2 compiler to C:\Compilers\dmd2 . I also have the Digital Mars C/C++ compiler at C:\Compilers\dm . For the "Toolchain executables" tab in the "Global compiler settings" window, I have set the fields to... Compiler installation directory: C:\Compilers\dmd2\windows C compiler: dmd.exe C++ compiler: dmd.exe Linker for dynamic libs: dmd.exe Linker for static libs: lib.exe Debugger: windbg.exe Resource compiler: rcc.exe (This is the default file, which does not exist. I'm not sure what to set this to.) Make program: make.exe I have the following listed as additional paths: C:\Compilers\dmd2\windows\lib C:\Compilers\dmd2\windows\bin When I start a new D project, I do not see any syntax highlighting. Attempting to compile and run a simple "hello world" program results in the following error: "Hello World in D - Debug" uses an invalid compiler. Probably the toolchain path within the compiler options is not setup correctly?! Skipping... Nothing to be done. What am I doing incorrectly?
