db design questions (how to deal with groups of products)

I would be grateful if somebody could help me to find an elegant solution to this database design problem. There is a company with a lot of different products (P1,P2,P3,P4) and a lot of customers (C1, C2, C3, C4). Now they have a simple database table to deal with orders, something like 20101027 C2 P1 qty status 20101028 C1 P2 qty status Now I would like to create groups of products ( eg. (P1+P3+p4) and (P2+P3)) that could be purchase together for a reduced price. What is the best way to represent such groups in a database system? Dealing with these groups as individual products doesn't work, because I need the functionality of replacing, adding or removing products from the groups. So I need to keep the currently given table of products. Thanks for reading. I hope I will get some help.
