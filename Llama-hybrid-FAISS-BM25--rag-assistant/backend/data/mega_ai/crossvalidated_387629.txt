There is no golden rule for normalization. Feature scaling should be performed alongside with a model selection Yes, in some point it is true - the tree-based models are less affected by unscaled features, as decision trees classifier tries to find the most useful split for each feature, and it won't change its behavior and its predictions. On the other side, there are models which depend on these kind of transformations. The model based on your nearest neighbours, linear models, and neural network. Types of preprocessing on numerical features: MinMaxScaller Rank Log transfrom Extracting square root StandartScaller Also normalization is a good practice to remove the influence of outliers
