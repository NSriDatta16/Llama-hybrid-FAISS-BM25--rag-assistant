Gibbs sampling will indeed not be usable unless a conjugate or conditionally conjugate prior exists. However, there are other perfectly good MCMC sampling methods. If you are using a fixed $a_0$, you can trivially do this in any software for MCMC sampling that allows you to specify a user defined log-likelihood e.g. Stan (can be used from within many statistics packages, e.g. in R using the rstan package), PROC MCMC in the SAS/STAT software and so on. E.g. in Stan you could specify this form of the power prior as target += a0*logLhist(theta,zn) + logpi0(theta); where you would have to define appropriate functions for the log-likelihood of the historical prior and log-pdf of the initial prior (or use some pre-defined pdfs or pmfs). Note that if you want to use the formulation of the power prior with a non-fixed $a_0$, there is a complicated normalization of the power prior that is necessary (see "A note on the power prior" ). For that you need to do some numeric integration in each step of the MCMC sampling, but even that is possible in all the software I mentioned above.
