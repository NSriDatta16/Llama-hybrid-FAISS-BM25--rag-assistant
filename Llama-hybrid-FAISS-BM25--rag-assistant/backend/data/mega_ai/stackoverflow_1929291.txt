There is no dependable way to clean up WORD docs and make them into nice HTML. If the document has any special characters, they are often encoded as Windows charset instead of UTF-8, so they just "break" when displayed online. The list goes on.

You can write a few macros to do things like insert at paragraph breaks, but that's about it. If there is a huge volume of material that needs to go online from Word, you may be better off using a PDF.
