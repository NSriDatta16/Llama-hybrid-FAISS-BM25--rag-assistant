You requested for a solution without CNNs. However, nearly all machine learning algorithms like KNN,SVM, Random Forest work well only if the data has some underlying structure allowing to cluster it (e.g. invariances to different lightings,..). If you work directly on the image pixel values, this will fail with classic machine learning algorithms. You need to use some image descriptor, e.g. HOG,FAST,... Note that a CNN can be understood as transforming the image into a more meaningful representation and then performing SVM clustering on that representation.
