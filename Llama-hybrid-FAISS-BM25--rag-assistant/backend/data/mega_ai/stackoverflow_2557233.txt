How does Rails Plugin Storage work?

Trying to figure out how to install rails plugins manually on windows so I have a few questions. What does the directory need to be named in vendor/plugins? Is it arbitrary or is it linked to something within the plugin config files or is that what you set in the environment.rb? Once I've copied the files to the correct directory, do I always need to run something inside like init.rb or is it good to go? What's the difference between 'require' and 'include'? Thanks!
