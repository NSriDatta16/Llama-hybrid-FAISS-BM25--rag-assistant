Sure thing! Try something along these lines: select [id], [username], iif([type] = "US", "User", iif([type] = "MO", "Moderator", iif([type] = "AD", "Admin", "Unknown Type" ) ) (Here's a link to the IIf function) All things considered, though, you may want to normalize your data with a lookup table. So, for example, create a second table called, "UserType" with two columns: [Code] and [Name]. Then populate it with three records: "US", "User" "MO", "Moderator" "AD", "Admin" Then, within query designer, include both tables and join them by dragging the "type" column from your source table to the "[Code]" column on the [UserType] table. Then, select the [id] and [username] columns from the first table, and the [name] column from the lookup table. That way, if you need to add new user types, you don't have to worry about going back and modifying all of your queries.
