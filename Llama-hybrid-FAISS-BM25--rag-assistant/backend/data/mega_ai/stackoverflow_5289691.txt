How to detect tap on uiview with lots of controls?

My problem is about tap detection. I have a uiviewcontroller and there are some controls on uiview (labels, buttons, tableview, imageview, etc..) When I tap the uibutton I display a small uiview (200x150), if the user taps the uibuttons in smallview I hide the smallview. But I can't hide the uiview if the user taps the background. I tried this code.. -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ //NSLog(@"Touches began."); [self hideShareView]; } It doesn't work if I tap the another button in the uiviewcontrols view. I just want my uiviewcontrol's uiview to react first. I think its about firstResponder but I dont know how to set it first. edit: i want it to work like a uiPopover in ipad.
