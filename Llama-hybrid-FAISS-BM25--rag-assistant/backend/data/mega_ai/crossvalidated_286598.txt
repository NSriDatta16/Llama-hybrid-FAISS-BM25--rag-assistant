Obtaining a Bayes Factor for the difference between two proportions (R code provided)

Below ( in R code ), I'm showing the Bayesian estimation of the Difference between two proportions resulted from two binomially distributed groups ( groups ) of scores ( y ) . My question is how can I now compute a Bayes Factor to understand which hypothesis (i.e., $H_1$ or $H_0$) my data supports? set.seed(0) n1 = 100 ; n2 = 100 ; p1 = .65 ; p2 = .5 ; trials = 15 y = as.vector(unlist(mapply(FUN = rbinom, n = c(n1, n2), size = c(trials, trials), prob = c(p1, p2)))) groups = factor( rep(1:2, times = c(n1, n2)) ) alpha1
