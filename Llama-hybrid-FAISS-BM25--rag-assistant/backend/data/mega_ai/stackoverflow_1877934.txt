prototype ajax updater div with different buttons

i'm learning it, but i cant find what's wrong in this! i want the div2 to get data from the form in div1, called formulario. i would like to know which item is selected and which button was clicked. main html file: function sendf(formul, divi, php) { var params = Form.serialize($(formul)); new Ajax.Updater(divi, php, {method: 'post', parameters: params, asynchronous:true}); } contenido div1 elemento 1 elemento 2 elemento 3 contenido div2 the php file, prodiv1.php: '; print_r($_POST); echo serialize($_POST); if (isset($_POST)) { foreach ($_POST as $key=>$value) { echo $key.'=>'.$value." "; } } echo "select: ".$_POST['lista']; if (isset($_POST['b1'])) {echo 'click: boton1';} else {echo 'click: boton2';} ?> i've tried a lot of things, and seen that it could be done with event observers, httprequests and such, but what i need is quite easy, and probably there's an elegant way to solve it... i thank in advance any help! have a nice day. guillem
