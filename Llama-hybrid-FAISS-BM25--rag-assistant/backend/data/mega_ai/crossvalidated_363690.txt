I have a time series dataset. I am looking to answer 2 forecast questions:

(1) At any given time 't' the machine is upstate/downstate (logistic) (2) Forecasting total downtime of the machine in the coming 10 weeks? The dataset looks like this where Count is no of downtimes occurred in the day and Length is the total length of downtime (in mins) for the day Day | Count | Length 1 3 25 2 0 0 3 1 50 How should I go answering it. I used the auto.arima function from forecast package but the forecasting is a straight line. Anyidea how can I improve in answering the above questions?
