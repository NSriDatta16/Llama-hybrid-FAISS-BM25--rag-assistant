p-value continues to be debated. see one of links below: Which of the (two) conflicting p-values should I use when estimating lmer using R I agree with your assertion in para I of your question. power-test does not serve any purpose if you are interested in checking whether the effect-size is significant or insignificant. The results of power- analysis - p-statistic have a different end use. p-value itself is not dangerous but it is so often misinterpreted by users that its utility has been challenged. Your second paragraph seems to convey a different purpose of power analysis/power different from what it is meant for. welcome to raise further queries in the present context.
