What is meant by Low-Order combination of features?

I came across a Machine Learning paper that talks about input with low-order combination of features . A statement says: The initial feature is used as the input of the model, and the non-linear feature of the initial feature is transformed to obtain the first hidden layer, the low-order combination. The model mentioned is a Stacked Autoencoder. What is meant by low-order combination?
