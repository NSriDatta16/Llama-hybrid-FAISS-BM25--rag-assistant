Total access, ownership and location choices of personal information and data is an interesting goal but your example illustrates some fundamental architecture issues. For example, Facebook is effectively a publishing mechanism. Anything you put on a public profile has essentially left the realm of information that you can reasonably expect to keep private. As a result, let's assume that public forums are outside the scope of your idea. Within the realm of things that you can expect to keep private, I'm a big fan of encryption combined with physical and network security balanced against the need for performance. You use the mobile phone as an example. In that case, you almost certainly have at least three problems: What encryption is used on the phone? Any? Physical security risk is quite high - have you ever had an expensive portable electronic device stolen? There seems to be quite the stolen phone market out there.... The phone becomes a network hotspot - every service that needs your information would need to make an individual connection to your phone before it could satisfy a request. Your phone needs to be on, you need to have a sufficiently fat data pipeline, etc. If you flip your idea around, however, it becomes clear that any organization that does require persistent storage of your sensitive private information (aka SPI) should meet some fundamental (and audit-able) requirements: Demonstrated need to persist the information: many web services already ask "should I remember you?" or "do you want to create an account?" I think the default answer should always be "NO" unless I say otherwise explicitly. No resale or sharing of SPI. If I didn't tell my bank or my bookstore that they can share my demographic information, they shouldn't be able to. Admittedly, my phone number and address are in the book, so I can't expect that I'll stay off of every mailing list but this would at least make things less convenient for the telemarketers. Encryption all the time. My SPI should never be stored in the clear. Physical security all the time. My SPI should never be on a laptop drive. Given all of the above, it would be possible for you to partially achieve the goal of controlling the dissemination of your SPI. It wouldn't be perfect. The moment you type anything in, there is immediately a non-zero risk that someone somewhere has somehow figured out to monitor or capture it. Even so, you would have some control of where your information goes, some belief that it would only go where you tell it to go and that the probability of it being stolen is somewhat reduced. Admittedly, that's a lot of weasel words in a row....
