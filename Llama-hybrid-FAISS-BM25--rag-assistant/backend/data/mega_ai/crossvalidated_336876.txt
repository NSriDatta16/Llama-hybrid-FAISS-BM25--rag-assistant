Does it make sense using Machine Learning techniques on a sparse features matrix? Yes. But you need to use the right methods. Actually there is a whole subdiscipline that covers that - there is even a textbook called Statistical Learning with Sparsity . Logistic regression is a good example of a method that can incorporate sparsity. If you use $l_1$ penalty (adding $\lambda \|w\|_1 = \sum_{i}|w_i|$ to the error term) you can enforce $w$ to be sparse. The usefulness of sparsity is even reflected in implementations: in scikit-learn for example linear methods can be used with both dense and sparse matrices, and they leverage the fact that the input is sparse (there exist solvers specifically for sparse matrices). If you want to read more about the theory, I encourage you to read the textbook I mentioned, especially the Lasso part (for linear models the theory is easier to understand, than for logistic regression, and there even exist proofs that if there exists a sparse solution of OLS problem, then Lasso/some other method will retrieve them) . If you want to dive into applications, then you can check SLwS authors: they have two other textbooks, one of which contains many R examples. Or you can check scikit-learn's documentation for examples , if you're a Python guy.
