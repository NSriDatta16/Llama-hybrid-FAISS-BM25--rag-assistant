Pytables vs. CSV for files that are not very large

I recently came across Pytables and find it to be very cool. It is clear that they are superior to a csv format for very large data sets. I am running some simulations using python. The output is not so large, say 200 columns and 2000 rows. If someone has experience with both, can you suggest which format would be more convenient in the long run for such data sets that are not very large. Pytables has data manipulation capabilities and browsing of the data with Vitables, but the browser does not have as much functionality as, say Excel, which can be used for CSV. Similarly, do you find one better than the other for importing and exporting data, if working mainly in python? Is one more convenient in terms of file organization? Any comments on issues such as these would be helpful. Thanks.
