I don't believe there is a dedicated nginx core or third-party module for this. Since any module would simply test the user-agent anyway, I can't imagine anyone creating a module for this specific purpose. However, it should be relatively simple to set-up a check on the user-agent and redirect. You may find it preferable to check for Gecko/IE/webkit/opera explicitly and redirect everything else to your mobile site - that way you're maintaining a smaller ua regex, plus you'd be catering for the mobile safari (iPhone/iPod Touch) by keeping them on your main website. Its then a simple step to special-case for that browser should you wish to. Furthermore, you should be able to check cookie contents in your nginx config to decide whether to redirect based on the user-agent's preferences.
