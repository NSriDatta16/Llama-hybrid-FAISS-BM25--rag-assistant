Access MainWIndow Control from a class in a separate file

I add a TextBlock to the MainWindow in XAML. And I would need to change the TextBlock Text in a separate class resided in a separate .cs file. I tried the following: private static fooNameSpace.MainWindow tW1; tW1 = this; tW1.textBlock1.Text = "This is a paragraph"; It worked if the class is reside in the same file as the MainWindow class, But it throws me an null exception if the class is reside in a separate file. I have already added the using fooNameSpace; Still doesn't work I can't figure out the right way to make a reference from a separate file class to the MainWindow and it's Control. Tips anyone? thanks,
