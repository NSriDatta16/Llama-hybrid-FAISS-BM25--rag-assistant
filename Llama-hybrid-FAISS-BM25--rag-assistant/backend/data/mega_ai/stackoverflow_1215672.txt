Unable to communicate with Javascript from Flex after dymanically loading a swf

for some reason, whenever I dynamically load a swf on a $(document).ready() by writing to a div, I am unable to make javascript calls to the browser. Specifically, all calls to the browser return "null". This does not occur when embedding the swf normally on the page load, but I would like to prevent loading of the swf until a specified point in time. What the heck is going on here? Is there something special about dynamically embedding a swf that prevents the swf from talking to the browser? The methods ARE called (I've proven such by showing alerts), but all return values to any function, regardless of type returned, shows as null when it gets to flash. Is this a bug with flex, or am I missing something entirely? This has been a major headache for me.
