The mathematical definition of an unbiased estimator is: $E[u(X_1, X_2,\dots,X_n)]=\theta$ . In English, this formula means that the expected value of a statistic, generally given as $u(X_1, X_2], \dots, X_n)$ , equals the parameter (of the population) value. While a parameter has a single (probably unknown) value, a statistic has a distribution of values (which come from the fact that we could hypothetically calculate the statistic for many different random samples). As such, we can calculate an expected value for our distribution. Expected value is just the value that is most likely to occur (in the case of a Normal distribution it would be the peak, i.e., $\mu$ , of the distribution). In the example given in the question, there seems to be the assumption that the distribution of the data is Normal (because you are asked to provide unbiased estimates of mean and variance). So, we want to know if $\bar x$ , the sample mean, and $S^2$ , sample variance are unbiased. We can prove the first part straight forwardly, and I show it below. There is a proof for the second part, but it is a little more complicated. I encourage you to research unbiased estimators for $\hat \sigma^2$ . Our proof starts with the definition of an unbiased estimator above. $\begin{align} E[u(X_1, X_2,\dots,X_n)] &= \theta\\ E[\bar X] &= E[\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i]\\ &=\frac1n \sum_{i=1}^nE(X_i)\\ &=\frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \mu\\ &=\frac1n(n\mu)\\ &=\mu\\ E[\bar X] &= \mu \end{align}$ On the second line, we replace the generic function, $u(X_1,X_2, \dots, X_n)$ , with our estimator, the sample mean ( $\bar X$ ). On the following line we replace $\bar X$ with the formula for the sample mean. The 3rd line moves terms appropriately (following rules/properties of Expectation). By definition, we know that $E[X_i]=\mu$ , so we replace it in the 4th line. What follows is simple math. We end up with the result that, indeed, our sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. I hope this answer provides an approachable explanation for someone who is relatively new to these ideas.
