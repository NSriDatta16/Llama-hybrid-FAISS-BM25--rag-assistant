A simple example created with your class seems to work just fine. I used a string and DragFormat of DataFormats.StringFormat. It worked just fine. Hans is right, there is no way to repro. Im assuming whatever the Data object is , somehow mucks up the Get Data reflection or however it transfers it back. My suggestion would be to break up your data object and see if any particular part has the same issue.
