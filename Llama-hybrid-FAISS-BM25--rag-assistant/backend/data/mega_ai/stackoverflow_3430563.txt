Need to store 128 *bit* Primary Key: Should I use SQL Azure or Azure Table? Or Just use a linked list in Azure Blob

I need to store a large (128-bit) PK. Each int will have some corresponding columns... no schema is defined now... and I want the schema flexible in the future. (I only need conservative flexibility eg adding new columns from time to time) At this point I'm not too concerned with the ability to do joins and such. I mostly want to pick a random PK and search up or down to the next 10 records. Since there can be a lot of white space in the search the cost of the upward and downward search may vary. What is the best technology to handle this request? I'm interested in something that will save me money (per transaction), and storage space. I'm also interested in performance. What do you recommend? Update OK, so what is this for? I want to create a history of data for IPv6 addresses. Of course this will be a very sparse table... but I do need to track certain things regarding seen IP's.
