OCR model with TensorFlow

I'm just getting started in Machine Learning and I'd like to implement a simple OCR. I've played with the MNIST dataset, but it was classification over a finite number of classes, and one character at a time (so no positionning/ordering issues). What kind of model should I look into to build a simple OCR ? How does character location in an image is usually treated ? For example, if the image contains a 9 and a 1 , which techniques will allow me to know if it's 91 or 19 ?
