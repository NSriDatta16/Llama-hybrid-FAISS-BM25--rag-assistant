PANDAS Within Category Normalization

I'm want to normalize sales data of multiple point of sales (POS), Products and weeks. The dataframe looks like this: pos product sales week 0 1 car 250 1 1 2 tank 400 2 2 2 car 300 1 3 1 tank 500 2 The goal is to normalize the data between 0,1 for each point of sale and product, e.g the minimum and maximum relate to the minimum and maximum of sales within a specific product and a specific point of sale. I guess I can just create a column for each combination (example below) and then normalize each column but I'm looking for a more elegant solution. pos 1 2 product car tank car tank week 1 250 0 300 0 2 0 500 0 400 Thanks, Al
