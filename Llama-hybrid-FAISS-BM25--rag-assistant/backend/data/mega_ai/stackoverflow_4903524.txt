pcntl is discouraged in production environments because the functionality it supports (fork, process control, signal handling) are fairly explicitly things you should not be using in a CGI style application. Now, if you're writing a daemon or command line application in PHP, that is another matter... From the PHP manual : Process Control should not be enabled within a web server environment and unexpected results may happen if any Process Control functions are used within a web server environment.
