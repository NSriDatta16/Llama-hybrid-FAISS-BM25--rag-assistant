Creating ROC curve for multi-level logistic regression model in R

I used the functions from this link for creating ROC curve for logistic regression model. Since the object produced by glmer in lme4 package is a S4 object (as far as I know) and the function from the link cannot handle it. I wonder if there are similar functions for creating ROC curve for multi-level logistic regression model in R.
