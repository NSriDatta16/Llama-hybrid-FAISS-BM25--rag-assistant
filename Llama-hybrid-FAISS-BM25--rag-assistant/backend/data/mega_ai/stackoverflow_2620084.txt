If you really have to do it, an alternative to wrapping the exception each time would be to use Exception.Data to capture the additional information and then rethrow the original exception ... catch (Exception ex) { logEntry = new LogEntry("5006", RC.GetString("5006"), EventLogEntryType.Error, LogEntryCategory.Foo); ex.Data.Add("5006",logEntry); throw; } Now at the top level you can just dump the contents of ex.Data to get all the additional information you might want. This allows you to put file names, useragents, ... and all manner of other useful information in the .Data collection to help understand why an exception occurred.
