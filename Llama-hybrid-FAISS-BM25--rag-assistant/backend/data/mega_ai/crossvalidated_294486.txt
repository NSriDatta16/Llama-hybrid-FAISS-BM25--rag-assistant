A comparison between the convergence of Metropolis-Hastings and INDEPENDENT Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

I am trying to explore the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm but I am wondering about the characteristics of this sampling method. It is known about the Metropolized independent sampling that if we designed everything well then for sure it will converge to the target when sample sizes grows to infinity according to this paper J. Liu 1995 . My question is: Suppose we designed two Markov chains and sampled in the first time using the original M-H and in the second time using the independent M-H, which chain will converge quicker under the same conditions (i.e mean by same conditions: same sample size, and the same distributions...etc ). I think that the metropolized independent should converge quicker because we sampled independent objects although the whole chain is dependent since we are using MCMC which generate repeated samples Robert & Casella 2010 . I tried to find a reference to prove or reject this but I couldn't!! I am so sorry if there is any ambiguity or anything wrong but as I said I am trying to understand it. Any kind of help is appreciated.
