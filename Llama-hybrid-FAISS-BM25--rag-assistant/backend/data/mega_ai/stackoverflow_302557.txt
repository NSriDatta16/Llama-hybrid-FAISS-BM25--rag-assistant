Chained exceptions already take care of removing redundant stack frames. That is, you'll only see a given stack frame listed once. It's a matter of opinion, but I'd consider lack of a chained exception a drawback. Discouraging extension of RuntimeException would be good. This might help in that regard. Intervening stack frames may wish to add their own context as the stack unwinds. That could lead to clobbering of properties. There should be a mechanism for dealing with that, such as a stack of values for a given property name. This will never happen in core Java, but there's nothing stopping you from using this convention for your own Exception classes.
