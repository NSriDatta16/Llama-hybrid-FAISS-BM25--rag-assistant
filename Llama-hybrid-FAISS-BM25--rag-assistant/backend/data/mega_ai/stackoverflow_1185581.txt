I have found the help in the build engine Hudson to be very elegant and discrete. You have a help icon, you click on it, the help text is expaned inline the page, you click again it disappears. Try starting https://hudson.dev.java.net/hudson.jnlp and go tohttp://localhost:8080/configure and click the many (?) buttons in the right side.
