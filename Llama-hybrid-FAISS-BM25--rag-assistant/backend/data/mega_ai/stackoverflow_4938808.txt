" VARCHAR " basically sets a maximum length for the field and only stores the data that is entered into it, thus saving on space. The " CHAR " type has a fixed length, so if you set " CHAR(100) ", 100 character worth of space will be used regardless of what the contents are. The only time you will gain a speed advantage is if you have no variable length fields in your record (" VARCHAR ", " TEXT ", etc.). You may notice that Internally all your " CHAR " fields are changed to " VARCHAR " as soon as a variable length field type is added, by MySQL. Also " CHAR " is less efficient from a space storage point of view, but more efficient for searching and adding. It's faster because the database only has to read an offset value to get a record rather than reading parts until it finds the end of a record. And fixed length records will minimize fragmentation, since deleted record space can be reused for new records. Hope it helps.
