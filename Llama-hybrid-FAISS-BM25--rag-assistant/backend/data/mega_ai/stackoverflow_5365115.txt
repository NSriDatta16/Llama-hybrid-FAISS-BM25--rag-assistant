How do I go about taking all of my images and making them 'less dense'? My first guess is to load them into Gimp or Photoshop and scale them down to a smaller resolution. Is this all I need to do? Yes, that's all. The scaling performed by such programs is way better looking than Android's automatic scaling. The dpi values are: ldpi = 120 dpi mdpi = 160 dpi hdpi = 240 dpi so if you have hdpi images you can scale them to 66% and obtain mdpi images, or 50% to get ldpi images.
