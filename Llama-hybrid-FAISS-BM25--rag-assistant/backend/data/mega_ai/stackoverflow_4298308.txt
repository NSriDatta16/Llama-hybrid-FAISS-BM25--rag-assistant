Azure: How to save IDictionary at TableStorage?

I have a class with an IDictionary. The size of this object isn't fix to any particular size. The idea with this is to have a Dynamic Schema of my object. I want to store this object in the TableStorage. How can I do this? And how can I retrieve this information from store after this inside my object with the IDictionary again?? Thanks!!
