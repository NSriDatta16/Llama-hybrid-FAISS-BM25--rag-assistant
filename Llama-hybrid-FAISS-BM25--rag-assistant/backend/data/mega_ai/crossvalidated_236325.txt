coincidentally i was trying out a github extension to sklearn (python). So if you refer to this http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/classifier/StackingClassifier/ , especially the algo specified, it clearly indicates that you CAN essentially use the same data set since the meta learner in the stacking model will use the predictions of the base learners to construct a meta model. So the question of leakages dont arise. I hope i made some sense. Besides if the classification is binary , don't you think SVM's / RandomForests can also be considered ?
