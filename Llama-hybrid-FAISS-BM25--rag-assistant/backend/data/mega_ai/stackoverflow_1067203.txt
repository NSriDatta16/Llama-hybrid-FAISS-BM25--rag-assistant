i'm not sure where you're having a problem. ExternalInterface and SWFObject work in IE6/7/8 just fine. See this example (explanations for the example are here ) when you say 'embed a swf in a form', what exactly are you trying to do? if you're embedding the swf into a div, it shouldn't matter whether the div is in a form or anywhere else in the body. here's an example of a SWF in a form as for window[id], that's a deprecated approach and should be replaced by document.getElementById(id). a lot of old Flash tutorials/documentation say to use window[id] when working with ExternalInterface, but that advice is safe to ignore now that every major browser supports the W3C standard document.getElementbyId. This includes IE6/7/8, Firefox, Safari/Webkit, Opera, etc. As far as the element existing before trying to find it, that's a timing issue. SWFObject embeds the SWF at domready/onload, which means you shouldn't try to invoke ExternalInterface until after the SWF has loaded. You can do this by placing whatever code you're writing in a domready function: swfobject.addDomLoadEvent(function (){ //safe to execute code on your embedded SWF in here }); SWFObject 2.2 has a new callback feature that lets you invoke a function as soon as the SWF has been embedded. Bobby Van der Sluis has an example you can 'view source' on . The SWFObject API documentation covers its usage. hope that helps --philip
