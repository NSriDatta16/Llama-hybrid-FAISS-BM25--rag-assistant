How to read json file format and how to write the json in c# asp.net

In my ASP.NET MVC project I am conecting to a remote cloud server which is returning the data in json like: [{ "name":"new-service-dev", "Isenabled":"true", "ttl":86400, "cdn_uri":"http://c0099.cdn2.files.rackspacecloud.com", "referrer_acl":"", "useragent_acl":"", "log_":"false" }] Now I want to get all the values in list or array format, for example I want to get "cdn_uri" . I also want to create JSON somewhere in my code, how do I create and write JSON?
