Dashcode - how do you combine two values from one datasource

In Dashcode, if I have a dataSource that has, for example, 2 fields called 'FirstName' and 'Last Name', how do I concatenate the 2 fields into one text field in a list view? I'm fairly sure it must be to use a value transformer, so say that I assign the 'FirstName' field to the textfield, and add a value transformer... how do I then add the 'LastName' value to the 'value' variable in the transformer. I'm sure it's to do with dashcode.getDataSource and valueForKeyPath and I think I'm close to the solution but it all seems a bit ungainly so any help would be much appreciated.
