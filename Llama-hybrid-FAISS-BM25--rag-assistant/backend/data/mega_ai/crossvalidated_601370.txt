You should fit a single model that includes an interaction between Extraversion and Gender in it and test whether there is evidence for the presence of the interaction. The model should look like the following: glm(CDC ~ Extraversion + Gender + Extraversion:Gender, data=data, family=poisson()) The test for the coefficient on Extraversion:Gender tells you whether the relationship between Extraversion and CDC depends on (i.e., varies across levels of) Gender . (To make the analysis more robust to violations of certain technical assumptions, I would change poisson() to quasipoisson() and use a robust standard error.) Do not rely on ChatGPT to answer questions about statistics. It doesn't know what it's talking about (literally).
