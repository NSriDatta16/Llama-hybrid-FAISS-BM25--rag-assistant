Correct Way to analize the time series data where we cant calculate the central tendency

If we are given a dataset of real-time sensors, we need to normalize the features. We might not be calculating the central tendency of the whole data coz it's been updating every 5 secs. So if we calculate the mean with existing data, as the time exceeds we might be getting a higher value and we might get a wrong model. So which technique do we use here to calculate the normalizing technique? consider it a case of petroleum drilling and we get measurement IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT ranges.
