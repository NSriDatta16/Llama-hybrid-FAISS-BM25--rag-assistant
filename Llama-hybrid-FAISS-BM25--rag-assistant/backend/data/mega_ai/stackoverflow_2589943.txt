One minor suggestion that's worked well for me: start using first-person plural pronouns, rather than singular ones. That is, talk about "we" and "us" rather than "I" and "me." It encourages other people to participate when they feel like part of team, rather than when they feel like they're contributing your own self-aggrandizement.
