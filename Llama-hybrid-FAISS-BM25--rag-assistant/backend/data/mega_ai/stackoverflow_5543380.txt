You don't need these loops. Here's a quick example: >>> week1 = (35,38,30,34,27,40,39) >>> average1 = sum(week1) / len(week1) >>> average1 34 As in the comments: The above example (in Python 2.x) needs one part cast to float if you want 'true' division (e.g. 34.71). In Python 3.x the single / division defaults to 'true' division so the above snippet would be correct (although with a different resulting value for average1 ).
