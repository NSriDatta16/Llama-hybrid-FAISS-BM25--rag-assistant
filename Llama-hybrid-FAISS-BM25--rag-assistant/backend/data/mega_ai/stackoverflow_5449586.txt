AForge.NET is a C# framework designed for developers and researchers in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Starting from version 2.0.0, the AForge.NET framework is published under the LGPL v3 license . The AForge.NET framework consists of several libraries which include: AForge.Imaging, which is the biggest library of the framework so far, contains different image processing routines, which are aimed to help in image enhancement/processing, as well as in some computer vision tasks. AForge.Vision library consists of different motion detection and motion processing routines. AForge.Video library contains different classes, which provide access to video data. Nice to have it taking into account the amount of image processing stuff in the framework. AForge.Robotics library contains some classes to manipulate some robotics kits AForge.Neuro library consists of some common artificial neural network (ANN) architectures' implementations and their learning algorithms AForge.Genetic library consists of classes aimed to solve different tasks from genetic algorithms (GA), genetic programming (GP) and gene expression programming (GEP) areas AForge.Fuzzy library consists of classes to perform different fuzzy computations, starting from using basic fuzzy sets and linguistic variables and continuing with complete inference system, which is capable of running set of fuzzy rules evaluating requested fuzzy variable. AForge.MachineLearning As of October 2016, the latest release is version 2.1.6 : Bug fixes in the AForge.Imaging component New features in the AForge.Video.DirectShow component Licensing update Other updates and fixes
