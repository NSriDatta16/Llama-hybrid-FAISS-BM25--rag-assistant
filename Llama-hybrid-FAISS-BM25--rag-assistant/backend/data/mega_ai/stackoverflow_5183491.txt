I think its to do with Chunk.NEWLINE addition. I'm guessing you are simulating a paragraph with that Phrase + Newline combination. If you switch to Paragraph object instead, the problem is solved (tested on my machine with your code). using(MemoryStream PDFData = new MemoryStream()) using(Document document = new Document(PageSize.A4, 50, 50, 80, 50)) { PdfWriter PDFWriter = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, PDFData); document.Open(); Moviecollection movCol = new Moviecollection(); foreach (Movie mov in movCol.Movies) document.Add(new Paragraph(mov.Description)); }
