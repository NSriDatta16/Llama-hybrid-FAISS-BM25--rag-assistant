How to model the distribution over payouts from aggregate (sum) data?

The setting A user is presented with a number of options related to her search query. She chooses one of them. As a result, a payout is generated. The payout lies in the range [0.05, 0.50], but the payout of each option is not known. The total number of options is $n$. Observable data For each day, only aggregate data can be observed. Let $t$ be the time index, then we observe: $u_t$ the number of user on day $t$, and $q_t$ the total payout on day $t$ (sum of all payouts). What I want to model From the past time series, I want to estimate the distribution over payouts for a single user at time point $t + 1$. That is, from past aggregate data I would like to estimate the distribution reflecting the payout generated by a single user . Questions What is a suitable model for this distribution? How can I estimate its parameters? Since the distribution over payouts may change over time, I would probably like to use past data in a weighted fashion. How can that be incorporated in the parameter estimation? Example data I can't post a histogram (because I don't have enough reputation points), so I'm describing the data here. I plotted a histogram of $q_t/u_t$ (average payout per user) over the last 100 days, to get a feel for the distribution: The payouts are dispersed around the mean (0.20) More dispersed than a normal distribution Slightly asymmetrical, the left tail is fatter than the right one Possible approaches One option is to think of the total payout as the sum of i.i.d. categorical random variables, see: Estimating parameters of categorical distribution from sum-of-outcome data
