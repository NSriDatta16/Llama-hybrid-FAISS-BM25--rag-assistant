And mysteriously, it clears up. Here's the last thing I did: Removed all old downloaded copies of my developer identity from the downloads folder. Removed the developer identity from the keychain. Removed (minused away) all old provisioning profiles from the phone in XCode's organizer. (If you just do it on the phone, Organizer puts them back the next time you plug if.) This step was performed with the development iPhone plugged in, so the removal was immediate. Meticulously followed the instructions step by step to create & download a new developer identity. Confirmed in the provisioning portal that all my provisioning profiles were marked as invalid. Clicked "modify" on one wildcard provisioning profile. Re-checked the box for my developer identity and clicked through. Reloaded the page to see the Provisioning Profile ready for download. Downloaded it. Relaunched the organizer window. At this point, the Developer Profile heading for the Organizer window showed ALL the old (removed) provisioning profiles with my Developer Identity, when I clicked that heading. Dragged the modified and redownloaded provisioning profile to the Organizer. And now the app runs on my phone. Frustrating, as I feel I'd done all this, but some detail must have been missed along the way.
