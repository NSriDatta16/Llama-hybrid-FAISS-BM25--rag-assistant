How can I compute a posterior density estimate from a prior and likelihood?

I am trying to understand how to use Bayes' theorem to calculate a posterior but am getting stuck with the computational approach, e.g., in the following case it is not clear to me how to take the product of the prior and likelihood and then calculate the posterior: For this example, I am interested in calculating the posterior probability of $\mu$ and I use a standard normal prior on $\mu$ $p(\mu)\sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$, but I want to know how to calculate the posterior from a prior on $\mu$ that is represented by an MCMC chain, so I will use 1000 samples as my starting point. sample 1000 from the prior. set.seed(0) prior.mu make some observations: observations and calculate the likelihood, e.g. $p(y | \mu, \sigma)$: likelihood what I don't quite understand is: when / how to multiply the prior by the likelihood? when / how to normalize the posterior density? please note: I am interested in the general computational solution that could be generalizable problems with no analytical solution
