...That the "clarification of ideas" should not be the sole responsibility of the developer...and yes xkcd made me use that specific phrase... To often we are handed project's that are specified in psuedo-meta-sorta-kinda-specific "code" if you want to call it that. There are often product managers who draw up the initial requiements for a project and perform next to 0% of basic logic validation. I'm not saying that the technical approach shouldn't be drawn up by the architect, or that the speicifc implemntation shouldn't be the responsibility of the developer, but rather that it should the requirement of the product manager to ensure that their requirements are logically feasible. Personally I've been involved in too many "simple" projects that encounter a little scope creep here and there and then come across a "small" change or feature addition which contradicts previous requirements--whether implicitly or explicitly. In these cases it is all too easy for the person requesting the borderline-impossible change to become enraged that developers can't make their dream a reality.
