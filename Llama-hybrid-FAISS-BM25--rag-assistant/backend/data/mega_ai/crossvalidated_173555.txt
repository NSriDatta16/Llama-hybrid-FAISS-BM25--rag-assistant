Predicting a ratio, max values known. Should they be inputs?

I am trying to predict the ratio between variables $a$ and $b$. I know the max values $a$ and $b$ can take and qualitatively the ratio "should" either be close to $\frac{\max(a)}{\max(b)}$ or to $1$ (and it drops to $1$ as total load $a+b$ decreases). I do not know the value for either $a$ or $b$, those are outputs of the calculation. I do know $a+b$. In total I have nine input variables and about 200 data points. I want to avoid overfitting as much as possible, but I have to hit the target to less than 1% or the model will be scrapped. I am considering using a neural net, or possibly (simpler) a linear regression with higher order terms of the inputs. My question is, is there any way to get more information out of the max values then simply using them for inputs? Any suggestions as to a model that leverages those knowns is also appreciated. The problem comes from engineering, basically we are doing load balancing between two machines. Both machines will run near their maximum capacity until the load drops and they should share more equally.
