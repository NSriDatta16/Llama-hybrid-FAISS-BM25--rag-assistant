How do I know if a mysql table is using myISAM or InnoDB Engine?

In MySQL, there is no way to specify a storage engine for a certain database, only for single tables. However, you can specify a storage engine to be used during one session with: SET storage_engine=InnoDB; So you don't have to specify it for each table. How do I confirm, if indeed all the tables are using InnoDB?
