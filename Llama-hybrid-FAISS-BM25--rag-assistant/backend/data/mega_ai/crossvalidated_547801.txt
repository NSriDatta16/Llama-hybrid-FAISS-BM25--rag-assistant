Tukey's fences for outlier removal

I'm in a biomedical research field, and I see a lot of researchers conducting low N studies that use Tukey's fences for outlier removal. For anyone who doesn't know, Tukey's fences works as such: Calculate quartiles 1 and 3 of your data Add 1.5xInterquartile Range to Q3 (upper fence), subtract 1.5xIQR from Q1 (lower fence) Anything above the upper fence or below the lower fence is an outlier and can be excluded This doesn't feel right to me, especially in the context of low N experiments, though it seems common. The odd thing is, in scientific papers where this is mentioned, the reference given is John Tukey's 1977 textbook, "Exploratory Data Analysis." You can find the PDF online, but nowhere in the book does he talk about using this strategy for data removal , only for highlighting data points in an exploratory manner. I was wondering if anyone knew of any references or papers about when this strategy began to be used for outlier removal , or if this is a valid strategy.
