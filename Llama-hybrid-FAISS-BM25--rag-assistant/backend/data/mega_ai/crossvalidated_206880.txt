For all caret models, the final model is trained on the full dataset. caret::train uses the cross-validation scheme you chose to select model parameters (e.g. mtry for a random forest) and estimate out-of-sample performance of the model. Once the cross-validation is done, caret retrains the model on the full dataset, using the parameters it selected during cross-validation. So roc.1 is an in-sample roc curve. The model does not average the trained model's coefficients. It re-fits the model on the full dataset. It is NOT correct to use the final model on the training data, but it is correct to use on a different dataset.
