How to transform non-Gaussian multivariate time series

I wish to apply a VAR-like kind of model to a multivariate time series dataset. The model assumes that $X_t | X_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\Gamma X_{t-1},\Omega)$ for $X_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$. I want to learn more about how to test this assumption if the assumption is not met; if there is any transformation technique that can transform the data so that the conditiona normality assumption is not violated (too much). Can anyone shed some light in this issue, or reference some resources that might help? Thanks in advance.
