Different implementations of a C header file

How can I add multiple implementations to this header file: MoveAgent.h #ifndef _GAMEAGENT_ #define _GAMEAGENT_ #include "Defs.h" #include "GameModel.h" MoveDirection takeDirection(GameState *gs); #endif _GAMEAGENT_ MoveAgent.c: Let's say that I have an implementation that will return a random move MoveDirection takeDirection(GameState *gs) { MoveDirection dir = DIR_NONE; while (dir == DIR_NONE) { int index = arc4random() % gs->moves_total; MoveDirection tempDir = gs->moves[index]; if (tempDir != oppDir(gs->car.direction)) { dir = tempDir; } } return dir; } What is practical way of having multiple implementations of that function? As you might guess, I'm a Java programmer trying to make a basic game to learn C, so I'm trying to do this to simulate a Java interface. Any ideas?
