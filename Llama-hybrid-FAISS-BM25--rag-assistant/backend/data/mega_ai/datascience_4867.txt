From your question I am not sure how you are using logistic regression. The "vanilla" version of logistic regression gives a binary classifier, but your target has three values: a positive value, a negative value, and zero. The Apache site, on the page for logistic regression refers to the thesis of Paul Komarek, in which "logistic regression" refers to the binary classifier. So your problem might be that there your target variable has 3 values. Assuming that that is the case, you have many options, for example: - a) use "multi-nomial logistic", - b) use ordinary logistic regression 3 times to fit 3 models, one per level, to distinguish it from the other two combined
