I think that's a great idea. You definately want the Membership provider, and ensure authentication is set to 'forms' for all the .Net web apps you download. Also check out IIS7 because its newly constructed pipeline means you can leverage .Net based authentication types in any handler (CGI, etc). So for example, you can use Windows Authentication for your PHP applications.
