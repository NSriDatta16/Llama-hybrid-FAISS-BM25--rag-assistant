Is there any justification for using an unbalanced window in difference-in-difference analyses?

In some difference-in-differences analyses, is there any common rule for how many "lead" and "lag" years around the event that we should use? For example, in some papers, I saw the author using [-2;+2], but in some other papers I also see the authors using the event window [-2;+5]. From the end of this discussion , I saw a paragraph documenting that in a specific case You could estimate a finite number of leads and/or lags, or trace out the full dynamics of exposure by saturating the model. If the treatment is transient, then incorporating a full series of time indicators is very demanding. Moreover, some units may opt out of the treatment over time. As you move farther and farther away from the first adoption year, you may have less and less data to estimate your lags. This isn't usually a problem in practice, but you may find that the fifth, sixth, and seventh lags are less precisely estimated.
