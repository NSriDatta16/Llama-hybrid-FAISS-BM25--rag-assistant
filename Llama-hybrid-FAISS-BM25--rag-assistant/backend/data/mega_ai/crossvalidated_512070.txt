Classification of logit and probit models

Savolainen et al. (2011) has a review of discrete choice models used in accident analysis. The paper offers a classification of these models (see image), but some models (e.g. 'Partial proportional odds model', 'Classification and regression tree' and 'Heteroskedastic ordered logit/probit model') mentioned in the paper don't quite fit that taxonomy. Are there any good references on the classification of these models with explanations on the variations? Something similar to this classification of machine learning models is what I'm looking for.
