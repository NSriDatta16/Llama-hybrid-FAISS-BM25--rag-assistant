You might want to consider giving both an estimate and a confidence level, i.e., it's 50/50 that it will take 3-6 months or 6-9 months or 75% chance to be done in 9 months and 90% that you will be done in a year. Another thing you might want to consider is using the " wisdom of crowds " approach. Go around and ask 25-50 people how long they think it will take and average their estimates. Mike Cohn's Planning Poker is, I think, very similar to this, though difficult to plan with just one developer.
