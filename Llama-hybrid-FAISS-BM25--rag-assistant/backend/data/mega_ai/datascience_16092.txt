I can recommend Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning by Goldberg . In particular, chapter 1 gives a great "introduction to genetic algorithms with examples." The code examples are unfortunately in Pascal but readable even if not familiar with the language. The book by Thomas Back is a little more advanced but also more complete (more "evolutionary programming"). Also, Genetic Programming by Koza is a good choice with many examples but less tutorial.
