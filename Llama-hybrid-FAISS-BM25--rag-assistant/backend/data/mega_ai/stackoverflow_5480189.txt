MVC pattern in Qt4 - how to organize code besides using Interview

i was recently suggested to use MVC pattern to organize my Qt4 application. I'm a little puzzled :). How do I implement: 1. model 2. view 3. controller In HTTP based apps its quite straigtforward. But here I'm not sure what is a view and what is a controller ? Lets asume that I'm not using Interview right now. Thanks for help
