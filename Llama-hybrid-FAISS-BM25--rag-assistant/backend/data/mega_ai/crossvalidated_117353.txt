1) Technically speaking, you don't need to test out of sample if you use AIC and similar criteria because they help avoid overfitting. 3) I don't see how you can do the standard CV because it implies training a time series model with some missing values. Instead, try using a rolling window for training and predict the response at one or more points that follow the window.
