How to automatically parse an RSS feed for storage in MySQL database?

I need to somehow automatically update/parse a couple of RSS feeds and place them into a MySQL database almost as soon as the feed is updated, or as close as possible. However, I can't work out the best way to do this automatically - I've found tutorials for doing it when a user runs a script - but in this case it all needs to be done in the background. Would a cron job be suitable? Any ideas? Any advice is greatly appreciated thanks.
