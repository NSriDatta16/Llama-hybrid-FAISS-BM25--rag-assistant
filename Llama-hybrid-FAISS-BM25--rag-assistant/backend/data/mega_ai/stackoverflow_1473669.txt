The main reason for using the database to do the work is that you have a single point of control. Often, app developers re-use or rewrite code fragments in different parts of the application. Even assuming that these all work exactly the same way (which is doubtful), when the business logic changes, the app needs to be reviewed, recoded, recompiled. Unless the parameters change, this would not be necessary where the business logic is stored only in the database.
