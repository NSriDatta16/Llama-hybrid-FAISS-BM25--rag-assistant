This seems a problem to a phylogenetic linear mixed-effects model. Have you tried glmmTMB or bayesian alternatives, like brms ? I'd build a binomial GLMM with repeated measures (=multiple observations within species), including country as random intercept and then include a phylogenetic VCV to account for phylogenetic autocorrelation (with your data set has > 30 species), if not I'd just include species as a crossed random effect, given that your data shows that you have the same species in different countries. For the bayesian alternative, take a look at this vignette . For glmmTMB, look here . Also, make sure you diagnose your model for zero inflation and correct for that, if needed. I'd use DHARMa in this case .
