I'm assuming you can have duplicate priorities. There's no container within .NET that allows duplicate keys akin to a C++ multimap. You could do this in a few different ways, either with a SortedList that had an array of values for each priority key (and grab the first item out of that array as the return value); the SortedList is a balanced tree underneath (IIRC) and should give you good insert and retrieval performance.
