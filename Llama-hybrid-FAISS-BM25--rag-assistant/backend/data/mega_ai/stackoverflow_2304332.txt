The first couple of suggests I have are, first like others have already suggested, use warnings is strongly encouraged. Older Perl interpreters may require you use the older form #!/usr/bin/perl -w as the first line of your Perl script. Second, there is a Switch module available, to make the switch statement look less ugly. I've also shown usage of subroutines to clean up the appearance of the program. I've attached a alternative version of your script with some potential suggestions. Note it uses a slightly different alternative for switch . If available, I'd recommend using the Switch module. It includes a different way of printing the time, and of course fixes your problem with the system calls. I hope that helps. #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; # otherwise /usr/bin/perl -w in first line sub menu() { print ); system("ls $path"); print "\n"; } system("clear"); my $option; do { menu(); chomp($option = ); # SWITCH: for ($option) { /1/ and do { showtime(); }; /2/ and do { listdir(); }; /3/ and do { system("cal"); }; /4/ and do { system("vi"); }; /5/ and do { system("bc"); }; last; } } while ($option != 6); print "Goodbye!\n"; sleep 2;
