Applying Heterogeneous treatment effects to clinical research (non technical explanation)

I'm trying to understand the hype around this estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in the machine learning literature lately. It seems super interesting, but alot of it is beyond me. I read this paper by Susan Athey and I'm really struggling to understand how to implement this in clinical research. Can someone help explain this (with as simple non-technical terminology as possible) with an example of how to use this technique to uncover whether patients with certain characteristics who received a cancer drug were affected differently by the cancer drug than patients with different characteristics? Examples using code in R would be highly appreciated, but general examples would help too.
