It's not that $\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}$ is a bad measure per se, its just that, on its own, the resulting number doesn't represent anything meaningful. You are on the right track though... what we are looking for is a combined, average of the two performance measures since we don't want to have to choose between them. Recall that precision and recall are defined as: $$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positive}}{\text{Predicted Positive}}$$ $$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positive}}{\text{Actual Positive}}$$ Since they both have different denominators, adding them together results in something like this: $$\frac{\text{True Positive}\left(\text{Predicted Positive}+\text{Actual Positive}\right)}{\text{Predicted Positive}\times \text{Actual Positive}}$$ ... which isn't particularly useful. Lets go back to adding them together, and make a tweak: multiply them by $\frac{1}{2}$ so that they are the stay in the correct scale, $[0-1]$. This is taking the familiar average of them. $$ \frac{1}{2} \times \left( \frac{\text{True Positive}}{\text{Predicted Positive}} + \frac{\text{True Positive}}{\text{Actual Positive}} \right) $$ So, we have two quantities, which have the same numerator, but different denominators and we would like to take the average of them. What do we do? Well we could flip them over, take their inverse. Then you could add them together. So they are "right side up", you take the inverse again. This process of inverting, and then inverting again turns a "regular" mean into a harmonic mean. It just so happens that the harmonic mean of precision and recall is the F1-statistic. The harmonic mean is generally used instead of the standard arithmetic mean when dealing with rates, as we doing are here. In the end, the F1-statistic is just the average of precision and recall, and you use it because you don't want to choose one or the other to evaluate the model's performance.
