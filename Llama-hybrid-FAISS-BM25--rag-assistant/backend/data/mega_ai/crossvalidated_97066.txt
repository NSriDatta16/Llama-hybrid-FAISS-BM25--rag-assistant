Reducing the number of variables by using PCA and then do a clustering on it is generally a bad idea because the clustering structure is not always on the first axes of the PCA. Let me give an example. If you take a dataset where the rows represent time, you will have a high correlation between close rows and the PCA will result a first axis with high eigenvalue whereas the structure of the clustering might be on the 2nd and 3rd axis. It has been proved (e.g., Arabie & Hubert, 1994; Chang, 1983; De Soete & Carroll, 1994) that there are more efficient ways to do what you are trying to do. I advice you to use algorithms like reduced kmeans or factorial kmeans. I also recommand you to read recent publications of Yoshikazu Terada about this subject. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4942.pdf I hope I answered to your questions. PS: forgive me for my bad englisH.
