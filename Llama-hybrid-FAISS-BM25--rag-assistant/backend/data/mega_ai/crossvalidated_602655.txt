I don't know if a specific term exists for the operation you are looking for. However, it seems to me that you can reduce your formula to a much simpler one: $f(x,y) = \frac{x-y}{x*H(x-y)+y*[1-H(x-y)]}$ $H(x-y) = \begin{cases} 1 \qquad if \qquad x-y>0 \newline 0 \qquad if \qquad x-y In this way, your term $H(x-y)$ can take as value either 0 or 1 (if you include the case $x=y$ in one of the two cases), therefore the denominator becomes either $x$ or $y$ , depending on the final equation you are looking for. $H$ is usually called Heavyside function (or step function) when you work with time series. I am sorry but from the format of your question I cannot understand if you need $\frac{(x-y)}{y}$ when $x-y>0$ or the opposite.
