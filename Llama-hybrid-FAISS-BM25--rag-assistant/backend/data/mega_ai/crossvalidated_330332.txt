Olkin and Pratt adjustment then Fisher's z calculation before meta analysing correlations from small studies?

I have read that for small studies I need to make adjustments to the pearson correlation coefficients (r) that I extract from studies, by using the formula by Olkin and Pratt 1958, then I need to transform them using fisher's z in order to create a normal distribution, then meta -analyse, then convert back to pearson r for interpretation. Is this correct? This was in guidance by DeCoster. However I have read in the original papers that you choose Olkin and Pratt or Fishers as an adjustment, so I'm confused now about what I should be doing. Also, does the Olkin and Pratt only apply to averaged correlations, or should it be used for a single value of pearson r extracted from a single study?
