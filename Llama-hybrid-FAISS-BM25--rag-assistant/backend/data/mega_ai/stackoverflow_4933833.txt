I'd use a UIPanGestureRecognizer. Instantiate one and hook it to each view you want to have be draggable. Then when it fires, use its translationInView: method to get the translation to apply to the view itself. See here for the docs on UIPanGestureRecognizer: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIPanGestureRecognizer_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIPanGestureRecognizer
