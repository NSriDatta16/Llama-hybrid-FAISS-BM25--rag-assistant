Normalize discrete data on a scale from 0 to 10

I know this subject must have been treated already but I can't figure out how to deal with my problem on an example different from my situation : I measured pain on different location with a Likert scale from 0 to 10 (the scale is discrete, every number is separate by 1 point). That is, by doing test for normality distribution, the results show that scores are not normaly distributed (with Shapiro-Wilk test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). I think that the problem is that during pre intervention testing, the values appears frequently to be 0. We need to compare two time of measure (pre and post intervention) to see group, time and group*time interaction effect but without normalize data I can't figure out how to do this. I heard about ordered logistic regression model but I don't understand the concept... How can I deal with this ?
