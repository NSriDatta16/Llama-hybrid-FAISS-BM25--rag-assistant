Although I've never done it before, you could attempt to create a secondary impersonation context, that when established, the call to GetAllUsers should succeed. Have a look at http://chiragrdarji.blogspot.com/2007/03/impersonation-using-code.html , this chap appears to have achieved a change in security context by using System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity class along with System.Security.Principal.WindowsImpersonationContext . Might be worth checking out.
