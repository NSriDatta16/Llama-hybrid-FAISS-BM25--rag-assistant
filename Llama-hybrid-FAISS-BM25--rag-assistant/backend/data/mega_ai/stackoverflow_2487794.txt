CodeIgniter is very useful and very easy to learn. Its a kind of simple but it could be an advantage too. I began with it and then went to Kohana 2.x that I liked very much. Now there is Kohana 3.x but I didn't find clear information as with its previous version. I think CodeIgniter will do what you need. Probably you should begin to play with the 2.x (now in Beta) branch. If you want something more elaborate I suggest you consider Yii (www.yiiframework.com) that I am also learning right now.
