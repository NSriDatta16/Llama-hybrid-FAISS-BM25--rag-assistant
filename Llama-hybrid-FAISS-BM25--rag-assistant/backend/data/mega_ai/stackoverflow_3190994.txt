Your read code is incorrect: while (bytesRead > 0) { bytesRead = sourceStream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length); foreach (byte b in buffer) { attachmentBytes.Add(b); } } If the bytesRead is less than buffer.Length, you still add the entire buffer to the attachementBytes. Thus, you always corrupt the document returned by adding any garbage in the end of the last buffer post bytesRead. Other than that, allow me to have a really WTF moment. Reading a stream as a List ?? C'mon! First, I don't see the reason why you need to read into an intermediate in-memory storage to start with. You can simply read buffer by buffer and write each buffer straight into the outputStream. Second, if you must use an intermediate in-memory storage, use a MemoryStream , not a List .
