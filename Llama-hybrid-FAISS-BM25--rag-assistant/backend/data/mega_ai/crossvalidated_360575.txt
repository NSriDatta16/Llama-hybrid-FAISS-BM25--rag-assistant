A huge gap between training and validation accuracy, confusion with the concept of Overfitting

I have a fairly small dataset with 100 examples per class and 12 classes in total . Out of all the CNN models I have tried, the only inference I could make is that my training accuracy plateaus at 97%, but my validation accuracy is 7-8% which can be random. So where is the problem? Is my dataset too small? Is my code wrong? (I am not asking for any code advices, just a conceptual question) Something else
