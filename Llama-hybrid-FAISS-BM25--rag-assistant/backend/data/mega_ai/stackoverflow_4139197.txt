For EJB3 you normally define transaction propagation with the @TransactionAttribute annotation. The default transaction attribute for all EJB 3.0 applications is REQUIRED: If a client invokes the enterprise bean's method while the client is associated with a transaction context, the container invokes the enterprise bean's method in the client's transaction context. The doc's for transaction type are here: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ejb/TransactionAttributeType.html N.B. Persistence context and transaction propagation typically happen together but not always - beware. For example, stateful session beans may have an extended persistence context .
