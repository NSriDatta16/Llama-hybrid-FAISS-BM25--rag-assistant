Random forest regressor accuracy reduces when the input data is not shuffled

I am using a random forest regressor and I split the independent variables with shuffle = True , I get a good r squared but when I don't shuffle the data the accuracy gets reduced significantly. I am splitting the data as below- X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25,random_state=rand, shuffle=True) I fit the random forest regressor as below- reg = RandomForestRegressor() reg.fit(X_train, y_train) When I do the cross-validation with unshuffled data, the accuracy is not good, but it improves when the data is shuffled. This is how the response variable I am trying to predict looks like- What could be the reason behind that?
