I don't think you can disable auto linking for addresses and dates like you do with phone numbers, at least it is not in the Apple's official documentation, the Safari HTML Reference . A hack to try to prevent auto linking is to use some redundant tags in the content. For example, instead of writing out +61 3 777 8888 , you could do something like +61 3 777 8888 . It's not very elegant, but it might achieve what you want.
