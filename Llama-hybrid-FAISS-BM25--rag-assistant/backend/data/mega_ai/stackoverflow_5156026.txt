Windows message loops and WTL

I'm trying to understand the way WTL works, and message loops are confusing me right now. For example this code fragment: link The window is first created and after that the message pump is started. How come it works? Isn't the CreateEx, UpdateWindow and so on supposed to send their own invisible messages like WM_CREATE/WM_PAINT/WM_NCPAINT? Where are they thrown if the message pump is not initialized? What happens if you create a window, start message loop, then close the window, but want to create a new one in it's place? PostQuit exits the loop and you have to create a new one?
