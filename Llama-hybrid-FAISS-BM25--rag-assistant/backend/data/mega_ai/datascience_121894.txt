Accounting for differences in average teacher salaries, adjusted for inflation and the cost of living in each state

My aim is to determine whether teacher salaries in all 50 of the United States over between 2013 and 2023—adjusted for inflation and the cost of living—differ significantly. I would like to ask what the wisest approach might be to modify unadjusted teacher salary averages (there is one average for each state) to account for these effects. Afterwards, I would like to graph these modified salaries for a few of these states and examine whether changes in revenue receipts within all schools in a particular state leads to a significant difference in average salaries. I am open to your insight on how I might best tweak teachers’ salaries to account for these effects and things I ought to consider when graphing the relationship I’ve described. Please bear in mind that I am referring to information from the National Education Association, which sources from public schools. Thank you!
