The key here is that the logit is plotted on the y axis. When you're running a logistic regression, typically your data are a column of 1's and 0's. When values only occur at a limited number of discrete x values, they can be 'grouped', or turned into percentages. Lets assume that your data are in percentages. The logit transformation is: $$l=\ln\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$ where $l$ is the logit, $p$ is the percentage and $\ln$ (obviously) is the natural log. Given these values, the plot could be created in R with plot(lowess(logit~age)) . If your data are not grouped (or group-able), then this would not work. (For example, the natural log of $0$ is -Inf. and $1/0$ is undefined. In such a case, you might fit a lowess to your untransformed $y$ first (which would yield predicted probabilities) and assign the lowess fit to a variable. Then the variable can be transformed, as above, and plotted.
