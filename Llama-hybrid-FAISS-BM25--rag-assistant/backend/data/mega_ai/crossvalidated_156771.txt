"Balancing" principal components

I apologize in advance for the poorness of my statistics and mathematics. I am doing PCA on data (emission spectra) that I know a priori should have two strong components (there are two fluorescent proteins) and a residue; I expect the first two components to be the emission spectra of the two protein, and a residual variance. However, when I run PCA the second component shows a small negative peak corresponding to the first component, as if "maximizing" the first component take away a part of the second. When I try to scatter my data on the first two components, this is reflected by the fact that there is a correlation between the first two components values; I would like to "balance" the first two components, I don't know if this is clear. I guess that maybe PCA is not the best way to perform my analysis, unfortunately I am not familiar with any dimensionality reduction algorithm. which is the simplest similar statistical analysis where I can choose the number of "a priori" components?
