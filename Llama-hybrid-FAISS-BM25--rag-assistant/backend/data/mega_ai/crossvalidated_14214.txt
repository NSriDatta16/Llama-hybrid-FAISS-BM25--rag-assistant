From the mean it's easy to calculate the sum over all items, e.g. if you know the average income of the population and the size of the population, you can immediately calculate the total income of the entire population. The mean is straightforward to calculate in O(n) time complexity. Calculating the median in linear time is possible but requires more thought. The obvious solution requiring sorting has worse ( O(n log n) ) time complexity. And I speculate that there is another reason for the mean being more popular than the median: The mean is taught to more persons at school and it's probably taught before teaching the median
