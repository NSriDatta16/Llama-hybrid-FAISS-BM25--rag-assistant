Let's say the true data generating process is: $$ y_i = x_i \beta + \epsilon_i $$ But we don't observe $x_i$ , instead we observe $ z_i = x_i + u_i$ . We can write the above using observables ( $z_i, y_i$ ): $$ y_i = z_i \beta + v_i $$ Where the error term is $ v_i = \epsilon_i - \beta u_i$ . Is the strict exogeneity requirement $\operatorname{E}[v \mid z] = 0$ satisfied? No. If $\operatorname{E}[v \mid z] = 0$ then $\operatorname{E}[vz]=0$ , but $\operatorname{E}[vz]=\operatorname{E}[(\epsilon - \beta u)(x + u)] = - \beta \operatorname{E}[u^2] $ . $\bot$ The underlying cause is that $\operatorname{E}[u \mid x + u] \neq 0$ . The precise story depends on the distribution of $x$ and $u$ , but loosely speaking, above average measurements $z$ are going to be associated with positive measurement error $u$ .
