Differentiating between P tags wrapping images and P tags wrapping text nodes in Wordpress?

I need a good solution to be able to style tags differently in a wordpress post. More specifically I need to differentiate between paragraphs and images. Wordpress just wraps all new lines in tags. Here are some possibilities: Strip all tags and add tags where appropriate (around text) Add a class on tags that wrap text Somehow differentiate between them as is (p img does not work.. I need to select the p tags that have a img child... I'd rather not use selectors that don't work in IE 6) Other solutions? I do not want blog contributors to have to do something manually (add div tags), I want this done in the background. I know other people are having problems with this. Please let me know your thoughts! Thanks all, Matt Mueller
