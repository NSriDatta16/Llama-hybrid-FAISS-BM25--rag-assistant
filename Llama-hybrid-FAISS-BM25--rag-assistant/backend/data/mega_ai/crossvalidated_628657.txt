Interpreting random effects estimate in logistic regression with binary predictor

I've run a model in R as follows: model1 Like outcome , predictor is a binary variable. My understanding is that this model would only give me the random effects estimate of groups where predictor = 0 (because 0 would be the intercept), so I also ran the following to include a slope term and hopefully estimate the variance of groups where predictor = 1 : model2 I ran a dotplot using the 'lattice' package and was confused about seeing the same groups in both intercept and slope plots. I don't understand what the slope estimate plot is telling me. How do I get a random effects estimate for all groups or those for which predictor == 1 ? I think a problem might be that all individuals within each group have the same value of predictor .
