That would be correct, list the fields you want (in SQL Server you can drag them over from the object browser, so you don't have to type them all). Incidentally, if there are fields your specific query doe not need, do not list them. This creates extra work for the server and uses up extra network resources and can be one of the causes of poor performance when it is done thoughout your system and such wasteful queries are run thousands of times a day. As to it being a maintenance problem, you only need to add the fields if the part of the application that uses your query would be affected by them. If you don't know what affect the new field would have or where you need to add it, you shouldn't be adding the field. Also adding new fileds unexopectedly through the use of select * can cause maintenance problems as well. Creating performance problems to avoid doing maintenance (maintenance you may never even need to do as column changes should be rare (if they aren't you need to look at your design)) is pretty short-sighted.
