How can I use an F# type with generics in Silverlight 4 and XAML?

Take the F# following code: type Blah (objects : 'T array) as this = // whatever When I try to use that type in a XAML document, there is no type associated with the generic parameter, and it's ugly. I think the compiler complains, too: So, I try to alias the type like so (at the bottom of my Blah.fs file): type StuffBlah = Blah Then when I use it in the same way in my XAML document, the type is not found to exist: Why is that? Is there a cleaner, more elegant way to do this? I'm still getting the hang of Silverlight, XAML, and F#, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
