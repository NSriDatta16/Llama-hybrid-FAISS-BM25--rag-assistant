I also had the same problem in one of my apps, and tried to force sharekit to do just that. ShareKit isn't really made for it though, it's meant to be a provide a large range of sharing options - so even after modification, I found that it wasn't a very elegant or efficient solution. It will save a bit of time, sure - but if you want a good looking, elegant solution I'd suggest integrating twitter and facebook yourself. It takes a bit of time, but you can define the behavior exactly as you want, and theme the interface to suit your app better.
