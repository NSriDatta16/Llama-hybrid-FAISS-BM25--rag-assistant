You could also use pcalg package if you are interested in network analysis(graphical modeling) and creating directed causal networks. pcalg has several algorithms for observational(cross sectional) data. With assumption of no hidden variable, you could use "pc" algorithm in the package to estimate the equivalence class of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data. Depending on your variable having Gaussian distribution, discrete(ordinal) or binary you could use different conditional independence functions in the package. for example using the database that comes with the package(gmG) you could do the following for the above mentioned 3 types of variables (these are modified examples from package pdf): library(pcalg) ## Using Gaussian Data ################################################## ## Load predefined data data(gmG) n
