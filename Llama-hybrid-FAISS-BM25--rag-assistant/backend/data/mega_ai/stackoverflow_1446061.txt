Getting a Magento 404 error when accessing the module settings through admin panel

So I downloaded the Magento free blog extension but it only supports a single blog. So I duplicated the extension as I need more than one blog in my magento store. I changed all the references and calls appropriately in my extension copy and was able to install it as a separate extension. However when I want to create a new post from the admin panel it gives me a Magento 404 error. I would appreciate if someone could take a look and let me know what I am missing. Please NOTE that I use two environments for testing: a local installation of Magento through MAMP/WAMP (prepackaged LAMP desktop environment for Mac and Windows) with PHP 5.2.6, MySQL 5 and Apache 2.0.59 a Webserver with PHP 5.2.10, MySQL 5.x and Apache 2.x On my local MAMP/WAMP I am able to create a blog without a problem. However when I test it from a live server I am no longer able to create new blog post and the redirection to the admin page of the create post page gives me a magento 404 error. I have been thinking that this might have to do with some server settings but I am not sure at all and would appreciate if someone else could look into this for me. Thanks. Programmer
