Parsing PlainText Emails from HTML Content (ASP.NET)

Right, in short we basically already have a system in place where the HTML content for emails is generated. It's not perfect, but it works. From this, we need to be able to derive a plaintext alternative for the email. I was thinking of instantly jumping on and creating a RegEx to strip the tags from the message - but then I realised this would be no good because we do need some of the formatting information (paragraphs, line breaks, images etc). NOTE: I am OK with actually sending the mail and setting up alternative views etc, this is only about getting plaintext from HTML. So, I am pondering some ideas. Will post one as an answer to see what you guys think, but thought I would open it up to the floor. :) If you need any more clarification then please shout. Many thanks, Rob
