The content and meaning of FILE is undefined. Different compilers/libraries, and different versions of the same compiler/library can have completely different content, or even just subtle but breaking changes. FILE is meant to be an opaque block of data that allows the different library functions to share state. It is not designed to be broken apart and reused by user code. OTOH there is nothing to stop you, other than the knowledge that any solution based on this will be fragile (at best).
