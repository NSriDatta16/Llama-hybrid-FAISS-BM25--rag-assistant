Use HTML5 appCache with Django dynamic page

I am experimenting the HTML5 appCache feature as our web app uses a lot of image resources. Also most pages are not static, but dynamic pages based on Django. The problem is that when appCache is used for a page (more like a RESTFUL url), it will automatically download this page, but it seems there is no way to force invalidate this page when there are content updates on this page without changing the manifest file on the server side. My question is, does this mean I can't use appcache on any dynamic pages? if not, how do I do it?
