Write a C# script to test hundreds of domain names

A client has given me a spreadsheet of hundreds of domain names. My task is to determine the following about each: Which domains are connected to a web server / website. Of those that are, which redirect to another site. What is the server software running (ASP, ASP.NET, Apache, etc) ...and output the results in an organized fashion. Is there a script, preferably c#, that can help with this?
