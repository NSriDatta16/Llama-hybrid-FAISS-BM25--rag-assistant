Understanding questions regarding the Kalman filter

I have a few questions about the Kalman filter in R ( dlm package): Given the function dlmFilter , there is the output time series m that contains the filtered values. Why is the time series longer than the number of observations by one value? And why, on the other hand, is the output time series a, which contains the predictions, identical in number to the number of observations? Why is the initial value of the state variable not corrected when I consider the output time series m of the filtered values? If I have 100 observations and want to calculate a prediction for time 101. What is the best way to do this? Unfortunately, I cannot use dlmForecast because I am using a time-varying matrix (JFF). Would be great if someone could help me.
