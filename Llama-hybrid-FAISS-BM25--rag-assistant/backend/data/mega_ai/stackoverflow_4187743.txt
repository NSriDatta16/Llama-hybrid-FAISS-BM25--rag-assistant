The following template will emit all numeric digits of a string up to the first non-numeric (without having to know how many digits may be in the number): (Thanks to @Alejandro for the key idea, using substring() to get the first non-number, and then passing it to substring-before().) Here it is in the context of an identity transform: When run on the following input: it produces the requested output: Another way to do the @num template is the following, arguably more elegant but harder to read IMO: 0]" --> Notes: The first of the two @num templates above takes priority over the second, because the first is more specific, having a predicate. So the first template is used to process @num's that it matches, and the second template processes all other @num's. The first template matches @num's whose value is all digits, and merely copies the attribute. If we didn't make this exception, the second template would output empty string values for such @num's.
