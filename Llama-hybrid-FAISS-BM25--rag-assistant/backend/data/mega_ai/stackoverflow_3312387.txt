Trying to come up with a way to write a web cms

So I want my users to manage the site content themselves. For example when a customer/visitor is on the site, they see the content (each page content or paragraph stored in a database). If an employee is on the site, they should be able to login (or LDAP integrate) and for every or they should see a little edit icon next to it. When they click it, it turns the paragraph into a rich textbox where they can edit the content themselves. This is something I've been thinking of for a while now but have never implemented and would like to try. Is there some tutorials or books I can start with? I can do this in either php or asp.net (mvc).
