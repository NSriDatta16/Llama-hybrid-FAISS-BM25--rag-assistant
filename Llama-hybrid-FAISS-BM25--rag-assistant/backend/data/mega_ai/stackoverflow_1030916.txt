Dynamic configuration (like changing a database driver or replacing a layer with a mock one for testing) is only one of the many advantages of Spring and IoC in general. Perhaps the main advantage is the complete separation of concerns. All objects become independent of each other, perform a specific task and it is the responsibility of the container to wire them together. Also in Spring the singleton concept is somehow different from the design patterns singleton. I would say that using IoC is appropriate for every application of medium or large size. Perhaps the developers weren't very experienced with Spring and didn't use some of the more advanced techniques, which really reduce code size and produce a more elegant result.
