When doing RSA encryption, we do not find prime numbers, we select random numbers and then apply tests to them that give us increasingly high probability of the number being prime, withou ever proving it. I suggest the same. Try to find conditions which that give a good likelyhood of the puzzle having the desired properties, and testing for those. Or you could use genetic algorithms/neural networks and train them to recognize the "good" puzzles, which amounts to the same thing.
