Magento - local controller is not working

I have a question regarding Magento's local directory. I am trying to override a core controller - Mage/Contacts/controllers/IndexController.php . So I copied IndexController.php to /app/local/Mage/Contacts/controllers/ but Magento is still using core file. I can confirm it because I see 404 page when I rename Mage/Contacts/controllers/IndexController.php to IndexController.php_. Please advise me. Thanks!
