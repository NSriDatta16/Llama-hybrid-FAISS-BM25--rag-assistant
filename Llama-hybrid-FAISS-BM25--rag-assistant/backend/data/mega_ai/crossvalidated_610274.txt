prior & posterior probability in Bayesian Decision Theory

Learning Bayesian decision theory (specifically in Machine Learning) recently, couldn't figure out what do the posterior possibility $P(c|x)$ and the prior possibility $P(x|c)$ mean exactly. Anybody knows what $x$ and $c$ represent exactly in the possibility formula? (all I know is c stand for class and x stand for samples. But I suppose they have some different meaning in the formula, perhaps represent some events?)
