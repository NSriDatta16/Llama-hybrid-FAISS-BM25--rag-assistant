which layer contribute more in deep neural network

Which layer(first few layer or last layers) contribute more to final learned deep neural network model? I'm looking for a general answer with the reason behind. Edit: Please answer based on likelihood not interested in answer like "it based on experimental", " All layer are important " Etc....
