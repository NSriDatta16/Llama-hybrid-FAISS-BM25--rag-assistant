Rails: fields_for only one object

I've got a model Product in my Rails application, its attributes can be edited, and I want to let user comment every change he makes (a comment can be blank, though). So, Product has_many :comments, it accepts_nested_attributes_for :comments and rejects it if the comment is blank. Hence, the edit form for Product is a multi-model form. The problems I faced are: Fields_for helper renders text areas for all comments belonged to the product, so the user can edit all previous comments. I need it to render fields for the new one only. If validation breaks, and there are no comments, fields_for renders nothing. Should I perform @product.comments.build in the view before fields_for statement every time, or there is more elegant way to do it? Maybe I'm wrong and fields_for isn't suitable in this situation?
