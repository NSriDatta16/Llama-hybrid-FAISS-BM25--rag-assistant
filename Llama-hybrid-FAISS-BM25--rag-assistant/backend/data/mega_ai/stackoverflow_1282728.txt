.NET Adding a range of characters to a list

I would like to ask if there is a more elegant way to do this: List unallowed = new List (); for (char c = '\u0000'; c I have to add to the list a few contiguous ranges of Unicode characters and the only thing that I can think of to refactor the code above is to create my own method to avoid typing the for cycles repeatedly. And I'm not even too sure it's worth it.
