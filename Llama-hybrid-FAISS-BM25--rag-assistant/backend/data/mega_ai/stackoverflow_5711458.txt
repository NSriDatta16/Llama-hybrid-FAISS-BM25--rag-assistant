Update You will not find a tool that can systematically identify unused resources, because JavaScript, CSS, and image files can be loaded dynamically. This article shows how to load JavaScript and CSS dynamically, and it's a straightforward task in JavaScript to load an image dynamically. It's easy to imagine a scenario in which the image name is loaded from an external data source, or concatenated from another field value plus ".jpg". Clearly any tool that attempted to scan your source to find unreferenced files would miss these resources. That said, you can search for hard-coded references to .js, .css, and .jpg files using Visual Studio's search by regular expression feature, or by using a high-powered text editor like Notepad++ with a Regular Expression search feature. For example, to use Visual Studio to search for all files ending in .js that are referenced in ASCX ir ASPX pages, go to Edit/Find and Replace/Find in Files, set the search expression to .js> switch on "Use Regular Expressions", and set "Look in these file types" to "*.aspx; *.ascx". ("\" escapes the ".", and ">" means end of word, so that "foo.js" is found, but not "foo.jsx". Visual Studio has its own Regular Expression syntax, which is documented here ) In addition, the tools in my original response below can give a good picture of what JS/CSS/IMAGE resources are actually getting used when your site is loaded. When used in conjunction with a testing tool like Selenium , these should allow you to remove resources with confidence. There are several tools you should look at: WARI--Web Application Resource Inspector seems the closest fit. According to their website: WARI scans your web application and examines dependencies between JavaScript functions, CSS styles, HTML tags and images. The goal is to find unused images as well as unused and duplicated JavaScript functions and CSS styles. JSCoverage is a code coverage inspector for Javascript. For CSS, there is an online tool at http://unused-css.com/ and a Firefox extension called DustMeSelectors
