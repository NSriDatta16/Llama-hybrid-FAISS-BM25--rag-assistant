I found one solution, a perl script called arc_extractor: https://wiki.lib.umn.edu/wupl/DI2.HowToCrawl/arc_extractor.txt It extracts all the files that are in the ARC file, separated by folder according to the site from which they were received. And yes, it does include image files. The script isn't too elegant... so if anyone has any other suggestions I'd be interested in learning about them.
