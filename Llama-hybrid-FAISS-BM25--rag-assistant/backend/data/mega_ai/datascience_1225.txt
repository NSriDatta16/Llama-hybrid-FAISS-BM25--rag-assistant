data processing, correlation calculation

I have product purchase count data which looks likes this: user item1 item2 a 2 4 b 1 3 c 5 6 ... ... ... These data are imported into python using numpy.genfromtxt . Now I want to process it to get the correlation between item1 purchase amount and item2 purchase amount -- basically for each value x of item1 I want to find all the users who bought item1 in x quantity then average the item2 over the same users. What is the best way to do this? I can do this by using for loops but I thought there might be something more efficient than that. Thanks!
