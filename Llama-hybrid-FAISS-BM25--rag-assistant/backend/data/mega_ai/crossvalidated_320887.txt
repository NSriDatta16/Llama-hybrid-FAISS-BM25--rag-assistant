Here's a whole slew of tips you can implement: https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks A few specific tips which apply to you: Use LeakyReLu instead of Relu Don't mix real and generated content in batches: construct separate batches for real and generated content respectively Save checkpoints of your models and mix in older versions of the generator and discriminator every couple of generations Instead of using straight binary 0/1 for your discriminator target variable, add noise to the discriminator target variable Use ConvTranspose2d for upsampling Add dropout Don't assume you have a good training schedule: check in on the norm of the gradient and visualize generated samples periodically.
