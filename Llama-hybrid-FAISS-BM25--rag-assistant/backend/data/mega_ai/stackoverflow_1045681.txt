Distinguishing between storage model and conceptual model field names (Entity Framework)

Every sample I come across has the entities and properties in the storage model named exactly the same as in the conceptual model. So in the mapping section, I can't tell whether an entity or property is from the storage model or conceptual model. This is a snippet of an Entity Framework diagram. Which "ID" fields are from the database and which are from the entities?
