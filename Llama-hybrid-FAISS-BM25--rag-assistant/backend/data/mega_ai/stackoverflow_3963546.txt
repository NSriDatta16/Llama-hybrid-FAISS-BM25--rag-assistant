Ruby regex matching strings from an array?

I'm sort of new to regexs with Ruby, (or I suppose regex in general), but I was wondering if there was a pragmatic way to match a string using an array? Let me explain, say I have a list of ingredients in this case: 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese Ultimately I need to split the ingredients into its respective "quantity and measurement" and "ingredient name", so like in the case of 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon , will be split into " 8 ounces , and shredded mozzarella cheese . So Instead of having a hugely long regex like: (cup\w*|teaspoon\w*ounce\w* ....... ) , how can I use an array to hold those values outside the regex? update I did this (thanks cwninja ): # I think the all units should be just singular, then # use ruby function to pluralize them. units = [ 'tablespoon', 'teaspoon', 'cup', 'can', 'quart', 'gallon', 'pinch', 'pound', 'pint', 'fluid ounce', 'ounce' # ... shortened for brevity ] joined_units = (units.collect{|u| u.pluralize} + units).join('|') # There are actually many ingredients, so this is actually an iterator # but for example sake we are going to just show one. ingredient = "1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chilies, undrained" ingredient.split(/([\d\/\.\s]+(\([^)]+\))?)\s(#{joined_units})?\s?(.*)/i) This gives me close to what I want, so I think this is the direction I want to go. puts "measurement: #{arr[1]}" puts "unit: #{arr[-2] if arr.size > 3}" puts "title: #{arr[-1].strip}"
