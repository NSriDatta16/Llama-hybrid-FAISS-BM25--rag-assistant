1) It's important to distinguish between an estimator and the population quantity it is being used to estimate. For example, for a symmetric distribution whose mean exists, I could use any number of sample estimators of the population mean - such as the sample median, for example. [And, for example, if the distribution is Laplace, the sample median is actually a substantially better estimate of the population mean than the sample mean is.] 2) If you assume the same distribution-shape (i.e. identical apart from a possible location shift) for the two populations in your test, then both the Mann-Whitney and the t-test test for that location shift, which is the same shift whether you think of it as a shift in means, medians, 95th percentiles or whatever. In that situation, the Mann-Whitney is as much a test of difference in populations means as the t-test is, it just uses a different estimator for the quantity. Indeed, it's quite possible to produce both an estimate of (and interval for) that shift under either test. The Mann-Whitney estimate of the shift is the median of pairwise cross-sample differences ( see the second paragraph here ) -- but similar to the example in (1), that's a perfectly valid way to estimate the shift in population means . For more discussion of some of these issues, and how a Mann-Whitney and a t-test test the same null and alternative hypothesis once you assume that the alternative is location-shift, see this answer
