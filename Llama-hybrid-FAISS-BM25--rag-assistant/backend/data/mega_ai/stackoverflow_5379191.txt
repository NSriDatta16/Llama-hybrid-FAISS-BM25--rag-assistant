URLRequestHeader problem in actionscript

I will use the URLRequest to upload the modified image in Flex. It works fine. However, I need to add Content-Length as a URLRequestHeader for the moment, and I get error 2096. Then, I know that this header is not allowed. How can I solve this case. Please advice, thanks. Update: According to adobe's documentation: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/URLRequestHeader.html In Flash Player and in Adobe AIR content outside of the application security sandbox, the following request headers cannot be used, and the restricted terms are not case-sensitive (for example, Get, get, and GET are all not allowed). Also, hyphenated terms apply if an underscore character is used (for example, both Content-Length and Content_Length are not allowed): Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Ranges, Age, Allow, Allowed, Authorization, Charge-To, Connect, Connection, Content-Length, Content-Location, Content-Range, Cookie, Date, Delete, ETag, Expect, Get, Head, Host, If-Modified-Since, Keep-Alive, Last-Modified, Location, Max-Forwards, Options, Origin, Post, Proxy-Authenticate, Proxy-Authorization, Proxy-Connection, Public, Put, Range, Referer, Request-Range, Retry-After, Server, TE, Trace, Trailer, Transfer-Encoding, Upgrade, URI, User-Agent, Vary, Via, Warning, WWW-Authenticate, x-flash-version.
