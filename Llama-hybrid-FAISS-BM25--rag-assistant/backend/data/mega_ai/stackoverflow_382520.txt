There are two things off the top of my head that will affect the internal layout of an object: the size of member objects. Hopefully you'll recompile all affected modules if you change a member definition. packing pragmas may change the padding added between members. Be sure that the packing is the same for all modules that use the class, or at least the section where the class is defined. If you don't, you'll have bigger problems than unpredictable offsets.
