Magento - Removing the black background from automatic thumbnails?

On a Magento site, I’m just uploading one picture per product, and using that as the base, small and thumbnail images. However, my pictures aren’t square, so I’m getting a black background added to the thumbnail that’s created. Any ideas how to change that to a white background? http://www.magentocommerce.com/?ACT=25&fid=10&aid=10785_osKeOnfKFLFvgqVYbr0j&board_id=1 I’ve searched for this but can’t find a decent answer anywhere…
