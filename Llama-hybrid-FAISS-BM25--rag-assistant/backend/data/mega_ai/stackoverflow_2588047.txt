If I have any suspicions that a file is not being compiled I start inserting: #pragma message("Reached Here!") type lines in the source until I see the message pop up. I've tested the source code from the OP with VS2008 in a project that uses precompiled headers and bluebrother is correct that text before the first #include is ignored, including #pragma message .
