Sanitizing data at active record

I want to sanitize the data coming from my form in ActiveRecord. Especially the apostrophe before its actually included into the SQL query. I want it to be something raghu'\s if raghu's is been inputed. I have already tried using: sanitize_sql_array sanitize_sql_for_assignment sanitize_sql_for_conditions sanitize_sql_hash_for_assignment sanitize_sql_hash_for_conditions But none of these seem to escape the apostrophe there by failing my SQL query.
