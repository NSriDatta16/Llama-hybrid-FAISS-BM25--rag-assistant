Move programmatically cursor in UiTextField

I need to tweak UiTextField behavior so that I can programmatically insert some asterisks and move the cursor at the beginning of the string; I tried the "paste" trick ( http://dev.ragfield.com/2009/09/insert-text-at-current-cursor-location.html) , but the cursor is moved at the end. The effect I try to achieve is like this: At the start: then the user insert characters f***** fo**** foo*** etc... Is this possible or the tweaks I've to do don't deserve the effort? Thanx -G-
