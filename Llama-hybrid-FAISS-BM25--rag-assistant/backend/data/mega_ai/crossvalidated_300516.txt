You can use multivariate regression for this problem, without a problem. But since you already use neural networks it is more natural to me to solve this problem using neural net with one neuron on the top of your outputs. $\alpha_i$ would be weights of this new neural net and you will not use activation function (i.e. use linear activation function). Also, keep in mind that you will need $N$ different subset of features created from each new (unseen) example in order to perform prediction on unseen data.
