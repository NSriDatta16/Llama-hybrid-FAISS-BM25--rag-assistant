Sensitivity Measures for GEE Model

Is there any method (e.g. like Cooks D) implemented in R to identify leverage points for GEE Models? I used geepack to fit my models and would like to do a sensitivity analysis now. However, I don't seem to find any R package that has any kind of leverage measure implemented?
