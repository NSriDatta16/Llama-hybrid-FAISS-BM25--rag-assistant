Random Forest feature selection

I am using Random Forest model for feature selection on data with bias. I have tried the Random Forest model on my features by increasing number of trees and found the feature importance moving. Could anyone help me understand how I should use the 'rfpimp' package in this situation in Orange visual programming?
