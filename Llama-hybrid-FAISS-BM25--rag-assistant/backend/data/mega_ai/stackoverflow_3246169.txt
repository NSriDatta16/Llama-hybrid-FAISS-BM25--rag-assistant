Validation of certain Action's methods in Struts2

I have an Action class with CRUD actions inside and I have overridden the validate() method given by the ActionSupport class. The question is: how can I fire the validation only for the update and create actions? One possible solution is to move create & update on a brand new Action class, but I'd like to know if there's another solution for this. Thanks! Roberto
