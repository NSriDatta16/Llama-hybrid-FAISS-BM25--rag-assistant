Where is the bottle neck on Magento load time

I am trying to improve the load speed of my Magento store http://www.jinkou.info the load time for the front page on pingdom tools is 13 seconds! It seems that the delay in the pingdom readout is the green section after "connect" What is likely to be causing this bottleneck?
