scrollLeft on Chrome

I've seen a few discussions about this around, but no solutions really. When I'm using Jquery 1.5 the "scrollLeft" property nor "scrollTop" work in Chrome. Not even on the jquery API page (http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/) I'm using code like this: $('html, body').animate({ scrollLeft: a_position }, a_duration); and have simplified it down to the most minimal code possible. Why won't this work? Once I saw it not working on the jquery website I began to think maybe it's just not possible. Thanks in advance.
