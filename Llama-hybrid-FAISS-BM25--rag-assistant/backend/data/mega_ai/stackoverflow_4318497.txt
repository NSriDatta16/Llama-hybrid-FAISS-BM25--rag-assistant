Mysql string is being rejected

I'm trying to write a new sql string, but it is far more complex than anything I wrote before and I'm fairly certain it wrong somewhere SELECT manga.mangaName,chapter.chapterNumber,chapter.chapterName, chapter.chapterID,counter.dateUpdated, DATE_FORMAT(chapter.dateUploaded,'%b %D %Y') as dateUploaded, pageViews.counter FROM manga, chapter, pageViews WHERE manga.mangaID = chapter.mangaID AND chapter.chapterID = pageViews.chapterID AND counter.dateUpdated BETWEEN ".$Monday." AND ".$Sunday." ORDER BY pageViews.counter DESC LIMIT 1"; that is the warning that comes along with it Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /homez.380/mangasma/www/index.php on line 39
