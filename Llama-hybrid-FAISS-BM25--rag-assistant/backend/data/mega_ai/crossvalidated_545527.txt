The Spearman correlation is not a linear correlation of the data, but a linear correlation of a transformed version of the data -- specifically, the correlation of the rank-transformed data. It doesn't "see" what you show in your plots. (The second plot has been removed from the question, but I will leave it in my answer as it still serves to illustrate the points being made.) In the plot of DSI vs H, the low points (especially the zeros) that are on average further right than the bulk of the data "pull" the regression line down. If those points were absent the line would slope up. Rank transforming these variables reduces the impact of the low points (the rightmost ones are relatively less influential - the highest H-values are less distant - and the corresponding low DSI values are less discrepant). At the same time a group of points in the upper left quadrant are transformed to be much further to the right. Consequently, the line in the transformed data has a slope that is essentially flat (but just positive). In the plot of DSI vs IVGR, the four very low DSI values are now omitted, so they are not there pulling on this regression line. Here the six rightmost IVGR values have DSI values mostly above the mean of DSI rather than below, so this line slopes up. Again, the rank transform reduces the impact of these influential points and the correponding line on the transformed data is essentially flat (but just negative).
