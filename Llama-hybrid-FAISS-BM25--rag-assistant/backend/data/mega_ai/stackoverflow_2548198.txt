Getting text from a cell using the each function on checked checkboxes

I have a list of states, each with some data associated with it, displayed in a table, with a checkbox next to each state. I have it successfully computing the sum of input values of all checked states, but I need to store the additional data for each state in a 3D array so that I can display it later in the form's summary, showing the user just the states they selected. I have found a few solutions, but haven't been able to get any to work for my setup. This is what I have so far (hoping I'm not leaving any important code out): var returnDb = new Array(); var inc = 0; var returnState = ''; var returnNum = ''; var returnEmail = ''; $("input:checked").each(function() { var value = 1*$(this).attr("title"); var value_vendors = 1*$(this).attr("title"); // These are causing my script to stop returnState = ''. $(this).closest('tr').find('td:eq(1)').text(); returnNum = ''. $(this).closest('tr').find('td:eq(2)').text(); returnEmail = ''. $(this).closest('tr').find('td:eq(3)').text(); returnDb[inc] = [['' . returnState, '' . returnNum, '' . returnEmail]]; total += parseInt(value); vendors += parseInt(value_vendors); inc++; }); When I comment out the three lines that cause my script to stop, everything works fine. Any idea what I'm doing wrong or if there is a better approach to this?
