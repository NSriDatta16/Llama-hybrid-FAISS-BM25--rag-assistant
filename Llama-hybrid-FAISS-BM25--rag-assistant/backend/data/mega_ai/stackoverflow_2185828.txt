Organizing a project that uses multiple languages?

I am currently working on a project that has components in perl, .NET, C/C++, and Java. These components are inter-related, but are not tied to the same release schedule. Due to the very different build/testing environment requirements, lumping them all in to the same /bin /src /lib /etc /tests hierarchy is a bit unwieldy. What are some good organizational hierarchies to use in source control when dealing with a project of this nature? I am currently leaning towards each language having its own branch: repo/project1/perl/main/... repo/project1/.NET/main/... repo/project1/Java/main/... How would your recommended hierarchy change if they DID have a tied release schedule?
