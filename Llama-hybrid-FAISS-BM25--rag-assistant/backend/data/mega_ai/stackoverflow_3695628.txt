New App Data Decision

A group has been using a VB app for a while and it uses an access db as its data storage. I've been tasked with completely redoing this in java. The application will be self-contained with the data local (with internet updates), but not a central connection to a db. So installation and local setup is a consideration. The access db is not huge (100MB-300MB) and is somewhat complex, but not overly. I've always had to work around a set data environment and now find myself able to dictate it. So my question comes to "what should I do"/"what would you do"? Keep the ms access db. Go with another db. Use a java data storage environment. I'd love to get some input on what would be the best ideas and direction to take while I can dictate it. What's worked what hasn't.
