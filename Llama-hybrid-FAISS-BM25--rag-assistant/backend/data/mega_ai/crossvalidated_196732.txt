Use the (AICcmodavg) package in R developed by Marc J. Mazerolle. This package will allow you to compute model average estimates and their 95% confidence intervals based on your entire list of candidate models. The estimates are weighted based on the relative importance of your models (the AIC values/ranking of your models)and includes only the models for which the variable of interest is included. When computing the model average estimates, you have to be sure to exclude any interactions in which the variable of interest is included. In your results section, include a table with each of your models and their AIC, delta AIC and AICweight values. Also include a table of the model average estimates with the variable, estimate and upper/lower 95% CI. In your write up you can then refer to the models as "The most probable model/models" and the variables "as the most important variable". If the confidence intervals of your estimates do not contain zero, then you have an effect of your variable as compared to your reference. So, If you were comparing 3 treatment types to a control and you found that only treatment 2 was different (ie. the average estimate CI did not contain 0 but treatment 1 and 3 do), instead of saying "significantly different" you could conclude that treatments 1 and 3 were similar to the control but treatment 2 had a positive effect (or negative depending on the sign of the estimate)on your response variable. You can then use the same package to compute the predicted values for your variables using the entire list of candidate models and look at the trend. So if you were looking at the treatment effect over time, you could make predictions for treatments 1, 2, 3 and control and then say something like "Treatment 2 had a postive effect on the response variable which increased with time throughout the duration of the study period. There was no difference in response variable between treatments 1 and the control, nor treatment 3 and the control".
