Minimizing square errors (MSE) is definitely not the same as minimizing absolute deviations (MAD) of errors. MSE provides the mean response of $y$ conditioned on $x$, while MAD provides the median response of $y$ conditioned on $x$. Historically, Laplace originally considered the maximum observed error as a measure of the correctness of a model. He soon moved to considering MAD instead. Due to his inability to exact solving both situations, he soon considered the differential MSE. Himself and Gauss (seemingly concurrently) derived the normal equations, a closed-form solution for this problem. Nowadays, solving the MAD is relatively easy by means of linear programming. As it is well known, however, linear programming does not have a closed-form solution. From an optimization perspective, both correspond to convex functions. However, MSE is differentiable, thus, allowing for gradient-based methods, much efficient than their non-differentiable counterpart. MAD is not differentiable at $x=0$. A further theoretical reason is that, in a bayesian setting, when assuming uniform priors of the model parameters, MSE yields normal distributed errors, which has been taken as a proof of correctness of the method. Theorists like the normal distribution because they believed it is an empirical fact, while experimentals like it because they believe it a theoretical result. A final reason of why MSE may have had the wide acceptance it has is that it is based on the euclidean distance (in fact it is a solution of the projection problem on an euclidean banach space) which is extremely intuitive given our geometrical reality.
