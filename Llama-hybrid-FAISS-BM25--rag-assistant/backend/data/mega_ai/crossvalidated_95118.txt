Residual plot for regression tree: What should it look like?

I realize that decision trees are nonparametric methods What should residual vs. actual/fitted look like for a well behaved regression tree? My argument would be that since each observation assigned to a terminal node is assigned (as a predicted value) the average of the dependent variable at that terminal node, you would expect the conditional distribution (that is, for each node) to be approximately normal. I have attached two plots for my decision tree (validates at 63% on test set, so kind of weak), residuals vs. fitted and residuals vs. actual -Basically, my question: wouldn't a strong regression tree look like a step-function of sorts?
