Bootstrapping CI for correlation coefficients; effect of averaging

I want to bootstrap the confidence intervals for the correlation matrix of a 2D dataset with 2000 separate observations (e.g. data = 2000 x 7, as an example this could be "performance score" in 2000 people in 7 different skill tests). My main question is which pairwise correlations are significant (e.g. do people with great scores in test 1 also perform well in test 2,3,4,5 etc). Note that my outcome variable is continuous but the grouping variable is not (e.g. skill tests). This dataset was derived from averaging a 3D dataset with different amounts of technical replicates (e.g. data_raw = 2000 x 7 x 45). I (statistics noob) can think of two ways of doing this, which give me very different results: 1) Bootstrap the CIs by drawing from trials on the unaveraged data (i.e. repeatedly (i.e. 1000) do the following: Draw 45 (nTrials) times with replacement from 1:45, calculate the mean across the drawn trials, get correlation). 2) Bootstrap the CIs by drawing from observations in the averaged data. (i.e. repeatedly (i.e. 1000) do the following: Draw 2000 times with replacement from 1:2000, get correlation). Is one of them obviously stupid? Thank you!
