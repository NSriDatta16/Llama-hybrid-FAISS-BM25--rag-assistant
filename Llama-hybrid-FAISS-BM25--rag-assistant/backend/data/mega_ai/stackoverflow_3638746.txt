Animated Sorting of Block Elements in Javascript

I have a page where I want to animate the sorting of a list of block elements. .... .... I want something similar to the sortable elements provided by jquery ui but it will animate based on an event not based on dragging. I can write it myself but I'm wondering if there are any good libraries out there to handle it.
