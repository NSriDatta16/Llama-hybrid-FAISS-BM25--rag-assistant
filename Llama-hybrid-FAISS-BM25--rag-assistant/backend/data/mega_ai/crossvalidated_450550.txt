Before trying any modeling with time series, it is important to make sure that time-series you have is stationary . In simple words, it means that, if you select random consecutive sample sizes of n from this time-series they will have equal covariances. One considers time series purely stationary if and only if it complies to the following: Constant mean Constant variance Constant covariance between equally sized periods. Stationarity is one of the assumptions of regression models. Edit: Formatting
