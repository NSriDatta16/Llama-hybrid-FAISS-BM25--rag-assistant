I'm not sure the concept of referencing between models in EMF is what you describe. However, in a model you do can reference elements in other models. In the Generic EMF editor with you create model instances, you can click the right button and then select "Load Resource...". That new resource can be any other model that is related to your model (your metamodel references the other model's metamodel). You can to that as well at the meta-model level. In the graphical Ecore editor, you can drag and drop classes from other metamodels. They will keep in synch. I'm not sure, however, if this is what you're asking.
