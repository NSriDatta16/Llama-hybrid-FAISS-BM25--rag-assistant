Looking for a customizable "flowchart builder " builder

I need to create a customized graphical flowchart builder. There are only three classes of connectable components, and two kinds of connectors from which the flowchart is constructed. Each component and connector class, though, needs to have a tailored set of properties associated with the instances of their class. So I'm looking for a "flowchart builder" builder that lets me configure the types of components, the associated properties, and has all the plumbing already in place to handle drag/drop, resizing, drawing, connecting, load/save, and so on. Ideally the resulting application would save diagrams in an XML-based format, but anything parsable would be fine. Dia has the capabilities I'm looking for, however, customizing it for a new type of diagram requires coding up the specifics of the component set. I'm looking for something that on a much shorter timeframe constructs a flowchart application ideally based on the content of component and connector configuration definitions.
