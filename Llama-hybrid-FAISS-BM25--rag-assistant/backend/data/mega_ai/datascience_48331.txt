Residual plot is tight to zero, but low R2 score

Hi I am a beginner at data science, and currently trying to use Gradient Boost Regressor to predict car price based on several attribute such as machine capacity, car brand, car type etc. I am following this tutorial: https://github.com/PaacMaan/cars-price-predictor/blob/master/cars_price_predictor.ipynb I got a low R2 score and plotted the residual vs predicted value, what i am confused with is even though my residual value is close to zero (as showed on the graph) my r2_score is low. Can anyone kindly explain this to me? here is my r2 score r2_score: 0.38 and the code i am using car_df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(car_df_encoded, columns=['Store_Loc','Brand','Type','Transmission'], prefix = ['Store_Loc','Brand','Type','Transmission']) price= car_df_encoded.pop('Price') x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(car_df_encoded, harga, test_size=0.25) gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(loss='huber', max_depth=5, max_features=None,min_samples_leaf=8, min_samples_split=6, n_estimators=150,random_state=42) gbr.fit (x_train, y_train) predicted = gbr.predict(x_test) residual = y_test - predicted Tried using cross validation as well scores = cross_val_score(gbr, car_df_encoded, harga, cv=4, scoring='r2') print('\nMean Score:') print(scores.mean()) and my mean r2 score is Cross Validation Scores: [0.76621245 0.41771035 0.35744057 0.73955563] Mean Score: 0.5702297501214788
