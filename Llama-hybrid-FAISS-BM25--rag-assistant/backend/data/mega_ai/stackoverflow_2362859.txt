I've used CDC in a data-warehouse set up before. It's very good and saves you having to write triggers for all your tables, but I would list 2 areas of caution: By default, there is a SQL agent job that prunes the tables every X days (can't remember the default), so you need to either override this, or ship the data elsewhere. Scripts that drop and recreate tables (which MSSQL Management studio sometimes does) can result in your CDC tables being dropped and the data lost, so take care.
