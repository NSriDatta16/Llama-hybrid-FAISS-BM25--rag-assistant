What can be a good way to generate data(tabular) from statistical facts and probability of data?

For Example, If I have facts saying that: 50% of humans are male 30% of males are Indians 70% of Indians are brown average age of Indians are 27 30% of indian females are working 80% of no-indian females work So, basically a lot of variables which are sometimes dependent on others.
