How to use pcap_sendqueue_queue() in winpcap library?

I used pcap_sendPacket() to send raw UDP packet which i crafted manually. i want to increase the performance of my code by reducing the context switches. But i got the sample code about pcap_sendqueue_queue() function it sends variable number of packets in a time.but it reads read from the already dumped .pcap file and .cap file. i want to use this queue() function to send the same UDP packets which i crafted it manually. this is the link for sending the packets using pcap_sendpacket()? http://pastebin.com/m402783ae how to modify this code to send this packets in a queue()? thanks in advance
