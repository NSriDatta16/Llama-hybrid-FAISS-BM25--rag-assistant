Need help integrating NCover 3.4 into CruiseControl.Net 1.5 with xUnit 1.6.1

I'm trying to integrate NCover into my CC.net build. I followed an article I found here http://csut017.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/improved-ncover-integration/ that I pretty much followed verbatim except that we use xUnit instead of nUnit for our unit tests. The problem is NCover never runs on the build server with this configuration and I was wondering if anyone else had some experience with this and could give me some advice. Below is the pertinent parts of my ccnet.config file. The portion of the config is running our unit tests which have been configured right in the proj files. C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe c:\projects\win_wip\src\Core.Tests Core.Tests.csproj /noconsolelogger /p:configuration=debug Test 900 C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server\ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MsBuild.dll c:\program files\ncover\ncover.console.exe C:\Projects\win_wip\lib\xunit-1.6.1\xunit.console.clr4.x86.exe DomainModel.Tests.dll c:\projects\win_wip\src\domainmodel.tests\bin\debug domainmodel.*.dll C:\Program Files\NCover\NCover.Reporting.exe ncover\reports FullCoverageReport CoveragePercentageDescending
