Maybe you could try to turn this seemingly time series problem into a classification. I would then create a set of features, e.g: number of days between requestDate and tripStartDeparture binned departure and arrival times, e.g. 0-2, 3-5, .. 23 travel time (tripDestinationDeparture - tripStartDeparture) day of the week, categorical features for both departure and arrival categorical feature for month flight carrier: maybe you can categorize them from low-cost to high-end airline etc.. Actually, a bunch of new features can be created from your initial dataset if you are a little creative. Then try out a series of classifiers independently then stack them to see model acccuracy you can get.
