Your question is not clear becuse it mixes up several different things. On the one hand, a pointer to derived class can be converted to a pointer to a base class (assuming the base is accessible). This is a natural conversion and there's no need for any cast to do it. On the other hand, you mention dynamic_cast and its ability to to perform downcasts . But downcasts are casts in the opposite direction: from a pointer to a base class to a pointer to derived class. Downcasts can be performed by both dynamic_cast and static_cast depending on what you need and what amount of run-time checking you require. ... And at the same time you ar talking about casting the result of new , which, of course, can only be upcasted, but not downcasted. So, what is it you are asking about? Upcasts or downcasts?
