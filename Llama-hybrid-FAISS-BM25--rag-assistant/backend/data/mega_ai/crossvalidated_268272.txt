The first thing to consider is the size of your training data. From your description and results I gather that it is small. There are three things your need to: Change your loss to categorical crossentropy and use a single output since you have boolean classes. Significantly decrease the size of your network. First try a single hidden layer with far fewer hidden units. Split your data into training, validation, and test sets. If your dataset is small, use cross-fold validation. I would recommend starting with this code (logistic regression): model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(1, input_dim=300, activation='sigmoid')) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=["accuracy"]) If that fails, add a hidden layer: model = Sequential() H = 100 model.add(Dense(H, input_dim=300, activation='tanh')) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=["accuracy"]) H is the hyper-parameter you'll have to tune. Try 50, 100, 150, 200, 300. Now if your classes aren't balanced (not 50/50 fruits/veggies) you should look at other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1. Good luck!
