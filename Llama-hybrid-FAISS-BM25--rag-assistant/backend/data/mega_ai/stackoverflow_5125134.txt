The best way is to not use the SDK if you can help it, and just use a multitouch driver. This simplifies things greatly. Once you have this driver you need to: enable pen and touch in windows respond to the TouchDown, TouchMove, and TouchUp events. the touches don't get translated into events the same way mouse clicks / drags do. Look at the "Raw Touch" section of this article . if you dont have a driver, or you insist on using their SDK, you should still look into the Touch events I listed above, as these are most likely what you need.
