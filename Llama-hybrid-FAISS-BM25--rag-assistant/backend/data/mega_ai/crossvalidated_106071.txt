Get fitted values estimated in ARIMA in Matlab

I am using Matlab to forecast time series data using ARIMA algorithm. I am able to get forecasted values, but unable to get the fitted values. This is what I mean. In R: model forecasted$fitted will give the data which has been fitted to the original data by the ARIMA algorithm. But I cannot see anything like that in Matlab. This is what I have done so far: model = arima(1,1,0); [est, ~, logL, info] = estimate(model, data); [output, YMSE] = forecast(est, 10); output gives me the 10 values Arima has forecasted, but not the original data values it has fitted. I would like to know those. Any help is appreciated.
