Is there any reason not to recode it as an iteration? That way, it'd be easier to set a hard limit on the depth of the organizational tree in order to catch bad (cyclic) data. Recursion is fun, and tail optimizations can even make it efficient, but here it seems a like large hammer for a small problem.
