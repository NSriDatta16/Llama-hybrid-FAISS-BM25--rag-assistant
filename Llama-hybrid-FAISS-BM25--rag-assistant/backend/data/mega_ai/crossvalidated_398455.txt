How to measure the growth of a trend in time-series analysis?

I have a time series dataset as follows day 1 2 3 4 5 6 sales_dept1 0 0 0 3 3 3 sales_dept2 0 0 0 6 6 6 sales_dept3 0 0 0 1 1 1 As you can see, dept2 is most efficient, dept1 is second most efficient and dept3 is less efficient. In other words, I want to capture the performance diffrences among the departments. For, that I used Linear Regression and got the slope as a metric to compare the performace. However, I got the following results as the slope (which do not match with my manual interpretation). dept1 slope = 1 dept2 slope = 0.5 dept3 slope = 3 My code is as follows. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression regressor = LinearRegression() X = [[0], [0], [0], [3], [3], [3]] y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] regressor.fit(X, y) print(regressor.coef_) Therefore, I think slope is not the correct metric for my situation. Is there any other metric that captures the actual growth change of different time-series data? I am happy to provide more details if needed.
