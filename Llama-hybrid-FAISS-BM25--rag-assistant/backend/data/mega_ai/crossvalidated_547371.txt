To calculate Bayes estimator for $\theta $ using squared error loss function

The life of an electric bulb, X (in hours), follows the exponential distribution with mean life $ 1/ \theta $ , where $ \theta(>0) $ is an unknown parameter. The prior distribution of $ \theta $ has a gamma distribution ( $ \alpha , \lambda $ ) with mean 0.8 and standard deviation 2. The average live of a random sample of size 5 bulbs is 3.8 hours . Calculate the Bayes' estimate of theta using the squared error loss function. Also explain the significance of the bold part Now in this question , since I am learning bayes estimation on my own so I do it step by step Step1 $\ f(x |\theta ) $ = $ \theta e^{-x\theta} $ And from the given mean and standard deviation , $ \alpha = 0.16 , \lambda = 0.2 $ since in gamma distribution mean = $ \frac{\alpha }{\lambda }$ And variance = $ \frac{\alpha }{\lambda^2 }$ Now $g(\theta ) = \frac{\alpha^\lambda \theta^{\alpha -1 } e^{- \theta \lambda } } {\gamma(\alpha )}$ Now after this we will find their joint distribution, but one thing I am unable to understand is that why are the sample size and average life of bulbs given , where shall is use them ?? I dont think I am doing it correct , can anyone please assist here ??
