How quick is .NET at finding the right value based on such a key? The complexity of retrieving a value for a key is close to O(1) according to MSDN , so it's pretty fast... Also from MSDN: The speed of retrieval depends on the quality of the hashing algorithm of the type specified for TKey. If you use a string as the key, you should be OK, since we can probably assume that the String class uses an efficient hashing algorithm...
