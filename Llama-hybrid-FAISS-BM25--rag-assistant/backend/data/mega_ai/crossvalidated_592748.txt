The quoted paragraph defined C = A or B, I'm not sure what you are asking by saying "if and only if all people who have at least one disease go to the doctor". That's precisely how this person defined it. $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B) = 0.01$ , yes. On the other hand, $$P(C) = P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B) = 0.19.$$ The passage is explaining the bias of using a data source coming from the doctors' offices only, artificially causing diseases A and B to have correlations.
