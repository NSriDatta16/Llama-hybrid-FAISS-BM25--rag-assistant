How can I efficiently model the sum of Bernoulli random variables?

I am modeling a random variable ( $Y$ ) which is the sum of some ~15-40k independent Bernoulli random variables ( $X_i$ ), each with a different success probability ( $p_i$ ). Formally, $Y=\sum X_i$ where $\Pr(X_i=1)=p_i$ and $\Pr(X_i=0)=1-p_i$ . I am interested in quickly answering queries such as $\Pr(Y\leq k)$ (where $k$ is given). Currently, I use random simulations to answer such queries. I randomly draw each $X_i$ according to its $p_i$ , then sum all $X_i$ values to get $Y'$ . I repeat this process a few thousand times and return the fraction of times $\Pr(Y'\leq k)$ . Obviously, this is not totally accurate (although accuracy greatly increases as the number of simulations increases). Also, it seems I have enough data about the distribution to avoid the use simulations. Can you think of a reasonable way to get the exact probability $\Pr(Y\leq k)$ ? p.s. I use Perl & R. EDIT Following the responses I thought some clarifications might be needed. I will shortly describe the setting of my problem. Given is a circular genome with circumference c and a set of n ranges mapped to it. For example, c=3*10^9 and ranges={[100,200],[50,1000],[3*10^9-1,1000],...} . Note all ranges are closed (both ends are inclusive). Also note that we only deal with integers (whole units). I am looking for regions on the circle that are undercovered by the given n mapped ranges. So to test whether a given a range of length x on the circle is undercovered, I test the hypothesis that the n ranges are mapped randomly. The probability a mapped range of length q>x will fully cover the given range of length x is (q-x)/c . This probability becomes quite small when c is large and/or q is small. What I'm interested is the number of ranges (out of n ) which cover x . This is how Y is formed. I test my null hypothesis vs. one sided alternative (undercoverage). Also note I am testing multiple hypothesis (different x lengths), and sure to correct for this.
