An organization i worked for choose RCP because their users needed to work with the application both online and offline ( when they are on the road, etc ) . I know this is possible with google grears now but gears is not really mainstream enough for big organiazation to base it flagship product on . But if your users dont have the need to go offline you would really save the hassle of syncing user data / product updates ect between your rcp app and server, RIA would be the way to go in this case.
