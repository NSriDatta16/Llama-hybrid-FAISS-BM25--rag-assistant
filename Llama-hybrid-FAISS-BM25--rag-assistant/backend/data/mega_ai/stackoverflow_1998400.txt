Data directory has no read/write permission in Android

I m using Android 1.5 my data directory doesn't have the read/write permissions System.out.println("DAta can write??--->"+Environment.getDataDirectory().canWrite()); System.out.println("DAta can read??--->"+Environment.getDataDirectory().canRead()); So please suggest me how to provide permissions for the data directory. What I'm trying to do is to create a file and add some content to it in the Data storage of the emulator like as below private void writeToSDCard() { try { File lroot = Environment.getDataDirectory(); if (lroot.canWrite()){ File lfile = new File(lroot, "samplefile.txt"); FileWriter lfilewriter = new FileWriter(lfile); BufferedWriter lout = new BufferedWriter(lfilewriter); lout.write("XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"); lout.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { Log.e(m_cTAG, "Could not write file " + e.getMessage()); } }
