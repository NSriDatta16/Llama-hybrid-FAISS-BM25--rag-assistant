ASP.NET: How to make a checkbox always unchecked even post-submit

Just started learning how to develop a ASP.NET application, i am puzzled on how to make a checkbox is always unchecked even after form submit where a user tick the checkbox. The checkbox is for acknowledgment that user agrees to the terms and conditions ... and when form submit return some errors I want to display the error message on the screen and keep the checkbox unchecked regardless it was ticked or not. In my view I have the following: m.UserAgreement) %> And I have tried both the following in my controller and none of them works: ViewData["UserAgreement"] = false; return View(new MyModel { UserAgreement = false}); Anyone can help on how to achieve what I need? Thank you.
