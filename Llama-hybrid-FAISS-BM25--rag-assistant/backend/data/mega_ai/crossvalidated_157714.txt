R package for Weighted Random Forest? classwt option?

I'm trying to use Random Forest to predict the outcome of an extremely imbalanced data set (the minority class rate is about only 1% or even less). Because the traditional Random Forest algorithm minimizes the overall error rate, rather than paying special attention to the minority classes, it is not directly applicable on imbalanced data. So I want to assign a high cost to misclassification of the minority class (cost sensitive learning). I read several sources that we can use the option classwt of randomForest in R, but I don't know how to use this. And do we have any other alternatives to the randomForest funtion?
