I don't think you should look for precision in the case of a game, which changes with every patch and evolves over time. I would recommend looking for a pattern visually by graphing the data. You can smooth out noise with simple moving average ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average ) before building graphs. 12 period moving average makes sense (5 minutes * 12 is 1 hour). It will basically average the rate for every hour. You can then visually look for a pattern. It would also make sense to build graphs for every day and see if the same pattern persists. Also, there will be a limit on how much you can buy/sell at night. When the trading volume is low it is hard to trade large amounts. It will also make it easier for you to do some fundamental analysis, e.g. to see if patch days have different patterns, holidays, weekends, Friday nights, etc.
