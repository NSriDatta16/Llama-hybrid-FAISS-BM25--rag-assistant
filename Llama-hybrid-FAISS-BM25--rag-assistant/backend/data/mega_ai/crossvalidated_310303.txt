As of uninformative priors: the prior You described can be 'eased' further by decreasing the degree of belief ( nu ). Note that You can achieve practically flat improper priors by specifying nu of variance components to be zero (see Hadfield's Course Notes). I wouldn't recommend using improper priors though, because they can make inference from the model challenging (or even meaningless), and improper priors can lead to zero values of variance components, or MCMC chains more easily get stuck at given parameter values (produce reducible chains). Specifying us(trait:atribute):id is indeed a correct way to have random slopes, and in this setup You won't need to change the dimension of variance matrix of G1 from 2.
