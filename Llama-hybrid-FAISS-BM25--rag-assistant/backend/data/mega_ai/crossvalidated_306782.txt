Why is MCMC not reliable when compared to stochastic gradient descent?

I came across the following quote on enter link description here if we made MCMC as reliable as stochastic gradient descent now is for deep networks, that could mean a resurgence of more explicit Bayesian/probabilistic models and hierarchical graphical models, of which RBMs are just one example. Is it really true that MCMC is not as reliable as SGD?
