How to get image from vb6 MSFlexGrid OLEDragDrop event

I have a VB project that is converted from VB6 to VB.NET. In this, I have a MSFlexGrid that is used as an interop compatibiliy. That means it is somewhat converted to .NET, but internally, many of the mechanisms are still from VB6/COM. I need to drag an image from a PictureBox (which is .NET) and drop it on the flexgrid. This is what I do to initialize the drag: Private Sub picStartSymbol_MouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles picStartSymbol.MouseDown picStartSymbol.DoDragDrop(picStartSymbol.Image, DragDropEffects.Copy) End Sub And this is where I catch the drop in the FlexGrid: Private Sub flxConstructionPoints_OLEDragDrop(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AxMSFlexGridLib.DMSFlexGridEvents_OLEDragDropEvent) Handles flxConstructionPoints.OLEDragDrop Dim image As Image Dim oleImage As Object oleImage = e.data.GetData(2) ''This gets an object of type 2 (bitmap) ''How to convert oleImage to a .NET Image? End Sub
