As you mentioned you are searching just names, emails or ids, etc which is not large text. So consider a case where you have 6 documents/records having names as below then you can understand better whether how much the large text could matter. Rohit kumar Bhatnagar Shilpa Shinde Manoj kumar Rohit Bhatnagar Kandaswamy Rohit kumar shindey Bhatnagar Rohit Bhatnagar If user comes and perform a search for Rohit Bhatnagar, then using the regex you will be showing results in two ways: Case I: Where regex is strict match Rohit Bhatnagar Kandaswamy Rohit Bhatnagar Case II: When regex is relax Rohit kumar Bhatnagar Rohit Bhatnagar Kandaswamy Rohit kumar shindey Bhatnagar Rohit Bhatnagar If we examine case Ist, you are missing two things relaxation(Record 1 & 5 will be missed) and in ranking exact match should come on top that might be more relevant. In case 2, we relaxed but still exact match is below in ranking So if need a relevant search then yes you can use a search engine. You could also tweak like whether you need the record 5 or not because if you see that might looks irrelevant so you can control like how many words should be in between to consider a document match. If we say consider 1 word in between then record 5 will be eliminated from results. Other than search relevance, you can horizontal scale your search if QPS is high. You could also use machine learning techniques(learn to rank), also you could apply synonyms, stemming etc. There are still many other benefits join, streaming, sharding, etc which you could learn from the documentation Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_6/ ES: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/index.html If above mentioned is required or in near Future then you can use use ElasticSearch or Solr as search engine otherwise you should be good with the current system.
