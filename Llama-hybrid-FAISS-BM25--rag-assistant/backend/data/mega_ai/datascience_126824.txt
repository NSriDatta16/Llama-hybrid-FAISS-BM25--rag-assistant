How to determine the optimal number of trees in Random Forest?

Here I list possible answers for mine: Do you use the graph for OOB? Do you use any other kind of graph? Do you take a fixed number in default? Do you take in consideration any research paper which explain why you should use x-number of trees? Do you use any piece of code in any package in R or python which you trust to do it for you? Can you choose which is your solution and give arguments why?
