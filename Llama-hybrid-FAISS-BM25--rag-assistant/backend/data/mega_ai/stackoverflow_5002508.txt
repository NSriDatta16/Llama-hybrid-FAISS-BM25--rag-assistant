I think you are confusing OR with SQL union operator to join the returns of the two queries. OR is used to manage conditions in the WHERE part of the statement while union is used to append one query to another. You should note that union will only work if the two queries have the same domains. From quick look at your queries it should do exactly what you have in mind. Try this: SELECT "outbreaks".* FROM "outbreaks" INNER JOIN "bacterial_agents" ON bacterial_agents.outbreak_id = outbreaks.id INNER JOIN "bacteria" ON "bacteria".id = "bacterial_agents".bacterium_id WHERE (bacteria.name ILIKE E'%VTEC O157%') UNION SELECT "outbreaks".* FROM "outbreaks" INNER JOIN "viral_agents" ON viral_agents.outbreak_id = outbreaks.id INNER JOIN "virus" ON "virus".id = "viral_agents".virus_id WHERE (virus.name ILIKE E'%NOROVIRUS%')
