Generalized linear model operate on the idea that the expected value, conditioned on (or parameterized by) some features, is linearly related to the features once a link function, often called $g$ , is applied to the expectation. In math: $$g(\mathbb E[Y\vert X])=X\beta$$ In logistic regression, we use $g=\log\left(\dfrac{p}{1-p}\right)$ . Inverting $g$ to solve for $p$ gives the activation function used in logistic regression.
