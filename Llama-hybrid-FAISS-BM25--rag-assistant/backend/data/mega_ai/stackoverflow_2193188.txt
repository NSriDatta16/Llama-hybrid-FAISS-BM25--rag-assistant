VS.Net - automating "Execute Custom Tool"

My organization has a visual studio (2008) project that contains a slew of Crystal Reports. One thing we'd like to do is have the ability to automate the build of this assembly, especially when either 1) a new report is added to the project, or 2) whenever one of the existing reports is modified. Everything as far as updating the project with new or modified reports is all fine-and-good, but we have yet to figure out a way to run the "Execute Custom Tool" against them (to regenerate the wrapper classes around the reports). Do any of you fine gentlefolk know of a way to do this?
