grouping draggable objects with jquery-ui draggable

I want to use jquery draggable/droppable to let the user select a group of objects (each one has a checkbox in the corner) and then drag all the selected objects as a group... I can't figure out for the life of me how to do it haha. Here is what I'm thinking will lead to a usable solution, on each draggable object, use the start() event and somehow grab all the other selected objects and add them to the selection I was also considering just making the dragged object look like a group of objects (they're images, so a pile of photos maybe) for performance reasons. I think using the draggable functionality might fall over if you drag several dozen objects at once, does that sound like a better idea?
