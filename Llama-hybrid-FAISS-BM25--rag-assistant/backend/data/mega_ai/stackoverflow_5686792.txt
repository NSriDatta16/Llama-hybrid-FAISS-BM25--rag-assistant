2 simple steps: place the canvas inside a div container with overflow:hidden use any method to make your canvas draggable (I will use jQuery UI) To follow my method you need to go to the jQuery UI website and download any version of the jQuery UI (you can create a custom version only consisting of the UI Core and Draggable Interaction for this example.) Unpack the .zip file and move the 'js' folder to your page directory. Inlcude the .js files contained in the folder into your page. Place the following code between your -tags to get your canvas draggable: $(function() { $("#CanvasID").draggable(); }); Here's an example: canvas test #box{ width: 400px; height: 400px; border:5px solid black; overflow:hidden; position:relative; } /* Just some basic styling for demonstration purpose */ window.onload = function() { var drawingCanvas = document.getElementById('myDrawing'); // Check the element is in the DOM and the browser supports canvas if(drawingCanvas.getContext) { // Initaliase a 2-dimensional drawing context var context = drawingCanvas.getContext('2d'); context.strokeStyle = "#000000"; context.fillStyle = "#FFFF00"; context.beginPath(); context.arc(200,200,200,0,Math.PI*2,true); context.closePath(); context.stroke(); context.fill(); } // just a simple canvas $(function() { $( "#myDrawing" ).draggable(); }); // make the canvas draggable } Your browser doesn't support canvas. Hope this get's you going. note: This is just a basic example. This will still need some editing. For example the user can drag the canvas totally out of the viewport (perhaps constraining the Canvas to the div may do the trick?). But this should be a good starting point.
