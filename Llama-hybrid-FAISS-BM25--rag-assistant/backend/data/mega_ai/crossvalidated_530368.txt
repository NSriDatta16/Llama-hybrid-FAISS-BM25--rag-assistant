Bayesian point estimate of a random sample

I am new to statistics and some concepts are not clear to me. I have a random sample that is distributed as a Binomial with parameters $k=2$ and $\theta$ unknow. Using a Bayesian approach I must give a point estimate for $\theta$ . I understand that being binomial, a priori I must use a beta distribution, and there is a relationship between the expectation and the variance with the beta distribution. I intend to obtain the expectation and variance of my initial data and with them obtain shape1, shape2, (I am working in R). to get my a priori beta distribution, but shape1 and shape2 come out negative, which tells me that I am doing something wrong. Can someone guide me? Or if I'm doing it wrong, how should I proceed?
