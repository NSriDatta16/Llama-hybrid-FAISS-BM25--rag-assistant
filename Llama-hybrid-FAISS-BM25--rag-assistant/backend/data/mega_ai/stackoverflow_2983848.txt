JSTL XML Transforms not working with nested XSL includes

I have a bit of JSP that does this: This transforms the XML exactly as expected so long as Transformer.xsl contains no tags or so long as any documents it does include do not include anything. However, if I use an XSL which includes a document which in turn includes another document, I get the following error: ERROR: 'Invalid URI 'NestedInclude.xsl Could not resolve entity reference: "NestedInclude.xsl"'.' Note that the JSP is contained in the directory below the xsl documents. If all my XSLs and JSPs are in the same directory (and I remove the xsltSystemId attribute) then everything would work fine, but I don't really want to do this. Can anyone see anything I'm doing wrong, as it's a bit of a killer at the moment and the JSTL documentation is next to useless.
