The most commonly used persistent storage for CoreData is implemented on top of sqlite3, so they have fairly similiar performance characteristics interms of raw fetch peformance, etc. It has a lot of code to handle faulting in objects in the background without blocking, evicting them under memory pressure and transparently refaulting them as necessary, etc. In the strictest sense if you are going to spend an immense amount of time (think months to years) optimizing for a specific case then a direct sqlite3 implementation can beat CoreData, but the vast majority of the time CoreData will beat any simple sqlite3 based implementations.
