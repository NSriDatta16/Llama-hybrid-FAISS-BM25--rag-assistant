You can also use a server side solution like php (or any other you have access to). Using php you would save the style-sheet as a php file which would get "executed" every time it is requested. You could put all your variables on top and echo them where ever you need them. The browser sees a normal style-sheet, but the server would have some extra work to do. And it does not really improve the readability of the style-sheet... Not a very elegant solution, but it works.
