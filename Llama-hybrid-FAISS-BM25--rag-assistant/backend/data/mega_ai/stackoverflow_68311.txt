Using indentation in a language doesn't necessarily mean that the language's grammar can not be context free. I.e. the indentation will determine in which scope a statement exists. A statement will still be a statement no matter which scope it is defined within (scope can often be handled by a different part of the compiler/interpreter, generally during a semantic parse). That said a good resource is the antlr tool ( http://www.antlr.org ). The author of the tool has also produced a book on creating parsers for languages using antlr ( http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr/the-definitive-antlr-reference ). There is pretty good documentation and lots of example grammars.
