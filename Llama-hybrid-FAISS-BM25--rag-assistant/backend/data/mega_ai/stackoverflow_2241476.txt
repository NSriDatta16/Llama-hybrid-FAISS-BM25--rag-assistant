Organizer reporting, "The version of iPhone OS doesn't match iPhone OS supported for development"

Earlier this week I was developing to the device just fine. I upgraded itunes to the latest version (9.0.2 (25)) and I noticed that Organizer was throwing the: The version of iPhone OS on “sk’s iPhone” does not match any of the versions of iPhone OS supported for development So I figured I'd upgrade to the newest XCode in hopes that it would solve the problem. Well, it didn't - After an upgrade to Xcode 3.2.2 Organizer is still throwing the error and not letting me build to the device. Image of the exact error message: http://mr-sk.com/iphone/organizer.png Edit: I installed the 3.2 SDK - Apparently I missed out on the 3.1.3 SDK - any idea how to fix this? Side note: This ALWAYS seems to happen to me - every time I upgrade. Last time I believed it was fixed by some random terminal command (sym linking a path? - I can't recall) but it's a PITA that this never, ever, seems to work smoothly. Thanks!
