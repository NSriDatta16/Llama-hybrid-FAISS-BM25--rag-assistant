I have cilents with 300 mb databases although they should be upsizing to SQL Server for other reasons. 19 Mb is relatively small. If performance is bad enough that archiving speeds things up then check the indexes to the tables for all your sorting and selection fields. Albert gave you a good URL there to check. Entire MDB files do not go down the wire. Unless you are missing indexes.
