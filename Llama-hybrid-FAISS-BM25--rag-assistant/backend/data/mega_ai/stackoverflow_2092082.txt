A detailed summary of the unit tests could include a measure of code coverage perhaps, or a chart showing where you have achieved code coverage. But even this is not particularly valuable. This is part of the problem with unit tests - it's easy to add a unit test to add additional code coverage without really adding to the confidence you have in your code. If you have some specific tests that, for example, test that known input/output combinations worked, or that test the handling of certain edge or exception cases, then you can document those. If you used test-driven development, where the test comes from the problem and its analysis rather than from the code in a "retrofitted" manner, then say that as well. By all means put some simple metrics in there, but you always have to take these with a pinch of salt...
