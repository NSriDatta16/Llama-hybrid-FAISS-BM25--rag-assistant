How to search for a .htaccess file with Windows?

I am dealing with a massive nest of files and need to find a .htaccess file that is redirecting a single page in my website. I know how ridiculous this sounds: why not just check the directories the page is located within? But the problem is slightly more complicated than that. All I need though, is to search for every .htaccess file under the web folder. Trying a normal search doesn't allow me to select that type of file to search for, and searching for hidden files has just been (who knows why) ignoring the .htaccess files anyway. I can't download any new software to do this for me. but - there must be a way! Even if I could somehow list every file within a directory (and its subdirs) and then organize by file type and scroll down? I could search for any file with the word "RewriteEngine" , but there are so many files, this would take forever. Any ideas? Thanks! =/ notepad++ is not installed, and I don't have auth to install anything
