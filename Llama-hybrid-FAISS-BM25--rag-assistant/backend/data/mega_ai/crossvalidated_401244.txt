Propensity Scores: What is this estimator?

I'm reading The Central Role of the Propensity Score in Observational Studies for Causal Effects in order to understand why Propensity Scores work. I'm kind of new to this and I'm not understanding an estimator given in corollary 4.3. Let $r_t$ be the potential outcome response for treatment $t$ . $z = t, t = 0, 1$ denotes the treatment and $b(x)$ is a balancing score. This is the notation used in the paper. They state: "Suppose treatment assignment is strongly ignorable, so that in particular, $E[r_t| z = t, b(x)] = E[r_t | b(x) ]$ for balancing score $b(x)$ . Further suppose that the conditional expectation of $r_t$ given $b(x)$ is linear: $E [ r_t | z = t, b(x) ] = \alpha_t + \beta_t b(x)$ with $t = 0, 1$ . Then the estimator $$(\hat{\alpha}_1 - \hat{\alpha}_0) + (\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_0)b(x)$$ is conditionally unbiased given $b(x_i) (i = 1, ..., n)$ for the treatment effect at $b(x)$ . " My question is, what is this estimator? I am not sure how to relate it to the notation I am familiar with: Let $Y_i$ be the response of the $i$ th unit, and $Z_i$ be a treatment indicator. Keep $b(x)$ as a balancing score. Is this estimator the same as the interpretation of treatment effect $\theta$ as the change in the expected response in a regression model of the form: $$E[Y_i| b(x_i)] = \alpha + \theta z_i + \beta b(x_i)$$ where $Z_i = 0, 1$ ? More generally, I'm a little confused on the mathematical justification for why a regression adjustment on the propensity score works. I understand that the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment conditional on the propensity score, but why can we use regression coefficients to estimate average treatment effects? If anyone had some references that would be great
