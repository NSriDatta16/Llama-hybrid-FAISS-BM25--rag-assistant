Effective Techniques for Password Retrieval in Modern Web Applications

We've been working on web application where in we need to implement traditional web-apps functionality of password retrieval. According to the trends there are approaches like.. Sending Password reset link to user's email. Asking Secret Question to the user for Password recovery. Resetting the existing Password and creating a new password and sending it to the user. This may also force the user to change the password upon next logon. Do we have any non-traditional technique for implementing password retrieval mechanism ? What other approaches you've tried for this ? Thanks.
