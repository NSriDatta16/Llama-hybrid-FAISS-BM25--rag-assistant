Because your 'closeness' metric obeys the triangle inequality, you should be able to use a variant of BK-Trees to organize your elements. Adapting them to real numbers should simply be a matter of choosing an interval to quantize your number on, and otherwise using the standard Bk-Tree procedure. Some experimentation may be required - you might want to increase the resolution of the quantization as you progress down the tree, for instance.
