A lot of MVC'ers are doing something akin to a view model in the sense that instead of returning domain objects to the controller, they have a flattened data structure (a view model) of all the data needed for that view regardless of how many domain objects worth of data it contains. In that regard a view model is very doable with MVC, and I'm sure it could be leveraged in webforms as well. However, there is no way that I know of to do the two way databinding / commanding / event aggregation that is associated with MVVM in WPF. Although I don't know of any webform implimentations you could try some of the approaches described here: Jimmy Bogard - How we do MVC Here is a very interesting article on how to do MVP in winforms: Castle Windsor's MVP with ASP.NET Maybe you can create a hybrid of these two approaches using webforms.
