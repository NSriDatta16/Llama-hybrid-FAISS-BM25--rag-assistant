Answering briefly on this. Using a P-value in Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) does not allow you to draw conclusions about your null hypothesis, just that you cannot reject it at the observed data. This is a common misconception. See e.g. Nickerson, R. S. (2000). Null hypothesis significance testing: A review of an old and continuing controversy. Psychological Methods, 5, 241-301 . Instead, you could calculate confidence intervals to get an idea about the population estimate, see for example Abserson 2002 - or use Bayesian statistics, but that is another chapter. You are right that your P-values will be even higher when correction for multiple comparisons is performed.
