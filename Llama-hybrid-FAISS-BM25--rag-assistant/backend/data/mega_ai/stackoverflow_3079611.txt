Installation pop-up perior to the download . how?

I wanna implement a download-and-install mechanism. I have a source link where my app gonna download from, an apk file. Ive managed to do it, but i payed attention to the fact, that it first download then when it finish downloading it pop up an installation window and then install. now this this can interrupt the user, if he is in the middle of conversation or some anothe opeartion, and all of a sudden the installtaion pop-up window, coming up after download successful. In the market it works in a diffrent way: first it's up an installation window, and then downloading, and installing (in the background) how can i achive it also the same way as the downloading mechanism of the market? thanks, ray.
