Is in-process the only way classic ASP can store session state?

I know it's a simple question, but I can't seem to drag it out of Google noise. I know .NET can use a session state service or a SQL database to back its session state, but I don't know if ASP offers any out-of-process options for storing it. Does it have any, or am I stuck with losing session variables on ASP applications when a load-balanced server is taken offline?
