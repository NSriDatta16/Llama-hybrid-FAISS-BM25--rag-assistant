html tag usage/replacment

I know that tags are evil. If it is so bad to have scrolling text, then using JS to get the same effect doesn't make it any better, right? And suppose I decided to have some scrolling text (gasp) , is there some type of CSS(3?) or HTML(5?) way to do this that is technically correct (i.e. not deprecated)? If there isn't a CSS/HTML solution, should I use: Javascript, which will be heavier to download and might be turned off (is that a pro or a con?), but I get the bonus of being W3C correct and valid and non-deprecated and smart, or should I use the hated ( ) tag, which is lightweight (19 bytes!), fully supported by all browsers in all rendering modes and all doctypes (even though it shouldn't be), but is deprecated? Thanks. P.S. I think a news ticker is a valid use for marquee-style P.P.S. If anybody tells me that if I don't want a heavy Javascript solution I should use JQuery because it is lightweight, I will shoot them in the comments Edit: I'm adding JQuery tag since that seems to be the best way to get attention from a lot of experts on JS questions, and it is not totally unrelated here.
