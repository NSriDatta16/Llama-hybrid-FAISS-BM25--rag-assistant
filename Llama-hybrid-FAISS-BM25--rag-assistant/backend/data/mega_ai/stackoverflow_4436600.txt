Is this the same application/database as your other question ? In which case, the answer has been supplied in that Data Model . If it isn't the same app/db, or if this question has not been adequately answered, pls post or comment. Eg. Based on previous info, I modelled it so that the SensorType table differentiates Sensor (analogue or boolean) ... but we could: differentiate it at the Sensor level, or make Reading into subtypes: ReadingAnalog and ReadingSwitch . That could make it a little easier for the programs that produce graphs, etc.
