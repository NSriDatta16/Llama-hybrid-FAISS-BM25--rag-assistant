The way you originally posed the question in terms of the probability of the hypothesis , there is no answer in classical (frequentist) statistics, and you need to provide further information for an answer in the Bayesian framework. In frequentist analysis the hypothesis is either true or false. There is no "probability" of the hypothesis, as this answer to one of the earliest questions on this site makes quite clear. Frequentist analysis examines the probability of obtaining a certain set of data given that a particular hypothesis is true. Bayesian analysis considers the probability of an hypothesis, but it begins with a prior assumption about that probability, which you have not provided. Data are then used to update that probability. As you can imagine, the manufacturer of the magical spray would be quite likely to challenge any prior probability assumption that you make in this case. If you intended to ask about probability of data rather than of hypotheses, this is a simple problem in binomial statistics and contingency tables. See this question for discussion of statistical tests, this Wikipedia page for background, and the Vassar site as a resource for doing computations (look for 2x2 contingency table tests). As you posed the situation, with one set of results obtained before the other, without direct comparison, you may have a problem with experimental design. My first thought was that the first batch of RPs was faulty, and those receiving the magical spray came from a better batch.
