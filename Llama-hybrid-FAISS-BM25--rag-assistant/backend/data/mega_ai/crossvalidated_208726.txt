Bayesian model comparison in high school

I teach physics to high-school students, and I would like my students to conduct a rudimentary Bayesian model comparison for data from their experiments. I figured out a way for them to do so (see below), but I'm not certain it's correct. I would very much appreciate any feedback on it (especially negative feedback!), or suggestions on how to do it better. I would like to compare a linear theory, with parameters slope $a$ and intercept $b$, to a null hypothesis of a constant i.e. slope $a$=0. In both cases I assume Gaussian symmetric noise. The students can derive, using Excel, the maximum likelihood estimates for the slope and intercept ($\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$), and their errors $da$ and $db$. For the prior on the slope, I consider a wide Gaussian, centered on the maximum=likelihood estimate ($\hat{a}$) and with a standard deviation of ten times that. My reasoning is that I realistically expect them to find the "correct" line parameters to at least within a magnitude, and in practice they will find ones closer still so if I replace the "correct" slope with its MLE I won't change the numbers too much. For the likelihood of the evidence given any particular linear theory, I consider the standard multivariate Gaussian distribution, with a standard deviation ($\sigma_e$) related to the sum of the residuals squared. The likelihood of the evidence for the linear theory in general, i.e. the integral of the above prior and likelihood, is hence estimated to be the prior and likelihood at the MLE point, times the error in the slope $da$. The likelihood of the evidence given the null hypothesis is assumed to be another multivariate Gaussian, now using the total standard deviation ($\sigma_T$), based on the difference from average-Y. This is the part I'm least sure of: I estimate the Bayes factor to be the ratio of the above two likelihoods (3 and 4 above), which allows me to come up with the following formula: $B_{10}=\frac{da}{(10 |\hat{a}| \cdot \sqrt{2 \pi})}(\sigma_T/\sigma_e)^N\cdot \sqrt{e} $ Would this give us reasonable estimates for the Bayes factor? Any feedback is welcome.
