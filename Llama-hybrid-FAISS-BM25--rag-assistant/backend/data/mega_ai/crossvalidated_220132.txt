This sounds like you could employ e.g. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for your problem. With HMM, observed states would be your events, while hidden states would reflect your time series values. With RNN, input would be your events, and the output would be your time series values. In case you don't have a steady update frequency in your data (=uniform delays between samples), be sure to add the delay in your model (e.g. HMM can handle this well). For using binary features: you might need to use one-hot encoding (-1/1) for the RNN - but I'm not sure about this being a good choice for HMM.
