Can a state have zero periodicity?

I am getting my concepts cleared in Stochastic process. I understand the concept of periodicity. Just to make it clear, suppose there is a finite Markov chain with states $1,2,3$ . Let their transition probability matrix be $$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1& 0 & 0 \\ 0& 1& 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ In this case, what is the periodicity of state 3?
