"Recently, it was decided that medical examination can be reported EITHER as free-text (as always) OR in a structured way (divided in exam name, date, results, and so on)." This strikes me as a non-decision (probably made by non-cognoscenti). From what I can make of it, this so-called "decision" still leaves the information provider the liberty to provide the information in whatever way he wants, structured or non-structured. (Note : my reply doesn't apply if the information provider is forced to make a definitive choice between "structured" and "non-structured".) "Structured" means that there are "layout rules" (e.g. CSV) and "content rules" (e.g. "examName must be the name of a known course/exam") to which information provider must conform. But "non-structured" by definition will still keep meaning that "whatever information that information provider provides, that information will always at least satisfy "non-structured", so any information provided is, by definition, always acceptable under the "non-structured" interpretation. Therefore, this so-called "decision to allow structured too" is of no damn use at all to you. And (taking into account the caveat I mentioned), the logical conclusion is that "not doing anything at all" with this decision (which seems like a totally fake one) is your best option. No doubt you will think "But I just can't do that". You may be right, if your management is completely insensitive to logically well-founded reasoning. PS As to the remark that has been made ""One Fact, One Place, One Way" : Cases such as these might be illustrative of why it is sometimes necessary to relax that (TEMPORARILY !) to "One fact, One place, One OF TWO POSSIBLE ways". Just to facilitate transition-at-the-users'-pace.
