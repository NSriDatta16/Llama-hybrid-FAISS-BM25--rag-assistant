Penalized regression with zero-inflated models

I'm currently building zero-inflated Poisson & negative binomial predictive models using the zeroinfl() function from the pscl package in R. Incorporating penalized regressions into my model to account for shrinkage and variable selection is a priority. In addition I'd like to use penalization to avoid convergence issues due to perfect/quasi separation in my data (better than manually removing variables). Question : Realizing that zero-inflated models $\neq$ hurdle models, for purposes of variable selection will my models be seriously biased if I first run separate run lasso (or elastic net) Poisson and logistic regressions with glmnet to select variables for the zeroinfl()?
