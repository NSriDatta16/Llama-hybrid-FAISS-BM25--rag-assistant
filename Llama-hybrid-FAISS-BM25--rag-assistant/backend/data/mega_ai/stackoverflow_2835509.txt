I wouldn't overcomplicate your solution. The downside to storing images in a database is the database bloat and storage requirements for backups, especially if the images are only good for 12 hrs. If in doubt, keep it simple, so when requirements change, you haven't invested that much time anyways. This is how I did it on my site. Store the images in a folder. If you want control over the filename the user sees, or employ conditional logic, use an HttpHandler to serve up the image, otherwise just use its full path and filename in an img tag. If you are talking high-volume mega site, perhaps consider using a content delivery network.
