I skeptical of statistics for the following reasons. I am convinced anybody without a graduate degree in statistics has no clue what they are doing. Unf. there are millions of people across the world doing research without a graduate degree in statistics. I was an undergraduate math major at the Univeristy of Maryland College, Park. I took 4 400 level math classes. All teachers did was teach you how to calculate stuff. Nobody taught me how to make sense of anything or do any statistical analysis except for hypothesis testing, which makes no sense for 2 reasons. 1. For every hypothesis test I was taught, I had to make assumptions beforehand. Nobody taught me which assumption(s) I had to start with. 2. P values make no sense logically. A graduate degree in statistics might teach you what a p value actually is. However, I am convinced no undergraduate knows how to use it. The undergraduate definition assumes a probability of something that depends on the hypothesis being correct. Logically, the definition makes no sense at all. Even worse, NOBODY has ever told me where the probability comes from. I have actually emailed almost my whole math department(more than 200 people) if somebody could give me an answer. The most popular and only responses were "one would have to ASSUME the error rates for the probability" (When I asked people how this was done, they all answered me "from previous experiments", I could not get anything more specific from anybody), "It's just the way it is", and "it is completely random". The same thing happened when I googled what the signifigance of a p value is. It leads me to the conclusion... Even a sig. number of math and statistics professors have no clue what the logic behind statistics is. I don't expect people to have in depth knowledge. However, I have a feeling that even a sig. % of researches and professors do not understand any of the underlying logic behind statistics. Statistical error is not the same thing as actual error. Because people like to use statistics to derive estimates for things that are humongous, people like to use statistical error to "mask" the fact that they have no clue what the actual error. People use small samples for big populations because statistical theory tells them they can. I learned from one of my college courses, that people like to use data that is an estimate from about 30 schools in the country to show that there are few violent incidents in schools in the whole country. There are about 100,000 schools. That sounds insane. A whole popular movement is based off of about 30 schools in the whole country. People like to make the burden of proof statistical. The Higgs Bossom was never discovered. It was discovered statistically, but that doesn't mean anything. Something being discovered purely statistically is useless because nobody knows the accuracy of statistics. People like to use statistics to make important desicions. Statistics can be used as a guide, but nobody knows how accurate it really is. Just because a problem seems impossible to solve does not mean that statistics is the next best thing. The fact that DNA testing is based off of statistic gives me the chills. Can I be given the death penalty soley because of statistics? Could a murderer be released from jail soley because of statistics? I believe statistics can be useful, but only if it is not used as the conclusion. I believe statistics can tell us what some of the possibilities are. Then logic, not statistical logic should be used to prove which possibility(s) is correct.
