" from a Bayesian probability perspective, why doesn't a 95% confidence interval contain the true parameter with 95% probability? " In Bayesian Statistics the parameter is not a unknown value, it is a Distribution. There is no interval containing the "true value", for a Bayesian point of view it does not even make sense. The parameter it's a random variable, you can perfectly know the probability of that value to be between x_inf an x_max if you know the distribuition. It's just a diferent mindset about the parameters, usually Bayesians used the median or average value of the distribuition of the parameter as a "estimate". There is not a confidence interval in Bayesian Statistics, something similar is called credibility interval . Now from a frequencist point of view, the parameter is a "Fixed Value", not a random variable, can you really obtain probability interval (a 95% one) ? Remember that it's a fixed value not a random variable with a known distribution. Thats why you past the text :"A confidence interval does not predict that the true value of the parameter has a particular probability of being in the confidence interval given the data actually obtained." The idea of repeating the experience over and over... is not Bayesian reasoning it's a Frequencist one. Imagine a real live experiment that you can only do once in your life time, can you/should you built that confidence interval (from the classical point of view )?. But... in real life the results could get pretty close ( Bayesian vs Frequencist), maybe thats why It could be confusing.
