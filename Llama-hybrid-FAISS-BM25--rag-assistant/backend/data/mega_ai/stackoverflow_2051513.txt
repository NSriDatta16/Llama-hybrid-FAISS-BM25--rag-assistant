You should test with PDO if you are using the Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql adapter. Testing with the plain ext/mysql API is not comparing apples to apples. (of course fill in your password in place of XXXX) Run this test PHP script on the same host you run your Zend Framework application. This is important, because the same username may work when connecting from one host and not from another host. The username may even be authorized to connect via a loopback method (i.e. "localhost") but not from the same host if you invoke IP by specifying the hostname. If that paragraph made no sense to you, read about The MySQL Access Privilege System until it makes sense.
