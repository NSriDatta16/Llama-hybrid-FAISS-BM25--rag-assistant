How would I calculate a combination of the Binomial and Geometric Distributions?

To be specific with my problem, I'm calculating a formula for a game. There's 6 independent trials, each with an independent probability of success = 0.34. I know that from the Geometric distribution, it'll take about 3 trials before I get a success, so should expect about 2 successes for every 6 trials? However, my issue is that anytime I get a success, I get another trial, so if I get 2 successes in 6 trials, then I can get 2 more trials, and I'm having trouble determining the amount of successes I can expect on average, although I have a feeling it's around 3.
