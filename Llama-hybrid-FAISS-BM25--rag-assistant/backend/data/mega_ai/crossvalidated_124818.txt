Logistic Regression - Error Term and its Distribution

On whether an error term exists in logistic regression (and its assumed distribution), I have read in various places that: no error term exists the error term has a binomial distribution (in accordance with the distribution of the response variable) the error term has a logistic distribution Can someone please clarify?
