From some of the XNA 4 documentation I've been reading: We can define the size of the game back buffer to be different from the size of the target device, and to draw according to our definitions. The hardware will scale our image to the target device. Having the hardware scale our image to the final target size means minimal work porting games between different devices, but to get the best possible image quality we should consider the actual target display in advance. The following code fragment shows how to configure the back buffer for the maximum resolution supported by Windows Phone 7. C# if (this.Window.CurrentOrientation == DisplayOrientation.Portrait) { graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 480; graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 800; } else { graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 800; graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 480; } Most importantly, they clearly specify 800x480 as being the maximum supported resolution. It also demonstrates how easy it is to target multiple resolutions should that be desired. In this instance though, I'm assuming my programs will only ever run on 800x480.
