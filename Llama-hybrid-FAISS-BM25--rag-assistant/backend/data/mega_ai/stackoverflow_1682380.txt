Problem dispatching with google mobile analytics for iphone

I have integrated Google mobile analytics into my iphone app, but for some reason the page views and events are not dispatching. I put this into my app delegate applicationDidFinishLaunching method (i've x'd out the UA string): [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-xxxxxx-x" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:self]; NSError *error; [[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:@"/home" withError:&error]; This is the delegate method: - (void)trackerDispatchDidComplete:(GANTracker *)tracker eventsDispatched:(NSUInteger)eventsDispatched eventsFailedDispatch:(NSUInteger)eventsFailedDispatch { NSLog(@"Google Analytics Dispatch: succeeded:%i, failed:%i",eventsDispatched,eventsFailedDispatch); } which prints out the message: Google Analytics Dispatch: succeeded:0, failed:190 Did anyone else run into this problem?
