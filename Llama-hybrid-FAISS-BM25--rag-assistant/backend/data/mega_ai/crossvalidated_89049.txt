Error Calculating MVN Likelihood of Time Series with AR(1) Errors in R

I'm having trouble calculating the likelihood of a time series with AR(1) errors. I am generating my covariance matrix according to page 2 of ( http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contri...regression.pdf ), using the library mvtnorm and the multivariate normal density function dmvnorm(). Here's some example code: library(mvtnorm) # Generate a basic time series with AR(1) Errors: t Without fail, I get the following error message: Warning message: In log(eigen(sigma, symmetric = TRUE, only.values = TRUE)$values) : NaNs produced. It's worth noting that the matrix from the following ( https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-hel...ay/131728.html ) "works", but I think is actually for an MA(1) process rather than an AR(1) process. I gather the message means the proposed covariance matrix may not be invertible. This said I'm stuck on how to proceed and would be extremely appreciative of any thoughts. Thank you very much,
