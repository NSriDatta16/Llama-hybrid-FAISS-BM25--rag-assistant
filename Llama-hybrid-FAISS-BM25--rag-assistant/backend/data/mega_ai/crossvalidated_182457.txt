You're right that we often over-rely on exponential distributions to formulate GLMs. A link function is only half of a GLM. Also specified is a variance structure. For exponential families, the variance and link function have a mathematical relationship which gives a very simple estimating equation. However, there is often very good reason to step beyond the bounds of "regular likelihoods" and look to GLMs as estimating a meaningful relationship. An example of that is relative risk regression which uses a binomial variance structure but a log link to compare the relative rates of an outcome. Here, unlike logistic regression, an estimated rate ratio of 2 can be interpreted as "twice as likely to experience an outcome of interest" (an Odds ratio of 2 has no such interpretation). I think the only consideration would be that the estimating equation (whose solution produces our estimate $\beta). $$S(\beta) = D^TV^{-1} (Y - g(X\beta))$$ Should be asymptotically linear at it's root. I think this is required to ensure that the estimated variance is in some sense correct. Choosing $g^{-1}$ differentiable and invertible helps to ensure this, but it is not a necessary condition. The paper by Fahrmeir discusses this. You can, of course, get a broader class of estimators from minimax estimation!
