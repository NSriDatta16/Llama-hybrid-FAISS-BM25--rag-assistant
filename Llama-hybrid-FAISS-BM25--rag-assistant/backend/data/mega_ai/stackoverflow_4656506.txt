If they're saying that you've got access to agent, then you'll have to manage the agent jobs manually. The stored procs that you'll be looking at are sp_add_job , sp_add_jobserver (which you need to do even if you're just adding the same server you're running on), sp_add_jobstep and sp_add_schedule . They exist in msdb, not master, so you need to explicitly switch to msdb or include that db in your EXEC calls.
