Without further details about your model, priors and etcetera, the best thing I can do is to point out a reference for Bayesian variable selection Faraggi and Simon (1998). Bayesian Variable Selection Method for Censored Survival Data . Biometrics Vol. 54, No. 4, pp. 1475-1485. Of course, the typical way for conducting Bayesian model selection is the use of Bayes factors (http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/papers/bayesfactors.pdf) . You can use the posterior simulations obtained with your favourite software to calculate the Bayes factors using an importance sampling as detailed in Chopin and Robert (2010). Properties of Nested Sampling . Biometrika 97 (3): 741-755.
