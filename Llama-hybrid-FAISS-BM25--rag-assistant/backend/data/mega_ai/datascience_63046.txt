two options come to mind looking at your question: 1) One-Hot-Encoding + Correlation: One-Hot-Encoding takes your categorical features and replaces them by making a binary column out of each unique value of your categorical feature. Using this you would get a bunch of new numerical/binary features that you could then use for claculating the correlation between each bineary feature and your numerical ones. 2) Logistic Regression: If you want to measure correlation between your categorical feature and a numeric one you could try calculating a logistic regression between both (having your categorical feature as target and the numeric one as your only input). The hypothesis behind this is, that assuming you have a high correlation between your categorical feature and a numeric one it should be possible to build a fairly good performing model for predicting your categorical feature using your numerical one as input. Of course there are a bunch more ways to measure correlation between categorical and numerical values. They all however are based on some sort of distance measure you need to define for your categorical features.
