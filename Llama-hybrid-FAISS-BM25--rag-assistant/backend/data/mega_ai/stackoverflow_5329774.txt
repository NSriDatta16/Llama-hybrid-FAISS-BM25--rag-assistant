You could implement them in terms of const references so that server side constructs the transport struct but client usage is only allowed to have const references to them and can't actually instantiate or construct them to enforce the usage you want. Unfortunately without a code snippets of your messages, packaging, correct usage, and incorrect usage I can't really provide more detail on how to implement this in your situation but we use something similar in our data model to prevent improper usage. I also export and provide template storage classes to ease the population from the message for client usage when they do want to store the retrieved data.
