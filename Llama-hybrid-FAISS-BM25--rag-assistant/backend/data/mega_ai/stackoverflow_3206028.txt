Do I need another JQuery plugin for Draggable to work?

I am doing some self-learning about JQuery. Here is the code for my very simple HTML form: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#replybox").draggable(); }); The DIV table just could not be draggable, I am not sure what's wrong in the code. Any ideas?
