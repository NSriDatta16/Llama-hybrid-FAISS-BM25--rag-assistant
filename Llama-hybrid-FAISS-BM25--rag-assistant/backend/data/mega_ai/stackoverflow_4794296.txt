You can manipulate the URL with JavaScript using the window.location.href property, but this will trigger a page reload; fortunately you can use the window.location.hash property. The hash property is used for fragment identifiers, which are optional components of URLs that came after the hash character (#). The string that comes after the hash character is not sent to the server; therefore, the browser is responsible for restoring the state through client scripts, and retrieving the appropriate views. Because they are like normal links, but within a single page, no page reload occurs, and the browser behaves as if you have clicked a standard link, adding the URLs to the list of visited URLs. This also enables history navigation, bookmarking and sharing URLs with other people. Source: http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez/2010/02/the-single-page-interface-pattern/
