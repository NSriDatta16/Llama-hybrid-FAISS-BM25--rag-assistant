You actually have two problems, not one. The first problem seems to be to average the scores in a matrix. Here the mean, median, trimmed mean and winsorized mean all seem potentially sensible. The other is to somehow "account" for the size of the matrix. Here the total size (rxc) seems to be the obvious solution. If you need more than this, please clarify your question again, but I see no reason why the average (or any of the variations I listed) are poor choices simply because the matrices are different sizes.
