It entirely depends on where the variables need to be accessed from. If they're only needed in a single function, then a static local variable makes the most sense. If they're needed "file-wide" then a file global (that is still static) makes the most sense. Otherwise, a global. The other option, better for future expansion, would be to create a file-static variable set with accessor functions to get and set name/value combinations, and use that API everywhere else. That lets you change the storage mechanism later to something more efficient if, say, you suddenly needed to store lots of name/values pairs (say, into a b-tree instead of an array).
