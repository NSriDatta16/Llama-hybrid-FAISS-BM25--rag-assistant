Delete Drag and Drop Behavior of IKImageBrowserView

By default (it seems), IKImageBrowserView enables drag and drop to locations in the Finder. I would like to turn off this behavior but am unsure of how to do so. I was thinking that perhaps implementing the NSDraggingDestination protocol and overriding it could solve this, but so far it hasn't worked for me. Thanks for any help!
