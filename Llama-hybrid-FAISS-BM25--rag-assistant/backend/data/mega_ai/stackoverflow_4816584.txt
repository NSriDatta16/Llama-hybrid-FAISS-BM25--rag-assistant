Automatic login doesn't work while prompt does

I have a local ASP.NET web application that I use in IE. Some time ago I began experiencing problems with automatic login on to it. When I set "prompt for username and password" in Security settings - it's all fine, but when I set "automatic login only in intranet zone" - all I get is a screen "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage". I think it should at least ask for username and password when login fails, but this is all it gives. I don't know what could cause this - don't remember doing anything special, I just used manual login for some time, and then wanted to go back to automatic. The same application works with automatic login fine on other computers, both when using locally and from my machine also. So I assume there is not IE issue and not application issue - maybe something with IIS configuration? But I can't find anything appropriate there. Do you have any ideas? Thanks.
