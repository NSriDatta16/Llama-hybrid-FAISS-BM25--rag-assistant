I do not do neural networks, but logically the standard approach should be something like this: $$F[x] = f_n\circ f_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ f_1[w_1 x+b_1] \implies F'[x]=w_1\frac{\partial F}{\partial b_1}$$ In other words, use standard backprop to get the derivative with respect to the bias $b_1$ on the first layer. Then multiply by the weights $w_1$ applied to the features $x$ that are input to this layer. (This is just the chain rule applied to $F[z]$ where $z=w_1x+b_1$)
