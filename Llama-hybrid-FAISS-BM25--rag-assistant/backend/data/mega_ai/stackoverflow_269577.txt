Translate multiple languages in php

I am working on a small parser that should accept input in a number of languages. I am going to have maybe 50 strings that will serve as keywords/anchors in parsing the input. In PHP, what would be the best way to organize these translated keywords? One possible solution that comes to my mind is to use an associative array. Like this: $lang = array('us' => array('totalDebt' => 'Total Debt', 'color' => 'Color'), 'gb' => array('totalDebt' => 'Total Debt', 'color' => 'Colour')) which I could then access using the following: $langCode = 'en'; $debtPos = strpos($lang[$langCode]['totalDebt']); Are there any better, proven methods for dealing with a bunch of short strings translated into a bunch of languages?
