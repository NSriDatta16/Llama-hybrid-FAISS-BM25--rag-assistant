YAGNI is a rule of thumb (not a religion). Decoupling is more or less a technique (also not a religion). So they're not really related, nor do they contradict each other. YAGNI is about pragmatism. Assume you don't need something, until you do. Usually assuming YAGNI results in decoupling. If you don't apply that knife at all, you end up assuming that you need to have classes that know all about each other's behavior before you have demonstrated that to be true. "Decouple" (or "loosely couple") is a verb, so it requires work. YAGNI is a presumption, for which you adjust when you find that it's no longer true.
