Do the latter, PCA on training set each time In PCA, we learn the reduced matrix : U which helps us get the projection Z_train = U x X_train At test time, we use the same U learned from the training phase and then compute the projection Z_test = U x X_test So, essentially we are projecting the test set onto the reduced feature space obtained during the training. The underlying assumption, is that the test and train set should come from the same distribution, which explains the method above.
