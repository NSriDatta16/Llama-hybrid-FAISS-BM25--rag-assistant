The solution depends a little bit on how you start the builds. If they are all timer started, You can let them all start at the same time. The risk that you end up with different revisions will be minimal. A more elegant version is to have one job that triggers all your build jobs passing the revision as a parameter. If the build is not too long, you can build one job which than passes the revision on to all the other jobs. EDIT: Currently the following is not supported by Hudson (1.376) I also found a nice svn book . It states that you can replace the revision with a date in curly braces. So you can try @{00:00} in your job configuration.
