Google Static Maps API: representing a route as an encoded polyline

I'm trying to represent a route between a number of points on a static map using an encoded polyline. The code for this is in a function called getStaticMapAddress, defined like so: def getStaticMapAddress(self, route): destUser = DestUser(self.destination) route += [destUser] attempts = 0 while attempts The route is represented as a list of User objects (of which DestUser is a subclass). The self.encodePolyLine() method is defined as follows: def encodePolyLine(self, route): routePairs = [] destUser = DestUser(self.destination) route += [destUser] i=0 while (i This glineenc module is from here and takes in a list of coordinate pairs, returning a pair containing the encoded line string and an encoded string representing the maximum zoom level to be able to see all of the points. So, I have a route going between Brighton, London, Bristol and Manchester which I have passed into this function. The following URL was the output: http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?zoom=B@@@@@?@AA@AA??A@@A@A@?@@@@@@@@B?@@@@@A@@@@@@?B@@AABABA@@@@@@@B&sensor=false&size=400x400&markers=50.8202008,-0.1324898|51.447341,-0.0761212|51.4608947,-2.5884312|53.4778853,-2.2308146|53.4778853,-2.2308146&path=color:0xff0000ff|weight:5|enc:b|XqvduHm@cDcMhAfAfFrc@{BlJgDqHaZkEy[vsKiwp@ciHahd@}nEwoK_KqB_QmoIpAyBw@Mv_BqxDmC`EasCvAeFuuAwi@_Rq|DuVnYgPdXyHvIcBcSgElgBkqBzKgh@`xD_cAzBpBvNM{HsHh]wNfbCzOxpCrUjeD_`Ahi@pItyGdXj`D_PjctLa}BzhH~nFn\dPfe@bObv@dC`i@fS_HrFk@~AmAzDsW_Ak_CmiAkuGy_GvxDctEolnBcpdEhtPc}Srp~AcvsCi_a@clJakR`]kiCr]opDtRcW}JhVcV_EmDaDhFkCc@ If you view this you can see something has gone wrong. I'm not sure exactly what has happened but I noticed that the new route appears to be a projection of the proper route, if reflected using the equator and meridian as lines of symmetry. Not sure why it would have done this, but that's about all I can see as the possible cause of the problem. Any ideas?
