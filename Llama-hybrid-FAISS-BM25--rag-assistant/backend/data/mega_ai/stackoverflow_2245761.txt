Python: Read configuration file with multiple lines per key

I am writing a small DB test suite, which reads configuration files with queries and expected results, e.g.: query = "SELECT * from cities WHERE name='Unknown';" count = 0 level = 1 name = "Check for cities whose name should be null" suggested_fix = "UPDATE cities SET name=NULL WHERE name='Unknown';" This works well; I divide each line using Python's string.partition('=') . My problem is very long SQL queries. Currently, I just paste these queries as a one-liner, which is ugly and unmaintainable. I want to find an elegant, Pythonic way to read the right of an expression, even if spans over many lines. Notes: my SQL queries might contain the = I don't fancy the idea of forcing " s around the right hand side, because there are many existing files without it. EDIT: ConfigParser is great, but it forces me to add a space or tab at the beginning of every line in a multiline entry. This might be a great pain. Thanks in advance, Adam
