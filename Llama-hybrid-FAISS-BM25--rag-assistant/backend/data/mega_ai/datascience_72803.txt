To improve your results you should try other embeddings instead of tf-idf. Some examples are word2vec, FastText, Elmo, Flair or transformer-based embeddings like BERT. In the past I got great results with a single neural network which uses embeddings and numerical features as input features. But, as mentioned before, it depends on your concrete problem.
