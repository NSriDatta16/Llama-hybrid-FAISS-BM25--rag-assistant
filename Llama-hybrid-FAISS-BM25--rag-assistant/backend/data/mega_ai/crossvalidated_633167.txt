Not sure what your book is referring to, but it would seem to me that if you estimated variance at fixed $i$ : $$ Var\left[x_{ij}|i=const\right]=Var\left[z_{ij}|i=const\right]\approx\sigma_z^2,\,\mbox{at some }i $$ So you should be able to estimate the variance of $z$ by stratifying on $i$ (i.e. keeping $i$ fixed). You will get multiple variances in this way, it will then make sense to average them $$ E\left[Var[x_{ij}\:|\:i]\right]\approx\sigma_z^2 $$ Here $E$ stands for the expectated value You can then introduce: $$ v_i=E\left[x_{ij},\: | \:i=const\right]=y_i+\zeta_i,\quad\zeta_i=E\left[z_{ij},\: | \:i=const\right]\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\,\frac{\sigma_z^2}{N_i}\right) $$ Where $N_i$ is the number of $j$ -samples you have for a specific $i$ . Then: $$ Var[v_i]\approx \sigma^2_y+\frac{1}{M-1}\sum_i \frac{\sigma_z^2}{N_i} $$ If $x_i$ and $z_{ij}$ are independent. You can compute the LHS, and you know the variance of $z$ on RHS, so should be able to get the estimate of $y$ . $M$ is the number of different i-values you have
