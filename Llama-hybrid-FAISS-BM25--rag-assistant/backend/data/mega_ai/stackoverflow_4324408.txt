Custom Color in UIAlertView

Hi everyone I was using the below code to give a custom color to the UIAlertView.I was using S.D.K. 3.2.3 and the color was changing to the desired color.But today I updated my S.D.K. now I am using 4.2.1 and also run this code on this S.D.K. it worked.But when I checked again the color of the AlertView didn't change ,but the color which i provided with image,moved to the backward of the alertview.I don't know why this happening. Is there anything wrong that i doesn't work with ios 4.2. Just let me know how to do this in ios 4.2 the code was working good with 3.2.3 sdk. The code is UIAlertView *ForgotPassalert= [[UIAlertView alloc]initWithTitle:@"Status" message:@"An Email has sent to your Account Containing User Name and Password " delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:@"cancel",nil]; CGAffineTransform moveUp = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(0.0, -120.0); [ForgotPassalert setTransform: moveUp]; [ForgotPassalert show]; #pragma mark (AlertView Custom Color) UIImage *theImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Untitled-1.png"]; theImage = [theImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:16 topCapHeight:16]; CGSize theSize = [ForgotPassalert frame].size; UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(theSize); [theImage drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, theSize.width, theSize.height)]; theImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext(); UIGraphicsEndImageContext(); [[ForgotPassalert layer] setContents:(id)theImage.CGImage]; //[[Passalert layer]setBackgroundColor:[[UIColor colorWithRed:179.0f/255.0f green:21.0f/255.0f blue:17.0f/255.0f alpha:1.0f]CGColor]]; [[ForgotPassalert layer]setCornerRadius:7.3F]; [ForgotPassalert release];
