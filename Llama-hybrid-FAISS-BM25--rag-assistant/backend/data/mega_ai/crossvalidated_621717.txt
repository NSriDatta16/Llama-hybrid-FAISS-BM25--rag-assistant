Can SVM and Decision Trees be seen as instances of neural networks?

We already know that neural networks with specific choices of activation function as well as connections can generalize large amount of ML models. My question is: neural network also generalize SVM and Decision Trees? It doesn't seem that NN does this so straight-forwardly. Please share your insights.
