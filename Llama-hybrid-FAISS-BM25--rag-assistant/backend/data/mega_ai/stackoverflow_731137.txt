Whatever font you choose, your declaration should end in ,sans-serif; ,serif; or ,monospace; as those are the only 3 that user agents are guaranteed to render. Arial, verdana, times, and courier have rendered on every commercial browser I have ever used. I know open source browsers on Linux will often not have verdana though. Georgia, tahoma, etc. are a total gamble which I would stay away from or have more common back ups. I am sure you are aware that the browser picks the first font it can render in the list.
