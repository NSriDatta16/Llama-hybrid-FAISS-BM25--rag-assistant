What does the term 'Facet' in Seaborn FacetGrid imply?

I am a newbie to data science. I have a very basic understanding of Seaborn. My understanding is that it is used to plot grids. That said, I intend to have a better understanding of ' FacetGrid ' and the term ' facet '. FacetGrid is a multi-plot grid for plotting conditional relationships. FacetGrid object takes a DataFrame as input and the names of the variables that will form the row, column, or hue dimensions of the grid. The variables should be categorical and the data at each level of the variable will be used for a facet along that axis. The confusion is in the line 'the data at each level of the variable will be used for a facet along that axis'. Here, what does it mean by facet? I am adding a code example where FacetGrid is used(Here FacetGrid is used to plot a 2D scatter plot): sns.set_style('whitegrid') sns.FacetGrid(haberman, hue ='Survival Status', size = 8) \ .map(plt.scatter, 'Age of Patient', 'Positive Axillary Nodes') \ .add_legend() plt.show() Can someone give a better explanation for a better understanding?
