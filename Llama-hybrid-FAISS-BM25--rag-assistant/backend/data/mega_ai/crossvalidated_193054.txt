Time series analysis for predicting a binary outcome

I'm fairly new to time series analysis. I want to analyze two series of variables in a span of time to predict a binary outcome. For example i collect data over time at my home of two variables: VarA the temperature over time VarB the humidity over time Then at 12:00 am i stop collecting this data and i see at 4:00 pm if it rains or not. With a big dataset i want to predict given the time seres data collected till 12:00 am if it will rain at 4:00 pm. How can i accomplish this? I was thinking about a k-nearest neighbors regression type analysis but i'm not sure how can i implement this. EDIT: Here a fictional data set, i don't have already the data because i'm still defining the details. I want to know if studying the two time series (the difference from the start or other parameters) is there a way to predict the outcome of the day
