Should I use an independent sample t-test or a Mann-Whitney test?

I'm doing a logistic regression concerning voluntary choice for an audit( 1 = yes, 0 = no) Now first i want to look at the two groups (the ones who choose for a voluntary audit and the ones who dont) and compare the means and std deviation of both groups. For the categorical variables im going to use Chi square and for the contious variables i have the choice between independant sample t-test and man whitney test. Now i've tested if my variables are normally distributed (needed for independant sample t-test). one variable was log transformated (lntotactief) but it doesn't seem to be normally distibuted according to both tests. although when i look at the histogram it seems to be normally distrubted. Now my questions is can i use the man whitney test for all my continious variables to compare the means and test if they are statistically different between both groups? Or should i just use the independ sample t test for the log transformated variable? Thanks in advance
