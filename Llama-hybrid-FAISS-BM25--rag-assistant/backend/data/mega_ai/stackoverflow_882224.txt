IE 6 has a strange behaviour, it does not recognizes redirects with anchors in it. The workaround is to add additional ampersand symbol '&' before the '#'. So, in your example, the code will look like Response.Redirect(Request.Url.PathAndQuery + "&New=1&#create"); I suggest you to check User-Agent on the server side and add this additional ampersand if the browser is IE 6.
