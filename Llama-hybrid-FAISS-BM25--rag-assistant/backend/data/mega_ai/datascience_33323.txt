Customer-Product Analytics

I am new to Data Science and I want to make Customer Product Analytics for my company(bank). I can have a data of customers, their income, daily transactions, average balance etc and what product(saving certificates etc) they have taken according to their account balance. Can i have a prediction for new customers or existing customers that what product will be suitable for them according to their average balance , income etc? Can the machine learning algorithm predict each product to a particular customer? I got to know cluster analysis and predictive analysis can be useful for such task. But i want to recommend a particular product to a particular customer. Which algorithm can be useful? And from where I have to begin?
