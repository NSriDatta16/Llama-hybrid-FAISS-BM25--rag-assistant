If localization settings are available - including, but not limited to, the HTTP Accept-Language header - then websites absolutely should respect them. The common argument against this is that "average users" aren't smart enough to find the language settings and configure them to match their own preferences, so these settings are, more often than not, incorrect (unless the user happens to be within the US). That is the wrong solution. If a substantial segment of the user population can't find (or can't be bothered to find) their browser's language settings, then the correct response is to make them easier to find , not for sites to ignore what they've been set to. Perhaps make language settings directly accessible from the program's top level menu instead of burying it inside an over-complicated "Preferences" dialog. Perhaps ask for language preferences the first time the program is run. Perhaps use the operating system's localization settings. Or maybe something completely different, if that's what it takes to make it near-certain that the browser will be sending correct information about the user's preferences. But don't just throw up your hands, say "it's useless and can't be fixed!", and ignore it. Other answers have talked about letting the user choose a language or locale in their profile on the site, which is also important and absolutely should be standard, but that's just to provide a site-specific override to the user's normal settings. If the user has not overriden this on the site, though, the correct action is to default to the most-preferred available language/locale as specified in their browser settings, not to base it on geolocation of their IP address.
