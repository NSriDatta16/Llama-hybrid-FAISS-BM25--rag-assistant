It's the same reason you have to explicitly link to libpthread on most implementations. When something new and scary is added to the standard library, it usually first gets implemented as a separate add-on library that overrides some of the symbols in the old standard library implementation with versions that conform to the new requirements, while also adding lots of new interfaces. I wouldn't be surprised if some historical implementations had separate versions of printf in libm for floating point printing, with a "light" version in the main libc lacking floating point. This kind of implementation is actually mentioned and encouraged for tiny systems in the ISO C rationale document, if I remember correctly. Of course in the long-term, separating the standard library out like this leads to a lot more problems than benefits. The worst part is probably the increased load time and memory usage for dynamic-linked programs.
