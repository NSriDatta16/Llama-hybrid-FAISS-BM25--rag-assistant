Intraclass correlation coefficient in Bayesian statistics

I need some references about intraclass correlation coefficient in Bayesian statistics and hypothesis testing. I already take a look in A. Gelman, J.B. Carlin, H.S. Stern and D.B. Rubin, Bayesian Data Analysis. London: Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2003 but it has very little information there.
