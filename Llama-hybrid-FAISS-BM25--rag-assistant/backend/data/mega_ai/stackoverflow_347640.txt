I had this issue and tried both, but had to settle for removing crap like "pageEditState", but not removing user info lest I have to look it up again. public static void RemoveEverythingButUserInfo() { foreach (String o in HttpContext.Current.Session.Keys) { if (o != "UserInfoIDontWantToAskForAgain") keys.Add(o); } }
