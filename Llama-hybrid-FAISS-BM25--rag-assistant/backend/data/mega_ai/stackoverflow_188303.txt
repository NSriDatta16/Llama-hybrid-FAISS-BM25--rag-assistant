Analysis Service - Proactive caching failing

For a while the proactive caching process successfully sync the OLAP databse and then is starts giving the following error 'Errors in the OLAP storage engine: The attribute key cannot be found:' followed by spesific data related information. I do not however have a problem if I manually process the databse with the 'Transactional Deployement' option set to True. I have set the data source isolation mode to snapshot and MARS connection setting to True on the connection string plus on the database side we have set the database property ALLOW SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION to ON and verified it. Can anyone help or give some suggestions
