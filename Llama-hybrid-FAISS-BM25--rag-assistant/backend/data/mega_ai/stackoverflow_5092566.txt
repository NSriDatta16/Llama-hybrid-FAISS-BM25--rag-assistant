You can get a chunk's width using GetWidthPoint() and the height of a chunk is generally the font's size unless you're using only lowercase letters. If so then you can manually measure characters using BaseFont.GetCharBBox() . Paragraphs are flowable items, however, and they depend on the context that they are written into so measuring them is harder. (Chunks don't automatically wrap but Paragraphs do.) The best way to measure a paragraph is to write it to a PdfCell and then measure the PdfCell . You don't have to actually add the PdfCell to the document. The link below explains it a little more. http://itext-general.2136553.n4.nabble.com/Linecount-td2146114.html
