I did an compare of the two pdf files (you'll have to read the current one to understand what these mean): changes: 0 - throughout: remove references to specific products and replace with "iPhone OS" 1 - throughout: references to include the federal government added to "your company, organization..." type phrases. 2 - clauses 3.1.17 and 3.1.18 are new to "Content and Materials" section 3 - clause 3.3.24 is new 4 - clause 15.11 - changes for disputes between apple & education institutions 5 - Exhibit A, clause 9 was added. hope that helps. (caveat: I'm no lawyer, so who knows what changed from a legal standpoint).
