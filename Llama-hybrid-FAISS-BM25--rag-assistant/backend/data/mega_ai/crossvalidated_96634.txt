Comparing two distributions in Fourier space

There exist a number of tools that provide a distance between two continuous probability distributions. Most (semi)distances, like the Kullback-Leibler divergence, use probability density functions. However, the literature is quite sparse when it comes to comparing two distributions in Fourier space, i.e. via their characteristic function. Is there an elegant way to do so?
