This can be done using a more general CLT such as the Lindeberg-Feller or Lyapunov CLT, which don't assume the same distribution (just independence and a tail condition). In particular, the Lindeberg-Feller CLT gives necessary conditions for an average of independent observations to be asymptotically Normal. It can also be done directly using the classical CLT: we know that $$\sqrt{n_1}(\bar Z_{1n_1}-\mu_1)\stackrel{d}{\to} N(0,\sigma^2_1)$$ where $\mu_1$ and $\sigma^2_1$ are the mean and variance of $Z_1$ and $\bar Z_{1n_1}$ is the average. In the same way $$\sqrt{n_2}(\bar Z_{2n_2}-\mu_2)\stackrel{d}{\to} N(0,\sigma^2_2).$$ We can write the overall average $\bar Z_n$ as $$\bar Z_n = \frac{n_1}{n}\bar Z_{1n_1}+\frac{n_2}{n}\bar Z_{2n_2}$$ Now we can either make assumptions about $n_1/n$ having a limit or, more generally, work along subsequences where it has a limit (any subsequence has a subsubsequence where there's a limit) Along subsequences where $n_1/n\to p_1\in(0,1)$ , we can define $\mu_n=p\mu_1+(1-p)\mu_2$ and $\sigma^2=p^2\sigma^2_1+(1-p)^2\sigma^2_2$ $$\sqrt{n}(\bar Z_n-\mu_n)\stackrel{d}{\to} N(0,\sigma^2).$$ Along subsequences where $n_1/n\to 1$ , there asymptotically isn't any $Z_2$ contribution, so $$\sqrt{n}(\bar Z-\mu_1)\stackrel{d}{\to} N(0,\sigma^2_1)$$ and the other way around when $n_2/n\to 1$
