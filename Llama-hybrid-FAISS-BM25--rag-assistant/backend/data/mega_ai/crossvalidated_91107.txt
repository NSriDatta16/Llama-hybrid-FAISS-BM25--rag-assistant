Is there any functional difference between an odds ratio and hazard ratio?

In logistic regression, an odds ratio of 2 means that the event is 2 time more probable given a one-unit increase in the predictor. In Cox regression, a hazard ratio of 2 means the event will occur twice as often at each time point given a one-unit increase in the predictor. Are these not practically the same thing? What then is the advantage in doing a Cox regression and getting hazard ratios if we can get functionally the same information from the odds ratios of logistic regression?
