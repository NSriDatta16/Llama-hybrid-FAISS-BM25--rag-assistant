You can easily quantify uncertainty for time series models using conformal prediction https://github.com/valeman/awesome-conformal-prediction Here is an article about doing it with classical models https://medium.com/@valeman/conformal-prediction-forecasting-with-nixtlas-statsforecast-cc39b9e30b36 But you can also do it easily using Nixtla's ecosystem for machine and deep learning models https://github.com/Nixtla/
