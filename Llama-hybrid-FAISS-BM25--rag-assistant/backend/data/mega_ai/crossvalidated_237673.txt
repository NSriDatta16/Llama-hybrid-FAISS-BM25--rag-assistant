Can an SVM be trained on multivalued features?

I cant wrap my head around a fact that how can I use multivalued features to train a classifier let's say SVM. For an example, lets say I have four features to look at, each of those features have 4 values under them. Can I use these numbers to train a classifier or I have to have only one values per features?
