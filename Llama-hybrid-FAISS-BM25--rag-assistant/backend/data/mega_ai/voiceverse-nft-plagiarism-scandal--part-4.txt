sed 15.ai's work without permission. According to Eurogamer, reactions to Baker's initial partnership announcement were universally negative. Critics raised multiple concerns, including the potential environmental impact of NFT sales due to blockchain energy consumption, fears that AI-driven voice technology would automate and eliminate the need for actual human voice actors and jeopardize voice acting jobs, warnings that the technology could devalue voice actors' work and undercut prospective actors, and concerns about scams and art theft associated with NFTs. At the same time, fans also accused Baker of abandoning a 2017 music crowdfunding project and never providing refunds to those who donated. The plagiarism revelation immediately exacerbated the already-negative reception. Less than an hour after 15's accusation, YouTubers SkillUp and Yong Yea both reported that by plagiarizing 15.ai's work, Voiceverse had committed theft and fraud. Aftermath On January 15, the day after the plagiarism revelation, Baker appeared on episode 90 of the Play, Watch, Listen podcast, which he co-hosts with Alanah Pearce, Mike Bithell, and Austin Wintory. In the episode, "Talking to Troy Baker About His NFT Tweet," Baker stated that his primary motivation for the partnership was to help independent creators access resources they otherwise could not afford. He said: "while I understood that an NFT was a component to this, that's not what I got involved with." Baker said he envisioned a scenario where "if some independent game maker wants to have me in their game and they can't afford me and they can do that now, great." Responding to concerns that the technology could put voice actors out of work, Baker said: "if the only reason why I don't do something to help somebody out is because it may hurt me, that's a fucked up reason to not do the right thing." He acknowledged that his announcement had been "just a fucking bad look" and apologized again; he also said that he had told Voiceverse he did not know what would happen with the partnership moving forward. On January 31, over two weeks after his initial announcement, Baker announced that he would no longer partner with Voiceverse and thanked fans for their "feedback and patience". He reiterated his apology from earlier in the month: "Intentions aside, I've heard you and apologize for accusing anyone of 'hating' just by simply disagreeing with me." Voiceverse stated that the decision was reached as a "mutual agreement" between the two parties and stated that they would "double-down our resources and efforts to execute on our roadmap, further our vision as the voice of Web3.0, and strengthen our community as well as the broader NFT ecosystem." On September 25, 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed against LOVO, Inc., the parent company of Voiceverse, alleging that LOVO had illegally copied the voices of voice actors and used them without permission. Court documents cited LOVO/Voiceverse's prior plagiarism of 15.ai as part of the case. In April 2021, LOVO wrote that "[15.ai] are LOVO's competition because we do all of that as well, but none of us are real threats to each other, yet." Legacy The incident was documented by various organizations indexing ethics violations in artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Both the AI Incident Database (AIID) and the AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies (AIAAIC) classified the incident as theft. Later, the AIAAIC also formally classified the incident as a case of plagiarism. The MIT AI Risk Repository catalogued the incident as an example of "economic and cultural devaluation of human effort". In a retrospective of the incident in her Web3 Is Going Just Great website, writer and crypto skeptic Molly White wrote that "things were further soured when it was revealed that Voiceverse had stolen work without crediting it from [...] 15.ai." White categorized the incident as theft, a "bad idea", and "shady business". In an article about vi
