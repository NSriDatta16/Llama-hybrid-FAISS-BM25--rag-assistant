iText - add content to existing PDF file

I want to do the following with iText: (1) parse an existing PDF file (2) add some data to it, on the existing single page of the document (such as a timestamp) (3) write out the document I just can't seem to figure out how to do this with iText. In pseudo code I would do this: Document document = reader.read(input); document.add(new Paragraph("my timestamp")); writer.write(document, output); But for some reason iText's API is so dauntingly complicated that I can't wrap my head around it. The PdfReader actually holds the document model or something (rather than spitting out a document), and you need a PdfWriter to read pages from it... eh?
