You don't need to use 4 spaces on your second conditional line. Maybe use: if (cond1 == 'val1' and cond2 == 'val2' and cond3 == 'val3' and cond4 == 'val4'): do_something Also, don't forget the whitespace is more flexible than you might think: if ( cond1 == 'val1' and cond2 == 'val2' and cond3 == 'val3' and cond4 == 'val4' ): do_something if (cond1 == 'val1' and cond2 == 'val2' and cond3 == 'val3' and cond4 == 'val4'): do_something Both of those are fairly ugly though. Maybe lose the brackets (the Style Guide discourages this though)? if cond1 == 'val1' and cond2 == 'val2' and \ cond3 == 'val3' and cond4 == 'val4': do_something This at least gives you some differentiation. Or even: if cond1 == 'val1' and cond2 == 'val2' and \ cond3 == 'val3' and \ cond4 == 'val4': do_something I think I prefer: if cond1 == 'val1' and \ cond2 == 'val2' and \ cond3 == 'val3' and \ cond4 == 'val4': do_something Here's the Style Guide , which (since 2010) recommends using brackets.
