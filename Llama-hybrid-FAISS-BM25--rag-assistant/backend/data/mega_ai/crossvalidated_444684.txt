What do the subscripts of the expectations mean here? They are the distribution you are taking the expectation with respect to. They are the "weights" you're using to calculate the weighted average. I can't really see how... This $$ \mathbb{E}_{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z})}\left[f\left(\mathbf{z}^{(i)}\right)\right]= \mathbb{E}_{p(\epsilon)}\left[f\left(g_{\theta}\left(\epsilon, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}\right)\right)\right] $$ is called the law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS) . Notice in the second line how you're applying $g_{\theta}$ to epsilons. You can either take the expectation with respect to either density. You will get the same expected value.
