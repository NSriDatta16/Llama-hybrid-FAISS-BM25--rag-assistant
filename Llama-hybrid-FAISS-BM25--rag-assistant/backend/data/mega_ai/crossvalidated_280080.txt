Correlation is not the same as linear combination with largest variance , which is what PCA finds. Also the eigenvectors have no particular direction. You can multiply them with $-1$ and those vectors will also be eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue (variance) and then you would get positive $+0.677\cdots$ for third component. If you want correlation maybe you could check out Canonical Correlation Analysis ( CCA ) instead.
