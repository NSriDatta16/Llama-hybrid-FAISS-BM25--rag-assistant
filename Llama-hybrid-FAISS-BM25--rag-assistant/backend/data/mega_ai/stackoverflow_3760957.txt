You could just create k list. When you receive a value, pick a random integer x between 0 and k-1, and put that value into the x-th list. On average each list will contain N/k elements, but with a standard deviation of âˆš(N * 1/k * (1-1/k)). def random_partition(k, iterable): results = [[] for i in range(k)] for value in iterable: x = random.randrange(k) results[x].append(value) return results
