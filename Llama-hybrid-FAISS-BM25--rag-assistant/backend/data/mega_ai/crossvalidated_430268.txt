Interpreting Logistic Regression Categorical Coefficients

So I have this question: If we fit a logistic regression with categorical predictor X with categories A, B and C, and have the estimated coefficients β0=−2.5 and βB=0.5 and βA=−0.2. (a) Interprete eˆβB,eˆβA and eˆβ0. (b) Which categorical would cause, on average, the smallest odds of success? This was my interpretation: a. eβˆB is the marginal effect on the odds ratio of being in category B rather than in category C. e^βA is the marginal effect on the odds ratio of being in category A rather than in category C. e^β0 is the marginal effect on the odds ratio of being in category C rather than in categories A and B. b. Category C would on average cause the smallest chance of success. This is because it has the smallest marginal effect at e^−2.5 = 0.082, which means it has the smallest effect on the odds-ratio compared to categories A and B. The marginal effect of A and B on the odds-ratio are 0.8187 and 1.649 respectively. Is this correct or am I completely off? Thank you for your time.
