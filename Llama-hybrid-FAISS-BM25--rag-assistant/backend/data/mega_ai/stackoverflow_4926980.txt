You might want to try just -c 50 instead of -c 50%. I am not sure why it does not pick Airtemp because it should have the highest information gain. I am also going to guess you are using the Machine Learning book by Tom Mitchell. His book should have some examples, try those and see how they compare. Edit : Have you run the examples on the site you linked too and if so have they matched up?
