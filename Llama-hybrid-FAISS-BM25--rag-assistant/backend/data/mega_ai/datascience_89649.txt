I think your background could be highly interesting for certain paths in data science. If you are only interested in the engineering parts of it, @Alex answer is right for you, but you will compete against people with a lot more applied computer science/engineering background and experience in data science than you have now. However, if you also like the mathematical parts behind the methods, you could consider applying for niche topics where your background will be highly sought after. One such area would be topological data analysis (TDA) which builds upon algebraic geometry and most people (including me) lack the mathematical sophistication to really delve into the subject. Last year, I was doing a research internship at a very recognized ML research group and during my time, the professor hired a new PhD student which came from a pure math background with a focus on algebraic geometry and who dropped out of a pure math phd. He started to work with him on a TDA project. However, I think you would have the best chances following this route through searching respective PhD positions, where genuine interest and motivation about the topic and its mathematical foundations (and not only the tech part) combined with your background should be enough to land you such a job. After having a PhD in ML, in which you will probably get a lot of exposure to other topics than topological data analysis alone (and you maybe even change your initial PhD topic), you will have no problems being invited to interviews for interesting data science positions. I also want to add that there are some companies and applied research institutes which apply TDA and maybe would be open for someone like you. However, one would need to find them and convince them that you are their man even though you have no real experiences, both of those things are not easy.
