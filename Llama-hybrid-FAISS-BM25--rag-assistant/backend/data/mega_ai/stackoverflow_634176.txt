I take it you want to be able to resume from where the snapshot was stored, as if nothing thereafter had happened. I wonder how many framework components and libraries such functionality would break. Suddenly, you are reviving a JVM state from storage; in the meantime, the clock has mysteriously skipped forward by 23 hours, network connections are no longer valid, GUI objects no longer have any underlying O/S handles... I'd say this is nontrivial, and impossible in the general case without modifying the framework extensively.
