First: (1) I assume that by standardize, you are wanting to know how many standard deviations a particular observation is from the mean; and (2) I assume that by normalization, you are meaning a transformation to express your data series on a scale of between 0 and 1 - from the minimum to the maximum observation. For (1): If you standardize, then this tells you how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean. If the series is non-stationary, the mean could be changing, and if the mean is changing, the variance (and standard deviation) are likely changing too. So, you would not be able to standardize without considering these effects. For (2): I do not see how normalizing would help in this context. There are many ways to analyze time series data, but you need to provide some further information about both the data set you want to analyze, and what you want to determine from the analysis in order to get more help here.
