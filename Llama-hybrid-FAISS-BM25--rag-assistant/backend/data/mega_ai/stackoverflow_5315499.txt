Sounds that are played using the AVAudioPlayer are streamed real time from storage. The drawback being that you can occasionally notice a small lag when it is due to start up. If you use OpenAL the sounds are loaded entirely into memory. There's a good discussion of this sort of thing in the ObjectAL documentation - a library that is meant to simplify the playing of sounds and effects on the iPhone.
