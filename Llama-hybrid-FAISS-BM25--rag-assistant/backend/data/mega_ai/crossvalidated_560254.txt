I spent the last 14 years trying to get better at statistics including earning an applied master's in it (which in honesty was disappointing). I think the answer is that there is no simple way to do this. This is made worse by the fact that much of the academic literature that uses statistics is not done by true statisticians IMHO (which of course is true of me) and they do things (lots of things) that violate various rules because they are not true experts. Simple examples include applying a method wrong, ignoring threats to external validity, using stepwise regression, failing to address omitted variable bias, dropping variables from the model because they are not statistically significant and rerunning the model with the same data and on and on. One frightening article years ago looking at articles in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet found a wide range of statistical errors in articles applying logistic regression, and they are of course elite journals. And this ignores the fact that statisticians often disagree themselves. So if you are going to learn statistics, its a lot of work. You might look at the UCLA (Idre) site or for time series the Duke University site as a starter.
