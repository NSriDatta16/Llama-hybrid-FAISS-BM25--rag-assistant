WebOS Resets LocalStorage On Browser Close?

I have an HTML5 webapp wherein I use localStorage to retain some client-side user settings between uses. I thought I had it all working well, but I recently find that in the WebOS browser the localStorage items are cleared after the browser is completely closed (all cards--not just my page). It is acting like it is saved to session storage, but that is not the case. Here is a minimal example that illustrates my problem: test $(function() { $('#btnV').click(function() { var x = ''; for(var i = 0; i '; } $('#lbl').empty().append(x); }); $('#btnS').click(function() { localStorage.setItem('test', 'blah'); }); }); When I first load the page and click the "View" button, nothing is shown. If I click "Save" and then "View" I will see the item as saved. Refreshing the page and clicking View immediately shows the value is retained across page-reload. However, if I completely close out the browser and then go back in to the page, "View" will show no values as it did the very first time. Am I setting localStorage items incorrectly, or is my WebOS browser configured somehow to do this? I couldn't find anything relevant in the settings. Thanks...
