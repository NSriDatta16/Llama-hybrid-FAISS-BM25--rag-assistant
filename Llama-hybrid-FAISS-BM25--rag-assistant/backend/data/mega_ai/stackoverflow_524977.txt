There are no industry standard definitions for Architect job titles -- Application/System/Software/Solution Architect all refer in general to a senior developer with strong design and leadership skills. The balance of design, strategy, development (often of core services or frameworks) and management differ based on the organization and project. The only "Architect" job title that really has a different meaning for me is "Enterprise Architect", which I see as more of a IT strategy position.
