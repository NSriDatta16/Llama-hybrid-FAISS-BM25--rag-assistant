Deciding the value of period in seasonal ARIMA (R)

I'm new to time series modeling and am trying to do seasonal ARIMA modeling here. I have figured out the p,d,q values but im not sure how to select the period in the below formula. There seem to be troughs in the data during summer months and winter holidays, what does it suggest the value of period should be, what is the concept. arima(time_series,c(2,1,4),seasonal=list(order=c(2,1,4),period= )) My data looks like this EDIT : I have 365 data points for a year
