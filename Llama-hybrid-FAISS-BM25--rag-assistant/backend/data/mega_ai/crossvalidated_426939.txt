Shouldn't we sample from the output of variational auto-encoder?

I know that the output of the VAE is the parameters of the data. For example: If the data follows normal distribution $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$ , the generative network should output $\mu$ and $\sigma$ If the data follows Bernoulli distribution $X \sim Bern(p)$ , the network should output $p$ (the parameters of Bernoulli distribution) And we should sample from that output to calculate the reconstruction loss. All the example codes(that I saw) of VAE on the internet don't sample from the output of the decoder to calculate the reconstruction loss even if the output is normal distribution(they don't output $\sigma$ ). They calculate the loss as if it's ordinary NN. Is my understanding of VAE correct? or Is the practical implementation of VAE different from the theory?
