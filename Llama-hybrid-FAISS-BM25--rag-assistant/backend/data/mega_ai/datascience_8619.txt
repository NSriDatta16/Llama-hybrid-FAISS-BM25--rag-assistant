In order to show a correlation between X and Y they should be aggregated over the same time period. Otherwise, there there may be seasonality or other features in Y that may have been averaged out in X. Is it possible re-index X to get monthly aggregates? I would not sub-sample Y. Find a common time period for both X and Y to make your comparisons.
