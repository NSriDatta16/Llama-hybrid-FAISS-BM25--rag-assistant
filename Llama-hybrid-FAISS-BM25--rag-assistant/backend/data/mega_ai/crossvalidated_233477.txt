Can I take the average of two standardized variables

I am wondering if there are any theoretical problems with taking the average of two standardized variables. Suppose I want to combine two variables to have a single measure. I could create an index by using weighted averages or PCA. I was wondering if there are any theoretical impediments against standardizing each variable and then taking the arithmetic average.
