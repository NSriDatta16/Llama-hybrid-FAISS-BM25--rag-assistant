How would you use TDD with a neural network or a GUI application?

I'm new to Test Driven Development and trying to understand the basics. For simple methods it seems straightforward, but suppose I'm working on taking some points of a .txt file and drawing them on an image. Is there a way to test that this is doing what I want without having to actually check it? Or, suppose I have to test something that isn't deterministic like a neural network, which can sometimes get 55% accuracy or 82% in other occasions. How can I test those? I realize I can test the simpler methods, but still, there's always the chance of things breaking elsewhere.
