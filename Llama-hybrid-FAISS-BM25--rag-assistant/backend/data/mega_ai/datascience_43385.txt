What does it mean when someone says "Most of the data science algorithms are optimization problems"

I was trying to understand the Gradient Descent algorithm from this article and the author says Most of the data science algorithms are optimization problems I come from software engineering background trying to get a basic understanding of data science. Can someone help me explain what this means?
