I would imagine a greedy approach for an undirected graph as follows: let Q = all nodes which haven't been checked (initialize all V) let Q* = all nodes which satisfy the required condition (initialize to empty) start with an arbitrary node, v in Q while Q is not empty let minDeg be the minimum degree of all v's neighbors if degree(v) This algorithm may be slightly more efficient because at each iteration, it either finds a satisfying node, or checks a new node of lesser degree and removes a node from the graph. At worst case, it will be equivalent to your brute-force algorithm. On average, though, I think it should perform better.
