I think you never really know the true optimal solution, only that with respect to your training data. The metrics given are then actually relatively easy to calculate: Keep a cache of the loss (for an SVM, $\max(1-y_i _\mathcal{H},0)$ for all $i$) on your training data and average this loss, this gives you an estimate of the current $\epsilon$-accuracy. Have you read "An introduction to support vector machines and other kenrel-based learning methods" by Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor? It contains a lot of interesting information with respect to optimization and tricks like monitoring the duality gap. Should you still want to calculate this explicitly, it suffices to monitor the difference between the primal and the Lagrangian (both of which are easy to calculate on the training data as in point $1$).
