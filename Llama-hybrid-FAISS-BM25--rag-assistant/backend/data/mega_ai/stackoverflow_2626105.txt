MySQL: Is it possible to compute MAX( AVG (field) )?

My current query reads: SELECT entry_id, user_id, cat_id, AVG( rating ) as avg_rate FROM `entry_rate` WHERE 1 GROUP BY entry_id cat_id relates to different categories: 1, 2, 3 or 4 Is there a way I can find the maximum average for each user in each category without setting up an additional table? The return could potentially be 4 maximum avg_rate for each user_id Visit the link below for example: http://lh5.ggpht.com/_rvDQuhTddnc/S8Os_77qR9I/AAAAAAAAA2M/IPmzNeYjfCA/s800/table1.jpg
