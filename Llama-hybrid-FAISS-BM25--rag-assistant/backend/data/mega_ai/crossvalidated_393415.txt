Terminology: "Central Limit Theorem" for Delta Method

This is a question about when is it appropriate to call an asymptotic normality statement, the "Central Limit Theorem" (CLT). More specifically, suppose I have $X_1, X_2, \dots X_n$ iid from a distribution with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$ . Let $\bar{X}$ be the sample mean. By the CLT, $$ \sqrt{n}(\bar{X} - \mu) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \sigma^2)\,. $$ The above equation is a consequence of the CLT, but is also often referred to as a CLT. That is, the asymptotic normality itself is referred to as the CLT. This I understand to be colloquial norm, and I am ok with. But now, suppose for a differentiable function $g$ , I use the Delta Method to obtain an asymptotic statement about $g(\bar{X})$ . That is, for some $\lambda^2$ , $$ \sqrt{n}(g(\bar{X}) - g(\mu)) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \lambda^2)\,. $$ The above is also often referred to as a CLT. The theorem however only applies to a sample average. So the asymptotic normality of $g(\bar{X})$ should not be referred to as a CLT. If the above is referred to as a CLT, then I would imagine asymptotic normality of MLEs should can be referred to as a CLT(!). I am wondering if the community has any strong (or weak) opinions about this? Edit: Another example is the asymptotic normality of the median, which is also often referred to as the CLT for a median (or any quantile).
