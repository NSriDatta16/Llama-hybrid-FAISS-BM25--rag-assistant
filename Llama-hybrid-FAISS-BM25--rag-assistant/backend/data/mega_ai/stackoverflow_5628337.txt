load network-based images asynchronously in Java

I have to be able to load and draw X amount of images located on a network based drive. I need help finding a way to load the images asynchronously. java.net.URL Loc = new URL("http://auroragm.sourceforge.net/GameCover/GameCases/Mass-Effect.png"); JLabel lbl = new JLabel(); lbl.setIcon((anotherIcon = new ImageIcon(Loc))); The above is one image which loads on the GUI thread and thus would freeze if 20 more were to be loaded. Any help would be appreciated
