Is it feasible to integrate convolutionnal layers as Reinforcement Learning input to learn video game?

Let's say, you want to apply reinforcement learning on a simple 2D game. (ex : super mario) The easy way is of course to retrieve an abstraction of the environnment, per example using gym and/or an open-source implementation of the game. But if it's not available, I think about integrating convolutionnal layers over pixels as inputs of the RL agent. We could of course split the task in two : featurization of the images and then reinforcement learning, we probably would need some supervision over the images (which can be problematic since we have no abstraction of the environment). Is it a feasible approach to combine learning a featurization of the image data and learning a game policy at the same time ?
