gensim's Phrases module may also be helpful: from gensim.models import Phrases documents = [ "the mayor of new york was there", "machine learning can be useful sometimes", "new york mayor was present" ] sentence_stream = [doc.split(" ") for doc in documents] bigram = Phrases(sentence_stream, min_count=1, threshold=2) sent = [u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new', u'york', u'was', u'there'] print(bigram[sent]) # Expected output: # [u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new_york', u'was', u'there'] That code is from this other answer (I've copy-pasted it above for convenience).
