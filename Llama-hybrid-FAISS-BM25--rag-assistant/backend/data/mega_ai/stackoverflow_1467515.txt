NCover does not have an "api" per say to obtain the data. What version of NCover are you attempting to read the data from? 1.5.8, 2, 3? Are you attempting to build a data warehouse of coverage data? How are you collecting you TFS coverage data? Did you write a parser to read the data? Thank you, Joe Feser NCover
