M- and other robust estimators are not linear in the observations. Note that this is a different issue from fitting a linear model; it concerns how the estimator is computed! In fact being linear in the observations means that outliers cannot be down-weighted, which is what robust estimators aim to do. In fact they do have (sometimes dramatically) lower variance under heavy tailed error distributions and outlier-generating models (you can simulate this if you want to convince yourself), however they are not better under all non-normal distributions. OLS can be better under distributions with lighter tails than the normal. Note by the way that if you want to be robust against leverage points, you need to do something more sophisticated than a standard M-estimator, for example an MM- or tau-estimator (see robustbase package in R).
