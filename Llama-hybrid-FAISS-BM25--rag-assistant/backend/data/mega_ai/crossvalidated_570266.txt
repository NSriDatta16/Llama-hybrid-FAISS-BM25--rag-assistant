A post-hoc test for linear regressions with interaction?

I've been looking for an answer for a question (which I thought was rather trivial) for a while now, but can't seem to get the correct solution for it. I'm working on data of blood parameters (e.g. hematocrit, HCT ; a continuous variable) from fish reared under different temperature treatments ( treatment ; a factor). These measurements were made at several time points throughout the trial, however are independent from each other, as we did not sample the same fish twice. During this time the fish put on body mass, which we measured too ( weight , a continuous variable). I'd like to know whether there is a significant effect of treatment on HCT after controlling for weight . I'm not really interested in the effect weight has on HCT and treatment , I just want to adjust for it. The problem I have is that treatment and weight are not independent from each other, as fish grew differently within each treatment , so I can't go down the ANCOVA route. From my understanding I can simply fit a linear regression in form HCT~treatment*weight , but this would allow me to only compare each treatment to the treatment set as baseline. My question is: Is there a more elegant way to statistically compare the intercepts of all treatment groups with each other including adjustments for multiple comparisons (essentially a post-hoc test for lm's with interaction), instead of running the same model with different base line treatments ? Thanks, Hanna
