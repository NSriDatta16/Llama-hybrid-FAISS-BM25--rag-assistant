Does machine learning offer alternatives to linear regression (i.e., OLS) for predicting continuous variables?

I understand that defining the scope of what falls precisely under the scope 'machine learning' is impossible. Yet, are there are insights from the machine learning literature that moves away from linear regression using OLS when the goal is predicting a continuous variable? It seems that machine learning offers a lot more options (relative to models typically described in econometrics literature) when it comes to predicting categorical or binary outcomes, than continuous variables.
