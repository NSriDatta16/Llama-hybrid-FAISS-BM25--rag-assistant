Replacing empty paragraph using preg_replace, whitespace not recognized

I need to change this: Into this: on a string. Seems simple, but the following don't work: $filecontent = preg_replace('/ /', ' ', $filecontent); $filecontent = preg_replace('/^ /', ' ', $filecontent); $filecontent = preg_replace('/ \s /', ' ', $filecontent); $filecontent = preg_replace('/ \s+ /', ' ', $filecontent); $filecontent = str_replace(' ', ' ', $filecontent); To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I did a replace on xxx to turn it into yyy which worked just fine. I think the problem is my space isn't a normal space as the content is probably that windows character set iso-8859-1 or whatever it is (or it's got confused because we've converted that to utf-8 somewhere along the line..) Copying and pasting the empty paragraph from chome/firefox didn't work either. I'm a bit stuck :( Thanks for helping! Update: Here's the base64_output, AwMD is a string of 0s which I used to mark the beginning of a string of p's as above. AwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDA8L3A+DQo8cD7CoDwvcD4NCjxwPsKgPC9wPg0KPHA+wqA8L3A+DQo8cD7CoDwvcD4NCjxwPsKgPC9wPg0KPHA+wqA8L3A+DQo8cD7CoDwvcD4NCjxwPsKgPC9wPg0KPHA+wqA8L3A+DQo8cD7CoDwvcD4NCjxwPsKgPC9wPg0KPHA+wqA8L3A+DQo8cD7CoDwvcD4NCjxwPsKgPC9wPg0KPHA+YmFzZTY0ZW5jb2Rpbmc8L3A+PC9w * update2: I've found the charater ord values in php are: 194 followed by 160 - eg it's two characters. WEIRD. *
