By convention, you should not define your class in his package. The author is reasonable to make that assumption, and he should be the only one who accesses these package variables. If you choose to break that convention, you are allowed to, and you should know what you are doing. You know what else you can do to mess around with the design, since you have the source? Everything ! The access level is an honor system after all. It is there to help you, but it's not your dictator. JDK classes use package level variables extensively. And it's my favorite too. public and protected have important roles for public APIs, private when you are really paranoid and you don't even trust yourself. For everything else - default/package level, which allows an author to freely access, but difficult for users to access. "How can an author be so arrogant and think that he doesn't have to mark his private variables as private? He is doing his job wrong!" - well, who are you and how is that your business? Obviously Java creators thought that is should be the most frequently used leve, therefore we should save some key taps, and don't impose a keyword on it.
