The short answer is that ARIMA models rely on the assumption that the time series being modeled is stationary. Therefore that assumption needs to hold if you want to use these models. When we fit an AR(1), we obtain a value for the parameter $\phi_1$ . If the value of this is approximately equal to 1 or even close enough to 1, the series is not stationary. This is called the Dickey-Fuller test. You can find some information on that here . In the example here I believe they use a $\rho$ where I used $\phi_1$ . Here is a great post on why time series needs to be stationary If the coefficient has a value larger than 1, the auto regressive process is said to be explosive
