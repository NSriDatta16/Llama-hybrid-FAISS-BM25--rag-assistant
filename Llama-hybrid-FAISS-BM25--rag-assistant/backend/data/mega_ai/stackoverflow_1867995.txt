Mechanize with weird https form RoR

I'm using RoR trying to search a simple form at my college using mechanize . The code works fine for searching google, but returns the search form in the results? I'm really confused. Any advice? Thanks! ruby script/console require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new agent.get("https://www.owens.edu/cgi-bin/class.pl/") agent.page.forms form = agent.page.forms.last form.occ_subject = "chm" form.submit
