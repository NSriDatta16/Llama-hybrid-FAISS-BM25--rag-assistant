What does the SSDL say the property is? Open the EDMX file up using an XML Editor (the one in VS is pretty good) Now look in the StorageModels element for the column in question. The 'type' of the Property in the in the SSDL section is the type the EntityFramework thinks the database column is. I suspect it will say DateTime2. You should be able to change it back to something like DateTime. Hope this helps Alex
