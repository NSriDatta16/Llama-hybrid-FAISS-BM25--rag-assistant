Determining the numerical value of the parameters of a Moving Average process

Is it possible to determine the numerical value of the parameters of a moving average process just by looking at the correlogram (Autocorrelation function and Partial Autocorrelation function) of the model? Suppose we have a simple $MA(1)$ process: \begin{equation} y_{t} = \epsilon_{t}+\alpha\epsilon_{t-1} \end{equation} with $\epsilon_{t} \sim WN(0, \sigma^{2}_{\epsilon})$ . Just by looking at the Autocorrelation function and Partial Autocorrelation function of the process without estimating a proper regression, can we derive the value of $\alpha$ ?
