Sounds like an issue with MIME type. Here's a post describing the problem and a solution : http://agilerails.wordpress.com/2009/05/27/ie-throws-file-download-security-warning-on-form-submit/ . Basicaly, the problem is with IE's request headers. You'll have to use a MIME Type of text/html to make it work. More info about it in this SO question . You have a few options : Detect IE by user-agent and send text/html as described here Add format.html above format.js in the request response priority list Edit: no quite sure this is what you want for all requests, since you're also doing AJAX, but at that last step, when you make the redirection, you should be serving a text/html MIME Type.
