Do the principal components change if we apply PCA more than once (recursively) on data?

Consider a set $X=(X_1; \dots; X_n)$ of $n$ data points such that $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a column vector. Let $Y = \text{pca_proj}(X)$ denote the projection of points in $X$ according to the PCA components i.e. $$Y_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\\ Y_i = W X_i$$ where $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is the projection matrix obtained from PCA, and each row of $W$ is an eigen vector of $X^T X$. Now let's define $Z = \text{pca_proj}(Y)$. My questions is: does $Y = Z$? If not, what happens if we keep applying PCA recursively on a matrix? Does it converge to a specific matrix?
