Is there a way to restrict the relationship of parameters in MCMC?

I have seen some discussion on the restriction on the parameter space such as MCMC on a bounded parameter space? this post, but I am wondering if there is a method to restrict the function or relationship of parameters in MCMC. So For example, I am fitting a linear mixed model where $\sigma^2$ is a variance for the random effect and $\tau^2$ is a variance for the random error. What if I want the ratio $\frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}$ to be less than some number p? I've been trying to find this method on Google Scholar but haven't had success finding any article. I used keywords: restricted mcmc, constrained mcmc. Can anyone tell me what keywords I can use to find this approach anywhere or direct me to an article that did something similar to this?
