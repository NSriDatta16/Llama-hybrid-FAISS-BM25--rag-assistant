ECM long-run elasticity with one I(2) variable

I am estimating a 2SLS using a time series simultaneous equation ECM. The purpose is to estimate the price elasticity of electricity demand. Assume that both price and demand are I(1) variables, becoming I(0) after differencing once. The main equation is consumption: The price is estimated using instruments: Rewriting the consumption function, the long run relationship between quantity and price is given by the fraction coefficient on inside the bracket: Now, I have come to realize that is in fact an I(2) integrated variable, and is not stationary after being differenced once. is still I(1). My question is how this ECM changes to accommodate a second differencing of . And importantly, what happens to the long run relationship between and ? Edit: A graph of and
