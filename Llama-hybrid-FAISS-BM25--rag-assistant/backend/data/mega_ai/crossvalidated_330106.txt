Replacing missing wind speed data from a nearby site

I am doing a project that is looking at testing various imputation methods for estimating missing wind speed at a site in Trinidad. The dataset consist of hourly wind speeds for 15 years. I have tried simple methods like listwise deletion, mean substitution, linear regression, cublic & linear interpolation, nearest neighbor and even Markov chain monte carlo multiple imputation. Are there any other methods that could accurately estimate the wind speeds? I would also like to know if it is possible to use the respective Known wind speed data from a nearby site like in Tobago to replace the specific missing points in Trinidad?
