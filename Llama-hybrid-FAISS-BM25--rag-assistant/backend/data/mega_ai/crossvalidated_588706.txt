Does coin tossing obey mean reversion?

If a coin comes up Heads 90 times out of the first 100 tosses, should one expect Tails to make a comeback over the next 100? Reference from this page: https://www.financialwisdomforum.org/gummy-stuff/coin-tossing.htm It is my understanding from the Law of Large numbers; that in the above case tails should make a comeback over the next 100. However arguments against this include that given they are independent events; tails is not likely to make any comeback and still be 50% over the next 100 tosses. Let’s exaggerate it further; 1 million tosses; 900k heads; it is a fair coin; we are living in our reality (and not a computer simulation); would tails make a comeback to “even out/mean revert” the average to 50%?
