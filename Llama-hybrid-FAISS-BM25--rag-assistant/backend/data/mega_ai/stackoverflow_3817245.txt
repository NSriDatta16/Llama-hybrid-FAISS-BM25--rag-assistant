Visual Studio Makefile Project Synchronization

I've inherited some C99 code that I'm planing on reusing in a C++-centric solution. Unfortunately, even Microsoft's latest compiler has virtually no support for non-trivial C99 features. The code in question has been tested to death and I'd rather not go through the trouble of rewriting it in C++. This means that in order for me to reuse the code verbatim I'll have to rely on a conforming 3rd-party compiler. After looking around, it appears that the nicest way for me to integrate this code is by adding a "Makefile Project" to my solution. Only one problem. It seems like it is now my responsibility to keep the "Build Command Line" property synchronized with the files that I add to the project through Visual Studio. At first glance, I couldn't find a way to get a list of files in my project through the usual Visual Studio $()-style macros. I could always write a shell script that would enumerate * .c files in my source tree and pass their paths to the 3rd-party compiler. However, I kind of expected that Visual Studio would do at least that part of the work for me since it already has this information in the relevant *.vc[x]proj file. It is very unlikely that I'll need to add any new source files to this project, but still, manual synchronization (i.e., without a script) of this sort seems rather fragile to me. What are my options besides writing a helper script?
