As the other responders have pointed out, the basic problem here is that the standard HTTP POST method is not idempotent like the other methods. There is an effort underway to establish a standard for an idempotent POST method known as Post-Once-Exactly, or POE. Now I'm not saying that this is a perfect solution for everybody in the situation you describe, but if it is the case that you are writing both the server and the client, you may be able to leverage some of the ideas from POE. The draft is here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-http-poe-00 It isn't a perfect solution, which is probably why it hasn't really taken off in the six years since the draft was submitted. Some of the problems, and some clever alternate options are discussed here: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7646
