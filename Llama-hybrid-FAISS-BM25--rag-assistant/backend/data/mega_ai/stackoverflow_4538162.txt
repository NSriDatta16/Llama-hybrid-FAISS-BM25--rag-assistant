No user authentication and completely prevent cheating? No can do, sorry. You could restrict casting votes per IP address, but NATs and proxies and VPNs make this unworkable (an IP address could map to many users - e.g. a school or a municipal network, a user could map to many IP addresses - e.g. mobile connection or DHCP, etc). You could set a cookie, but these can be deleted, or not even stored, very easily (Ctrl+Shift+Del, anyone?). Note that just by setting a cookie, you'll prevent 90% of the users from cheating (less if your site has a technical, web-savvy audience); alas, if you don't have some way of identifying the users (e.g. by authentication), there is no way to avoid cheating altogether (and even then people would create sockpuppets to up their vote counts). Facebook's "like" button is something very different - it appears to use no authentication, but actually it requires you to be logged into FB - thus FB stores the vote counts in the database, against usert IDs - and knows which user voted on what, preventing most of voter fraud. Example - a table of "who voted on what": user_id | article_id 1234 1 1234 5 1100 1 Without the user ID, you'd need to set up some anonymous ID. As I have outlined above, this can be done, but every time the user deletes their cookies, he will appear as a completely new user to the system. Since sessions are implemented using cookies, this same problem applies to sessions, too. If you absolutely need to allow anonymous voting, you could store in the session a list of articles this user voted on: { 1, 5 } and check it when the page is accessed. If you set your cookie and session expirations for long enough, this will sort-of work - but again, once the user clears their cookies (or they expire), bamf he's gone and will look as a new user. There is no way to prevent this, using current technologies (yes, there are "persistent cookies","flash cookies","evercookies" and whatnot, but they are, in the end, all just some sort of temporary storage the user can erase).
