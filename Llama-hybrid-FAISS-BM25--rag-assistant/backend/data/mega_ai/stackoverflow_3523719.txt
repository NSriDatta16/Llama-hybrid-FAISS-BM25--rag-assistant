NSTextView: How to be notified when user pastes data?

I need to be notified when the user pastes data into an NSTextView in order to strip it of any disallowed data types (url links, etc). I don't want to use NSTextStorageDelegate's textStorageDidProcessEditing: because it is called when the user is just typing. How can I be notified of pastes only?
