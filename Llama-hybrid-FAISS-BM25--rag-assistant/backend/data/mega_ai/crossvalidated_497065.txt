Heteroscedasticity: When is it OK?

The point of the last analysis in my paper was to check on the basis of which predictor variables the answers to moral dilemmas can be explained. Predictor variables are continuous: dark personality triad (Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy), empathy (cognitive and affective) and thinking style (rational and experiential) The criterion variable is the answers to moral dilemmas that can be utilitarian or deontological. It is also continuous, but has only 6 degrees. The tendency towards lower numbers means utilitarianism, and towards higher ones deontologism. My original idea was to perform a hierarchical regression in two blocks. However, I got quite pronounced heteroskedasticity. However, I got 6 lines, which somehow justifies such a plot given the characteristics of the dependent variable. The direction of regression and distribution seem normal. I would ask for help if someone can justify to me what would be best to do. Is it to do White residual correction, ordinal logistic regression or is there a justification to proceed with the hierarchical regardless of heteroskedasticity, given the characteristics of the criterion variable and how then to best justify it?
