The intuitive idea behind the bootstrap is this: if your original dataset was a random draw from the full population, then if you take subsample from the sample (with replacement), then that too represents a draw from the full population. You can then estimate your model on all of those bootstrapped datasets. This gives you a large number of estimates and so you can e.g. look at the standard deviations of your estimates - it turns out that often this gives a good guess of the standard error of the estimates. Actually, the standard error of the estimates can be thought of excactly as this if you take the many datasets from the true population. Suppose for example there is one outlier in your dataset: then in many of your bootstrapped datasets that observation is not included and so for those datasets, you see the estimated coefficients change by a lot. Similarly, you can look at the F statistic for each of the bootstrap datasets. You could for example see how many times the model was rejected. But I am not sufficiently familiar with SPSS to know what it reports as the F stat: is it the average F statistic?
