Regression help

I am doing a medical study for my thesis concerning the number of organs a donor (numbers ranging from from 0-7) will produce given certain circumstances. I am monitoring their blood sugar, ejection fraction, etc (which are whole numbers) but I also have categorical figures such as Race, Gender, etc. On top of that, I have some yes or no questions as well. I can convert these to binary numbers, but would that mess up a multiple regression or give me bad results. Should I look into another model?
