Including a Trend Component in a Rolling Regression

I am new to rolling regressions, but am currently trying it for my current research. As the post title suggests, I'm trying to assess my specification. What I have now is: ŷ = β0 + β1*x + ε But I'm wondering if I should include a time trend as a right hand side variable. My data structure is time series, 5 years of daily observations. The data exhibit a unit root, I should add. I have looked in the literature, I haven't seen anyone include a time trend. But since my data have a unit root, it almost seems like I should. Perhaps there are many different conventions for denoting time trend and I misunderstood. My statistical package uses the following, which is directly included with the other right hand side variables. @trend I'm unclear because if I am adding a time trend, it almost seems to defeat the purpose of a rolling regression (90 day window, 10 period step) of examining the changes in the coefficients over time. Or on the other hand, if I'm not , I wonder if the trend will behave the same way in a static OLS regression, and account for trending in the time series, making it clearer how x may affect y, and ameliorate inflated r-squared values due to trending, among other things. Which specification is the best way to go?
