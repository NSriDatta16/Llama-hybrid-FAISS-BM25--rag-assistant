A typical HTTP POST request looks like this: POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com Accept: text/html,*/*;q=0.5 User-Agent: BrowserName/1.0 Referer: http://www.example.com/ Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8 foo=1&bar=2 The first line contains the method (typically GET or POST, but there's more, like HEAD, PUT, DELETE), the request URI, and the protocol version. Then there are a number of request headers, which may not be so important for a simple server. If the method is one that takes a request body (POST and PUT), then after the headers there's a blank line followed by the request body. In the case of a POST from an HTML form, the body will consists of key=value pairs for all form elements, joined by & . The values will be %-encoded. You just need to take care of properly parsing the entire request. You should be aware that line endings in HTTP are supposed to be Windows-style ( \r\n ). The readline() method might interpret this as two linebreaks, so it might look like there's an empty line between each of the real lines.
