I believe the answer you are seeking for is ' jQuery custom event '. jQuery custom event provides you abilities to name and organize your event handlers; these event handlers can then be triggered by $(el).trigger('the_event') . Just google for the word for usage and example. I don't it could overwrite the event object, like e.element you suggested though. You may need to rethink the flow to fit it. (Not the that this answer worth 200 reputation but here it is anyway, hope that it's helpful for you to find a way.)
