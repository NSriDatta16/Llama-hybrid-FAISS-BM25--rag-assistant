Is there an elegant way to remove a specific key from a hash and it's sub-hashes in Ruby

Lets say I have a hash which may contain hashes. params: { :action => "index", :controller => "home", :secret => "I love Jeff Atwood", :user => {name => "Steve", secret => "I steal Joel's pants"}} Is there an elegant way to traverse the hash and remove all the "secret" keys I come across including the subhashes. (The hashes are not restricted so no way to know what the hashes may contain in advance.) I know I could do params.delete(:secret) but that wouldn't get the secret from the 'user' hash.
