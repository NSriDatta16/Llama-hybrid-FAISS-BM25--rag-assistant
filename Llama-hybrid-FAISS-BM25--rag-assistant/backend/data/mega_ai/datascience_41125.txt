I think this is a more elegant solution. First of all, km.fit_transform() (or km.transform()) gives you back all distances to all clusters. Then you can summarize only the minimum values - which are the distances to the respective closest clusters. km = KMeans(n_clusters=3) alldistances = km.fit_transform(data2D) totalDistance = np.min(corpus.clusterMatrix, axis=1).sum()
