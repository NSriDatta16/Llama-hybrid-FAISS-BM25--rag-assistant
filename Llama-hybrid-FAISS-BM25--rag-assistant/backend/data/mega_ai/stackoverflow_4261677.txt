jQuery .css() fallbacks?

What is the proper way to do fallbacks with .css()? This would most commonly be used for font fallbacks but I am using it for cursor images. Here's what I got that isn't working: $("#dragable").css('cursor','url(images/grabbing.gif), -moz-grabbing, auto'); **UPDATE: can someone tell me the valid CSS for starters? What I have: cursor: url(images/grabbing.gif), -moz-grabbing, auto; ... doesn't work.**
