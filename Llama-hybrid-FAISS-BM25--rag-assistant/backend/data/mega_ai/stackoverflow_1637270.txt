Give this a shot: 1) Add the following to your view controller's .h file: #import ... @interface MyViewController: UIViewController { ... } ... - (IBAction)buttonPressed:(id)sender; 2) Create a button in Interface Builder 3) Right click on the button in Interface Builder, select the second tab, and drag from the circle next to "Touch Up Inside" to the "File's Owner" in the .xib window, and select the "buttonPressed" method 4) Add the following code to your view controller's .m file: - (IBAction)buttonPressed:(id)sender { NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"mysound" ofType:@"wav"]; SystemSoundID mySound; AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID((CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:path], &mySound); AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(mySound); } 5) Finally make sure you link to the Audio Toolbox framework... you can do this by going to Add to Project... from the Project Menu, navigating to /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulatorXX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks and choosing AudioToolbox.framework. Make sure you select not to copy, and "Relative to Current SDK" from the menu that pops up. Hope this helps!
