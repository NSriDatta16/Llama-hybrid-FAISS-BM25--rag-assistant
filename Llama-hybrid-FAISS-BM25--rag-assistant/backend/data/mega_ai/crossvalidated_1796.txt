I am not at all sure if ignoring the performance spread is a good idea. Ideally, you would want a method to be both reliable (i.e., have low spread) and be valid (i.e., give a performance measure of close to 1). Consider the following two output measures: Method 1. [0.80, 0.60] Method 2. [0.71, 0.69]. Unlike your example, there is no method that clearly dominates and in fact both methods perform equally well on average. Thus you may want to choose the one that is more reliable (i.e., has lower spread). If you accept the above reasoning then your null hypothesis should be: $$\frac{\mu_1}{\sigma_1} = \frac{\mu_2}{\sigma_2}$$ The above is analagous to the Sharpe ratio from finance and I am sure there is an extensive financial literature which discusses how to test hypothesis like the above and its extensions to more than 2 groups. Unfortunately, I am not well read up on that literature to help you.
