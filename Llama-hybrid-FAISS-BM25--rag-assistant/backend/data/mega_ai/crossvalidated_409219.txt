How does fisher.test calculate the confidence interval for the odds ratio in R?

The fisher.test function in base R by default returns a confidence interval for the odds ratio in a 2x2 contingency table. For example: > x dim(x) fisher.test(x) Fishers Exact Test for Count Data data: x p-value = 0.02291 alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval: 1.058526 12.904604 sample estimates: odds ratio 3.406113 The confidence interval of an odds ratio is an extremely useful thing to know, and I would like to refer to it in an article I am currently writing. My dataset has high enough n for a chi-square test, but the latter would only give me the test statistic and a p -value, which are harder to interpret than the confidence interval of an odds ratio. However, I cannot find any explanation of how the confidence interval is being calculated in this case, nor of what the theoretical precedent might be for calculating confidence intervals of odds ratios as part of a Fisher test (as opposed to a logistic regression). Can anyone shed some light?
