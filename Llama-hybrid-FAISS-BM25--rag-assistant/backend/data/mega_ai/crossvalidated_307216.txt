Do posterior probability values from an MCMC analysis have any use?

I need to estimate the Bayesian posterior of my model parameters ($\theta$) for some observed data ($D$), given a likelihood $P(\theta|D)$, and assumed priors $P(\theta)$: $$P(\theta|D)= \frac{P(\theta|D)\; P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$ I use a MCMC algorithm which as far as I understand samples the unnormalized posterior ( edit : I was wrong, the draws are taken from the full posterior). After the MCMC is done, I can construct the probability density function for each $\theta_i$ in my set of parameters $\theta$ (from which I can obtain the necessary statistics: mean, median, confidence intervals, etc.) but I also have a rather large set of unnormalized posterior values. As far as I understand, these values are not used at all in the analysis of the model parameters. Does this set of unnormalized posterior values have any use at all, or are they simply discarded?
