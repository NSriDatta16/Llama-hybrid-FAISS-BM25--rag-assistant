It is definitely a style preference, much like the style arguments around where to put the brace, whether there's a space before/after parentheses, empty lines, etc. Like you, I prefer to keep private functions near the public functions that use them. More specifically, I prefer to group functions by their usage or functionality, rather than alphabetically or visibility. The latter two feels like they are merely for aesthetic reasons rather than any real organisational benefit considering the prevalent use of IDEs these days, making function navigation a very simple thing. Yet when you're working or reading up on a certain feature, it's even easier to just use page up and page down as you work, rather than having to function lookup all the time when you want to navigate from a public function to its helper function.
