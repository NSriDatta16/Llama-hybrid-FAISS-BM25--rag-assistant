Adding up the values a variable takes over the different time periods has meaning only if this cumulative sum can have a meaningful interpretation. For example, it would be reasonable to try to explain a person's weight as years go by, by the person's age, among other things. Obviously adding the values of the time series for "age" has no meaning at all -but including the variable in such a regression makes sense. In your case too, adding, period's A reach to period's B reach is meaningless -so it cannot be used as a criterion as to whether to include the variable "reach" in the regression. A final note: under certain assumptions, the "percentage of target population that saw an ad", can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability that any given member of the population may see the ad.
