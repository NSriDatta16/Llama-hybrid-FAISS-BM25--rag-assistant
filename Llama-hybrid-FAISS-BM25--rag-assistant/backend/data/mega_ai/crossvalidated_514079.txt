Rolling fixed window scheme for GARCH forecasting

I'm working on my bachelors thesis which mainly revolves around this paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1146/4/1/3/htm Shortly after describing the dataset in 3.1 the authors mention that they use a rolling fixed window scheme to estimate the parameters and to predict the conditional variance for the next 20 days. The time windows and forecast horizons are listed in a table in the appendix. I get what they did and I understand the reasoning behind it, but I can't find any literature about it. Why did they decide to chose 20 days? Why not 10 or 50? Is there any rule I should follow if I want to incorporate this method myself, considering I use a different dataset and timescale? As of now, I estimated the parameters for my in-sample and then forecasted the variance for the out-sample using this parameter. Would that be wrong?
