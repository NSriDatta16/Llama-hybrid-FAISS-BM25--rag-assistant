Bayesian updating in JAGS - data not reaching posterior distribution

I am trying to model the survival of a bird species as the function of a habitat variable, using JAGS run with the R package R2jags. When I leave the habitat variable out, I get believable estimates for the survival parameters (phiWithin and phiAmong). Here is that model: model{ for(i in 1:nBirds) { z[i, first[i]] ~ dbern(1) for(t in (first[i] + 1) : last[i]) { logit(phi[i,t]) When I add the habitat variable the posterior distributions of the survival parameters (phiWithin and phiAmong) are not updated, and closely mimic their prior distributions (e.g., dunif[0,1]). I've tried to give really informative prior distributions, but no luck. The covariate values are not large, they range from 5 to 21, so I haven't tried to scale them. Here is that model: model{ for(i in 1:nBirds) { z[i, first[i]] ~ dbern(1) for(t in (first[i] + 1) : last[i]) { logit(phi[i,t]) Why are the posterior distributions not updating? In Kery and Schaub's 'Bayesian Population Analysis Using WinBUGS: A Hierarchical Perspective', in 'Appendix 1: A List of WinBUGS Tricks', #14: "We have sometimes experienced problems when using WinBUGS' own logit function, for instance, with achieving convergence." They go on to suggest explicitly specifying the logit transformation instead. Perhaps JAGS has similar problems with the logit function? Any clarity greatly apprectiated.
