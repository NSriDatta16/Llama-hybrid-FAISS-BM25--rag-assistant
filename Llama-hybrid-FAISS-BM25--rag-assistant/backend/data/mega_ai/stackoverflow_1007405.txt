Inheriting a web server control in a simple fashion?

I'm having a Repeater used as a sort of Paging TagCloud. To do so, I've added simple properties to the Page's ViewState such as a Page, RowCount, etc... I feel like it doesn't belong there but I had bad experiences with server controls, debugging, dll and deployment. Could I just inherit the Repeater class, add a few ControlState/ViewState properties and be able to use it exactly as a Repeater dragged straight from the ToolBox? Here, having the following simple class: public class TagCloud : Repeater { public int selectedIndex; public TagCloud() { selectedIndex = -1; // // TODO: Add constructor logic here // } public int SelectedIndex { get { return selectedIndex; } set { selectedIndex = value; } } } Without creating a new WebControlLibrary project, could this cs file stands in the App_Code folder and work like expected? Thanks.
