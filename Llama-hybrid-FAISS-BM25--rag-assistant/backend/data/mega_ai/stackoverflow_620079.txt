The asp:Silverlight server control just renders some client side script to create the host/sink for Silverlight, you can test this yourself, but you have to do this with JavaScript. It's possible that the asp:Silverlight control supports this but I reckon you'll have to write something yourself. In that case, look up how a Silverlight host is created in the browser, that's where you'll find your answer. You're dilemma is that the asp:Silverlight server control runs before any client side code. You'll probably have to write some custom JavaScript to hande this and it won't be possible to let the server take action unless you have a reliable User-Agent string, which is unlikely.
