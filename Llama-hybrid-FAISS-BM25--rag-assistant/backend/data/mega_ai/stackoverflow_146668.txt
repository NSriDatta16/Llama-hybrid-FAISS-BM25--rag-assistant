How do I parse a number from a String that may have a leading zero?

In ruby I am parsing a date in the following format: 24092008. I want to convert each section (year, month, date) into a number. I have split them up using a regex which produces three Strings which I am passing into the Integer constructor. date =~ /^([\d]{2})([\d]{2})([\d]{4})/ year = Integer($3) month = Integer($2) day = Integer($1) When it hits the month line it crashes as follows: `Integer': invalid value for Integer: "09" (ArgumentError) It took me a while to realise that it's interpreting the leading zero as Octal and 09 is not a valid Octal number (it works fine with "07"). Is there an elegant solution to this or should I just test for numbers less than 10 and remove the zero first? Thanks.
