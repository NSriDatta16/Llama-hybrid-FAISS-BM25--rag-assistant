Python is great. Easy to read, fully featured. If you are going to work with pseudocode, Python will look pretty familiar. Python is already the algorithms language of choice at UC Irvine , where it is described like so: " Python represents an algorithm-oriented language that has been sorely needed in education. The advantages of Python include its textbook-like syntax and interactivity that encourages experimentation. " Python also works in a beginner friendly way with Gato , a graph making tool. Learning Algorithms and Data Structures is one top that can help by being made visual, something that Gato makes it easy to do (without learning any complex graphing libraries)
