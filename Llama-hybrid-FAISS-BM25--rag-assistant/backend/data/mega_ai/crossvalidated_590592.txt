How is AR(1) autocorrelation defined in a glmmTMB generalised linear model?

How is AR(1) autocorrelation defined / parameterised when using a R {glmmTMB} GLM? I have read through Kristensen and McGillycuddy's vignette ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/vignettes/covstruct.html ) and understand the Gaussian case, but I don't understand how it's implemented within a generalised linear model structure. In particular, I want to be able to understand it when implemented in a logistic regression, but more general theory is fine (I'd also be interested in being able to apply it to Poisson etc.). If I could have a link to a reference paper, that would be greatly appreciated. Or, some equations describing how it's done. Thank you!
