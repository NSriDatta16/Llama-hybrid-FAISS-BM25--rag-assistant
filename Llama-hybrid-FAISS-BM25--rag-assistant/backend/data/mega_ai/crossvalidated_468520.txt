How to check if a correlation exists between a continuous independent and a binary dependent variable

So this has been a headache for me. None of the resources I found could explain it in a manner I understand. Having two sets of data: x The y variable is binary and the x variable is continuous as you can see. What I understand so far is that some machine learning models, like logistic regression, expect the log odds of the y variable to have a linear relationship with the y variable. How would I make a plot that shows if they abide to this assumption or not and how would I read that plot? I prefer examples in R but any explanation you feel might contribute to my understanding is more than welcome.
