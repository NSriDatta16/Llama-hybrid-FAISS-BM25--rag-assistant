Change point detection

I have a specific question about the formulation of offline multiple change point detection given in Burg and Williams . Where the change points are denoted $\{\tau_i\}$ , and the slice of a time series from $a$ to $b$ is $\textbf{y}_{a:b}$ . $\ell$ is a loss function, and $P$ is a penalty on the number of change points. My question is: why is it written as $\ell(\textbf{y}_{\tau_{i-1}:\tau_{i}-1})$ and not $\ell(\textbf{y}_{\tau_{i-1}:\tau_{i}})$ ? In other words, why is there a second $-1$ term in the loss function?
