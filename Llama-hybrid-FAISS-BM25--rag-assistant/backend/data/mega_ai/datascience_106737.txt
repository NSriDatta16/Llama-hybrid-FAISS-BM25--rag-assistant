From Official Keras examples: Image similarity estimation using a Siamese Network with a triplet loss Training a Siamese Network to compare the similarity of images using a triplet loss function. A Siamese Network is a type of network architecture that contains two or more identical subnetworks used to generate feature vectors for each input and compare them. Siamese Networks can be applied to different use cases, like detecting duplicates, finding anomalies, and face recognition. This example uses a Siamese Network with three identical subnetworks. We will provide three images to the model, where two of them will be similar (anchor and positive samples), and the third will be unrelated (a negative example.) Our goal is for the model to learn to estimate the similarity between images. View in Colab GitHub source Image similarity estimation using a Siamese Network with a contrastive loss Similarity learning using a siamese network trained with a contrastive loss Siamese Networks are neural networks that share weights between two or more sister networks, each producing embedding vectors of its respective inputs. In supervised similarity learning, the networks are then trained to maximize the contrast (distance) between embeddings of inputs of different classes, while minimizing the distance between embeddings of similar classes, resulting in embedding spaces that reflect the class segmentation of the training inputs.
