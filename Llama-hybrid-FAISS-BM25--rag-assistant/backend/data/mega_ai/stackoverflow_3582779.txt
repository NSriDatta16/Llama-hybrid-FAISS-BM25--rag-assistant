lPipeName is invalid, you need to escape the '\' characters correctly as in the msdn example (see here for details of the various error codes). I'd also use defines rather than hex numbers, a pipe I use is declared with: hPipe = CreateNamedPipe( lpszPipename, PIPE_ACCESS_DUPLEX | FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, PIPE_TYPE_BYTE | PIPE_READMODE_BYTE | PIPE_WAIT, PIPE_UNLIMITED_INSTANCES, BUFSIZE, BUFSIZE, 0, NULL); Which imo is more readable. The MSDN code snippet is for the client side. The server side creates the pipe using CreateNamedPipe, the client side connects to the already created pipe using CreateFile. EDIT: The first two paragraphs of the remarks section of the CreatenamedPipe man page describe why you may be getting access denied. Assuming this is the only instance of this named pipe you are creating the problem may be your permissions. Are you on Vista or Windows 7? If so make sure you are running as administrator. Otherwise you're going to have to play with your settings till you get it right. PS : Are you calling DisconnectNamedPipe and CloseHandle when you're finished with the pipe? I'd call them even if the pipe hasn't created correctly.
