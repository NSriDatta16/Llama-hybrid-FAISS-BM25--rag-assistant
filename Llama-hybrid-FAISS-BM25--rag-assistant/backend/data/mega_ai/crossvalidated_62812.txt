Sounds like your dependent/explained/left-hand-side/y variable is ordinal. In that case I would look into ordered logit, generalized ordered logit, or stereotype logistic regression. These are all models that (in different ways) respect the ordered nature of your variable and try to use that to get a parsimonious model. Various good books exist on this topic, as a Stata user I like : http://www.stata.com/bookstore/regression-models-categorical-dependent-variables/index.html
