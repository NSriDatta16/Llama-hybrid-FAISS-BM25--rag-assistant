other alternative texthelpers in rails

I have text input I get from a variety of sources which is not HTML but is simple text. I've tried using Redcloth to fit this with HTML tags to that it integrates nicely into my site, but it doesn't get bullet points or paragraphs... I checked around an found some text helpers built in, but those also didn't do the job. http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper.html The text looks basically like this Some text Some more text -Maybe some point -Another one I'd like to get that with tags: Some text whatever Other wise it just ends up looking like one long run-on paragraph. Any recommendations?
