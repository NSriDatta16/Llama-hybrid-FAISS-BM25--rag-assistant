Entity Framework Security

In my organization, we are just beginning to use the Entity Framework for some applications. In the past, we have pushed developers to utilize stored procedures for all database access. In addition to helping with SQL injection, we tried to grant logins access to stored procedures only to keep security relatively tight. Although inserting, updating, and deleting are easily done through stored procedures in the EF, it appears to be difficult to use stored procedures to query data with EF. However, using LINQ or Entity SQL and allowing EF to create the queries means giving a user read access to the entire database. How have others handled this dilemma?
