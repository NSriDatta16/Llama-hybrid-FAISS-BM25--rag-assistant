I would imaging the "2 gig limit" mentioned is a result of 32-bit integers (read: most 32-bit programs/servers) used throughout the various infrastructure -- it's only relatively recently that 64-bit file access has made it into consumer operating systems. (In addition to the above end-points, any intermediate proxies as well as file-systems, etc, must also be considered as limiting factors). I can't find anywhere in RFC 2616 that actually sets the "upper limit" for things such as Content-Length though. Edit (my thoughts) : If it's a captive audience, perhaps use an alternative (e.g. Flash/Silverlight/ActiveX/etc) agent for the uploads?
