Why pysqlite does not work properly?

I tried to install pysqlite. Some suspicious things start to appear during the installation. Why I typed: python setup.py build I got the following message in the end: src/module.c:286: error: ‘SQLITE_PRAGMA’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:287: error: ‘SQLITE_READ’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:288: error: ‘SQLITE_SELECT’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:289: error: ‘SQLITE_TRANSACTION’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:290: error: ‘SQLITE_UPDATE’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:291: error: ‘SQLITE_ATTACH’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:292: error: ‘SQLITE_DETACH’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c: In function ‘init_sqlite’: src/module.c:419: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘sqlite3_libversion’ src/module.c:419: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘PyString_FromString’ makes pointer from integer without a cast error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1 I just ignored the last line and decided to continue. So, I typed: python setup.py install And than, again, I got similar error message: src/module.c:288: error: ‘SQLITE_SELECT’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:289: error: ‘SQLITE_TRANSACTION’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:290: error: ‘SQLITE_UPDATE’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:291: error: ‘SQLITE_ATTACH’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c:292: error: ‘SQLITE_DETACH’ undeclared here (not in a function) src/module.c: In function ‘init_sqlite’: src/module.c:419: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘sqlite3_libversion’ src/module.c:419: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘PyString_FromString’ makes pointer from integer without a cast error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1 After that I wanted to try if pysqlite works. If in the python-command-line mode I type from pysqlite2 import * Python does not complain. However, if I try to follow an exmaple in my book: from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite I get a error message: Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in File "pysqlite2/dbapi2.py", line 27, in from pysqlite2._sqlite import * ImportError: No module named _sqlite Does anybody have any ideas why it happens and how this problem can be solved. By the way, I have installed a new version of Python. "python -V" gives me "Python 2.6.2". Thank you in advance for any help.
