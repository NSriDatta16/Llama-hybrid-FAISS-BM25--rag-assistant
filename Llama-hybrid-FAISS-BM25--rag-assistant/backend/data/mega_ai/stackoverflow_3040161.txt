Clojure lots of threads

I just got done watching Rick Hickey's "Clojure Concurrency" talk, and I have a few questions about threads. Let's say I have a situation with lots of Agents, let's say 10,000 of them running one machine. I'd rather not have 10,000 CPU threads running at once, but I don't want threads to be blocked by the actions of other threads. In this example I won't really be waiting for replies, instead each Agent will be sending a message or two, and then waiting until it gets a message. How would I structure a program like this without getting 10k OS threads which would probably end up slowing the system down.
