What is a good Gini decrease cutoff for feature inclusion based upon random forests?

I am using random forests to try and determine variable importance as part of feature selection for a model I'm working on, and while I can get ranked variable importance by mean decrease in Gini from removal, I'm not sure what a good cutoff would be for including a variable in a model or not. For example, if the decrease in Gini from removing a variable is 30, is that variable worth including? Are there any good rules of thumb on this topic, or does it depend on the model?
