Increasing number of neurons in convolutional net?

So this paper (chapter 2.4) describes a deep CNN as having two convolutional layers, consisting of 128 and 256 units respectively. From what I've learned, I understand that each convolutional layer should have fewer outputs than inputs, or at least not more. But in the paper 256-unit layer gets outputs from 128-unit layer as inputs. How is this possible? Could someone do a breakdown of that?
