Yes, as long as the assumptions of the logistic regression are met, you can do that (A simple guide to checking assumptions in R) . However, always check for Zero-inflated model , and if that is the case, you should define meaningful cut-offs in this variable to turn it into a categorical predictor (Such as more than zero and zero, etc)
