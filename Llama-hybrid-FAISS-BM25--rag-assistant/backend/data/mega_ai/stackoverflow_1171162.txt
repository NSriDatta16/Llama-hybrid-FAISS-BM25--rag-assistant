It sounds like you are still having a lot of logic in your UI layer. Forms/Panels shouldn't have that much Value properties (except maybe for Dialogs). If you want more structure than read up on the MVC pattern. Having said all that, Frames can be a good way to organize the GUI. Like with everything, don't overuse.
