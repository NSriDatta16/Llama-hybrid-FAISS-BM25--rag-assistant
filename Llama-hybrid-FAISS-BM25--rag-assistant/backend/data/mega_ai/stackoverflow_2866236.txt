I only use var when it's clear to see what type is used. For example, I would use var in this case, because you can see immediately that x will be of the type "MyClass": var x = new MyClass(); I would NOT use var in cases like this, because you have to drag the mouse over the code and look at the tooltip to see what type MyFunction returns: var x = MyClass.MyFunction(); Especially, I never use var in cases where the right side is not even a method, but only a value: var x = 5; (because the compiler can't know if I want a byte, short, int or whatever)
