Unless you're using a dynamic Flash object embedding method, your Flash object HTML should look something like this: The id="sample in the object tag and name="sample" & swliveconnect="true" in the embed tag are important. The object tag's ID value and the embed tag's name value should be the same (but doesn't have to be "sample" of course). You'll use that value in your window["sample"] and document["sample"] calls, like so: function changetext(str){ if(window.sample) window.document["sample"].SetVariable("myText", str); if(document.sample) document.sample.SetVariable("myText", str); } The simple example above uses a SetVariable callback method that is in the Flash movie. In your case, it should just be your sendTextToFlash callback, if your AS2 code is correct, which appears to be the case. Try fixing your HTML code first, and see if that works, then report back.
