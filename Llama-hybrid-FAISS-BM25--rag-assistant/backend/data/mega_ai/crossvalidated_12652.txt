In Information Retrieval research, an experiment is often repeated several times (in system-oriented IR e.g. about 50 times with slightly varying data). In that case the solution is normally to establish some measure of central tendency (e.g. arithmetic mean) and do the significance test on that. Your population is human beings so you would want to come up with a measure for a single human being, which, in your case, could be the mean answer.
