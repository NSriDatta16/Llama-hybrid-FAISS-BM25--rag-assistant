jquery sortable/draggable double event firing

I have some drag & drop code which works fine as it is. Just have a little query. I've noticed that if I add an alert within the drop function for debugging purposes (eg. alert(draggedItem.text());) it fires the alert twice when I drop something into the draggable area. I've read in another post that using droppable & sortable together causes this weird double event to happen. But I need to use the droppable event to get the dragged item object (ui.draggable) - this is so I can manipulate it when I drop it. If there is any other way of getting the draggable object, please tell me :) Also if you have an explanation to why this happens, that would be interesting... $(".field > li").draggable({ helper:'clone', opacity: 0.4, connectToSortable:'.dragrow' }); $(".dragrow").droppable({ drop: function(e, ui) { draggedItem = ui.draggable; //alert(draggedItem.text()); } }).sortable({ //code here to do stuff with 'draggedItem' I also have another query related to this, but as my code is quite large, I'm unable to post the full thing here. So I understand if you are unable to help - just if something springs to mind that would be really cool. Basically I have a list of 'blocks' which I can drag into multiple rows. Individual rows can be hidden with the toggle event. If I have 3 rows, I can drag blocks into any of them. If I then hide the first one, I am now unable to drag into the other two rows. I can still sort them though. And once I start sorting them, I am then able to drag into them again. Weird...
