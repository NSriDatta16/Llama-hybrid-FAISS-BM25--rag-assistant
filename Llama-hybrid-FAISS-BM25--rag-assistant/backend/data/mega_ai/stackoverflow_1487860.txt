NUnit has a richer assert API . The api is particularly elegant (fluent, even), for example Assert.That(Is.Unique, myResults); // assert: myResults is a collection of unique items If you've seen the Hamcrest extensions to JUnit you'll recognise this style. It also has a growing set of extensions , such as performance testing and an excellent VS plugin .
