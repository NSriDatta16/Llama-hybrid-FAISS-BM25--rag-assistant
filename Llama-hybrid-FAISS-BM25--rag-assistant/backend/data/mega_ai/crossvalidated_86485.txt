No, but the weighted sum of the coefficients should be the weighted sum of the individual log-odds ratio calculated for each sample. Consider the equation for g(x) on the Wikipedia page on logistic regression . Since $g(x) = \ln{(\pi_x/(1-\pi_x))} = {\bf \beta} x + \beta_0$, the weighted average of $g(x)$'s computed over multiple samples should be equal to the weighted average of the coefficients. So, if you average the coefficients ($\beta$s), you should get the mean log odds ratio across all your classifiers. You can calculate the mean odds ratio and mean probability from there.
