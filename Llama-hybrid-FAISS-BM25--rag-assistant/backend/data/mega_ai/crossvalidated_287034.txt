There is a paper covering the package, but I'm not sure how much help to you it might be. Based on my understanding the purpose of GAMLSS is to be able to run different models of distribution parameters in the same global model. This is similar to mixed-effects regression where the model is hierarchical, i.e., that equations for parameters at different levels are fit in one model in order to better model sources of error (e.g., dependency between repeated measures responses). But but GAMLSS you are modeling specific explanatory effects on specific parameters from whatever distribution you have chosen (in your case, the ex-Gaussian). That works well because in the RT literature using the ex-Gaussian as the model of cognition, there are theoretical reasons to believe that experimental manipulations will affect one or more parameters by not the others (but see Matzke & Wagenmakers, 2009). In your case, one might theorize that, say, valence only affects $\mu$, but not the other parameters (I am just picking at random here). So then you'd specify an equation only for $\mu$ but not the other variables. Everything else would go in the first formula call, as you have done. If you do not enter an explicit equation for a parameter, the function just fits an "intercept", i.e., an estimate of that parameter without any knowledge of factors or covariates.
