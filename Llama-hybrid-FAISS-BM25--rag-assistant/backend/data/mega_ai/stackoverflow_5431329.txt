While not impossible it would be incredibly hard, a simpler alternative would be to embed OSGi inside JBoss, see: http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-framework-launching-and-embedding.html and Programmatically Start OSGi (Equinox)? and http://njbartlett.name/2011/03/07/embedding-osgi.html http://www.dcm4che.org/jira/browse/DCM-308 Looks like they're adding support to make the Jars valid bundles - couldn't you just work out the dependencies and deploy these to an OSGi framework? OSGi has support for JMX and JNDI. Unless there are huge dependencies on JBoss' internals, I'd suggest the second option, but beware of Class.forName usage and other non-osgi-friendly code.
