Estimation of $\phi$ in $AR(1)$ process

Let $n=144$ observations from an $AR(1)$ model $$y_t=\phi y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$$ where $\epsilon_t$ is White Noise with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$. If $y_1=-1.7$, $y_{144}=-2.1$, $\sum_{t=2}^n y_t y_{t-1}=-128.6$ and $\sum_{t=1}^n y_t^2=246.4$. Find an estimate for $\phi$. I already found that the estimate of $\phi$ is the first sample autocorrelation Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R $$\hat{\phi}=\frac{\sum_{t=2}^n (y_t-\overline{y})(y_{t-1}-\overline{y})}{\sum_{t=1}^n (y_{t-1}-\overline{y})^2}$$ The problem is that I don't know how to evaluate it just with the information that I have. $$\hat{\phi}=\frac{\sum_{t=2}^n (y_t y_{t-1}-\overline{y}y_{t}+\overline{y}y_{t-1}+\overline{y}^2)}{\sum_{t=1}^n (y_t^2-2\overline{y}y_{t-1}+\overline{y}^2)}$$ I have separated the sums but it seems to me that the information is insufficient. What I'm missing?
