The class of score-driven models might be of interest to you: Creal, D. D., S. J. Koopman, and A. Lucas (2013). Generalized autoregressive score models with applications. Journal of Applied Econometrics 28(5), 777--795 Score-driven models were applied to a binary time series of outcomes of The Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge, https://timeserieslab.com/articles.html#boatrace In that paper, the time-varying probability was obtained with the score-driven methodology by using the (free) Time Series Lab software package. The score-driven model for binary observations in short: Our observations can take on either two values: 0 and 1. We therefore assume that these observations come from the Binary distribution with probability density function (pdf) \begin{equation}\label{eq:pdf} p(y_t | \pi_t) = \pi_t^{y_t} (1-\pi_t)^{1-y_t} \end{equation} where $\pi_t$ is a time-varying probability and $y_t \in \{0,1\}$ for $t = 1,\ldots,T$ where $T$ is the length of the time series. We can specify the time-varying probability $\pi_t$ as a function of a dynamic process $\alpha _t$ , that is \begin{equation}\label{eq:pi} \begin{aligned} \pi_{t+1} &= f(\alpha_t),\\ \alpha_{t+1} &= \omega + \phi \alpha_t + \kappa s_t , \end{aligned} \end{equation} where the link function $f(\cdot)$ is the logit link function so that $\pi_t$ takes values between 0 and 1. You can easily include more lags of $\alpha_t$ or $s_t$ into the equation above. The unknown coefficients include the constant $\omega$ , the autoregressive parameter $\phi$ , and the score updating parameter $\kappa$ which are estimated by maximum likelihood. The driving force behind the updating equation of $\alpha_t$ is the scaled score innovation $s_t$ as given by \begin{equation}\label{eq:score} \qquad s_t = S_t \cdot \nabla_t, \qquad \nabla_t = \frac{\partial \, \log \, p(y_t | \pi_t)}{\partial \alpha_t}, \end{equation} for $t = 1,\ldots,T$ and where $\nabla_{t}$ is the score of the density $p(y_t | \pi_t)$ and $S_t$ a scaling factor which is often the inverse of the Fisher information.
