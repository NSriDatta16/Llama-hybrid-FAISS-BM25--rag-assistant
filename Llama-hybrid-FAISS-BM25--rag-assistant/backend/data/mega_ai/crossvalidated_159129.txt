No, nothing has changed about the inferential situation, just the manner in which you generate the interval with the supposed properties. So the interpretation of an CI generated this way doesn't change -- the big question is whether it really has the coverage properties claimed for it. That is, across many such samples, would the intervals generated in this manner include the parameter the specified fraction of the time? That's a rather trickier question; often in small samples it seems that coverage can be rather smaller than the nominal coverage. Various things may improve the coverage in smaller samples in different circumstances, but I think that would be a discussion for another question.
