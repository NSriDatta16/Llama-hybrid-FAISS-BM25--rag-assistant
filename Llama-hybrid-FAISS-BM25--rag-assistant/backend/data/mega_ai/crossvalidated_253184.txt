You are on the right track, ROC is a common error measure for logistic regression models. More often, the Area Under The Receiver Operating Curve ( AUROC ) is used. The advantage is that this measure is numeric and can be compared to other validation runs / model setups of your logistic regression. You can, for example, use cross-validation to asses the performance of your model. As this goodness of fit depends highly on your training and test sets, it is common to use many repetitions with different training and tests sets. At the end, you have a somewhat stable estimation of your model fit taking the mean of all repetitions. There are several packages providing cross-validation approaches in R. Assuming you have a fitted model, you can e.g. use the sperrorest package with the following setup: nspres $pooled.err$ train.auroc) summary(nspres $pooled.err$ test.auroc) This will perform a cross-validation using 10 folds, 50 repetitions and give you a summary of the overall mean repetition error.
