Transforming input features for t-SNE and UMAP

Previously I was using PCA as my dimension reduction algorithm of choice, but have recently moved to using t-SNE and UMAP. For PCA I would apply transformations to my input features to ensure they were approximately normal. For t-SNE I would apply the same transformations to features then the Rtsne function from the Rtsne package would apply PCA and input the PC's into the t-SNE model. My question is what transformations or other dimension reduction techniques should I apply to my data prior to running UMAP (and for that matter is running with PC's in a t-SNE model the best way to analyse data)? For my datasets many of the features represent ratios and I am not sure if this has any bearing on how my features should be treated.
