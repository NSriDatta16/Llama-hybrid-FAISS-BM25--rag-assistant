Individuals and properties in semantic web

I'm currently working on a semantic web e-learning project. I've made an ontology and classes. However, when populating RDF files, I create an individual (for example a course) and place it in a RDF. Afterwards if I it is needed to relate another individual to this one by an object property (e.g. student-> studyMemberOf-> course), I put course Uri in student individual. This means (course individual Uri: crs000021): I have 2 Questions here: Is it right to put individuals of each class, in a separate RDF file? When relating these two individuals, am I making another node of 'course (crs000021)' in student file? is this method (making different rdfs) incorrect? Thank you for your attention
