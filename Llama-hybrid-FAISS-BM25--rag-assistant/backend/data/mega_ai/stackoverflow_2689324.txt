Poor man's solution: import time for i in range(10): print "\r", i, time.sleep(1) The trick is the print statement. The carriage return ("\r") sets the cursor back to the first column on the same line, without starting a new line. The trailing comma "," tells print not to produce a newline either. Depending on your output, you may want to pad the print statement with trailing spaces to ensure that fragments from longer previous lines do not interfere with your current print statement. Its probably best to assemble a string which has fixed length for any progress information. Updating answer for Python 3+ : import time for i in range(10): print('\r', str(i), end = '') time.sleep(1)
