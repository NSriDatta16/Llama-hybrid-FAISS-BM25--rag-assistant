This seems to have fixed the problem....maybe not all is necessary but I am moving on. table, tr, th, td {height: 5px; line-height:1.0; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; border:0px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 1px 1px 1px 1px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; vertical-align: middle; overflow:hidden; overflow-x:hidden} One especially important thing to note is the padding-top, padding-left, etc...Firefox and IE interpret padding differently, so it was correct in FF with just: padding: 1px 1px 1px 1px; But IE seems to ignore that. Another noteworthy issue is that CSS of course overrides setting the row height in the RowDataBound event, which makes sense. YET ANOTHER UPDATE: The original CSS above stopped working for me for some unknown reason. I happen to be using Blueprint CSS, which is causing some styles to come down that is messing with my custom stylesheet. So anyways, I think I finally have it.... 1. Basically, to be safe (maybe only if you a disorganized like me), you have to explicitly set every attribute that could conceivably affect the height. Here is the CSS I am using: .xGridview tr, th, td, input {height: auto; line-height:normal; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; border:0px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 2px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 2px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; vertical-align: middle; overflow:hidden; background-color:White} I happened to have a required field validator within my grid; it was rendering as invisible so I didn't notice it until I used Firebug. To make things worse, I think it was rendering itself within a table that was somehow ignoring the CSS of the outer table. I had a RadioButtonList in the grid, which by default renders as a table. This can be changed by setting RepeatLayout="Flow" on the RadioButtonList control which instead causes it to be rendered as a span, much nicer. Note also that I added the element INPUT to the CSS, this is required to set the vertical-align on the labels attached to the radio buttons. So that seems to have licked it finally.
