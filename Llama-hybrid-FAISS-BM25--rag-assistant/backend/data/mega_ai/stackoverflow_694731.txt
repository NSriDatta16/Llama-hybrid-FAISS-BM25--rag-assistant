unit testing data storage

Suppose I have an interface with methods 'storeData(key, data)' and 'getData(key)'. How should I test a concrete implementation? Should I check if the data was correctly set in the storage medium (eg an sql database) or should I just check whether or not it gives the correct data back by using getData? If I look up the data in the database it feels like I'm also testing the internals of the method but only checking whether it gives the same data back feels incomplete.
