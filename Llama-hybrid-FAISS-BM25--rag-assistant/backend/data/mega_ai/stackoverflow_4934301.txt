MSBUILD Run NCover Against Matched Projects

I am using MSBuild and am getting all test projects using a regex on the project name, like this. I now want to use @(UnitTestProjects) and pass them all to NCover to check that the tests are all giving 100% coverage. To do this on a single project, I do something like this: How do I effectively use @(UnitTestProjects) in the context of this NCover target?
