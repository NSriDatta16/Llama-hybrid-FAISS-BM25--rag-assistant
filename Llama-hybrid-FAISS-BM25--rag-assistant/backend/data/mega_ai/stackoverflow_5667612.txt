Difference between COOKIE and CLIENT scopes in ColdFusion?

I have been googling, but haven't found an answer. I understand pretty well what the cookie scope does in ColdFusion. But I'm not 100% sure about the purpose of the client scope or the differences between it and the cookie scope. It gets a bit muddy because one of the storage methods for the client scope can be set to cookie. Can someone supply an example, or use-case, that illustrates what the differences are and when I would use one versus the other?
