Does it need to be jQuery? You just need to define a callback function for your mousedown event on the image(s) in question with event.preventDefault() . So your image tag could look like this: The additional if is needed because otherwise IE throws an error. If you want this for all image tags you just need to iterate through the img tags with jQuery and attach the onmousedown event handler. There is a nice explanation (and example) on this page: " Disable image dragging in FireFox " and a not as well documented version is here using jQuery as reference: " Disable Firefox Image Drag "
