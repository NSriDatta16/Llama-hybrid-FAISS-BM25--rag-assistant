Prediction of features given predictor

I am working on a problem where my objective is to predict y given some features x1,x2,x3,...x8,x9 I solved this problem using some statistical and machine learning techniques like regression, trees, random forests & svm. Now that I have a prediction for y, at a given x1,x2,x3..x6 I would like to achieve an optimal value of y, by changing some values of xn which are in my control. Let us say that y was predicted to be 5, however I need a value of 10. Can I put three features aside say x1,x2,x3 and get like a range or values for the aforementioned aside features such that the value of y is 10? Basically, it is sort of like an inverse problem, where assuming I know the predictor I need to manipulate the features to increase the value of the predictor. Reproducible example: y So now that I have y.rf and y.fit, lets say i have control over the values of x1 & x2, hence I would like a given value of y say 0.5, and to achieve this value of y (0.5) at a fixed value of x3,x4 I would like a range for x1 and x2 or possible values for x1 & x2. How should I proceed?
