You cannot reduce "( a OR b OR d ) AND ( a OR c )" to "( a OR b OR d OR c )" because the former is not satisfied with "c=true, a,b,d=false", whereas the latter is. So you can't prove the reduction correct either :) In general, there are many ways to reduce Boolean formulae in size, and it is also a question of what you want to optimize (total size? average number of condition evaluations?). Karnaugh maps work only for a small number of variables. Reducing big Boolean formulaes into smaller ones is an advanced topic that is key in e.g. automatic logical circuit design.
