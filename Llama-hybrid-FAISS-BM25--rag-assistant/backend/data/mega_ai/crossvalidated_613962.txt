Why is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} Cov(X_i,X_j) = \sum_{i-j=-n}^{n} (n-|i-j|)\gamma(i-j)$ for a stationary time series

My book presents the following derivation of the variance of the mean estimator $\bar{X_n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$ for a stationary process $(X_t)_{t}$ with autocovariance function $\gamma(\cdot)$ : I do not understand the last equality in the calculation above. Could someone explain how they have rewritten the sum (from summing over $i,j$ to summing over $i-j$ ) and why there is factor $n-|i-j|$ multiplied with the autocovariance function?
