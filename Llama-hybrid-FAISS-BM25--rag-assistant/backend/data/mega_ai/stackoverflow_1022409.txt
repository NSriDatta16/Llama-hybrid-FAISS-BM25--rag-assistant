Compound object in HTML value attribute

If for some reason it were mandatory to associate a with more than one value, is there a good way to do it? For example ... CSV: Answer JSON: Answer In the absence of a good way to do it, is there a traditional way? Edit: another use case Server M, the producer of the HTML, knows the user's current location and favorite genres, movie names, nearest theater, and next showtime. Server F knows how to query various 3rd party servers about how to get from point A to point B in order to arrive by time T. The user knows only the movie names: click Drag Me to Hell , and get the route. Server M could generate a form for each movie, with a single button showing the name of the movie and multiple hidden fields with the start and end locations and desired arrive-by time, but that would require a lot of repeated code. Every one of these one-button mini-forms would have the same method and action and the same hidden input field structure. Styling would be a collection of mini-forms rather than a collection of buttons, so FIELDSET and LEGEND are unavailable (because HTML forbids nested forms). Putting the parameters into the button's value attribute would be much tidier.
