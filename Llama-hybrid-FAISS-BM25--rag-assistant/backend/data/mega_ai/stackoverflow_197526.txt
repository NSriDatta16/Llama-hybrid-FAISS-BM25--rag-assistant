As previous posters have stated, you shouldn't be throwing System.Exception. In fact, if you ran FxCop on your code, it would flag that as a rule violation. I recommend having a look at Chapter 18 of Applied .NET Framework Programming, or chapter 19 of the more recent CLR via C# (2nd edition) for detailed guidance. Richter does an excellent job of correcting the misconceptions that a lot of developers hold about exceptions. Both books contain a list of the exceptions defined by the Framework Class Library. Look at the list and figure out the most specific exceptions possible that your code can throw. If you can recover from an exception, do so in that catch block. If you have need of multiple catch blocks, organize them from the most specific to the least specific. Create a custom exception if you can't find one in the existing list that suits the situation.
