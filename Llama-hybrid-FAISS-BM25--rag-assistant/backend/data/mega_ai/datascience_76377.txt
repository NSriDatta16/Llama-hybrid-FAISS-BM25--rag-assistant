It will not In a very simple language, the model learns the characteristics in terms of the feature and map to result that you provide as a class. That mapping can be very simple or very complex(a big neural network) What ever data it will get, it will divide the full space and everything will be mapped to a Class.e.g. >10000 will be mapped to Class-A depending on the data, so it will predict Class-A even for 1Mn unless you train with new data for >10k-20K-Class-a, 20k-30k-Class-b etc. In your case, it will predict the Author which is nearest to the new Author in terms of the type of work. Using " Other as a Class" will only work when both the data and class are new. e.g. If the model sees the data is matching 80* with Author-A, it will predict Author-A with 0.8 confidence and you will have to accept it but in real-life the author is different but the model didn't have distinct data during training. "Other" can help if the data is for a new type of Author and model is not much confident for any of the Author. On a lighter note - My 3 years old kid was very confident in identifying a Kingfisher's image as a Parrot. This was his first interaction with Kingfisher.
