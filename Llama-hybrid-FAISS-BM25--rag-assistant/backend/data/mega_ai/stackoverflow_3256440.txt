There is a much simpler solution that doesn't use shaders: load the image as a texture, create a mipmap chain and read back the value of the last mipmap (1x1 pixel). This trick is used in games extensively to calculate, for example, the average brigthness of a scene (in order to apply HDR tonemapping). It's a great trick if you value simplicity and efficiency over accuracy.
