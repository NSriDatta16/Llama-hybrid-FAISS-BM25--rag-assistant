Miss a single tap randomly

I have the following code snippets - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; NSUInteger numberTaps = [touch tapCount]; // Tapping if (numberTaps > 0) { // do something } ... The above code basically detects a single tap on a small image (width = 18 and height = 36). It works 90% of the time detecting a single tap. But it sometime misses it (randomly). I have to tap several times before it picks up the single tap. What did I do wrong or miss so I could consistently detect the single tap 100%?
