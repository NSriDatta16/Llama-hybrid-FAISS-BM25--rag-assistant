Ajax submit makes a full post after first submit

The first submit works as expected, but the next time it's fully posted back. I'm using jQuery.form plugin, specifically the .ajaxSubmit(options) call to submit the form. There are a couple levels of wrapper div's, but I debug the button.click binds and I can't figure out why the second time, even with the same variables, it does a full post and my partial view is returned on a brand new page. here, buttonid and screenid are the same on both posts. I indicate this because they're calculated as per a naming convention like Outer (wrapper), (update target), and Form (form to be submitted) $('.formButton').click(function () { var buttonid = $(this).attr('id'); var screenid = $('#' + buttonid).closest('div:not(.CSRForm)').attr('id').replace('Outer', ''); //appends a hidden element so I know which button was pressed when posted $('#' + screenid + 'Form').append(' '); $('#' + screenid + 'Form').submit(); }); mind the .formButton elements are not inside the form, which is why I had to bind the submit event as such. My partial view only returns the form and not the buttons (they are dynamic) here is the .ajaxSubmit: $('.CSRForm').submit(function () { var needsValidation = "yes"; if (needsValidation) { $(this).ajaxSubmit({ target: '#AccountSetup', replaceTarget: false, success: StepCallWithForm //to check whether the response is valid for redirecting }); return false; } }); and my MVC action if it's relevant: public ActionResult AccountSetup(AccountSetupViewModel vm, string submitButton) { if (!ModelState.IsValid) { return PartialView(vm); } else { return Content(submitButton + ",AccountSetup"); } } Edit: After inserting this line immediately inside my $(function() { : $('#AccountSetup').ajaxForm(); I was able to stop the full postback. In Firebug, now I see ajax postback to /CSR/Home/CSR? which is where all this stuff is to begin with. It's like the form lost its action property. Are my events somehow crossfiring?
