Order statistics and Poisson process

Let $N(t)$ be $PP(Î»)$ .Given that $N(t)=n$ , compute the probability of a) Last event before $t$ occurs before $3t/4$ . b) First event after $t$ occurs after $t+h$ , $0 . c) $S_1 , $S_3$ >4 for $t=10, n=3$ . I know I should use order statistics to compute these probabilities. But cannot figure out how. a) $P(S_{N(t)} $={P(S_{N(t)} $=P(S_{N(t)} b) $P(S_{1}>h|N(t)=n)$ c) $P(S_{1} 4|N(10)=3)$ Also, any good resource with many solved examples on Poisson processes and Continuous time Markov Chains will be highly appreciated.
