Reporting Services 2000 - email different report to many people

Reporting Services 2000 Standard Edition (currently RTM but hope to have SP2 soon). I have a report which takes in a parameter - PlantID I'd like to email a pdf of this report every month to the 80 different plant managers So I have a table: PlantID ManagerEmail 1 BillySmith@company.com 2 FredJones@asdf.com 3 JohnLonestar@rrr.com I can currently setup a subscription to email a report to multiple users each month (which uses the SQL agent). However I want to specify the input parameter of the report (PlantID) to the recipient of the email (ManagerEmail). Ideas on how to do this? My current thought is to build a C# app which calls the URL of the RS with the correct input parameter in it. Then gets the pdf back, then emails from C#. Many thanks
