State-of-the-art LSTM solutions to known datasets

I've seen that many ML datasets have competitions (like imageNet). I've been looking for some kind of competition or state-of-the-art LSTM solutions for The Airline Passengers dataset but all I can find are really bad solutions (like next month will be like the current month) with some handwavy arguments that one could obtain a good solution if one tweaked the parameters. The best ensemble LSTM solution I've found is Taming the Chaos in Neural Network Time Series Predictions , but I'm looking for a single LSTM solution. So my question is, what are the known state-of-the-art LSTM solutions (maybe a timeline of them if there is any) and if there are none, how come? Looking at the data it seems like a simple problem to solve. Are there any other well known time series forecasting datasets that one benchmarks LSTM solutions against?
