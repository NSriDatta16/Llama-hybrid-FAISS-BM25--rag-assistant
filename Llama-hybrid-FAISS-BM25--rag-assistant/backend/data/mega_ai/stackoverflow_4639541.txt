Over a million mobile developers use Sencha . It leverages HTML5 and CSS3 and allows you to build amazing mobile applications without worrying a bunch of things you would otherwise do. It has layouts and a pile of widgets. The productivity is pretty high. Update: Sencha is dual-licensed meaning that if you develop commercial software, you need to pay their fee. If you develop an open source application, Sencha is completely free! See their licensing: http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/license.php
