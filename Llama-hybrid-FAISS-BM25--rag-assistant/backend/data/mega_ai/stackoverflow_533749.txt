C#: How do you handle/parse messages for your applications like drag and dropping an associated file type? Let's say I have a text document application and I want it to execute and open a file if, 1.) a .txt document is dragged on top of the exe. How could I make that possible, to execute the text software, and two, finally open and display the text document in the text document software?
