Stop touch event during touch move

In my game, when time is up, I want to display another view and stop the interaction on the others currently used before the time stopped. But when the other view is coming, if I let my finger on the screen, I can stil drag into the view behind the new view and continue the game.... That's not the purpose. I want to lose the focus of the finger, or cancel the finger... I tried to set userInteraction to NO.. but not working. Can somebody knows how to solve this issue? The quickFix is to setup a shared variable and test it in the touchBegan and TouchMoved event.. but that's not proper :) Thank a lot!
