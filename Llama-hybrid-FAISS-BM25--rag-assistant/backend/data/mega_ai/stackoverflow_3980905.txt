No, there's no way to control the browser scrolling through the window generically via a URL unless the web page itself supports it. The most common way to support it is the anchor tags , to which you can the link directly in the form of http://your-server/your/url.html#tag_name . The HTML page in question would then define the scroll point by declarintg the anchor via . As per robertc's comment, modern browsers also support using element IDs as tag names in this manner - but again, you need the target HTML document to have an element with an ID placed in the desired scroll point. It works on my FireFox 3.6.10 - to test on your browser, go to Link to site with scroll (included) and see if it scrolls down to the start of the answers. You could also approach this by building a browser extension (e.g. FireFox Add-On) which would allow scrolling down upon a link for any web page, but this would then only work for users who have that specific browser with that specific extension installed .
