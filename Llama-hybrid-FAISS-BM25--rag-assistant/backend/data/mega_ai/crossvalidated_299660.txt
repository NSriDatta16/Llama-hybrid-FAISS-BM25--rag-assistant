Comparing the Widths of two Posterior Distributions

I have a question regarding the task of my term paper case study, which is about Bayesian multilevel modelling and I would greatly appreciate it, if you could help me out. The exact assignment reads as follows: Estimate Bayesian random-intercept-random-slope hierarchical models using an R package and a sampling engine of your choice (BUGS, JAGS or Stan) based on simulated or empirical multilevel data Do sensitivity analysis using different priors Re-estimate your model ignoring the multilevel structure, and compare the widths of the posterior predictive distributions of y based on the simple and the hierarchical model So I did just what it says, I fitted one multilevel model with the lmer function from the lme4 package (on a suitable real life dataset) and one with Jags, giving very similiar results. I then fitted a third model complete pooling model with Jags, which ignores the multilevel structure. However, I do not quite understand what is meant by "compare the widths of the posterior distribution". For me it would make sense to conduct a performance analysis of the two models that were fitted with Jags. So ideally one would show that explicitly modelling the multilevel structure of the data, would significantly improve the explanatory or predictive power of our model. However, I do not understand how measuring the width (=range) of the resulting posterior distribution would be a meaningful way of measuring the quality of our model. Do you have an idea what the intention behind comparing the widths of the posterior distributions would be? Of course, the best person to ask would be my supervisor, but he is unfortunately unavailabe for some time and there is no way to ask him before the submission deadline. In advance, Thank you very much for your thoughts!
