Creating a representative sample

I'd like to create a representative sample from a larger population for monitoring (a hold-out control). I've thought of three approaches and am trying to select between them (plus I'm open to others): Simply to take a random sample. Perform a distribution test on the sample and reject/repeat if it is too different Produce many samples and score them all based on how similar the distributions are. Go with the closest For example the population's average spend is ~\$60, it's not normally distributed but for simplicity I'll say the SD is ~\$100. If I take a sample of 100 people then most of the time I'll have the mean of the sample between \$54 and \$66. If the sample's mean is say \$54 or less then I'm worried it's just a bit too different to the population. I can solve that by picking a bigger sample. 1000 people would make it $\pm 2$ rather than $\pm 6$ , but it also means I'm holding 1000 people out and people generally don't like to be part of the hold-out control. Can I instead solve it by calculating the sample's basic stats, rejecting and rerolling the sample if it fails? Or will this introduce other problems?
