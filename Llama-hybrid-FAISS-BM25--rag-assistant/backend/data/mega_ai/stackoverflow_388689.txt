"Write like crazy and just hope it works out for the best?", I've seen a project like this which was developed and maintained by just 2 developers, a huge application with lots of javascript code. On top of that there were different shortcuts for every possible jquery function you can think of. I suggested they organize the code as plugins, as that is the jquery equivalent of class, module, namespace... and the whole universe. But things got much worse, now they started writing plugins replacing every combination of 3 lines of code used in the project. Personaly I think jQuery is the devil and it shouldn't be used on projects with lots of javascript because it encourages you to be lazy and not think of organizing code in any way. I'd rather read 100 lines of javascript than one line with 40 chained jQuery functions (I'm not kidding). Contrary to popular belief it's very easy to organize javascript code in equivalents to namespaces and classes. That's what YUI and Dojo do. You can easily roll your own if you like. I find YUI's approach much better and efficient. But you usualy need a nice editor with support for snippets to compensate for YUI naming conventions if you want to write anything useful.
