Hypothesis testing

I was given this problem as homework and am confused on how to approach it We want to know if a chemistry students gender is a statistically significant factor in predicting the average chemistry test score. The list below gives test scores by gender. These scores were taken from as a simple random sample from the population of all chemistry students female: 59 77 95 98 82 83 male: 56 77 78 79 79 66 88 89 90 90 Do a hypothesis test to decide if the gender of the chemistry student is statistically significant for performance on a chem test. (alpha = 0.05)
