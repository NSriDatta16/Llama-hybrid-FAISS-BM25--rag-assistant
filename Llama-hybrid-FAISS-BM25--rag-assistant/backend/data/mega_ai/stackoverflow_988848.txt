Predicting that the program will crash

I've been using Google Chrome for a while now and I noticed that it features very elegant crash control. Just before crashing, google chrome gave a message saying " Woah! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now? ". And right after, I'd get a standard Windows XP "This program has encountered a problem and needs to close." with the "Debug", "Don't send" and "Send Error Report" buttons. My question is how can you program your compiled application to detect a crash condition in advance? If you have knowledge of how to do it in any programming language / platform would be great. Thanks
