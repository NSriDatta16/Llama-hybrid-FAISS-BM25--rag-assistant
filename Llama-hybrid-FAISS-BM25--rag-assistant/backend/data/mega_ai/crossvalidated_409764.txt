If you use demean approach (which is theoretically right), then you have to do demean your data both cross sectionally and time series (irrespective of the order). See how it is works. Assume following regression model: $$y_{it} = u_i + \nu_t + \beta X_{it} + e_{it} \,\,\,\,\, i = 1, 2, \dots, n \,\,\,\,\, T = 1, 2, \dots, t \tag{1}$$ First demean cross sectionally. Mean equation is $$\bar{y_i} = u_i + \bar{v} + \beta \bar{X_i} + \bar{e_i}\,\,\,\,\, i = 1, \dots, n \tag{2}$$ (notice, the $\bar{v}$ will be same for each cross sectional) Subtracting (1) - (2) $$y_{it} - \bar{y_i} = \nu_t - \bar{v} + \beta (X_{it} - \bar{X_i}) + (e_{it} - \bar{e_i}) \tag{3}$$ (see there is no fixed effect in equation 3) Now, take mean of equation 1 for each $t$ , and the mean equation is, $$\bar{y}_t = \bar{u} + \nu_t + \beta \bar{X_t} + \bar{e_t} \,\,\,\,\, T = 1, 2, \dots, t\tag{4}$$ Now, subtract equation 4 from equation 3, we get: $$y_{it} - \bar{y_i} - \bar{y_t} = \beta (X_{it} - \bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_t) -(\bar{v} + \bar{u}) + (e_{it} - \bar{e_i} - \bar{e_t}) \tag{5}$$ In this way, there is no fixed effects and time effects in equation 5.
