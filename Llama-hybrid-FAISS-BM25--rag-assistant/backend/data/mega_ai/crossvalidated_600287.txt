Detecting anomalies in repeating symbolic sequence

I have converted a time series to a symbolic sequence and want to use machine learning to detect anomalies. In this specific case, every time series represents the same process. So a similar, but not exactly the same pattern is repeated again and again as long as the system is in its non-anomalous state. So something like abacab abacab ababcab abacabc Sequences in an anomalous state are supposed to deviate stronger. The strength of deviation should be expressed in the output of the anomaly detector. Im struggling to find a comparable problem in literature. With what type of method is this typically solved? Can someone point me to a paper?
