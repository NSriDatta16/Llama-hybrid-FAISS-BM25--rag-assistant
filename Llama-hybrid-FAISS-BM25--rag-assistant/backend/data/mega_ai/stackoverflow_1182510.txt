Adding the library path isn't sufficient. That just ensures that whenever you tell it to link to a library, it will search for that library in the specified path as well as all the default paths. So you also need to actually tell the compiler to link to the library, with the flag -lboost_system-mt On Windows, Boost supports autolinking by default -- that is, if you just include the correct headers, it will attempt to link to the actual libraries as well (through use of a MSVC #pragma). On other platforms, you have to manually link to the library.
