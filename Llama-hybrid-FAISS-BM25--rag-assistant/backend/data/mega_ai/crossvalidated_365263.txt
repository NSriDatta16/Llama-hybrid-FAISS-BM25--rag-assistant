Bayesian Statistics. Please help me to find an example where posterior variance is greater than prior variance

Suppose we observe y successes in n trials where the probability of success in each trial is θ. If we choose a Beta(1, 1) (Uniform) prior then the posterior variance will be smaller than the prior variance. Show that the above isn’t necessarily the case if we choose a general Beta(a, b) prior. That is, find set of values for a, b, n, y where the above is not true. I have tried many random examples and still have yet found a case where posterior variance is greater than prior variance. Please help me to find a better direction.
