If you assume that the rate itself is a Gamma variable, you can easily update its distribution by Bayesian updating (The conjugate prior for a Poisson distribution is a Gamma distribution). If you use this approach, you'll have to define the event Busy in terms of the Poisson parameter (e.g. $P(\text{Busy}) = P(\lambda > c)$, where $\lambda$ is the rate and $c$ is a cutoff value).
