Is it possible to convert 3D image to 1D vector?

I use the following code to read images: from PIL import Image import numpy as np def load_image(file): img = Image.open(file) img.load() data = np.asarray(img, dtype="int32") return data data_3d = load_image('cat.jpg') data_1d = data.reshape(-1) As you can see, I read an image and transform it from 3D to 1D so that it becomes a single row in my dataset, followed by my manual labeling. I understand that convolutional neural network is made to handle imaging efficiently, but I want to create this dataset and apply classification using fully connected neural network . My question is, is such transformation from 3D to 1D valid in this case?
