I would have commented on RBerteig's post, but I apparently don't have enough reputation yet to be able to do so. In working on bringing LuaRPC up to speed with Lua 5.1.x AND making it work with embedded targets, I've been modifying the ldump.c and lundump.c sources to make them both a bit more flexible. The embedded Lua project (eLua) already had some of the patches you can find on the Lua list, but I've added a bit more to make lundump a little more friendly to scripts compiled on different architectures. There's also cross-compilation support provided so that you can build for targets differing from the host system (see luac.c in the same directory as the links below). If you're interested in checking out the modifications, you can find them in the eLua source repository: http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/elua/trunk/src/lua/lundump.c http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/elua/trunk/src/lua/lundump.h http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/elua/trunk/src/lua/ldump.c Standard Disclaimer: I make no claim that the modifications are perfect or work in every situation. If you use it and find anything broken, I'd be glad to hear about it so that it can be fixed.
