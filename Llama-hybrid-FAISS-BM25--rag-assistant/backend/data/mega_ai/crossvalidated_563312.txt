Logistic regression is basically a neural network with one layer. So you can equivalently ask, why do people use networks with 12 layers and not 24 layers ? or why do people use 5-th order polynomials for curve fitting and not 10-th order ? The question of how to choose to right model for your data is very broad. But in general, a model with more parameters is not necessarily better, and in many cases will be worse (think over-fitting). This is why for example convolutional networks work better for image data then fully-connected networks. It all depends on what type of data you have.
