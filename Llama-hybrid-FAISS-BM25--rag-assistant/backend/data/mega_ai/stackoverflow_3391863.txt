You missed the closing ' " ' (double quote) at the end of the last print's string (before semicolon). Should be: print FILEHANDLE "my \$ua = new LWP::UserAgent(agent => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5')"; ... Firefox/1.5.0.5')"; # To show end of that line without scrolling Also, couple of minor notes: Please consider using 3-argument form of open() , not 2-argument; as well as lexical filehandles: open(my $fh, '>', "out.txt") or die "Error opening for writing: $!"; print $fh "stuff\n"; You don't have a close() of the filehandle at the end - I assume just because you gave incomplete code.
