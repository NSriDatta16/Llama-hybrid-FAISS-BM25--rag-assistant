OK here's a better answer: for reasons I don't understand, when you load a fragment (or a whole page; whatever) with jQuery using the special "selector" trick to pluck out just a portion of the document: var showThisContent = this.id; $('#content').load('test-load-' + showThisContent + '.html #content-area'); the jQuery library strips out the scripts completely from the content, and doesn't ever run them. Why? I don't know. I know that you probably don't trust me anymore, but here's what I did with your source code: I took that second file (test-load-two) and stripped out the head and stuff; basically I made it a fragment containing only the "content-area". (I also got rid of the script tag that loads jquery, as you don't really need that since the outer page already has it.) Then I changed the main page (test-load) so that when it calls "load" it just passes in the URL without that '#content-area' selector. That works. [edit] I just posted a question to the jQuery forum: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/the-load-function-and-script-blocks
