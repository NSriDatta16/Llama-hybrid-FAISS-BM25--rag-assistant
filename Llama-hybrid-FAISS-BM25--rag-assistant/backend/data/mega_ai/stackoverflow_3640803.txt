You guys are all doing it wrong!! It's coming fromt he DB so this is how i do it: SELECT SUBSTR(description, 1, INSTR(description, ' ') -1); Why make it overtly difficult w/ programming languages??? Demo!! CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE foo (description text); INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('This is a really long paragraph. OK, not really ;-)'); SELECT SUBSTRING(description, 1, INSTR(description, ' ') - 1) AS description FROM foo; // Output: This is a really long paragraph.
