The "stand alone" EfctvEndDate index, while being functionally available in the other index, will be much smaller, and hence more efficient (with regards to number of reads required, to its ability to be cached, remain in the cache etc. etc.). This of course depends much on the usage patterns etc. but yes, in general, it is very plausible that having multiple, apparently redundant indexes be a sensitive approach. The drawbacks of index "duplication" are mainly (and probably in order of bigger to smaller impact): INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries on the underlying table, incur a performance overhead to maintain the extra index(es). competition for cache usage [very slightly] longer time to produce query plans. storage overhead (typically a non-issue; does increase backup times, however...). One must therefore estimate if the improved performance with SELECT queries which can potentially benefit from the extra index(es) offset the drawback listed above. Database performance tuning is typically a case-by-case exercise...
