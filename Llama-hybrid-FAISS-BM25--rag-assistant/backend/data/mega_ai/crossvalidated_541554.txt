Help in Understanding num.trees, mtry, and nodsize in Random forest?

I am currently creating a random forest quantile regression model in R and I am looking to have a deeper understanding on of num.trees, mtry, and nodsize. I want to understand how increasing or decreasing these values can affect a model. For example, does increasing mtry overfit a model? I am creating a grid search and looking to leverage dynamic parameters to train the ideal model
