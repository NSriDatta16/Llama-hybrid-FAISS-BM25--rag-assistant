From my point of view, exceptions are or should only be visible in development mode. Production mode should not display exceptions to the user/client, but a simple page showing that "An problem was encountered" or something similar. Those exceptions should be logged at best. The bottom line is that they are mostly useful for debugging or when necessary to control the execution flow (when they are expected). You could simply throw Zend_Exception all the way, but that would only make your exception too generic and would be difficult to find the cause in try..catch I usually create ghost files -- as you call them -- mostly on the "package" level or when a method is expected to throw an exception or another (so I can catch that very particular exception and treat it consequently). You may end up with many ghost files but it will only make your project more organized and easy to debug in the end. And since those exceptions are only loaded in a need-to basis, having lots of them doesn't impact on performance.
