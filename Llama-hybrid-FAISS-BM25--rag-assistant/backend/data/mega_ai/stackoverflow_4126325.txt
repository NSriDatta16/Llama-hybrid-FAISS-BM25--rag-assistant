Dynamically building xml tree's during runtime using linq

This is a design question, to whet the guru's appetite. In a previous version, the code was using a path definition, i.e. /../../ to provide instructions on how to build artbitary xml documents. The documents had to be correct according to xml schema, so the path's were essentially xpaths, being read and used in switch statements to call code to construct the doc. But don't get hung up on it. For example the call when read in and coded jim.set("/Alert/Source/DetectTime", "12:03:2010 12:22:21"); would create 12:03:2010 12:22:21 The jim.set just stores the tree in a particular context. Now I'd like to use linq to xsd, to create the xml tree, but i'm still looking for some contruct that will enable a user to define how the tree will be constructed. XPath's are easy, but kinda bulky to implement, not elegant and I don't easy mapping. Any ideas, any programs, open source, research, anything would be apreciated. If I don't get an answer I'll offer a decent bounty in 3 days. Bob.
