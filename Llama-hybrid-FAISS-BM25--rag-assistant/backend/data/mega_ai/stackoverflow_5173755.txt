Silverlight RIA Services - reference namespace from server side project in client side

I wasn't sure how to title this question. I'm creating an RIA Services driven Silverlight 4 application. I started out with a Silverlight Navigation Application . I'd like to be able to add a namespace from the server side project in my solution into a XAML file in the client project of the solution. When you create a Silverlight Business Application , the 'connection' is made between the two projects when the solution is created that will allow you to do what I explained in the previous paragraph. Is there a way to modify my Silverlight Navigation Application so that I can add a namespace from the server side project in my solution into a XAML file in the client project?
