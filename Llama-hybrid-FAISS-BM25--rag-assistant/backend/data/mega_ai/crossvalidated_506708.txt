Do I use Factor Analysis or PCA to answer How much variance in $Y$ is explained by $X_1,\dots,X_p$?

I am terribly confused by all the technical answers out there on this question. Suppose I have conducted a survey with the variables age, income, gender, education level, and home purchase price. The question that I'd like answered is "How much variance in home purchase price is explained by age? By income? By gender? By education level?" What methodology should I use to get this kind of output?
