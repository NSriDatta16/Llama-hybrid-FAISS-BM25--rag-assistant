Can a variable become statistically significant after the addition of another variable?

I am doing forward stepwise logistic regression. I have heard that its common for a previously statistically significant variable to become not statistically significant when one or more variables are introduced into the model. However, I have never heard of the opposite. This is my case right now. The first variable in my model was $x_1$ (by lowest p-value), the second variable introduced was $x_2$. What's interesting is that $x_2$ is not statistically significant when it is modelled with Y alone. I am using R to do this though, I think this more of statistics question.
