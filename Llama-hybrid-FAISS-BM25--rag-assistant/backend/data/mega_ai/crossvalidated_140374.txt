Its a very big & open question on which metrics are best to use to access classifier performance. This paper did a great job comparing them: Caruana, Rich, and Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil. "Data mining in metric space: an empirical analysis of supervised learning performance criteria." Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining. ACM, 2004. They actually concluded that AUC is one of the best metrics to use - however, its far from foolproof since some methods do better with one metric than another. For example, I'd suspect SVM & RF will do very well with AUC, but GLM might do much better with a probability-based metric such as cross-entropy. tl;dr: no one will criticize you for using AUC, but know that this metric will still be biased towards some methods over others since there is no 'perfect' metric.
