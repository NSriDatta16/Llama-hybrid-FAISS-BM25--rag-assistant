I had the same problem yesterday. I wanted to code a trigger that fired on every field except one, the table had 103 colums. First I coded: if (:OLD.col1<>:NEW.col1 or :OLD.col2<>:NEW.col2 or :OLD.col3<>:NEW.col3 ....) But I had some problems with null values, so I added: if (NVL(:OLD.col1,0)<>NVL(:NEW.col1,0) or NVL(:OLD.col2,0)<>NVL(:NEW.col2,0) ....) But then I had some problems with DATE columns, it became a mess.. I think that the best solution is to list all columns that you want to verify in the "OF": AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE of cOL1, col2, col3 ... colN ON table1 It was not "elegant" but... it worked perfect.
