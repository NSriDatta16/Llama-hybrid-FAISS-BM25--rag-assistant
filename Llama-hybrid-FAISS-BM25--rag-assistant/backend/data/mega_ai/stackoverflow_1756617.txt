I think that you forgot to add [super] calls to touchesBegan/touchesEnded/touchesMoved. Methods like (BOOL)beginTrackingWithTouch:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event (BOOL)continueTrackingWithTouch:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event aren't working if you overriding touchesBegan / touchesEnded like this : - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touches Began"); } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touches Moved"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touches Ended"); } But! All works fine if methods will be like : - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"Touches Began"); } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"Touches Moved"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"Touches Ended"); }
