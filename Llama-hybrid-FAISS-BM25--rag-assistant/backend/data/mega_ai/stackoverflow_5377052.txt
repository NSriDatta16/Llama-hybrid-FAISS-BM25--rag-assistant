drawLine problem with Paint.StrokeWidth = 1 in Android

I think I hit a nasty bug. The problem is that nearly horizontal lines with a slight gradient and using a Paint with StrokeWidth = 1 are not plotted, for example: public class MyControl extends View { public MyControl(Context context) { super(context); // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub } @Override protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) { super.onDraw(canvas); Paint pen = new Paint(); pen.setColor(Color.RED); pen.setStrokeWidth(1); pen.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE); canvas.drawLine(100, 100, 200, 90, pen); //not painted canvas.drawLine(100, 100, 200, 100, pen); canvas.drawLine(100, 100, 200, 110, pen); //not painted canvas.drawLine(100, 100, 200, 120, pen); //not painted canvas.drawLine(100, 100, 200, 130, pen); pen.Color = Color.MAGENTA; pen.setStrokeWidth(2); canvas.drawLine(100, 200, 200, 190, pen); canvas.drawLine(100, 200, 200, 200, pen); canvas.drawLine(100, 200, 200, 210, pen); canvas.drawLine(100, 200, 200, 220, pen); canvas.drawLine(100, 200, 200, 230, pen); } } And using MyControl class this way: public class prova extends Activity { /** Called when the activity is first created. */ @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); MyControl ctrl = new MyControl(this); setContentView(ctrl); } } Setting StrokeWidth to 0 or > 1 all lines are plotted. Can anyone bring some light on this or should I submit this issue as an Android Issue ? Thanks in advance!
