Unfortunately your question is similar to people asking how do you block spam. There's no fixed answer, and it won't stop someone/bot which is persistent. However, here are some methods that can be implemented: Check User-Agent (this could be spoofed though) Use robots.txt (proper bots will - hopefully respect this) Detect IP addresses that access a lot of pages too consistently (every "x" seconds). Manually, or create flags in your system to check who all are going on your site and block certain routes the scrapers take. Don't use a standard template on your site, and create generic css classes - and don't put in HTML comments in your code.
