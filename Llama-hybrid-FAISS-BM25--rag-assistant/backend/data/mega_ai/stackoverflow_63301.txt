I think that depends on how the generated code will be used. If the code is not meant to be read by humans, i.e. it's regenerated whenever something changes, I don't think it has to be readable. However, if you are using code generation as an intermediate step in "normal" programming, the generated could should have the same readability as the rest of your source code. In fact, making the generated code "unreadable" can be an advantage, because it will discourage people from "hacking" generated code, and rather implement their changes in the code-generator insteadâ€”which is very useful whenever you need to regenerate the code for whatever reason and not lose the changes your colleague did because he thought the generated code was "finished".
