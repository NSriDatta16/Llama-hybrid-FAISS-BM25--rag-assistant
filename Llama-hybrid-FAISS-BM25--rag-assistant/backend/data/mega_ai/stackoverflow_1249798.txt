How can I grep for a text pattern in a zipped text file?

Our daily feed file averages 2 GB in size. These files get archived to a single zip file at the end of each month and stored in a network share. From time to time, I have a need to search for certain records in those files. I do this by connecting by remote desktop to the shared server, unzip the files to a temp folder, run grep (or PowerShell) search, and then delete the temp folder. Now, because our server is running low in disk space, it is no longer recommeded to unzip them all to a temp folder. What is an efficient way to do a regex search on those zipped files with minimum impact on disk or network resources?
