Where to get good algorithm problem with solutions

I know some algorithm judge online system, but few of them have the solution attached. Most of the time after I deliever my own answer on those system, I can seen other people's solution have fewer memory usage and shorter CPU time cost which after refactories my code can not achieve. Is there any problem set have elegant solutions with them? I wanna to read the solution to find where to fill the gap. Thanks in advance!
