Understanding MVC pattern used in iOS apps

I have read Apple's MVC article and am confused about various things. Firstly Apple uses a combination of the View and the Controller in almost all its sample applications which is fine and I like it but they contradict themselves in this article because they said that View's should not rely on Controllers etc. My main question is does anyone have a link to one of Apple's sample iOS projects which is a good example of the MVC pattern - with data retrieval etc because I don't fully understand the Model part of the pattern. I don't understand the difference between a 'domain object' and a model object. For example if I wanted to retrieve a list of orders this would happen in a model class Orders. Would I then have another class Order which has properties such as OrderDate, OrderNumber etc or how would this work?
