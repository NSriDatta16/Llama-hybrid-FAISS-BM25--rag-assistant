In order to answer this I have to answer the whole question. While I could do this pen and paper, I'm instead going to use R to compute the necessary quantities. First, let's create a function for the log posterior. We'll need the optima and the hessian in order to make the approximation. log_posterior Now that we've optimized this, let's plot the log posterior and the approximation eta $value map par hess Cool, looks right. Because the logit function is monotonic increasing, we can compute the quantiles on the scale of eta and simple transform the quantiles. proba_interval Great, so we have an approximate 95% credible interval from this computation. The interval looks like $$ \hat{\theta} \pm 2 \sigma $$ The length of the interval is $$ L = (\hat{\theta} + 2\sigma) - (\hat{\theta} - 2\sigma) $$ so we can get the standard deviation (and eventually the variance) on the scale of theta by computing $$\sigma = \dfrac{L}{4}$$ L Ok, so $\sigma \approx 0.05$ which means the variance is approximately 0.0025. Now we know where we are going. We can use the Delta method to obtain an estimate of the variance on the scale of theta. The Delta method states $$ \operatorname{Var}(f(X)) \approx [f^\prime (\mu)]^2 \operatorname{Var}(X) $$ Here, $f$ is going to be the inverse logit function. The derivative of the logit function has a very special property that $f^\prime(x) = f(x)(1-f(x))$ so we can leverage that in order not to do any tedious differentiation. The computation of the asymptotic variance is then theta_map Which is very close to our original calculation using the quantiles from the normal approximation.
