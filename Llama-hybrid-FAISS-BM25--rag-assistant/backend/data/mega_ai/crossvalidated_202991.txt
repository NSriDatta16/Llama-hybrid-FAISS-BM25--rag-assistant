Can Control Variables also be included as Dependent Variables?

I'm currently reading an academic journal ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2488863 ) which, in Table 11 of the paper, lists several control variables including: Returns Size Leverage Growth And it runs regressions of say: Overinvestment = bo + b1returns + b2Size + b3Leverage... However, it also considers leverage as an dependent variable for one of these regressions: Leverage = b0 + b1returns + b2Size + ... Is this logical? I'm a student of econometrics and haven't seen this done before, but was wondering if this was a badly thought through approach, or (more likely) that i'm missing something.
