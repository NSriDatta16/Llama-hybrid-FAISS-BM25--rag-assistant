You could also do something like this: modify the app so on its first start it copies the images into the document folder load the images from the doc folder instead than from the bundle with a tool like iPhone Explorer you can then overwrite the files in the document folder it's a bit boring to find the actual app in the list that iPhone explorer gives you, but then it's just a matter of dragging and dropping the files into the right folder. It may work also with some file in the .app bundle, but I didn't found any suitable app to try it from there. Anyway if you want to keep the thing almost hassle free for your artist you may want to put everything in a Documents subfolder nonetheless :) EDIT I just tried to edit something into the .app folder and it worked OK, so you don't even have to change your code if you use iPhone Explorer to replace images. Just remember to disable the PNG optimization if you're using PNGs. Look here for the explanation (search for "PNGs:") good luck :)
