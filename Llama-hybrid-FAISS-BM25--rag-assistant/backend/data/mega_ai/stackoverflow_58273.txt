Robert Walker did a great job of describing how to send the request . You can read more about Mozilla's xmlhttprequest here . I would just add that the response would be found (using Robert's code) using xmlhttp.responseText ( Edit - i didn't read closely enough, thanks Robert ) You didn't indicate exactly what the data was, although you mentioned wanting to parse links from the data. You could the xmlhttp.responseText as an xml document, parse out the links, and place it into a menulist or whatever you like.
