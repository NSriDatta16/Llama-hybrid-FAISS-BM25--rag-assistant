What you're suggesting is similar to regression approach to time series. For instance, you can recast the AR(1) process as a simple regression: $$y_t=\beta_0+\phi_1y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$$ will become OLS problem: $$y_i=X_i\beta+\varepsilon_i$$ where the independent variable $y_i\equiv y_t$and design matrix has two columns for intercept and bona fide one regressor $x_{1i}=1,x_{2i}=y_{i-1}$ This can be made work under certain conditions. Assumptions of OLS are slightly different (relaxed), of course. Similarly, you could build the NN with one input which is the lagged dependent variable, which outputs the one step forecast. You'd have to call it repeatedly to produce the multi-step forecast. In this case your NN would basically degenerate into the glorified nonlinear regression $y_t=f(y_{t-1})+\varepsilon_t$
