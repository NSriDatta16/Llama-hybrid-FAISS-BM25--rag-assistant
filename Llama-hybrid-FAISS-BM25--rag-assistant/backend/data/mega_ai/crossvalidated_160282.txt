Just a thought: what if you converted the problem of "anomaly detection" to the problem of "normality detection"? That is, you train your model on anomalies and then try to apply it to all the data hoping that it'll be able to tell anomalies apart from normal data points. Not sure though if the features you have are descriptive enough for this ("time of failure" certainly doesn't seem good), but this is definitely something I'd try doing. You can start with One-Class SVM (available in sklearn ).
