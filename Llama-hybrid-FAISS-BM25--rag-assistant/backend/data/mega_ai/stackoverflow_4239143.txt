This question is incredibly long and superfluous for the actual problem, indicated by this line: ./organise.sh: line 8: perlStemmer.pl The Perl script you include is totally irrelevant, since it isn't even running . Start with one problem at a time and solve them in turn, so you don't get overwhelmed with other issues that cannot be solved yet. Your bash script cannot find perlStemmer.pl. This suggests you are not in the correct directory when you run the script, as (since you don't provide any path information), it will only look in the directories in $PATH for it. You might want to check for some error conditions before proceeding with the execution of the remainder of the bash script, as if the first part didn't work, you're just going to get garbage for the rest (as you are seeing). Incidentally, there are a few fundamental issues with your script that will prevent it from doing anything useful: my @triggers = ; while( ) #read each line into $_ This reads the entire contents of the file into @triggers , so this while loop will terminate immediately, as you are already at the filehandle's end of file. while($line ne "") You have only read one line into $line and don't read another, so this line will either loop forever or do nothing, depending on whether the first line of the content you pipe on stdin is an empty string (likely the former, since you haven't chomped a newline from it).
