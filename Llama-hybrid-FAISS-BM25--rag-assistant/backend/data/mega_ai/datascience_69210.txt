Generating text using NLP based on parameters

I want to generate some text based on the value of certain parameters. For instance, let's say I want to generate descriptions of video games. So, besides real descriptions as training data, I would like that the model takes in account the following parameters (for example) about the game: Violent: yes Multiplatform: yes Drugs: no So that if the game has drugs content, the output text has some phrase referring to it. Is this possible? If so, how could I do it in Python? I was going to use LSTM neural networks in Tensorflow.
