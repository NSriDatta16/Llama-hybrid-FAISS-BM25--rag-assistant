Good question! I guess your real question is: why do I get type-I errors when I use 2 million samples. If you ponder about it, your observation is really dependent only on $\alpha$ (size of the test). For $\alpha = 0.05$, if you sample your test statistic 100 times, you would be having type-I error 5 times on average. In your case, for 10 samples you observed a type-I error once, which is possible (with probability $10*0.95^9*0.05 = 0.315$). A more relevant experiment might be: import scipy.stats as stats np.random.seed(1000)#(seed) alpha = 0.05 n = 1000 count = 0 for i in range(n): X = np.random.normal(0,1,2000) Y = np.random.normal(0,1,2000) count += 1 if stats.ttest_ind(X,Y)[1] Output: .055 (inline with chosen $\alpha$)
