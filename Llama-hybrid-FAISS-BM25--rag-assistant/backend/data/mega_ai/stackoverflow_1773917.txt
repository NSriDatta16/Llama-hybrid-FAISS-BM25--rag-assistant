Some prefer running a lint-like tool for a given language to find common problems in the code and/or enforce coding style. However in a small and skilled team I prefer to allow every commit to go through and deal with possible problems during continuous integration and/or code review. Thanks to this commits are faster which encourages more frequent commits, leading to easier integration.
