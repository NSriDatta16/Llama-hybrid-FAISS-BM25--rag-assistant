Bayesian model - how to emphasize later observations?

I have a very general question, any links to relevant papers or which book I should consult should suffice. So, let's say I've got a Bayesian model (for example) to predict the outcome of a soccer game in the current season. I have some data for the current season (since not all games have been played), and then I have the data from the previous couple of seasons. Is there a method in Bayesian statistics whereby you would develop a model that provides more weight for the current season results compared to the results from the previous seasons? Appreciate the help!
