CustomValidator in a Repeater

I have a custom validator inside a repeater As a test, I tried the following code on an OnClick event foreach(RepeaterItem item in lstRepeater.Items) { CustomValidator cvValid= (CustomValidator)item.FindControl("cvValid"); cvValid.IsValid = false; } As would be assumed, the error message is not displayed on the page because I didn't databind the repeater. However, as soon as re-contruct the repeater and the datasource, I lose all the old values inside the repeater. Is there an easy way around this? I can't think of an elegant way of handling this problem.
