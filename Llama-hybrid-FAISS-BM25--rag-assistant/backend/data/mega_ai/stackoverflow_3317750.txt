Counting all other types but the current one

I'm trying to write this query, that would calculate the average value of all the columns except the one that contains the type value, which I'm grouping the whole query by. So for 4 types for example, each column in the resulting table will contain the average of all the other three type's values, i need to exclude the current type's rows. As an example, if I was to calculate each type's average value for itself, the query would look like: SELECT SUM(some value) / COUNT(TYPE) FROM TEMPTABLE GROUP BY TYPE Now I'm trying to calculate the other three's total average. Thanks.
