i guess you have a cascade specificity issue. ID-based selectors (starting with #) take precedence over Class-based selectors (starting with .) and both take precedence over Element-based selectors (just the elements' name, like p). and they sum up , which is interestign to note. let's say you have this markup: text text text. other text then #this-div{color:blue;} will override p.paragraph-class{color:red;} regardless of the order you put it in the css file. think like this: each #id-based-selector is worth 100 specificity and each .class-based selector is worth 10 and each element-based selector is worth 1. see http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificity for more details.
