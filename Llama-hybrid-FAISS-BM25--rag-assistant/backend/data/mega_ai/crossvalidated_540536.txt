This is a great question. I would say it starts with a deep study of existing statistics for other problems, including hypothesis tests, point estimates, and confidence intervals. For a given task, what makes one statistic preferable to another? In hypothesis testing we are interested in a most powerful test that maintains type I error control (the p-value is uniformly distributed under the null). For point estimation we often seek an estimator that is unbiased or perhaps median unbiased and has the smallest variance in this class. Confidence intervals can be thought of as the inversion of a hypothesis test, so we are interested in the shortest intervals that maintain their nominal coverage level. For a very new and challenging problem one can simply propose a new statistic that meets only some of these criteria. For instance, a hypothesis test where the p-value is uniformly distributed only asymptotically and power is acceptable. Later work will show the merits of the statistic relative to other proposals. Sometimes a method that is not exact or unbiased or most powerful is still preferable because of its ease of use and interpretation. By reading and understanding other's work you will develop a preference in approach and naturally see opportunities to improve their methods.
