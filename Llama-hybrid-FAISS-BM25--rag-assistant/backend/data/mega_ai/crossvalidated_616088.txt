Importance sampling for a parameterized family of distributions using a wide distribution from the same family

I'm motivated here by a problem for robust Bayesian analysis. Let $l(Y|X)$ be the likelihood and let $\{p_\xi(X)\}$ be a parameterized family of prior distributions where $\xi$ denotes the hyperparameters. For example, they could be Gaussian distributions where the hyperparameters are different choices for the mean and covariance. For some choice of $\xi$ the unnormalized posterior is $q(X|Y) = l(Y|X)\cdot p_\xi(X)$ . I want to see how the choice of $\xi$ affects the expectation $\mathbb{E}_q(f)$ for some function $f$ . Now, suppose I am able to reasonably sample from each posterior with MCMC. But, I can't hope to do this for all the choices of $\xi$ that I'm interested in. So, instead I want to estimate the expectation using importance sampling for my range of targets. There are a lot of schemes for doing this. I am wondering if something basic could work, like running MCMC using a prior from the same family that is wide and covers all the other priors I am looking at.
