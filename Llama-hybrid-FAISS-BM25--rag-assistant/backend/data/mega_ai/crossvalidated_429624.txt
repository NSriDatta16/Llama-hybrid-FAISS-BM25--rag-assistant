Welcome to CV. You have misunderstood the interpretation of the intercept. The intercept is the log odds (not the odds ratio) of the outcome when all the predictors are at 0 (not the marginal log odds, as you described). When the predictors are standardized, this corresponds to when all the raw predictors are at their mean. So, for an individual with average levels of each of the predictors, the intercept is the log odds of the outcome. This may not be an interpretable value because it might not make sense to think of an individual with average levels of all the predictors.
