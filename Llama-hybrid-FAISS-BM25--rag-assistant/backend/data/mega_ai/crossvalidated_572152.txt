Should I remove 0 values when calculating the average of many simulation runs?

Let's say I have a simulation model with stages A, B, C. I want to calculate the average time of each stage over 1000 runs as they contain stochastics. In many runs, either one of these stages may not be interacted with, and therefore, contain a time of 0, drastically lowering the mean of that stage. When calculating the average of a stage, should I include the 0 values that are present? To my knowledge, these 0's are technically null values and should not be included.
