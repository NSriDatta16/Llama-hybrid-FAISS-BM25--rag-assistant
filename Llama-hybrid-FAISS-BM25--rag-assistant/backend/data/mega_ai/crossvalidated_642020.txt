In that histogram you're examining the marginal distribution, which is not a useful strategy $-$ a GLM is a model for the conditional distribution which may be quite unlike the marginal (e.g. it may be that every conditional distribution is unimodal but the marginal is bimodal). This is a distressingly common error, perhaps one of the most common modelling errors of all. Calculations like the skewness and kurtosis (per your plot) will presumably also be of marginal distributions and so likely highly misleading. If your abundances are based on counts perhaps the most obvious generalized linear model would relate to logistic regression (once you convert proportions back to counts so you don't screw up the relative variances), though you might run into issues of (semi-)complete separation. However, by the sound of it you may want a random effect in there (i.e. a GLMM instead), or perhaps some quasi binomial might suffice to model heterogeneity in a very basic way if that doesn't seem suitable. If your abundances are some form of continuous variable (i.e. not originating from ratios of integers, for example), then I'd probably look at 0-1 inflated beta regression (also likely with logit link). Again, possibly with a random effect, perhaps. However, again, issues of differing relative variances arising from different sample sizes might suggest using gamma GLMs for the raw abundances rather than scaling them to a fraction and losing the sample size information (though you could use a weighted beta regression to account for sample size).
