Have you considered an indexed view? Its result set is materialized and persists in storage so that the overhead of the lookup is separated from the rest of whatever you're trying to do. SQL Server takes care of automagically updating the view when there is a data change which in its opinion would change the contents of the view, so in this respect it's less flexible than Oracle materialized.
