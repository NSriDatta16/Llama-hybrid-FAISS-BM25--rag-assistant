Targeted information extraction / focused extractive summarization

I have a large collection of project manuals, each with a large number of pages. Each manual contains some form of summary paragraphs, although these are not necessarily similar in structure or format from one to the next. The rest of the manual generally contains a large amount of various information in relation to the project, and is not always relevant to the desired content to be extracted and summarized. In theory- paragraph 1 - Project Summary (Extract this) paragraph 2 - Background info (ignore) paragraph 3 - Background info (ignore) paragraph 4 - Background info (ignore) paragraph 5 - Project Requirements (extract this) Is it possible to somehow selectively target paragraphs/ sentences within a document for extractive summarization, and if so, is possible to train a model with datasets containing full texts and their desired summarizations? So far, I have tried general extractive summarization methods utilizing TF-IDF. However, due to the substantial amount of extraneous information within the document, critical text within the summary paragraphs is usually ignored. I've considered manually increasing word counts across various keywords, but I think this will still ignore relevant sentences and phrase within close proximity (same worry with binary classification of desired paragraphs/ sentences). Can this be done, and is there a better approach than what I've been trying so far?
