How to interpret ACF and PCAF graph

I want to predict the future data given the time series data with SARIMA model. In order to determine (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q, m), I plotted the ACF and PACF. The ACF graph shows that there is a seasonality of 24 intervals, so I set the m as 24. However, I don't know how to set, p, d, q, and P, D, Q. In other example, ACF graph usually degrades exponentialy, so they set p and q as 1 or 2. But my ACF graph has cycles, so I am confused about how to set p and q. Could you help me?
