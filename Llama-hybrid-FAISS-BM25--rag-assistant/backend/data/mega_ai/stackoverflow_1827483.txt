jquery.validate plugin - how to trim values before form validation

I'm using the excellent jquery.validation plugin by JÃ¶rn Zaefferer and I was wondering whether there's a easy way to automatically trim form elements before they are validated? The following is a cut down but working example of a form which validates a email address: $().ready(function() { $("#commentForm").validate({ rules: { email: { required: true, email: true } } }); }); E-Mail: The problem is that some users are getting confused because they accidently enter some whitespace in their email address, e.g. "test@test.com ". And the form won't submit and has a error message: "Please enter a valid email address.". Non-techy users don't know how to spot whitespace and may just quit the site rather than try to work out what they've done wrong. Anyway, I was hoping I could chain " jQuery.trim(value) " before the validation so the whitespace is removed and the validation error never occurs? I could use addMethod to build my own email validation function. But I'm sure there's a more elegant solution?
