If you do the math, you get in average 100 MB of ram for each machine. This is not much. The overhead for a VM is pretty big, having to run a complete OS in each instance. Either you use some really small footprint os ( http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/ ?) and spend time to strip it down even more or you get bigger machines. Machines being that cheap, I'd tend to upgrade to a 64bit OS with plenty of ram.
