Offline Dropbox & Sync Ideas

Is there any way to use Dropbox to sync selected local files? I like the idea of being able to switch some Dropbox folders to local. Because here, in Australia we still have data limits. The scenario is that I need to sync Dropbox files on my iMac with my Macbook with only selected files syncing online (for client access). Because I work with a project code hierarchy, it's easier if all files (online & local) are in one folder. I usually just colour the completed jobs and archive by year. I've tried Symbolic Links, but Dropbox just creates a copy. No idea how to implement Rsync, and I'm not sure what Git will involve. So just a note: I'm not all that savvy. For now, all I need is to be able to effortlessly drag and drop files and let Dropbox do its thing when I turn Macbook on. The more I sync the better, because I forget things. For later, I'm thinking of ways to fully sync my future Macbook Pro and iMac. I already sync BusyCal, Address Book, Billings etc., but there are a few flaws. Not happy with ChronoSync either. So... any thoughts on this one? Thanks!
