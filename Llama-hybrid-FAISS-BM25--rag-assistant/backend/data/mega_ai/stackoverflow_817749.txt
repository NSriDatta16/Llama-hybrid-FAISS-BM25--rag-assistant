Cloud HUGE data storage options?

Does anyone have a good suggestion on how to do video recording? We have a camera that can record and then stream live video to a server. So this means we can have 1000's of cameras sending data 24X7 for recording. We will store data for over 7 / 14 / 30 days depending on the package. Per day if a camera is sending data to the server then it will store 1.5GB. So that means there is a traffic of 1.5GB / day / camera Total monthly 45GB / month / camera (Data + bandwidth for one camera) Please let me know the most cost effective way to get this data stored? Thanks!
