bundle product shows price as 0

I've been reading a lot about this problem but I get nothing that suggests a way out. I am working with version 1.3.2.4 and after creating a bundle product , Magento displays it as price as zero, but gives the "current composition" as the correct value. alt text http://www.balexandre.com/temp/2009-10-13_2158.png I already tried to refresh the cache, rebuild the catalog index, and nothing works... Then I went deep and navigated into the price.phtml template under template/bundle/catalog/product/view/ and tried to invoke the same method that is showing correctly the value, bu that as well, return zero. I did notice that Magento has this javascript method bundle.reloadPrice(); right after and if invoked I do get the correct price... I can try, using jQuery (or Prototype as Magento uses by default) change the value, but I was trying to this right... Any other ideas?
