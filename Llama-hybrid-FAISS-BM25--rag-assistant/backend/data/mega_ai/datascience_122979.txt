Advice on how to approach a recommendation model for marketing

I am working on a project to provide recommendations to the marketing team to launch effective campaigns. The dataset I have has data on existing customers, their demographic and billing details as well as tenure, plan and existing products that they have subscribed to. The task is to increase adoption on one of the particular products - PROD_B. Can someone help me understand the approach? I understand that I need to build a model to predict probability of buying the product and then sort it in descending order to get the most likeliest customer, most likely using content-based filtering approach. Can someone advise me on how I can approach this problem and any other methods that might work? Following is the data dictionary: Feature Definition CUSTOMER_NO ID of a customer DEVICE Type of Device CITY City of the customer STATE State of the customer TENURE Tenure PRICE Price PROD_A Boolean value indicating if the customer has product A PROD_B Boolean value indicating if the customer has product B PROD_C Boolean value indicating if the customer has product C PROD_D Boolean value indicating if the customer has product D PROD_E Boolean value indicating if the customer has product E SEGMENT Name of segment LOCALITY Name of locality BILLING_6_MONTHS Average billing amount for last 6 months Its not the exhaustive list, but other features are similar to the ones above.
