Kevin, You need to have a responder(s) in your viewcontroller that is linked to all the button(s) on the viewcontroller through interface builder. In IB, to link a button to a method make sure the method is in your viewcontroller.h file and also implemented in the .m file. Then go to the connections panel in IB (after clicking on the button) and drag a connection from 'Touch Up Inside' (touch up inside is when a user touches the button and releases that touch up and inside the button's boundary) to the viewcontroller.xib window onto the file's owner icon. From there you will be presented with a drop down menu that will let you choose the IBAction methods you specified in the header file. In this case take: - (IBAction) buttonPressed: (id) sender; // header file - (IBAction) buttonPressed: (id) sender { // .m file // when the button is pressed then change the uiimageview [imageView image: [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile: @"image.png"]]; }
