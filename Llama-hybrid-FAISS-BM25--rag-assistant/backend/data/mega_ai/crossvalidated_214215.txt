Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling using CDFs instead of PDFs

I wonder if there is any MCMC sampling method which uses the definition of the target CDF instead of the target PDF; however, I may use a proposal PDF. I would like to use Metropolis-Hastings but it is not possible because the calculation of the acceptance ratio is defined in terms of the target PDF. I say this because it is impossible for me to obtain the PDF associated to certain CDF without doing some kind of numerical approximation which may bias my simulation; also, my CDF might be not continuous, and therefore I cannot differenciate it to obtain the PDF Regards!
