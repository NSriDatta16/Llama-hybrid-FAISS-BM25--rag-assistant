Definition of model complexity in XGBoost

I am having a hard time trying to understand the mathematical principle behind XGBoost. What really bothers me is the definition of the model complexity : $$ \Omega(f) = \gamma T + \frac12 \lambda \sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2 $$ Can someone tell me what $γ$ and $λ$ stand for?
