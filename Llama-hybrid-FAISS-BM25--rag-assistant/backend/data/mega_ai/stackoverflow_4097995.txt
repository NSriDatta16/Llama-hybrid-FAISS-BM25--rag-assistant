I have the same question, and managed to half solve it by doing this: $('table').sortable( { connectWith: 'table', items: 'tbody tr' }); This allows me to move rows on to an empty table, and it looks fine, but the element is inserted after the tbody instead of inside it. I think Danny Robert's answer will work for me but I'd be interested in seeing a non hack solution.
