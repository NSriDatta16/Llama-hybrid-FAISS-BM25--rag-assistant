Time ago when developing a swing based application I came across a bug in the JVM which will cause the file requester open to be really slow if there is a big zip file on your desktop. And there is also another issue related when a big number of files exists in a folder. Probably there can be a correlation with your issue. Which version of JDK are you usign ? Please take a look at this thread for some info: https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=4638397 http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.java.help/browse_thread/thread/ec8854f82f381123 Defrag the disk is also a good idea.
