If I'm understanding your question correctly, it sounds like you want to figure out which combination/weighting structure of your 35 independent variables best explains an outcome (match/no match). To me, at least, this sounds like a job for a redundancy analysis. RDA is kind of like a multivariate form of regression that us ecologists use a lot when we have a lot of variables and only a vague sense of how they might all be relatively important. They are pretty simple to implement in R. library(vegan) #This package may need to be installed if you don't already have it. rda1 = rda(match ~ age + location + interests + ...) #Looks a lot like a linear regression. plot(rda1) #Returns a triplot of the data -- interpreting these is an artform. summary(rda1) #prints a lot of information about the results of the RDA. My intuition tells me that the loadings on the first (or more) component(s) for the right side of the formula above (i.e. for your explanatory variables) could reasonably be used as weights in your algorithm of interest. These loadings will be shown in the summary, but they can also be extracted and stored seperately; see here for some details on that. Unfortunately, like most ordinations, RDAs are much easier to run than to interpret. You can try here and here for more information, but they're both ecology-focused. It's important to point out that RDAs are not much of a conceptual leap past a principal components analysis, for which there is tons of good literature out there. Perhaps someone else here can build on my answer to help you more. To amoeba's comment, the advantage this approach would have over a linear regression is that an ordination technique like RDA will not be troubled by the number of variables you have because it is not trying to fit parameters (at least not in the same sense as a linear regression would). It's particularly good at figuring out which variables are unpredictive, as well as which are "redundant," i.e. effectively co-linear, without the need for a huge sample size.
