Can i suguest an alternative tack. The java serialisation format has some significant issues when being used for long term storage. Since you are refactoring and are most likely going to have to deserialise all the stored data one way or another, you may want to look at Google Protocol Buffers as an alternative serialisation format. It might take a bit more work but it is designed specifically for long term storage and versioning. Good luck
