Reproducing Holt-Winters analysis in the Cowpertwait-Metcalfe book

I am having trouble reproducing some output for some R code in the time series book by Cowpertwait and Metcalfe. There are quite a few typos in their code throughout the book, but in other cases I was able to reproduce what they say I should get by fixing the typos. However, in their section on the Holt-Winters method, I am unable to do so. Here is the code I used: wine.dat The authors write that the estimates for the smoothing parameters from this code should be $\alpha = 0.4107$ , $\beta = 0.0001516$ , and $\gamma = 0.4695$ . The code above instead gave me $\alpha=0.4086698$ and $\gamma=0.4929402$ and a $\beta$ parameter exactly equal to 0. I plotted the time series and it seems to exactly match the picture in the book, so I don't think the data file was changed after the book was published. All I can guess is that my computer is using a different precision.
