I think I am understanding your question. You want to create a new text file each day and name the file something like "03-09-2011.txt". You can do: var fileName = string.Format("{0:MM-dd-yyyy}.txt", DateTime.Now); This will get a file name like I mentioned above. I would also probably use Path.Combine: IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); var directory = "Data"; isf.CreateDirectory(directory); var fileName = string.Format("{0:MM-dd-yyyy}.txt", DateTime.Now); StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(new IsolatedStorageFileStream(Path.Combine(directory, filName), FileMode.Create, isf)); sw.WriteLine(textBox1.Text); sw.Close(); That will take care of adding the "\" between the paths, and that way you have the directory name and file name separate (I always seem to need these later anyways). This has the added benefit that you can prepend or append to the name easily: var fileName = string.Format("This is the file for {0:MM-dd-yyyy}.txt", DateTime.Now);
