There are two characteristics of Bayesian modeling that need to be emphasized, when discussing the equivalance of certain penalized maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian procedures. In the Bayesian framework, the prior is selected based on specifics of the problem and is not motivated by computational expediency. Hence Bayesians use a variety of priors including the now-popular horseshoe prior for sparse predictor problems, and don't need to rely so much on priors that are equivalent to L1 or L2 penalties. With a full Bayesian approach you have access to all inferential procedures when you're done. For example you can quantify evidence for large regression coefficients and you can get credible intervals on regression coefficients and overall predicted values. In the frequentist framework, once you choose penalization you lose all of the inferential machine.
