The benefit of using tables in any DBMS over file storage : the ability to query / mine the data afterwards with queries the ability to backup data transactionally With xml files on the file system, you will need to come up with strategies for 'unique file naming' and overcome limitations of how many files you can store per folder etc. In some RDBMS', Xml is a first class data type (unfortunately, not for MS Access), so: It is possible to query your Xml using XPath, e.g. using XQuery. In many RDBMS (e.g. Sql Server), it is also possible to create indexes in Xml for improved performance of the above queries. However, in Access, you will need to store in a Memo field , with a maximum document size of 1Gb in Access 2010 . TL;DR : If you are already using a database, store the Xml in it.
