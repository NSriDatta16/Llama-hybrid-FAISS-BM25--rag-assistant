Time series forecasting with 53 weeks in a year?

I am building a time series model in R. I have four years of data from 2010 to 2013 and doing forecasting for 2014. According to the calendar that my organisation follows, in 2014 there would be 53 weeks, while the other years have only 52 weeks. How can I handle this kind of scenario in R?
