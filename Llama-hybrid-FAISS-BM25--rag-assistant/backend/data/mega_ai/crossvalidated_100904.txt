I'm assuming that by "exact numerical solution" and "analytically" you mean that you want $$p(\mu,\theta_i,\tau|Y_1,\ldots,Y_n, \tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n)$$ to be a known distribution. If this is what you want, then NO there is no way to solve for this posterior analytically. Let me use $\sigma^2$ instead of your $\tau$, so that we have $$\theta_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$. Some suggestions that would get you closer to an analytic solution are Let $Y_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\theta_i,\sigma^2\tau_i)$. Let $\mu \sim N(m,\sigma^2p)$ Let $\sigma^2 \sim IG(\alpha,\beta)$. Now you should be able to integrate out $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n,\mu$ to obtain $Y\sim N(m, \sigma^2 S)$ where $Y=(Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$and $S$ is a known matrix. Then, you should be able to get $\mu|Y,\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n,\sigma^2$ followed by $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n|Y,\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n,\mu,\sigma^2$. Although this wouldn't get you to an analytic solution, you can at least use Monte Carlo (rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo) to obtain draws from the full posterior.
