If you do lsmeans(fitPoisson, ~ Treatment1 * Treatment2 * Treatment3) you will see the predictions (on the log scale) made by the model for each combination of the three factors. The results you show in your question are the averages of these predictions, averaged (with equal weights) over the levels of Treatment2 and Treatment3 . The results with type = "response" are the antilogs of these results, and the standard errors are obtained using the delta method. Note that the averaging is still done on the log scale, and the confidence intervals are computed on the log scale, then back-transformed. If you want the averaging to be done on the raw count scale, that is possible too. Do: rg = regrid(ref.grid(fitPoisson), transform = TRUE) lsmeans(rg, ~ Treatment1) (The regrid function creates a new reference grid for the model based on the back-transformed predictions. You can use summary(rg) to see the individual predictions.) These results can differ markedly from the raw averages you obtained from the data when there is imbalance in the data, so that the raw averages give far from equal weights to the levels of those two factors.
