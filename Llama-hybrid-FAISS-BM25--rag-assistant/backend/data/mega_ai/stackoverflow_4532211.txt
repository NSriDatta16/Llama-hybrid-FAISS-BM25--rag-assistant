Experiences in mailing to registered users

I am running small social site. It's witten in PHP (but it is not that relevant in this case). My plan was to make it more popular by allowing registered users to be notified about certain events happening in the site (like "someone commented your content" and so). Currently my site is sending only simple mails (like welcome mail with confirmation link) via SMTP (Gmail). Unfortunatelly Gmail has some limits - 2000 mails per day (in paid version). So the next step would be to use something which would allow me to send more mails than 2000 daily. There are paid services like AuthSMTP, Sendgrid, but I prefer to setup something on my own. Something which would be used for sending more than 2000 mails from "no-reply@example.com" to registered users. So my question is: Is it good option to setup MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) to send mails from php social site? Or should I go different way? Basically I was thinking about setting up Postfix.
