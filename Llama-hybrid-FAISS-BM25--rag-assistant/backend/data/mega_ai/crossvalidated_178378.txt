I don't necessarily agree that logistic regression is that appropriate. The reason I say this is because it is well known that the logistic distribution does not fit infrequent or rare events -- the extremes of the distribution -- at all well. A better choice would be to use poisson regression, which is the basis for, e.g., the law of small numbers, low valued integer or count data where the variance equals the mean as well as being designed for predicting rare events. In addition, there are extensions and adaptations for zero-heavy event data as in zero-inflated poisson models.
