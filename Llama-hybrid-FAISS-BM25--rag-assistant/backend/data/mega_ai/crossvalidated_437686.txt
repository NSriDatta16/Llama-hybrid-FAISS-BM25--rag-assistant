This is one of many areas in statistics that uses abysmal terminology. According to most of the rest of the world, an invariant function's values do not change at all when acted on by a group. The first definition you cite decidedly is not invariance in this sense: physicists would call it "covariant." The lesson here is to pay attention (as you are) to the definitions and go on from there, rather than assuming a word always means what you think it does.
