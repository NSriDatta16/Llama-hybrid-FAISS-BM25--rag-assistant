Comparing statistics of networks of different sizes

Hi This maybe a basic Stats question. Let say I have 3 networks of different sizes. Size in terms of number of nodes and links. Network n1, n2 and n3 have v1, v2 and v3 nodes and l1, l2 and l3 links. That is all we know about the networks. For each of these networks we compute some parameters based on some criteria. For example, param1 = no. of nodes with criteria 1 param2 = no. of nodes with criteria 2 param3 = no. of nodes with criteria 3 Result nodes links param1 param2 param3 n1 v1 l1 a b c n2 v2 l2 d e f n3 v3 l3 g h i Question If I average (a+d+g/3) to get the expected param1 across networks, would that make sense knowing that the size of the networks is different and the parameters are a function of the size of the network? How to reconcile with the fact that different networks have different sizes and therefore cannot be compared directly.
