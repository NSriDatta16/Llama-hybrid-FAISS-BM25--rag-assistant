Can two Silverlight applications share IsolatedStorage on one machine?

What identifies an silverlight application and when can two silverlight applications share IsolatedStorage if at all, i.e.: if I want to have two Silverlight applications share IsolatedStorage space, is this possible? What kind of "application id" do I need to give to do this? if I don't want two Silverlight applications to share IsolatedStorage, how do I prevent this? Do I need to do this? For instance, I've noticed when I develop a Silverlight application, I can press F5, in the application save to Isolated Storage, stop the application, press F5 again, and it reads from the same IsolatedStorage. (I would think that a new compilation would cause it to use new IsolatedStorage.) However, when I then copy the .xap and .html files to another directory and open the .html file, it does NOT share the IsolatedStorage with the application I was developing. What changed? What is going on behind the scenes here so I know when IsolatedStorage is shared and when it isn't?
