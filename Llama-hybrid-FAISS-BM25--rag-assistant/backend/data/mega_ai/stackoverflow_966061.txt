Two ideas (untested, first google them to see if somebody has done it before): Set a replacement stdlib which uses the TCP lib instead of syscalls. then use ld.so to override it at loadtime. Set a tun net device, make the apps talk on this, and write another task that connects the other side of the tun to the userspace TCP lib. I'd guess the first one performs better and could be less fragile. It needs some delicate stdlib knowledge, thought. Also, the tun device seems to only give you IP packets. Your best bet is to search other users of the TCP library, it's quite possible there's already some kind of 'loader' that do exactly that.
