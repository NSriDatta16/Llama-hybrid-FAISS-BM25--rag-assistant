Always overestimate

I have a regression use case where I am supposed to estimate a value based on 3-4 features. Using random forest, I was able to get ~20% error. However, I have a constraint now. I can overestimate but not underestimate. So, at the cost of improving the error I am allowed to overestimate. What is the right approach of handling this constraint? Is it okay to just go with an approach like 1.2x the estimation provided by the model?
