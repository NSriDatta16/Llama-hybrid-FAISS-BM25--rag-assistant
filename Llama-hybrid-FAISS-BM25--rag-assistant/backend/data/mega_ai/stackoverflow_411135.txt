I think chrismear 's point on using assignment over creation is great. To make the whole thing a little more Ruby-esque, though, I might suggest assigning something other than nil to each element: hash = {} array.each { |x| hash[x] = 1 } # or true or something else "truthy" ... if hash[376] # instead of if hash.has_key?(376) ... end The problem with assigning to nil is that you have to use has_key? instead of [] , since [] give you nil (your marker value) if the Hash doesn't have the specified key. You could get around this by using a different default value, but why go through the extra work? # much less elegant than above: hash = Hash.new(42) array.each { |x| hash[x] = nil } ... unless hash[376] ... end
