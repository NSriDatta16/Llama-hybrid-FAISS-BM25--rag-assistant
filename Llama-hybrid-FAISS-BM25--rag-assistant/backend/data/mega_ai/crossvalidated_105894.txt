What is your similarity? First try to figure out what a meaningful similarity function is for your use case . This is very much use case dependant, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Once you have a working notion of similarity, try hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN with this similarity. Note that having a working similarity is a requirement for these algorithms to yield good results. Think outside the box of vectors, and think in your data world Mathematically, you have a vector space. But that isn't what your data means . PCA will maximize variance in this vector space, but what does this mean ? Instead, choose approaches that mean something for your data. For example, frequent itemsets and association rules could mean much more on your data. Your data probably isn't random numbers, but there is some reality, some semantics attached to it. You need to get this tie to reality into your analysis.
