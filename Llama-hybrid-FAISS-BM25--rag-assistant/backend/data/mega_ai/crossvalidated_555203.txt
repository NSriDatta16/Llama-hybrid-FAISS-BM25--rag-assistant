Data transformation prior to the logistic/linear regression model

I am currently working on regression models and am unsure whether we should transform the data. From what I learned, it is recommended that we should: transform the continuous predictors (e.g. log-transform, spline transform) prior to the logistic regression. transform the outcome variable in the linear regression (e.g. log-transform) if it is not normally distributed. Are these the correct summaries/approaches? If not, can someone please correct them? Also, I have two follow-up questions: Is there any way we can transform the "categorical variable" prior to the logistic (or linear) regression? If so, how can we do that? Can spline transformation be applied to the outcome variable in the linear regression (I never see this done in the papers I read)?
