jQuery works as well with ASP.NET as with any other server platform, because it's just a set of client-side scripts. When you consider its daily usage (such as assigning Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.DateTimeFormat to jQuery calendar) the final code won't look as short and elegant as advertised. The server controls of ASP.NET AJAX have their own bonuses. In short: if you use ASP.NET and not going to change the platform try standard ASP.NET AJAX facility (possibly with AJAX Control Toolkit ). Otherwise starting with jQuery can be much better investment.
