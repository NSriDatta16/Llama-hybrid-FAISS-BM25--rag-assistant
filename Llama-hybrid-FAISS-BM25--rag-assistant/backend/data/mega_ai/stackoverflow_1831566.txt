In terms of code storage I would consider Dictionary and KeyValuePair, which makes lookup easy and quick. Assuming you're talking about a quantity of data that can be handled in memory that is. See Best implementation for Key Value Pair Data Structure? Then you could load the store from a file. XML would be a good way, although if it really is just plain ID and string value, then a simple CSV text file would suffice. If you are talking a huge amount of data however then it may be better looking into a random access kind of file storage, but then the time taken to do this may be better spent with a database. On the other hand, if it's just a handful of data items and these are guaranteed not to change, then as others have mentioned, an enum would be fine.
