Java Swing JEditorPane: manipulating styled documents

I have model that is a queue of Strings associated with enum types. I'm trying to display that model in a JEditorPane, with each element in the queue as a separate HTML paragraph that has attributes based based on the associated enum type. However, my updating methods are not doing what I want. I tried writing the HTML strings directly to the document (e.g., I take the Strings, prepend and append and then insert them at the end of the document), but that gives me the html tags in the output (instead of as formatting) - which of course is inconsistent with the result of putting the tags on the string that I use construct the document with JEditorPane("text/html",String foo). I've also tried inserting with an AttributeSet, but apparently I'm doing that wrong as well. Any suggestions?
