Azure Configuration Error

I am testing Azure and I keep running into this problem - I have no idea if anyone else has experienced something similar. Locally, the solution is working fine - no problems at all, but when I put it into the cloud - I just keep getting this error ? Any Ideas? Azure Configuration Error type="Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.AspProviders.TableStorageSessionStateProvider"
