Using xsl:variable in a xsl:foreach select statement

I'm trying to iterate through an xml document using xsl:foreach but I need the select=" " to be dynamic so I'm using a variable as the source. Here's what I've tried: ... /Rating/Path1/* /Rating/Path2/* ... ... ... The foreach threw an error stating: "XslTransformException - To use a result tree fragment in a path expression, first convert it to a node-set using the msxsl:node-set() function." When I use the msxsl:node-set() function though, my results are blank. I'm aware that I'm setting $DataPath to a string, but shouldn't the node-set() function be creating a node set from it? Am I missing something? When I don't use a variable: I get the proper results. Here's the XML data file I'm using: 1 1-3-86 Sarah 11-12-85 Joe 11-3-84 Jeff 3-5-81 Shawn My question is simple, how do you run a foreach on 2 different paths?
