Sometimes it is used to reduce an unwieldy thing like volatile unsigned long to something a little more compact such as vuint32_t . Other times it is to help with portability since types like int are not always the same on each platform. By using a typedef you can set the storage class you are interested in to the platform's closest match without changing all the source code.
