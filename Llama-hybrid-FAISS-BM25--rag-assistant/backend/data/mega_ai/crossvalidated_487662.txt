As others are saying, the problem has nothing to do with frequentist VS bayesian. The problem is that at the point of making the decision you don't have any information about whether it will be a win or a loss. If you introduce that information into your framework, then you are leaving yourself open to hindsight bias (which IMO it is the elephant in the room here and hasn't really been acknowledged in the other answers). Hence, if you don't consider the end result, you need to rely in your model/computed odds/whatever information you had available at decision time. And sadly, that means that sometimes you'll lose, even when making the correct play.
