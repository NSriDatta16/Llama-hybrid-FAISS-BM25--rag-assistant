UIWebView in UIScrollView and touch notifications

I have view controller with following view hierarchy: UIView '- UIScrollView '- UIWebView '- UIWebView '- ... more UIWebViews UIScrollView has paging enabled and each page contains one UIWebView. UIScrollView occupies entire screen, UIWebView as well. Now my problem is that I need to detect touches on entire screen. I guess that UIScrollView somehow eats most of those (and since UIWebView contains scroll view as well, things got even more complicated). I tried subclassing each of those views and tried both touchesBegan and tap gesture recognizer but nothing. All I was able to get was very unreliable gesture recognizer on UIWebView, it worked once in 20 taps, very random and very weird. How should I solve this? I need touchesBegan and touchesEnded or tap gesture.
