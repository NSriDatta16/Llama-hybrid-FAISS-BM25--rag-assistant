Choosing Between Training on Historical Data vs. Imputed Data for Time Series Nowcasting

I have several time series datasets which we can label as y , x1 , x2 , ..., x5 . Particularly interesting is the relationship between x1 and a newer dataset z1 . z1 is akin to an enhanced version of x1 - it possesses richer information and is on a broader scale due to the encompassed details. However, z1 has a limited historical record. While x1 is static with a rich history, z1 is updated weekly. Approach 1: Train on x1 and use a fitted version of it for new predictions. Train a model: y ~ x1 + x2 + ... Fit x1 on z1 : Understand the relationship between them. For future data: Use the mapped value of z1 (termed "fitted x1") and others for predictions. Approach 2: Impute z1 historically using x1 and then model on this. Impute historical z1 using x1 . Train a model with both imputed and current z1 values: y ~ z1 + x2 + ... For future data: Use the latest values of z1 and the rest for predictions. Question: Which approach is statistically more sound given the nature of x1 and z1 ? Are there pitfalls in either method that I should be particularly cautious about? If both methods have their merits, what factors should guide my choice? Any insights, references, or experiences shared would be invaluable. Thank you in advance!
