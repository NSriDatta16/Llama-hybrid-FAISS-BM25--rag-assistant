Machine Learning: Linear classifier and possibility to separate

Possible Duplicate: Machine Learning: Linear classifier Suppose we have 2 kernel functions $K_1(x,y)$ and $K_2(x,y)$. We know, that the dataset ($(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_l,y_l),$ $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ ) is separated with the first one (that is, there are $w,$ $w_0$: $$y_i(K_1(w,x_i)-w_0)>0 $$ for all $i=1,\ldots,l$ ), and not separated with the second kernel function. What we can say about kernel function $K_1(x,y)+K_2(x,y)$ ? How I can show that the same dataset is separated with it? (Or it's false?)
