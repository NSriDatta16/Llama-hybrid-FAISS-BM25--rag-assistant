First, you have to know how you information is organized. For instance, you could have your 1000 first prime nunbers organized this way: 1 2 3 5 7... Or this way: 1-2-3-5-7-11... You can use the StringBuilder (or just a String) to keep the numbers of your file (assuming that your text is like the second way above). As the numbers are separated by a dash you could use a substring that can take the first 8 numbers to some method. BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("Prime Nunbers.txt")); String num; int count = 1; while((num= br.readLine()) != null) { if( count But if you have your numbers organized like the 1st way (one number per line) you could do something like this: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("Prime Nunbers.txt")); String num; int count = 1; while((num = br.readLine()) != null) { if( count If you want to use these first 8 numbers at once you can just read the file entirely and then use some substring depending the way these numbers are read.
