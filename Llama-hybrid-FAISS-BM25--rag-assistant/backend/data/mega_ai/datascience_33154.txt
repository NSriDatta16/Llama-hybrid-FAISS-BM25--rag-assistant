I would recommend working with LSTM-RNN s. They have been a very convenient technique to deal with the prediction of a feature based on time series of multiple inputs. This is because they can deal with the time-dependencies between all inputs/outputs as a blackbox, saving you from the hassle. This tutorial is exactly what you are looking for. It provides you with the code to prototype your algorithm fast with Python / Keras and itt has worked very well for me regarding a problem very similar to yours.
