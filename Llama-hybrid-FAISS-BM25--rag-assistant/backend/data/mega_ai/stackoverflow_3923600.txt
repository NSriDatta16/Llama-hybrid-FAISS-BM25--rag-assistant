drag and drop ordering of images

I have 5 images that go into a banner on my homepage. These images are stored in the database but what I would like the user to do is drag and drop them so they retain some order. What I need to do is a (i) drag and drop the images in a container div so left if position 1 and right is position 5. (ii) on sumbit save the position as a field in the database. Some pointers would be nice, probably use jquery if possible. Thanks.
