Many companies still use IE6 because: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. (Sure, we know many ways that IE6 is broken, but the average user doesn't know or care about web standards and knows nothing about security.) Their existing web apps were built for it. In many cases, these apps break in IE7 or FF. Arguing with about web standards is unlikely to sway anyone, even if it involves your time efficiency. Your best bet is to push security.
