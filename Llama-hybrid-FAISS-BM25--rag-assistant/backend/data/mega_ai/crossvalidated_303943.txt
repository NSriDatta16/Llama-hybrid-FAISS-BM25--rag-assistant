I don't know the relevance of $X$ in your question but the sum of two independent $\chi^2$ random variables (as $Y$ and $Z^2$ are stated to be in your question) is a $\chi^2$ random variable whose number of degrees of freedom is the sum of the numbers of degrees of the two $\chi^2$ random variables. In short, the answer to the question asked in your last paragraph is Yes.
