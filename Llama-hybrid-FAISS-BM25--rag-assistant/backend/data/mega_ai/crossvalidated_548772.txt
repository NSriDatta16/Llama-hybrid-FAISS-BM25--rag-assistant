(Hand waving wildly) By the Universal approximation theorem , neural networks can approximate any nonlinear function (given sufficient depth of the network). This is what makes them so popular. Now whether you have the appropriate data and sufficient amount of data, to estimate all of the parameters of a neural network are another story. If you know your data adhere to a specific model, you will probably outperform a neural network. The benefits are when data deviate from this assumed model. The neural network can capture that. And of course this is only really useful if all you care about is prediction. If you need to do inference that is much more difficult in the neural network world.
