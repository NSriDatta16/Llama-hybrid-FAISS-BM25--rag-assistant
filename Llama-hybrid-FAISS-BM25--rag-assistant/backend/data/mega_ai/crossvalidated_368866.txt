I am curious if there is a more elegant way. A more elegant way would be to keep the quarters with promotions, and add as an exogenous variable a second time series with an indicator for promotions (i.e which is 0 for quarters without promotions and 1 for quarters with promotions). I have modeled sales data with promotions using Facebook Prophet and it has worked fairly well. (In Facebook Prophet, you don't add a second time series, just a list of promotions with their corresponding dates).
