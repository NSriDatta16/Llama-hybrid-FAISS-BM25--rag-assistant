Session stuff shouldn't be triggered for a CLI task (logically, you're not making a sfWebRequest when using the CLI) so something in your code is making an assumption. I imagine you're trying to do something with session storage or something that instances sfContext from within the save() method of an object - if you need to do something like that, always do it in your action, not the model.
