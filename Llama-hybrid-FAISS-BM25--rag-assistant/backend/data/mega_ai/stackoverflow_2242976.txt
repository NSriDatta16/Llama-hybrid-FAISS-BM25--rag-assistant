Of course there is a much better way ! You really want to learn some bits of Java EE, and in particular JPA for database access. For a complete crash course on Java EE, check out the Sun the Java EE 5 tutorial. http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/ Part 4 - Enterprise Beans Part 5 - Persistence (JPA) Then you want to try Hibernate (for instance) which has an implementation of JPA. This is for Java 5 or later. If you are still in Java 2, you might want to try Hibernate or iBatis.
