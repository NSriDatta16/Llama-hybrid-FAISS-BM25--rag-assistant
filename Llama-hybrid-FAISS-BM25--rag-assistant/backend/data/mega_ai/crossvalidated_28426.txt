Type of probability used by insurance company (and influence of gender)

I am currently working on analyzing a case and I need some help with the statistics. When a certain woman tried to find an insurance for her car, she was told that the premium she had to pay would be more than average, based on the fact that she was a woman. According to the insurance company, on average, women were a higher risk. She won the court case: the court decided that her individual risk could not be based on averages of other women. Now my questions are: (a) What kind of probability is used by the insurance company? (b) Can you comment on the kind of probability that is suggested by the verdict of the court? I am really interested in the difference of the type of probability used by the insurance company and the court.
