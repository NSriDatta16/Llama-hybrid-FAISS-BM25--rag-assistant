Is there any general consideration on the lack of balance in sample size for (any) inference?

I'm wondering if there are any suggestions, good practices, thoughts about the imbalance between data size in each compared group? I ask apart from any concrete statistical test (Welch, Kruska-Wallis, F in ANOVA, etc.). It's rather about the "philosophical" issue. If we compare, say, 100 and 20, the first one provides more information, the second - fewer. In case of, say, 1000 and 50 it's much fewer. I know, that technically analysis (both frequentist and Bayesian) can be performed on any data, but what about the sense of such comparison? I read somewhere, that 2:1 imbalance "usually" doesn't pose a problem. But what about 10:1? 50:1? Are you aware of any such discussion, book, article? It doesn't have to be about the concrete statistical test and its power (they all have their performance, that's understandable).
