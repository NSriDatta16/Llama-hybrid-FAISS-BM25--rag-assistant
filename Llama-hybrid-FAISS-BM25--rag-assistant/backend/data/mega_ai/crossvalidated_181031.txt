This question is concerned with the minimum information required for detecting changepoints in a time series-based sequence of events. For example, in classic approaches to estimating sample sizes, the assumption is that the full course and information from a study will be used to evaluate the tests. Sequential sampling is concerned specifically with finding the minimum information necessary to make a determination as to the significance of the result. Changepoint detection is a natural outcome of this approach. There is a rich literature on this beginning with Abraham Wald's 1947 book Sequential Analysis . The best, most recent and authoritative work is probably Alexander Tartakovsky's 2014 book Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection although his treatment is pretty advanced. Last June (2015), Columbia sponsored a 3-day workshop on this class of models and Tartakovsky was a co-chair: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsm2015/committees-and-sponsers Check the Program tab for details on specific topics and presentations. I'm sure there will be something that addresses your specific question. Interestingly, between Wald's and Tartakovsky's books, sequential analysis was relegated largely to Op Research departments, i.e., it was pretty much an academic concern that didn't see wider use. That was until Google's adoption and use of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) some years back. Since then, sequential analysis has really come into its own. Perhaps even more to the point of your concerns is a recent, less formally and theoretically statistical paper by Figueiredo, Ribeiro, Almeida and Faloutsos titled TribeFlow: Mining & Predicting User Trajectories . Here is their abstract: Which song will Smith listen to next? Which restaurant will Alice go to tomorrow? Which product will John click next? These applications have in common the prediction of user trajectories that are in a constant state of flux over a hidden network (e.g. website links, geographic location). What users are doing now may be unrelated to what they will be doing in an hour from now. Mindful of these challenges we propose TribeFlow, a method designed to cope with the complex challenges of learning personalized predictive models of non-stationary, transient, and time-heterogeneous user trajectories. TribeFlow is a general method that can perform next product recommendation, next song recommendation, next location prediction, and general arbitrary-length user trajectory prediction without domain-specific knowledge.
