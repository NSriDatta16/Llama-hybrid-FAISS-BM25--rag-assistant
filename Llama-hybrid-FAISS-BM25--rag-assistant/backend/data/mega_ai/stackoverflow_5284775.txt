how to determine the available physical memory in linux

I'm trying to figure if my software running on linux suffers from memory leak . I've tried to measure the available physical memory as found in /proc/meminfo (see below) but could understand which field(s) represents the available memory and what is the relation between MemFree, Cached, Buffers, Active, Inactive . cat /proc/meminfo MemTotal: 124128 kB MemFree: 62872 kB Buffers: 0 kB Cached: 15624 kB SwapCached: 0 kB Active: 38724 kB Inactive: 11148 kB SwapTotal: 0 kB SwapFree: 0 kB Dirty: 0 kB Writeback: 0 kB AnonPages: 34272 kB Mapped: 14640 kB Slab: 5564 kB SReclaimable: 424 kB SUnreclaim: 5140 kB PageTables: 504 kB NFS_Unstable: 0 kB Bounce: 0 kB WritebackTmp: 0 kB CommitLimit: 62064 kB Committed_AS: 57936 kB VmallocTotal: 655360 kB VmallocUsed: 1016 kB VmallocChunk: 654328 kB
