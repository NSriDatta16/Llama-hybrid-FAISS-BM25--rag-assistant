The paper is available from ResearchGate through Google. The validation of the delayed rejection algorithm is that, when starting with a realisation of the variable $X_t\sim\pi(x)$, the outcome of the Markov move to $X_{t+1}$ still remains distributed as $X_{t+1}\sim\pi(x)$. If the first step leads to an acceptance, the validation is the same as with the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, hence using the same acceptance probability, $\alpha_1(x_t,\cdot)$ and the accepted value is distributed as $$q_1(x_t,y)\alpha(x_t,y)$$ If the value $Y$ at the first stage is rejected, it is distributed as $$q_1(x_t,y)[1-\alpha(x_t,y)]$$up to a normalising constant. The second stage value is then generated from the proposal $q_2(x_t,y,z)$ which means that $Z$ is generated conditional on $(x_t,y)$ [and hence that a better notation would be $q_2(z|x_t,y)$] . In this second stage, $y$ becomes an auxiliary variable, with the joint distribution of $(Y,Z)$ given $x_t$ and a first rejection being$$q_1(x_t,y)[1-\alpha(x_t,y)]q_2(x_t,y,z)$$which explains why this block appears in $\alpha_2(x_t,y,z)$. Another way to explain the representation of $\alpha_2(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)$ is that the marginal distribution of $Z$ is (proportional to)$$\int_\mathcal{X} q_1(x_t,y)[1-\alpha(x_t,y)]q_2(x_t,y,z)\,\text{d}y$$ and that an alternative acceptance probability would be \begin{align*}\alpha_2^\prime(x_t,z)=\min\bigg\{1,\,&\pi(z)\int_\mathcal{X} q_1(z,y)[1-\alpha(z,y)]q_2(z,y,x_t)\,\text{d}y\\&\left.\Big/\pi(x_t)\int_\mathcal{X} q_1(x_t,y)[1-\alpha(x_t,y)]q_2(x_t,y,z)\,\text{d}y\right\}\end{align*} But this probability cannot be computed in most cases [except when $q_2(x_t,y,z)=q_2(x_t,z)$ and hence is replaced by a valid ratio of unbiased estimators of the integrals as in Andrieu & Roberts (2009) pseudo-marginal technique . This is for the "intuition" part, but the validation proceeds by detailed balance, namely that the distribution of $X_{t+1}$ given $X_t=x_t$ writes as $$q(x_t,x)\alpha_1(x_t,x)q_1(x_t,x)+\int_\mathcal{X} \alpha_2(x_t,y,x)\,q_1(x_t,y)[1-\alpha(x_t,y)]q_2(x_t,y,x)\,\text{d}y+\int_\mathcal{X^2} \alpha_2(x_t,y,x)\,q_1(x_t,y)[1-\alpha(x_t,y)]q_2(x_t,y,z)\,\text{d}y\,\text{d}z\,\delta_{x_t}(x)$$and that this density satisfies $$\pi(x_t)q(x_t,x)=\pi(x)q(x,x_t)$$
