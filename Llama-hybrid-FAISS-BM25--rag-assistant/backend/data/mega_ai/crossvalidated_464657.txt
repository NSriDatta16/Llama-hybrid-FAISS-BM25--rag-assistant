Time Series, linear regression and ARMA

I have time dependent data, I used linear regression for trend and seasonality, for residuals I used an ARMA (p, q). Then I improved my regression by adding the adjusted values of the two models and it worked very well. My question is, is there any way to improve my model betas and not just the fit? Thanks for the help!
