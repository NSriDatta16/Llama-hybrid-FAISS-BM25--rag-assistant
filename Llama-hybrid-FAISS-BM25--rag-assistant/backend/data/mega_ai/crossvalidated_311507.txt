Outlier detection in seasonal time series via forecasting with ARIMA model

I am trying to find Outliers in a contextual time series data using ARIMA model. My data contains the Hourly Average Speed and Volume of vehicle traffic for two months . So, day 1 (say Monday) would have 24 observations and so on. There is seasonality in my data : Volume is really high at 08:00 and again high at 17:00 on the weekdays. So, how I planned to do it was, take a Monday that has no outliers, use that as an input the the ARIMA model to predict the next 24 hours. And compare this prediction with the other Mondays that I have to find outliers in those Mondays that I compare. Similarly take a Tuesday that has no outliers, input that to ARIMA to predict the next 24 hours and compare that prediction to the Tuesdays I have. Do the same for Wednesdays to Sundays. Also, take holidays (since they have different vehicle count to that of working days) and compare the forecast of a holiday with the other holidays I have. [I am not sure if it makes sense but that is what I have in mind]. Will my idea work or are there some other suggestions? And, how would I use ARIMA for hourly data? Data in CSV format [Month - 1 and 2] There are about 2 x 24 x 30 values in total
