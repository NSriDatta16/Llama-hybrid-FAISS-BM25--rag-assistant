Here's a short Haskell function that enumerates primes from Literate Programs: primes :: [Integer] primes = sieve [2..] where sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x|x 0] Apparently, this is not the Sieve of Eratosthenes (thanks, Landei). I think it's still an instructive example that shows you can write very elegant, short code in Haskell and that shows how the choice of the wrong data structure can badly hurt efficiency.
