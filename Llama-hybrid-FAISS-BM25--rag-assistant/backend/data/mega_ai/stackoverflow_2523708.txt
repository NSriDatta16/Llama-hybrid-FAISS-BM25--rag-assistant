Examples of good IDEs to analyze for custom Form/Report designer

I am working on a basic form/report designer. Some of the features i'm looking to implement are: Single or multiple selection of objects Alignment of objects (when several are selected) Same-sizing of objects (when several are selected) Moving/dragging of selected object(s) Selected object resizing in eight directions (using object grips) For features and look-and-feel I've analyzed and used a mixture of ideas from: MS Visual Studio 200x (most useful so far) Visio Crystal Reports My question is: Have I overlooked some other IDEs that provide these kinds of features that are better and user-friendlier examples of what to do than others i've looked at? (They don't have to be Microsoft products. That's just what i have ready access to.)
