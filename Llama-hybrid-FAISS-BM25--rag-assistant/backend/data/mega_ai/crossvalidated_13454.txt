How should standard errors for mixed effects model estimates be calculated?

In particular, how should the standard errors of the fixed effects in a linear mixed effects model be calculated (in a frequentist sense)? I have been lead to believe that the typical estimates (${\rm Var}(\hat\beta)=(X'VX)^{-1}$), such as those presented in Laird and Ware [1982] will give SE's that are underestimated in size because the estimated variance components are treated as though they are the true values. I have noticed that the SE's produced by the lme and summary functions in the nlme package for R are not simply equal to the square root of the diagonals of the variance-covariance matrix given above. How are they calculated? I am also under the impression that Bayesians use inverse gamma priors for the estimation of variance components. Do these give the same results (in the right setting) as lme ?
