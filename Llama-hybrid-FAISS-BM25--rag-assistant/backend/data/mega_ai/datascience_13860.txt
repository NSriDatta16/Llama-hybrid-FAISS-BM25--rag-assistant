I would say you don't need to already have lots of programming experience, but being generally mathematically and computer-literate is important. If you've literally never programmed a computer before, then dig up a basic online R or python tutorial. As to which one, depends on the industry you'll be working in. Tech companies tend to use python, elsewhere R might be slightly more prevalent. There are various "drag-and-drop" software "solutions" that don't in theory need programming, but in most real-life applications you'll find that there's functionality you need that they don't have, or you need to pre- or post-process your data in some way, and you'll have to resort to R/python/SAS/... to get that sorted out. You'll find that you are most likely able to learn the coding skills you need on the job, as long as you have just a little experience with writing code.
