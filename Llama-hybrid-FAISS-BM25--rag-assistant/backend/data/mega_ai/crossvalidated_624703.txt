Unifying multiple sample data (meta-analysis)

I would like to unify multiple sample data (of different sizes) into some "unified sample" to evaluate its collective variance. Is this something statisticians do? I thought of unifying multiple samples in the following way : 1.From each data value, reduce the average of the sample it belongs to 2.Then, collect all these modified values from all samples, into a unified sample I have a good reason to believe that the unified-sample generated this way will distribute normally. Than, I could evaluate the variance of the unified sample and compare it to variances of other unified samples (say, with F-test). The problem I see with this approach is that the values in the unified sample are not independent, since each of them was created by reducing the sample average from the original valueâ€¦. I'll be happy to hear your thoughts, suggestions about this.
