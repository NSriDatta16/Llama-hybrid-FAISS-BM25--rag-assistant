How can I summarize latent variables using PLSSEM

I am kinda new to PLS SEM, but I think I have the steps down and can interpret the results. However, I initially like to look at summary statistics of variables when a single variable measure a construct such as mean and standard deviations and such. Is there a way to summarize variables such as averaging the variables in a construct between say 1 to 5, and looking at mean and SD, or is this meaningless when factor loadings, reliability/validity,etc are calculated in the PLSSEM approach? Any helpful answer on how to best summarize variables/constructs in SEM are appreciated
