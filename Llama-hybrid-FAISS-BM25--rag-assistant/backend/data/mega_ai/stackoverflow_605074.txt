Seems like you might be Object-orientizing it for Object-orient's sake... Seems like Bob Martin's classic bowling game problem. EDIT: -Summary- Its a long read, but basically, through TDD and refactoring, a bowling scoring application went from a huge cluster with lots of Classes and polymorphism to 20 or 30 elegant lines of code. Why? Because they didn't really need to be there in the first place
