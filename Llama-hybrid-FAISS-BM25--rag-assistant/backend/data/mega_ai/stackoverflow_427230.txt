Javascript Drag and Drop Grid

I'm looking for a script that would allow me to have a grid of draggable divs (used to organize image thumbnails ). So when one div is dragged over another, the divs would shift to create an empty spot to drop the div. I know jQuery has a drag and drop lib, but it doesn't seem to allow for the functionality I need (snapping to a grid and moving of surrounding divs). Anyone know of a script or framework that has what I need? Thanks!
