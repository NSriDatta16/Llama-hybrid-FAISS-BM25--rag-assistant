Recovering and sorting data from a sparse worksheet in Excel VBA

I have several sparsely populated tables in an Excel workbook from which I need to recover and sort the values for specific keys. The lookups will be triggered by Events. I could do this using Loops and an array but having been warned off Loops in VBA I am wondering if there is a more elegant method perhaps using an inbuilt excel function. Speed is important. UID| UK | FR | DE | FI | LUX | ..... 1 | 0 | 0 |0.03| 0.1| 0 | ..... 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.5 | ..... 3 |0.01| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.09| ..... 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.2| 0 | ..... 5 |0.31|0.07| 0 | 0 | 0 | ..... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . So in this sample table I would want to return the geographic distribution of each Unique ID and sort it, omitting any region with 0 weighting. The table sheet has several thousand UIDs and several thousand regions.
