If you want to use Preferences, here is some exampe code: In your class MyClass, declare.. private Preferences preferences = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(MyClass.class); private final String item1 = "item1"; // These are the keys (names) to identify your private final String item2 = "item2"; // items in storage. This code will retrieve a value.. preferences.getInt(item1, 0); // the 0 is a default that will be returned // if a stored value can't be retrieved. This code will store a value.. preferences.putInt(item1, 4); // store an int in item1 As mentioned by @extraneon, on Windows, these will be stored in the registry. Other systems may use a file stored in the user's home directory. I only show storing and retrieving int s but you can store many other basic types too. You should take a look at the documentation for Preferences.userNodeForPackage() to fully understand what it does. This will associate the stored items with your application/class.
