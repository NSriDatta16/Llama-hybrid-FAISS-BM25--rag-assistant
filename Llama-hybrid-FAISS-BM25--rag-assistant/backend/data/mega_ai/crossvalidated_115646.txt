I will try to respond to your specific questions, but I encourage you to offer a more complete explanation of what your goals are and what data you have because it is very likely people can give you better solutions and a deeper understanding. My understanding is that there are certain measured outcomes that you, as architects, are trying to control through your design. You have measured design variables that you believe are causally related to the outcomes of interest. I take it your goal is to do this study once, get a qualitative sense of what is important and then translate that into a couple principles that architects can keep in mind when developing a design. If I'm wrong about this purpose, or if you have more than one purpose, then please expand on this. Regarding your data: what are "parametrically generated external wall constructions"? and how did you get data on 100 of them? Were they constructed for the purposes of this study or naturally occurring? Did you select them from a larger population? How did you choose this 100? Now to your questions: 1) Is this correct? Am I missing something? 2) Are the thresholds for r/R2 (0.7/0.56) I have chosen correct to show correlation? There is no magic threshold for saying a correlation exists. I think you are grasping towards the idea of statistical significance... how do you know the relationship you see didn't simply arise by chance? Based on your data, what is the plausible range within which the true correlation is almost certain to lie? This is what the LINEST function is getting at as well. Really explaining this requires learning some statistics and it's not clear you want to go down this road. 3) Is the SKEW/log10 approach correct, and how do I deal with negative skewness? I think the best approach depends on more details of the distribution. Is it logically bounded on either the high or low side? Do you observe values close to the logical min/max? For a positively skewed distribution your log(1 + x) is probably a fine transformation. For negatively skewed distribution you could transform it by adding a constant and squaring it... look for a function that gives you a roughly normal looking distribution. But if its not to severely skewed you may not need to do any transformation at all. Before bothering with tests of skewness, just look at the data (histogram) and see if it has extreme tails. 4) Is there an easier way to do it by dividing the two datasets into each other and looking at the ratio, standard deviation, variance, etc. I'm not sure how to build on this... go back and develop your explanation of your study and I or someone else may be able to say more. Good luck.
