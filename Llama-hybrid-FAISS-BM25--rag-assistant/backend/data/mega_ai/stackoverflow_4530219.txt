Which Language Would be Best for Classified Ad High Traffic Website? 3000 to 20k Visitors Daily

Average visitors: 5000. I'm wondering should i make it in PHP or ASP.NET/C#. Website contents might grow really fast because it is expected there going to be daily/continuous posts from users. Its an interactive website that has to login, post, check replies and private messages without any advanced/complex features. Website might use AJAX as well as JQuery. What language do you suggest me to go with? This is one time process, once project is started! That's it, no changing mind would help. NOTE: i care to have the code be designed well so it can be extended easily in later future without having to change existing code incldung re-usability and consistency for the long run.
