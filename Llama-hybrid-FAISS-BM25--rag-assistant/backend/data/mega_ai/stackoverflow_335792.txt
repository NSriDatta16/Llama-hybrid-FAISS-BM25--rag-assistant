Linq to SQL: How do I stop the auto generated object name from being renamed?

In visual studio 2008, when I drag a database table into my dbml screen, any tables that end with the letter s automatcially get the s removed from the dbml object. Is there any way to disable this? Also, the collection of rows also gets an s appended to the collection property name. Is there a way to change that as well? Thanks
