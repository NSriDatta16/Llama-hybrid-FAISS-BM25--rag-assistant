Normalization / Moving Average

I have this daily time series of observed prices: $P_1,P_2,..., P_n$. I want to works with returns: $ 0 , P_2-P_1,..., P_n - P_{n-1}$. I have been told to "remove" the first term (P_1-P_0= P_1- ?) by setting it to 0. It appears that this 0 is very differents from others terms and not a good solution. (I even think it's not a solution at all). Here are the solution I considered: 0 as there is no returns on the first day {P_1} to be consistent with the time series nothing, just simply removing the problem what do you think about this problem ? This remained be about a similar problem I had while doing moving average. There is similar missing terms at the begining of the time series. When doing a p - moving average I usually take the last p value before my date. I have the same problem than before: at the beggining of the time series there is not enough data to make a sum with p terms. Is there a trick to adress this problem ? Would it change something to take the p values after my date ? the $[(p-1)/2] values before and after my date ? It won't change the general term of my moving average but only the values at the beggining and the end of my time series. does it matter ? How ?
