We utilize storage of originals in database for backup, but generated scaled down images that is cached on filesystem on the webservers. However, we try to avoid any roundtrips to the database if possible, because it generates huge load since one page usually invokes several image-request per page-view. One note on storing blobs in database, I suggest that you stor the actual blob-columns in a dedicated table, with a one-to-one mapping to your entity / entities. This will ease backups, aswell as alteration of your tables. When a table grows big, any changes will take "forever" to complete and locking is a big problem to, even during backup. If you have all info about the images (except the binary data) selecting that data won't be affected unless you need the binary data (which you rarely need since it will be cached in file-system). Just my two cents.
