Is there a problem of over fitting in my dataset?

I have applied the sequential forward selection to my dataset having 214 samples and 515 features (2 class problem). The feature selection algorithm has selected 8 features. Now I have applied the svm (MATLAB) on these 8 features. I have also tried to see the performance after adding more features. The table given below gives the correct rate of the algorithm (training data set) along with the feature set used. The result obtained is: 8 features = 0.9392 10 features = 0.9439 12 features = 0.9672 14 features = 0.9672 16 features = 0.9626 18 features = 0.9766 20 features = 0.9672 As visible, the accuracy seems to increase. Is it because of over fitting? Should I use the default feature set as given by the sequentialfs function of Matlab or should I force it to deliver more features to get more accuracy? I have uploaded the validation training and testing performance (70-15-15). Now can you tell me if my data is being over-fitted or not?
