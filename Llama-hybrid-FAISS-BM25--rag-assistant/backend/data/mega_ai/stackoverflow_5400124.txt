If you already have it done in Java, you can leverage that inside BIRT using a Scripted Data Source. A scripted data source relies on a Java object to build an array of objects, each object will represent a "row" on the data set. At runtime the BIRT Engine fires off the java object to go build the array and when that is compete the array is read into the data set on the report and you are off and running. More info on scripted data sources here: Scripted Data Source Examples
