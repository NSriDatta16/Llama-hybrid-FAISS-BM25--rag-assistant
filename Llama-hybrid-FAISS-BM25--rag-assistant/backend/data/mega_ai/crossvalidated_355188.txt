Logistic vs Cox PH model : different hypothesis for a single case

Let's say I'm interested in comparing the apparition of an event in 2 groups. I could take the problem by 2 ways : consider the dates and compute a Cox PH model. consider only the proportion of event and perform a logistic regression. I have the feeling that there is no "good" option here and that those cases answer to different problematics (and so I could perform both to answer those). The problem is I'm not 100% sure of what is the exact difference between those problematics : null hypothesis in Cox model is that Hazard Ratio is 1 (so there is no association between risks and group), whereas null hypothesis in Logistic regression is that there is no association between apparition of the event and group). I see there is a difference, but I cannot seem to find a crystal clear explanation of it. What is the exact difference between these two hypothesis ?
