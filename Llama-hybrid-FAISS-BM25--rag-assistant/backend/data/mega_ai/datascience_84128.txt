Can neural networks detect delay of inputs affect

Trying to make a model that predicts the stock market's total index by giving dollar price and inflation percentage as inputs, I know for sure, By changing the value of dollar price the stocks market will be affected ~10-20 days later! Can a neural network model detect the effect of input in the future outputs? If yes, What models are the best fit for these situations?
