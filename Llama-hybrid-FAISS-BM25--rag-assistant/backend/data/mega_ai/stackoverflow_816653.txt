You can simply add binary files (PSD, JPG etc.) to your tree, with the following caveats: Large files take more space on the server. A quote from http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsversioncontrol/thread/6f642d0f-5459-4a14-a19d-ede34713bcf4 : TFS does handle large (> 16mb) files differently. It does not perform Delta storage but instead stores a complete copy of each version. This is an optimization to make check-ins faster for those large files. There is no difference between text files and binary files. Small ones are Delta'd, large ones are Stored. Large files take slower to download (see the same link above). If there is a conflict (i.e. two people modify the same binary file at the same time), one of them has to resolve the conflict completely manually, e.g. he has to load all 3 image versions in the image editor, look at the differences, and merge the changes manually.
