Check the button state for all mouse buttons

Is there a better way to check the button state for all mouse buttons than to check for any different button extra? var mouseEventArgs = (System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs)e.StagingItem.Input; if (mouseEventArgs.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Released && mouseEventArgs.MiddleButton == MouseButtonState.Released && mouseEventArgs.RightButton == MouseButtonState.Released && mouseEventArgs.XButton1 == MouseButtonState.Released && mouseEventArgs.XButton2 == MouseButtonState.Released) { return; } If not, how could I do it more elegant without repeating myself so much? Thanks in advance!
