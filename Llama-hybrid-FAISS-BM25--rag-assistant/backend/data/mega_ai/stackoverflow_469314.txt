Memory Leak in Custom Cursors

I'm trying to track down a memory leak and I think it has to do with the custom cursor images being used. A new cursor seems to get created and displayed every time a certain object is dragged around on the form, but I can not find anywhere it is being disposed. I've read that it needs to be destroyed, but I'm not sure how to go about that. Shouldn't it automatically be disposed when the cursor is changed?
