C# To VB.Net Conversion - array of class objects with initialisation

can someone help me pls, im new to vb.net and im trying to work through the nhibernate firstsolution sample (written in c# re-posted here https://web.archive.org/web/20090831053827/http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/archive/2008/04/01/your-first-nhibernate-based-application.aspx as thier site is down again) and im struggling to convert this one bit. ive tried numerous convertors; telerik, developerfusion and a several others but none of the code produced will compile and i cant see the why... if you search for this method youll find where im upto... private readonly Product[] _products = new[] { new Product {Name = "Melon", Category = "Fruits"}, new Product {Name = "Pear", Category = "Fruits"}, new Product {Name = "Milk", Category = "Beverages"}, new Product {Name = "Coca Cola", Category = "Beverages"}, new Product {Name = "Pepsi Cola", Category = "Beverages"}, }; ' just the next part of the tutorial, ive resolved the "var" in vb.net 2005 bit np private void CreateInitialData() { using(ISession session = _sessionFactory.OpenSession()) using(ITransaction transaction = session.BeginTransaction()) { foreach (var product in _products) session.Save(product); transaction.Commit(); } } since my c# and vb are both shakey at best ive tried to use several conversion utils/sites. developer fusion gives: Private ReadOnly _products As Product() = New () {New Product(), New Product(), New Product(), New Product(), New Product()} telerik gives Private ReadOnly _products As Product() = New () {New Product() With { _ .Name = "Melon", _ .Category = "Fruits" _ }, New Product() With { _ .Name = "Pear", _ .Category = "Fruits" _ }, New Product() With { _ .Name = "Milk", _ .Category = "Beverages" _ }, Nw Product() With { _ .Name = "Coca Cola", _ .Category = "Beverages" _ }, New Product() With { _ .Name = "Pepsi Cola", _ .Category = "Beverages" _ }} which seems the most useful except it complains about a type expected here "New () {..." ive tried various things including the missing type in the New() as suggested in the comments but just cant figure it out... what am i missing? am i just being dumb? or isnt there and equivilent? This is all the code i have, as it is a simple copy n paste from the tutorial c# to the convertor sites. in the mean time ive used the developer fusion definition and manually populated the array elements in aother method. i.e. Private _products As Product() = {New Product(), New Product(), New Product(), New Product(), New Product()} Private Sub CreateInitialData() ' ================= ' since i couldnt figure out how to convert the initialisation of the ' "_products" array/collections whatever it is, i cheated and did this, ' seems to work ok though probably poor practice With _products(0) .Name = "Melon" .Category = "Fruits" End With ' etc.... End Sub background if it matters: vs2005, .net 2.0 Cheers all
