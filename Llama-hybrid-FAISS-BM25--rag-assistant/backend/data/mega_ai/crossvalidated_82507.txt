Estimating effect of binary event on multiple time series

I have multiple time series where at any point in the time series, an event can occur that I believe has an effect on the time series. This event can happen at different times for each of the different time series. How would I go about estimating the effect of this event on a time series where the event has not yet occurred? Ideally this would be some function of the time series itself. Thanks!
