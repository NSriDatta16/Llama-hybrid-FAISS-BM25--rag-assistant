Javadocs without HTML

Robert C. Martin's book Clean Code contains the following: HTML in source code comments is an abomination [...] If comments are going to be extracted by some tool (like Javadoc) to appear in a Web page, then it should be responsibility of that tool, and not the programmer, to adorn the comments with appropriate HTML. I kind of agree - source code surely would look cleaner without the HTML tags - but how do you make decent-looking Javadoc pages then? There's no way to even separate paragraphs without using a HTML tag. Javadoc manual says it clearly: A doc comment is written in HTML. Are there some preprocessor tools that could help here? Markdown syntax might be appropriate.
