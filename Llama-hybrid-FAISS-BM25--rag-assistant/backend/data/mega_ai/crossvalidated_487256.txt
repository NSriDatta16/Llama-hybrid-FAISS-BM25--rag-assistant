How random forest work? (Manual calculation)

I just learned about the concept of random forest (how the algorithm works) and I am confused on two things: If I use majority vote to classify something and I have 52 trees. I get result like this: Label 1 : 12 Label 2 : 20 Label 3 : 20 So, where will my data be classified? Label 2 or label 3? I created a random forest considering the information gain of each feature in every tree (I do it manually, not with program). One of my tree like this: Age have three attributes: middle_age, youth, and senior, but when I created node 1.1.2, data for youth age were absent, like this: My question is if I want to classify data that has features student = yes, credit = excellent, and age = youth, what label will I get? Can anyone explain it? I'm still a beginner in machine learning
