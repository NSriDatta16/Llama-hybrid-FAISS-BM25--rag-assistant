Implementing Logistic Regression in MATLAB

I have a data set of 13 attributes where some are categorical and some are continuous (can be converted to categorical). I need to use logistic regression to create a model that predicts the responses of a row and find the prediction's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Can/Should I use cross validation to divide my data set and get the results? Is there any code sample on how to go about doing this? (I'm new to all of this) Should I be using mnrfit/mnrval or glmfit/glmval? What's the difference and how do I choose?
