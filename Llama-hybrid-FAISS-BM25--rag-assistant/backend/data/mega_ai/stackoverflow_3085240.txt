Prototyping JavaScript native types, discouraged?

Is it a bad idea to prototype additional features in JavaScript's native types like Array, String, Number, etc? I think it would be great to have functionality like myArr.pop(), etc., but what if someday that becomes part of the ECMAScript x -- and differs from my implementation, so, it potentially breaks the entire software?
