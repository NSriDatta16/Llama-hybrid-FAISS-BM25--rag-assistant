Text analysis : What after term-document matrix?

I am trying to build predictive models from text data. I built document-term matrix from the text data (unigram and bigram) and built different types of models on that (like svm, random forest, nearest neighbor etc). All the techniques gave decent results, but I want to improve the results. I tried tuning the models by changing parameters, but that doesn't seem to improve the performance much. What are the possible next steps for me?
