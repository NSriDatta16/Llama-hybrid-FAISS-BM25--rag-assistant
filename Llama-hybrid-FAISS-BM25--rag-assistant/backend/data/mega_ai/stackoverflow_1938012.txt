Embedding OBJECT (Video) in RSS Feed while maintaining page flow

I'm trying to publish rss feed from a site. Some of the feed items contain embedded video. Now I know for sure that this won't show up in the feed when the feed item contains the object data enclosed within the item's tag. In fact feed validator shows a warning for the same. Googling for a solution to this problem, I came upon something called mRSS - an extension to RSS by Yahoo which allows you to embed videos inside feeds. However, from the examples they've provided, the embedding always occurs OUTSIDE of the description tags. My idea is to have the embedded video at par with the flow of the page, i.e. if a page contains a block of text and a video and some more text, then the feed item should preserve the order. The diagrams below should clarify the problem. What I get: == HTML Page == Text Video Text == Feed == Text Text Video as mRSS or enclosure What I want: == HTML Page == Text Video Text == Feed == Text Video as mRSS Text Is this possible with mRSS or any other methods? Has anyone successfully implemented this? Any help will be much appreciated.
