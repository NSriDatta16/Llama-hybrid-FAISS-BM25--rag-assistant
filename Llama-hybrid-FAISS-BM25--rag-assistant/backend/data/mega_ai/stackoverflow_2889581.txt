Suggestion: Why detect starting paragraph since the user can scroll between paragraphs. aa|bbbb|cc Here the user sees three paragraphs (1 full, 2 partial) as the scroll is continuous and not discrete with paragraphs. Unless manual scrolling is disabled and the user can only go left or right between paras with some custom controls such as: > then you can simply save the left scroll state and restore that when the page is reopened. You can also make use of the new localStorage API instead of cookies for saving data across sessions locally. Try this example on jsfiddle . Scroll and refresh or close and reopen page.
