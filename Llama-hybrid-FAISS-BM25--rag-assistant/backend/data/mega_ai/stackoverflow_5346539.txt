Sorry to bring up an old post, but I wanted to provide another answer for anyone that comes across this thread. I had the same problem. No matter what I did, the image just looked like it was complete black. I tried making multiple consecutive calls to cvQueryFrame and noticed that when I made 5 or more, I could see the image. So I started removing the calls one by one to see where the "breaking point" was. What I ended up finding was that the image got darker and darker as I removed each call. Making just a single call provided an image that was almost completely black, but if I looked very closely, I could make out my image. I tried 10 consecutive calls to test my theory, and sure enough, I was given a very bright image, considering that I'm in a dimly lit room. Hopefully, this was the same problem you were encountering. I don't know much about imaging, but it looks like multiple consecutive calls to cvQueryFrame increases the length of exposure for the camera. This definitely fixes the problem, though it doesn't seem like the most elegant solution. I'm going to see if I can find a parameter that will increase the exposure, or perhaps some other parameter that will brighten up my images. Good luck!
