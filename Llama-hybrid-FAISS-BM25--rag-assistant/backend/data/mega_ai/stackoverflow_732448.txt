WebResource.axd and HTTP Headers

Our site just moved from .NET 1.1 to .NET 3.5, and in the process updated our 3rd party server controls. One of these packages uses javascript provided via WebResource.axd. These are included as normal > tags. Watching the traffic, however, I see that these javascript files are coming across with headers that prevent client-side caching. And we're talking a lot of javascript. The headers in question: Cache-control: no-cache, no-store pragma: no-cache Expires: -1 Are these headers configurable in .NET somewhere? Can I intercept these requests short of building an HttpModule? Is this something I can blame the control vendor for? > Thanks, Baron
