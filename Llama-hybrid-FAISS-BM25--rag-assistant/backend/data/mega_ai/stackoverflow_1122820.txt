You're doing an aggregate. Since the aggregate is defined for 0-n rows (in this case, 0 rows yields null), you will always get one result back (exactly one in this case). To put it another way, you're not asking for rows from the table--you're asking for the average of one column in the table and that's what you're getting back. Getting anything other than one row in this case would be weirder. If you had asked for non-aggregated columns, too, e.g. SELECT Salesperson, AVG(Sale) FROM Sales GROUP BY Salesperson then I would expect you to get no rows back because there wouldn't be anything to satisfy the non-aggregate selects.
