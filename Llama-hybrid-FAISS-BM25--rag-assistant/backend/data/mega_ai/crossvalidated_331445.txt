Hypothesis test between means of week and weekend patterns of the same time series

I have a data set with phone calls, that contains the caller id and call duration. I want to test the hypothesis that the call duration during the week is smaller than the call duration during the weekend. I was thinking about using the Welch t-test but as the same caller can do calls on week days and weekends, I believe that I canÂ´t assume iid. The time series is autocorrelated, what complicates the matter. Would ANOVA help in this case?
