Identifying software and version range in a sentence

I have sentences similar to the following format This vulnerability happened in Firefox 1.x before 1.8 , Safari 2.x before 2.8 . Given the above sentence, I want to extract a dictionary {Firefox: 1.0-1.8, Safari: 2.0-2.8} Problem is how should I identify the version range with the software they belong to, using NLP techniques?
