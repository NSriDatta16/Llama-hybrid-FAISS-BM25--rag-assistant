Your new table rows aren't draggable because you haven't integrated them into your drag and drop object. They remain static HTML while your original rows are all fancy and interactive because you called .tableDnD() on them. See if calling .tableDnD on your new rows works, or update .tableDnD to use .live() . From the .live() page: Description: Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. The .live() documentation page describes precisely the issue you are having, well worth a look!
