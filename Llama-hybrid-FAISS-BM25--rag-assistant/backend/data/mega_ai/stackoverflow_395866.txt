Our bug tracking system is one of the two essential links between my company and our customers ("live" product reviews where existing customers are encouraged to suggest improvements and user interface tweaks being the other). A bug tracking system must, first and foremost, encourage trackable "dialogs" with your customers. It must answer the question "Have you fixed the problem (defined broadly) that I have been having yet?" It must have (in no particular order): A short description of the problem or feature request (the title) Room for an extended description The ability to attach files/images (screenshots) The ability to prioritize bugs/features The ability to categorize entries as bugs, features, inquiry, etc. The ability to assign bugs/features to areas (UI, database, documentation, etc.) he ability to assign bugs/features to products (we track bugs on five products) The ability to assign bugs/features to releases ("to be fixed in version 5.1") The ability to assign bugs/features to people (developers/writers) The ability to assign bugs/features to customers (reporters) The ability to re-assign to a different person (developer) The ability to Resolve bugs/features (mark them as finished and ready for testing) The ability to mark resolution status (fixed, won't fix, can't reproduce, etc.) The ability to Close bugs/features (take them off list after resolution & testing) The ability to Reopen bugs/features (restore to "Open" if testing fails) The ability to inform customers the bug has been resolved (e.g. via email) Date and Time stamp on every step (Open, Resolve, Close, Re-open) The ability to report on the number of Open bugs! (how close to release are we?) The ability to show bug reports versus resolutions The ability to search on bugs/features by date, priority, product, person, etc. The ability to list and sort bugs for easy scanning! Those are the things that we typically use in our system (FogBugz). While this may seem like a long list, we really do use every feature that I've listed here!
