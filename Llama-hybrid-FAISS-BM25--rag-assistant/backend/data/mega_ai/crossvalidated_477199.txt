n all examples on Wikipedia, if we have an original sample of size N, all the resampling should be done to the size N as well. Is this the standard approach? Yes. This is the method outlined in the original paper (Leo Breiman, "Random Forests", Machine Learning volume 45, pages 5-32 (2001)), or Hastie et al Elements of Statistical Learning (section 15.2). Or is it sometimes acceptable to create resampled data that has larger or smaller number of observations than the original sample? This is exposed as an option within sklearn via the max_samples parameter. Some related discussion: Can we use bootstrap samples that are smaller than original sample? And when we resample data for a random forest model, which metric of the original data do we look at when creating bootstrap samples? Bootstrap samples are constructed by sampling with replacement where each observation has probability $\frac{1}{n}$ of being selected. There's no metric construction involved to pick and choose samples.
