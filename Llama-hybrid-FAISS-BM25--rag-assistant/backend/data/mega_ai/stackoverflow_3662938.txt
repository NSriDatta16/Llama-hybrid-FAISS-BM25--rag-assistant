As Robert suggested, you can avoid saving a changed record by canceling the before update event. The code would look something like this: Private Sub Form_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer) Me.Undo Cancel = True End Sub However, that approach requires you discard any changes you've made to the record before you can move off it. Without Me.Undo , you can cancel the update, but Access won't allow you to move to a different record. You must either save or discard the changes to the current record before moving to another. If you want to move to another record but not discard changes first, I think you need to try a disconnected recordset. It's an ADO recordset you create in memory, not bound to any data source. You can add a command button to save your changes on command. If it sounds useful, see this article by Danny Lesandrini at Database Journal: Create In-Memory ADO Recordsets
