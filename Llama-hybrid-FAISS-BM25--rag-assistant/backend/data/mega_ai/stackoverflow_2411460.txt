I've implemented Pearl's belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian Networks. It supports loopy propagation as well, as it will terminate when the informed belief values converge to within 0.001. All the code is in Java, and it may be found in my Google code pen-ui svn repo. This doesn't explicitly make a factor graph. The class "Support" has a main function, and a couple static methods that create small networks that you can play with. In particular I implemented the three-node Burlar-FreightTruck-Alarm network found in Neapolitan's book, and my numbers check out. (No promises beyond that!)
