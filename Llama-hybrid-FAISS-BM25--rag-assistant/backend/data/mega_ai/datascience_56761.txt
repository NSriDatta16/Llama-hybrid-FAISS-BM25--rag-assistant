Representation options of strings (keywords/topics) in models

What are all the possible ways to represent keywords in a machine learning model? The two I am aware of are: one hot encoding, using a static index. vector representation, using an embedding layer. We have a specific problem where we are doing client side (browser) ml and need to convert text data into something the model can consume without sending it over to the server. EDIT: (comment clarification) The text data is extracted from the page on which our script loads, we then want to run a model locally on the browser - using text based features from the page (ideally). We are minimising in all elements any data needed to sent to the server. In terms of model, that is not defined at this stage, also this question primary concerned with representation of text based features.
