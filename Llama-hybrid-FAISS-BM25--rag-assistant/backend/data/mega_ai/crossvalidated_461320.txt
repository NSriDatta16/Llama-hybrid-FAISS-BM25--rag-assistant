Breusch-Pagan Test for Heteroskedasticity, what is the correct form of the null hypothesis?

For the Breusch-Pagan Test, under pg. 4 of this resource It claims that the null is $$ H_0: E(u\mid X) = \sigma^2 $$ But here it is stated that the null can be written as $$ H_0: \delta_1 = \delta_2 = \ldots = \delta_k $$ where the $\delta$ 's come from regressing the error terms $\epsilon$ in an OLS regression against $$ \epsilon^2 =\delta_0 + \delta_1X_1 + \ldots + \delta_kX_k + e $$ where $e \sim N(0,1)$ Furthermore, I have seen that the original paper states $$ H_0: \delta_1 = \delta_2 = \ldots = \delta_k = 0 $$ what is the difference between all these nulls? thanks.
