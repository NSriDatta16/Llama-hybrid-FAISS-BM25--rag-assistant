SQL Server Agent 2005 job runs but no output

Essentially I have a job which runs in BIDS and as as a stand lone package and while it runs under the SQL Server Agent it doesn't complete properly (no error messages though). The job steps are: 1) Delete all rows from table; 2) Use For each loop to fill up table from Excel spreasheets; 3) Clean up table. I've tried this MS page (steps 1 & 2), didn't see any need to start changing from Server side security. Also SQLServerCentral.com for this page , no resolution. How can I get error logging or a fix? Note I've reposted this from Server Fault as it's one of those questions that's not pure admin or programming. I have logged in as the proxy account I'm running this under, and the job runs stand alone but complains that the Excel tables are empty?
