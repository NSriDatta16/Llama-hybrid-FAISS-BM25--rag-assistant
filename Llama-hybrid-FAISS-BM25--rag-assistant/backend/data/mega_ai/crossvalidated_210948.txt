Statistical significance is used to generalize sample data to the average mean of the population. If your population were those 8 people, then you don't need to worry about statistical significance; we know the groups are different. What you may care about more in a situation like this is practical significance , which is context dependent. For example lets say 5 and 10 signified the number of minutes it took the two groups to run a mile: 1) If you were a track coach, then there would be a great deal of practical significance. 2) If you were trying to predict if one of the groups will be unable to walk 3 miles, the practical significance would be low (10 minutes is a decent time to run a mile, so both groups are in shape). 3) If you were hiring typists, there is no practical significance (unless those typists run around a lot). Practical significance always has to be answered in context of why we are analyzing the data.
