Experiment design - Two sample t test vs Paired t test

This is the first time I am designing an A/B experiment and I have read up all I could but still not completely clear on making a decision. It would be really great if the pros here could provide some guidance on the below setup or point me in the right direction We are building a new capability that will enhance the productivity of employees. Let's say we have 100 sellers. We want to pilot this out in the next quarter to measure the impact using Experiment and Control group (50 sellers each, randomly chosen). I see two options from here on. Run the pilot and compare the productivity metric (let's say average revenue generated per seller) between the Pilot and non-pilot users. (two sample t-test) Run the pilot and compare the productivity metric for the Pilot users in the prior quarter vs quarter of the pilot period. (paired t-test) These sellers are organized by geographical regions, so a sale for one seller does not effect the sale for other users i.e. they do not directly compete with one another.
