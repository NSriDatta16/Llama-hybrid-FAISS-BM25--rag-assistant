Inventory forecasting algorithm for wines?

I'm trying to figure out a good inventory forecasting algorithm for wine sales. I have the following characteristics so far: Wine sales are cyclical and not seasonal Have incomplete time series: not every day/week are there sales It should be sensitive to change and outliers: there could be one order with 20 bottles of wine, or 5 orders with 4 bottles each. Trying to forecast sales into a specific amount of days in the future. Tried linear regression to predict if the sales trend is going up or down, which gave somewhat accurate predictions, but in many cases it was way off, even for three years worth of sales data.
