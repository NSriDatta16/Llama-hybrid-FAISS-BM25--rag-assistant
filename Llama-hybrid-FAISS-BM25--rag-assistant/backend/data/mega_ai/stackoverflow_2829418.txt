"working as a software developer for almost a year" Remain calm. The "long run" is 30 or 40 years of a working life. If you're like the above-average people I've met, you'll be just able to produce software that's good enough to help your company get ahead. Until dumb management subverts things. If you're like the rest of us, you'll spend your career struggling to chase after the above-average folks.
