your selectors in the jquery are looking for id's... $("#op4").append(document.createTextNode(op4[i])); ^ is looking for an id of 'op4' whereas your markup has the fifth paragraph with a class of 'op4'... maybe try changing either the jquery or markup so that the selectors match. Not sure if this is an oversight a fresh pair of eyes might have caught here. Good Luck fixing!
