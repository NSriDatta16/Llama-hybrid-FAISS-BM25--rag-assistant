First of all: NEAT is an algorithm that is usually used for reinforcement learning. I guess it won't work very well in your case. You should rather find a good network architecture by cross-validation and train your network with stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient, ... Since it is just a fitness function it usually does not matter if it has an upper bound. You almost certainly will not find a perfect solution in every classification problem. So you should think about another stop criterion than "find the maximal fitness". However, you could take -E. Its upper bound is 0.
