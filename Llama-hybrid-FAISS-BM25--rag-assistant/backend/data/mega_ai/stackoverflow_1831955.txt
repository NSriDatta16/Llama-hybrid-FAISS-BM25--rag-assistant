PowerShell: an elegant way to create closures

Keith Hill explained me that blocks in PowerShell are not closures and that to create closures from blocks I have to call method .GetNewClosure() . Is there any elegant way to create closures from blocks? (e.g. create a wrapping function, an alias?, ...) Example: { block } ${ closure } # ???
