If you want to use Python, you can use the scikit-learn , which relies on Scipy. See the documentation for an example of the logistic regression: http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_logistic_path.html This implementation is based on liblinear, thus it scales reasonably well. In addition, it implements L1 and L2 penalization, for sparse or shrunk regression, when dealing with high-dimensional data.
