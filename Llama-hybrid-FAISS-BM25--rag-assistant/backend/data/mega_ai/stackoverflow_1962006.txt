Any database can store text, so the immediate option would be to store the xml as text. But some databases have added an XML data type in order to allow for storing the XML, checking that the schema validates (proper structure, not a fragment), and retrieving values from the XML stored in the database with XPATH/XQUERY syntax. Support differs between Oracle 10g+, SQL Server 2000+, Postgres, MySQL 5.1+ so we'd need more information before recommending a specific one. I am really confused between xml db and db that support xml Based on this information from Wikipeidia about XML Databases , it comes down to what each database product supports. SQL Server and Oracle support native XML at their respective versions.
