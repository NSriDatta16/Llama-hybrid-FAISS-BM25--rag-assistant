Why are interfaces used so prolifically in .NET apps?

Recently I began working on a largish mainstream project to deliver a public-facing e-commerce platform for a client I cannot reveal. I'm working with seasoned developers with many years experience across many projects in the City of London. It seems everyone is into interfaces in a big way. It's overwhelming and I now doubt everything I've done before, which is to use abstract base classes. .NET is not COM, it's not an interface-based programming platform. Am I missing something or is this just herd mentality - the years of IProgramming have proliferated as accepted norms in .NET land? Thanks Luke
