How can I make Excel's MIN function ignore zeroes in a set?

In Excel, I have the following formula =(MIN(H69,H52,H35,H18)*(1/H18))*10 that is supposed to return the MIN of a range, and divide it by the current cell (*(1/H18) ), then multiply by 10. I am having difficulty with adding a type of NULLIF statement. I want to be able to have (the possibility for) blank rows, and have the MIN function ignore zero/blank fields while selecting the next lowest value (all are between 1.0-0.1). Is there a modifier i can apply to the MIN function to make it not compare zeroes in the MIN set? Is there a better function than MIN to use? Here is the arrangement: Please remember to include the syntax for where the MIN 's set goes The reason for the H69,H52,H35,H18 using commas is that these are embedded, individual cells that are arranged for visual presentation as well. Using a range, or colon/semi-colon operators don't appear to work for this purpose (see pic). This is to prevent the following situation: users will need to eliminate fields that are zeros from the form, theres 2 formula edits per entry, averaging 4 entries per use, so 8 possible errors per form use...
