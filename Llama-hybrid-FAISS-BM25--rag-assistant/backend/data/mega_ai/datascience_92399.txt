I suggest you use facebook's faiss . It is a library for similarity search, which can be used to compute kNN on large vector collections. From facebook's own numbers : With approximate indexing, a brute-force k-nearest-neighbor graph (k = 10) on 128D CNN descriptors of 95 million images of the YFCC100M data set with 10-intersection of 0.8 can be constructed in 35 minutes on four Maxwell Titan X GPUs, including index construction time. Billion-vector k-nearest-neighbor graphs are now easily within reach. One can make a brute-force k-NN graph (k = 10) of the Deep1B data set with 10-intersection of 0.65 in under 12 hours on four Maxwell Titan X GPUs, or 0.8 in under 12 hours on eight Pascal P100-PCIe GPUs. Lower-quality graphs can be produced in under 5 hours on the Titan X configuration.
