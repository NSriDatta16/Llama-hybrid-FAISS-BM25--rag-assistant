I assume that you are thinking of a simple structure in which each of the 20 items loads on exactly 1 factor. Suppose items 1-10 load on factor 1, and 11-20 load on factor 2. Then you could average items 1-10, average items 11-20 for each individual and calculate their correlation. Alternatively, you can estimate factor scores for the factors and obtain an estimate of the correlation that way. If you do a CFA, allowing the correlation between factors to be free, the software will estimate that parameter for you. Is this your question? So yes ... these two statistics will be different. You can think of each item as being a noisy estimator of factor 1 or factor 2 (as appropriate). Taking the average will reduce the noise, but you still have noisy observations. Adding noise to a pair of variables reduces their correlation, so the first statistic will be biased downwards as an estimate of the correlation you seek. This is true even if the factor loadings are the same. In confirmatory factor analysis, you estimate the various components of the model (uniqueness variances, loadings, factor covariances) through maximum likelihood (or some other method), so you end up actually estimating the parameter of interest (the factor correlation). As a bonus, you can still get the covariance of the factors in a more complex model, where items load on more than 1 factor. Sum scores would totally not work in that case, but the covariance of the factors will emerge from the optimization.
