Extracting a part of string in java

I am having the following data in a text file: proc sort data=oneplan.cust_duplicates(dbindex=yes) out=mibatch.cust_duplicates; from oneplan.fsa_authorised_agencies (dbindex=yes) set oneplan.fsa_agency_permissions(where=(regulated_activity in ('103','106','107','108'))); set oneplan.customer_flags(where=(flag_id in(54,14,34))); from oneplan.document_history (dbindex=yes) set oneplan.product_references; proc sort data=oneplan.fast_track_log(where=(upcase(business_entry)="INCOME VERIFICATION FAST TRACKED")) out=fast_track_log; set oneplan.product_characteristics(rename=(value=filler)where=(characteristic_type="OFFS" )); set oneplan.mtg_offset_benefits (where=(modified_date between &extractdate and &batchcutoff) from oneplan.mtg_payment_options a; from oneplan.acc_retention_risk acr; from oneplan.acc_retention_risk_hist acr; from oneplan.account_repay_veh rv; from oneplan.repay_vehicle_map rvm; from oneplan.frozen_accounts as fa left join mibatch.accounts as a Now i need to fetch the part from each line which starts with oneplan. and ends with a space. Also if the line has two oneplan. then each must be extracted separately. Example: agtut oneplan.m htyutu oneplan.j hgyut i need the output as: oneplan.m and oneplan.j kindly give me suggestions in doing this please...
