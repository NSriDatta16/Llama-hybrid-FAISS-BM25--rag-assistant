Loading HTML straight from ajax reqest, or clone templates and insert data with javascript?

I'm working on a forum like page, where changing between pages of a thread pulls in html from an ajax request and inserts it into the div container. My question, is would it be faster to just get the basic data through json retrieval, and then do something like cloning a message template and inserting the needed data into that template?
