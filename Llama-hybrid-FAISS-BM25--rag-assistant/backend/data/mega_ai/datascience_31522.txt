the input is simply not enough to correctly predict the output, the model can not learn the output conditional distribution P(y|x). Either you have to add more features to the Naive NN model, e.g concat the previous x to the current x to predict the current y or use RNN like models to model the problem as p(y_t|x_t,x_t-1,x_t-2,....x_t0) see Time Series Prediction with LSTM
