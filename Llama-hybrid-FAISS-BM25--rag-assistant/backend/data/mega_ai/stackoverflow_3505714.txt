Have you looked at the Microsoft DSS / CCR framework? It's a SOA, Concurrent framework initially developed on the robotics platform. We previously used it to create a traffic simulator. It's not open per-se but its not to expensive, and I believe free for academia. You would have to write the logic to create parallel jobs, but this in theory should not be to difficult. The framework has a bunch of management tools. Hadoop is also another alternative and probably what I'd recommend. The storage requests you made are more viable with this solution using the hadoop file system. http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HadoopStreaming Is there a .NET equivalent to Apache Hadoop? Also in the above SO thread is the myspace technology http://code.google.com/p/qizmt/
