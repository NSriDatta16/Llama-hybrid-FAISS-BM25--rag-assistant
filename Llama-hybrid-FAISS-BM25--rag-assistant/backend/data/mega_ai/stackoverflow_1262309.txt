I recommend leveraging SVN export instead of checkout. This way, you will not expose any of the SVN files to the world. It also generally creates a cleaner folder structure. I have leveraged rsync before when moving files between stage and production. My typical deployment proceeds as follows: backup production site Restore from backup to stage server Lock the server down from all external IP addresses Export the code from the repository into a temp folder (optionally diff the two folders for small changes) rsyc files from the temp folder to the stage server folder Validate that only the files you expect to have changed have actually changed. Apply SQL scripts to the DB Test the upgrade Unlock the webserver Now, to deploy to production, replay these steps in fast forward. Using scripts make it much easier.
