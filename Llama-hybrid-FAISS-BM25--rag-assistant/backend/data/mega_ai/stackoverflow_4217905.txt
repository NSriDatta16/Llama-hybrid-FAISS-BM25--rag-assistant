Here is another neat little trick. The Application has a number of methods which are called to acquire paths. In particular the application has the method getDatabasePath with is used by SQLiteOpenHelper to construct the path. A custom application class can override these methods to provide different paths including paths in the getExternalStorageDirectory . The external storage is either application specific or public. There are methods, replacing the getExternalStorageDirectory mechanism, getExternalFilesDir() and getExternalStoragePublicDirectory() respectively.
