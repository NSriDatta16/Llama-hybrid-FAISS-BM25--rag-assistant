Your suggestion doesn't make sense. If your response variable is 0/1, then you should use logistic regression or probit. (If you want help understanding the distinction between them, it may help you to read my answer here: Difference between logit and probit models .) You can include interactions as you like. The model output will come with Wald tests of the parameters without your having to do anything else.
