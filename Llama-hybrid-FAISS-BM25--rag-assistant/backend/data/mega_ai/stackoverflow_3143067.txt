Can a custom component call PopUpManager.addPopUp on itself? How does one put the pop-up logic inside the component?

I'm trying to organise my code better and figured it would be good to place the pop-up logic within the component that's being popped-up. However, I can't seem to do this without causing one error or another. I also need to make the pop-up modal. I'm doing something along these lines (psuedo code): Can anyone help?
