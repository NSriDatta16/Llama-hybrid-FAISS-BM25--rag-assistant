(Sorry for the previous answer with 1024, a mistaken assumption) To your question of converting from kB to MB, you can surely assume by SI standard: 1 MB = 1000 kB Ergo, divide by 1000. For the unconvinced, I encourage you to read this . Since software like Microsoft Windows expresses storage quantities in multiples of 1024 bytes, change your code to: dblMax = dblMax/(1024*1024) MessageBox.Show("Largest file in .Net folder is " & vbCrLf & strMax & vbCrLf & dblMax.ToString("N0")) (since you are printing dblMax & your file size is in bytes, not kB)
