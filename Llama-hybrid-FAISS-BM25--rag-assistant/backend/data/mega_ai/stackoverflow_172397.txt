How do I use BGGA closures prototype on standard Mac JDK6?

I am trying to use the BGGA closures prototype with an existing JDK 6 (standard on Mac OS X Leopard). The sample code I'm compiling is from a BGGA tutorial: public static void main(String[] args) { // function with no arguments; return value is always 42 int answer = { => 42 }.invoke(); System.out.println(answer); } I have tried the following, and none work: Copied closures.jar to /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home/lib Ran javac with -Xbootclasspath/a:/path/to/closures.jar Ran javac with -J-Xbootclasspath/a:/path/to/closures.jar Tried from eclipse ganymede by defining my own system library and attaching it to my project with code utilizing BGGA. In all four cases, I get compilation errors, indicating that the compiler did not pick up closures.jar on the bootstrap classpath. I'd really like to get this working from eclipse, or at the very least maven. Thanks!
