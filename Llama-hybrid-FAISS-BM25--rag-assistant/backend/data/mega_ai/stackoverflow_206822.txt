Response from Microsoft: As discussed in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789039.aspx , there are two methods outlined in the Soap 1.1 specification for custom fault codes: (1) Using the "dot" notation as you describe (2) Defining entirely new fault codes Unfortunately, the "dot" notation should be avoided, as it's use is discouraged in the WS-I Basic Profile specification. Essentially, this means that there is no real equivalent of the Soap 1.2 fault SubCode when using Soap 1.1. So, when generating faults, you'll have to be cognizant of the MessageVersion defined in the binding, and generate faultcodes accordingly. Since "sender" and "receiver" are not vaild fault codes for Soap 1.1, and there is no real equivalent of a fault subcode, you shouldn't use the CreateSenderFaultCode and CreateReceiverFaultCode methods when generating custom fault codes for Soap 1.1. Instead, you'll need to define your own faultcode, using your own namespace and name: FaultCode customFaultCode = new FaultCode(localName, faultNamespace);
