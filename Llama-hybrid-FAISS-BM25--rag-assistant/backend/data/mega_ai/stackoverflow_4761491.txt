Although my answer will stray away from programming and into the realm of calculus, it should be noted that you can solve your problem both without recursion or a loop since you can exactly solve for an equation v(t) using integration. It appears that you are modeling Stokes' drag on a falling body, so you can use the fourth formula from this integration table to compute a final velocity vFinal that is achieved after falling for a time tDelta given a starting velocity vInitial . Here is the resulting formula you would get: vFinal = 9.8*m/c + (vInitial - 9.8*m/c)*exp(-c*tDelta/m); This will be a more accurate answer than approximating vFinal by making sequential steps forward in time (i.e. the Euler method , which can display significant errors or instabilities when the time steps that are taken are too large).
