Why do I need bag composition to calculate OOB error of combined random forest model?

Could someone please explain me the answer of the question already given here: Combining randomForests in R, why are the err.rate, mse and rsq components NULL I do not understand the phrase "clip it to out-of-bag" from model$inbag.
