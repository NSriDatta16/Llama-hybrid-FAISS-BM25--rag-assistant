In Codeigniter you have a concept of a Controller and a Model, which each has their own separate folder. They have setup their main router class such that it searches for corresponding controller and model files, it can even go recursive. This has nothing to do with any design pattern, it is just a folder organization. I find this interesting because the framework makes an object of the User object and the programmer does not. Yup, they have created a lot of stuff ready-made and to be used any time you want. The User class is used to control whole user system. Basically , as you said, the main design pattern used is MVC, rest of the things are controlled by different core classes for a specific task.
