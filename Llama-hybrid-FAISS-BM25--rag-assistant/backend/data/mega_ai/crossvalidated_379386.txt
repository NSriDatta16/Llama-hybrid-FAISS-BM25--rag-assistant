Random Forest Regression - R^2 score or MSE for Comparison

I trained a Random Forest Model for Regression and till now I compared the R^2 Score between the different trained models, but as I have read a few articles that the R^2 Score might not be the best to compare the different models I thought about doing it with the RMSE of the model. What are your thoughts about doing it this way and is there any better way of compare models against each other? How can I test if my prediciton is close to the desired value, which number would be better than the R^2 Score? Thank you, R
