A very non-mathematical intuition: A has a higher accuracy than B, but a lower log-loss: it means A is shy, i.e. its probabilities tend to me closer to 0.5 than 0/1. B is bolder, i.e. its probalities are closer to 0/1, but makes more mistakes than A. A has a higher accuracy than B, but a lower AUROC: it means A is "better" than B for the threshold with which the accuracy was computed, but when considering all thresholds on average B is "better".
