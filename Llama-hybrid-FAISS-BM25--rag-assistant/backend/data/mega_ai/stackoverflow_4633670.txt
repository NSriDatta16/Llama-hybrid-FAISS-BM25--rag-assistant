Magento API limitations

I'm currently working on an upload tool for a client using .Net to upload via the XML-RPC calls. I am currently hitting two brick walls. One is creating configurable products. Have I missed some documentation, is this possible? The other problem is adding data into drop down attributes for things like size. Is this possible via the API? Thanks
