ASP.NET MVC View - Display something base on Authorize

Sorry if you found that I'm asking stupid questions. But I'm new to asp.net and I'm facing a problem: I'm writing a simple blog to learn asp.mvc, and I want to display an Edit link next to the blog Title if the user is logged in. Currently I have to add the currentUser object to Model and check the IsLogged properties to decide if I should display the Edit link or not. The problem is if there is no logged in user, I have to create an fake currentUser to insert to Model in other to make it work. What's asking is there is any other elegant way to do this. For example we can use [Authorize] attribute in Controller to allow access to an Action or not. There is any similar way to apply for the View ?
