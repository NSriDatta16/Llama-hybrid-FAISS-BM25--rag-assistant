Try embedding and instancing the symbol from inside the swf, not the entire swf: [Embed(source = "../assets/next_button.swf", symbol"MyButton")] You will obviously need to replace MyButton with the actual symbol name of the button. That should give you more direct access to it, since it won't be wrapped by a Loader .
