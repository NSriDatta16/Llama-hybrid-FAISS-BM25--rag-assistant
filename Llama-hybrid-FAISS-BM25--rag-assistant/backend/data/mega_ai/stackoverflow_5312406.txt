Yes you can do this. Try out jquery, I think is already included (at leas in wordpress). "Break into" the layot part add js file of your own that makes an AJAX call to a url and returns some HTML from there and puts that content into a certain HTML component (a div that you also add there by your self with a certain id). User clicks a button, triggers the ajax call and voila. There are also complicated ways like developing your own plugin that makes SOAPCalls and integrated with the wordpress/drupal etc. But as you say that you are a desktop developer this is the closest aproach to you knwoledge and perspective. AJAX LOAD WITH JQUERY
