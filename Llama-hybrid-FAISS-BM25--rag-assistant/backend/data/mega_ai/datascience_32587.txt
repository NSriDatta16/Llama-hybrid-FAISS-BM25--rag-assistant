Does matrix shape for training/testing sets have to be in a particular order?

I've noticed that in the Andrew Ng Deep Learning course that for image analysis he always has X_train matrices in the shape of [height, width, 3, num_inputs] , or, if flattened, [height X width X 3, num_inputs] . He also has his y_train as [1, num_inputs] . To me, it is more intuitive to flip these so that X_train is [num_inputs, height X width X 3] and y_train is [num_inputs, 1] . Is there any motivating reason or justification that it has to be the way he does it or is it just preference? Is this a standard or does it vary?
