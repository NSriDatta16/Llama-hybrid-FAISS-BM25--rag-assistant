Compound Poisson Distributions: When, Why, and How To Split the Problem

I've just stumbled upon the Compound Poisson Distribution (CPD) and it seems to be precisely what I need. For the purposes of this post, let's suppose I have a store that sells many items of different cost (often at a bit of a discount) and I want to be able to model the total daily revenue. In fact let's say I have 10000 such stores, which to varying degrees have quite a lot in common. One reasonable approach to dealing with this problem would be two separately fit multi-level models to predict number of sales per day (Poisson) and average revenue per sale (Gamma or Normal (is Normal really uncommon to use with a CPD?)). This would have the advantage of separately selecting relevant features and perhaps slightly easier goodness of fit analysis. Another reasonable approach would be to directly fit a CPD to my total daily revenue. I feel like in this scenario, I can more accurately enforce any objectives I have as opposed to trying to factor those objectives; after all at the end of the day I care about accurately predicting revenue. I don't want one day where I sell a million cow tails for little revenue to have an incredible effect on the model. In addition to a response, any resources on CPDs, especially pertaining to multilevel models and the impacts of various underlying "weight" distributions, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot. P.S. @whuber, haven't seen you since my days in the problem solving group. Hope all is going well. Thanks for your insightful comments here.
