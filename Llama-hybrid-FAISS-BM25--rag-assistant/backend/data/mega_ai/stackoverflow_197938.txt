Django with custom, non-SQL service to store models?

Can I have a custom service providing the storage of the models I use in Django? That service would not be speaking SQL. I would like to build a web frontend to a system that consists of multiple services linked with a network based IPC, one of which provides an interface to commonly used, persistent objects (stored in a database). The real question here is not whether it's possible but whether it would make sense. For example, if I end up inheriting models.Model and overwriting every single method, skipping all the rest of django.db, I guess it wouldn't. The object service might even end up being implemented in Django, too, but the communication between it and the web frontend would not be using SQL.
