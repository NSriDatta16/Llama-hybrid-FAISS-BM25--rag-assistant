The IBM J9 JDK offers the said ability via the -Xdump flag ; this is the preferred way of registering dump agents. A typical way of configuring the JVM to produce heap dumps on OOME is to catch all Out Of Memory Errors thrown by the application or by the JVM, and to prepare the dump for "walking" (with a heap inspector). -Xdump:system+heap+java:events=systhrow+user,filter=java/lang/OutOfMemoryError,request=exclusive+prepwalk+compact Ref: Eclipse Memory Analyzer Guide The JAVA_DUMP_OPTS environment variable can also be used. More information on this is available in the IBM JDK diagnostics guide . EDIT For the purpose of running a command on a OOME, the tool option needs to be specified in the -Xdump option.
