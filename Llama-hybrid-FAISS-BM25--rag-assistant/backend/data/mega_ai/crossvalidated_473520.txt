The variance of the $(n+1)$ st observation after looking at a normal sample of $n$ is $Var(X_{n+1} + \bar X) = \sigma^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{n}.$ But the population variance $\sigma^2$ is estimated by the sample variance $S_X^2 =\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2.$ So if I have a sample of $n = 50$ test scores with $\bar X = 102.4,\,S = 10.7,$ then a 95% prediction interval for the next randomly chosen text score is $$\bar X \pm 2.01(10.7)\sqrt{1/50+1},$$ which is $(102.4,102.6),$ according to your formula for the prediction interval. [Computations in R.] q = qt(.975, 49); q [1] 2.009575 pm = c(-1,1); a = 102.4; s = 10.7; n = 50 a + pm*q*sqrt(1/n + 1) 2.5% 97.5% 102.400 102.602 Remember, that without the initial sample of 50 test scores you wouldn't know that the average test score is around $\bar X=102.4.$ And that's a big clue toward guessing the 51st score.
