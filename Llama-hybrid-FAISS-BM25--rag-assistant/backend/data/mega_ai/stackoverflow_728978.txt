Groovy: How do I sort an ArrayList of String:s in length-of-string order?

How do I sort an ArrayList of String 's in length-of-string order in Groovy? Code: def words = ['groovy', 'is', 'cool'] // your code goes here: // code that sorts words in ascending length-of-word order assert words == ['is', 'cool', 'groovy'] There are certainly more than one way to do it - so I'll grant the answer to the person who provides the most elegant solution.
