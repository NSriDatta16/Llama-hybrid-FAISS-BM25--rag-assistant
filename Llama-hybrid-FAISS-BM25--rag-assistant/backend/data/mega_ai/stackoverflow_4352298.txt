Ok: when you're using this... url = Paperclip::Interpolations.interpolate('/:class/:id/:style.:extension', attachment, style || attachment.default_style) The '/:class/:id/:style.:extension' portion is what's creating your erroneous URL: /attachments/25/original.jpg?1291407855 I'm not sure exactly the best way to get the "projects/project_id" part into your url, but you need to do something like this: class Attachment There may be a more elegant way to do this, but I think this should get you on the right track. Hope it helps!
