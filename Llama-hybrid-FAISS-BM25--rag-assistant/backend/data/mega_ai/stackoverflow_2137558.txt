Given the vagueness of your question, I would say that it depends on the kind of information that either party would be accessing/inserting. As I understand it, the structure of your database should reflect the manner in which you are organizing your data, not necessarily the relationship between the users of your database. For example, you could have a separate tabled called "User Status" with 0->Reviewer, 1->Review-ee, and then list User Status as a foreign key in your Users table as a column that indicates whether a given User is a Reviewer or a Reviewee, thereby eliminating the need for separate User tables.
