xsl -xml fo file - entering table data to the xml

I have xsl-xml files that I turn into fop file (using FOP factory, javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory ) so eventually I can turn it into a PDF. Until now I had to enter only simple data, so in the xsl I would write something like: and so on. And when I transform it into fop file I get: Sales Contract for Mobile 100 etc... Now I have a situation that I need to display a table with data. How do I define the table template in XML and what do I have to add in the XML?
