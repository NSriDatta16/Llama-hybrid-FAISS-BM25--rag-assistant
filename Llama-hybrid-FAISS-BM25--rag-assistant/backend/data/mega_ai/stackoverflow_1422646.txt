If you prefer AWK ... awk -f logstrip.awk in.log > out.log where logstrip.awk looks something like # *** Simple AWK script to delete lines from log file *** # Rule: keep all lines except these that have their 2nd # field equal to "D" and their 7th field more than # current date time BEGIN { FS = "!"; #delimiter stopDate = systime(); # stopDate = 47001231000001; for test purposes deletedLineCtr = 0; #diagnostics counter, unused at this time } { if (match($2, "D") && ($7 should do the trick. Attention, however, your field #7 contains an odd date format. I think I recognize an recent epoch value (123...) but it is preceded by 4 apparently unrelated digit. These can easily be removed before comparing to StopDate
