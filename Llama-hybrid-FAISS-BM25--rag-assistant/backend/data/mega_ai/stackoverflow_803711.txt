Perhaps you need to implement some sort of polling agent that runs on a seperate thread and regularly tries to contact something listening on a remote server (or servers?). When it fails (or perhaps when a preset number of connection attempts fail) then fire an event. Same when it goes from a fail-succeed state. Your application would subscribe to these events and take action accordingly. Of course this may not be suitable for your scenario..
