Well-written (X)HTML should be semantically sound. What that means is that the tags you use should match the content that they contain. For example, an ordered list of elements should be contained within an tag, a paragraph of text in a tag, and a heading inside a tag. The tags used for grouping and layout in semantic (X)HTML are the and tags. Since the distinction of which tags to use where is a semantic distinction, there isn't an easy way to "automate" this. My recommendation is to pick up a book on semantic (X)HTML(I highly recommend Dan Cederholm's Bulletproof Web Design -- it's canonical in the field) and rewrite your code from the ground up. It should not be difficult.
