Time Series Analysis - Object in R

For a time series object (in terms of theory/concepts), do we have to have the data for each date? In some cases the customers do not make purchases/sales amounts during the same month. For example, I want to predict the sales for each customer based on their dates. I am missing some dates for sales, would this be a problem for prediction? The data below: > amount dates data data amount dates 1 10 2012-01-01 2 11 2012-02-01 3 50 2012-05-15 4 12 2012-08-15 5 30 2012-12-10 > ts(data) We can see that row 1 and 2 are consecutive, however 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 11th month are missing. Would this be a problem? Thanks!
