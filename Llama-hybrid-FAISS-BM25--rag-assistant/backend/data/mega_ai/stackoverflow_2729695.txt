Take a look at the Loading Page Fragments section. You can target sections of the page to be loaded by adding a selector to the url string. The .load() method, unlike $.get(), allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the url parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded. $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container'); When this method executes, it retrieves the content of ajax/test.html, but then jQuery parses the returned document to find the element with an ID of container. This element, along with its contents, is inserted into the element with an ID of result, and the rest of the retrieved document is discarded. $('#work').load(this.href + ' #this');
