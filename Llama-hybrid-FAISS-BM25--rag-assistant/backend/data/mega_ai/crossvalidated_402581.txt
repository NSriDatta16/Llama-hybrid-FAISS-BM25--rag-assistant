How to design an experiment to test the effect of a drug on subjective energy level

I am currently running an experiment to test the effect of a drug (ALCAR) on my energy level (measured using a subjective 5-point scale). My goal is to determine whether or not consuming this drug causes an increase in my energy level. I am taking four measurements at different times (08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00) every day. Each treatment (ALCAR and placebo) will go on for 28 days. If it helps, my data looks like this. I'm planning on using a t-test to calculate a p-value for the results. However, I'm uncertain about some of the details. Should I use a matched-pairs design, or a 2-sample design? Should I use n=112 (since there are four measurements per day) or n=28 (using the average of the day's four measurements for each data point)? I'd like to have as much power as possible without using invalid methods.
