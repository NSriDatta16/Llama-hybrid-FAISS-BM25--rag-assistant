Sync without scanning individual files?

Consider two directories: /home/user/music/flac /media/MUSIC/flac I would like the second directory (destination; a USB drive) to contain the same files and structure as the first directory (master). There are 3600+ files (59G in total). Every file is scanned using unison , which is painfully slow. I would rather it compare based on file name, size, and modification time. I think rsync might be better but the examples from the man pages are rather cryptic, and Google searches did not reveal any simple, insightful examples. I would rather not accidentally erase files in the master. ;-) The master list will change over time: directories reorganized, new files added, and existing files updated (e.g., re-tagging). Usually the changes are minor; taking hours to complete a synchronization strikes me as sub-optimal. What is the exact command to sync the destination directory with the master? The command should copy new files, reorganize moved files (or delete then copy), and copy changed files (based on date). The destination files should have their timestamp set to the master's timestamp.
