Ensembling and stacking are made to improve the model's predictive capacity. But your need here is to enable the model to predict a new Class. This doesn't happen in machine Learning unless you use your domain knowledge and infer that from the individual prediction. e.g. If I train a model to predict white color and another to train Black color, it doesn't mean it can predict grey color. For that - I need to train the model on grey color or deduce from the two predictions e.g. If probability ~0.6 for both then it might be grey etc. In your case - - Train on a dataset which have data for "Diabetes", "Hypertension", "Both", "None" classes - Or put some logic on the probability of the 2 models e.g. Individually good for both disease means good for a patient which is suffering from both. But I think, this will be a very big assumption.
