I guess you already saw this useful link: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html All you need to do is to save different variants under different folders, but with the same name: res/drawable-ldpi (36x36) res/drawable-mdpi (48x48) res/drawable-hdpi (72x72) You refer to them in your code through common resource name, but actual version used is adapted depending on the screen size of the device you are using.
