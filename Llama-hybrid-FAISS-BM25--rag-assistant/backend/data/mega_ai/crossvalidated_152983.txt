Sidhha, your problem as far as I can tell, arises largely out of using an ensemble model. In such a mixed model, MAPE from one of the underlying time series can affect the overall MAPE giving erroneous results. I would suggest that you try using a Symmetrical MAPE (sMAPE) or Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE). I am sure that the results will be consistent with the cumulative sums test that you are conducting.
