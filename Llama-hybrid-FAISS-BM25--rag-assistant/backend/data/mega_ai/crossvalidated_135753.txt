Multiple regression - how to deal with mixed linear and non-linear variables

Say I have a bunch of explanatory variables to predict a continuous independent variable. Below, a simple toy example: I think it would be easiest to do a log-log transform and proceed with linear regression. Looks like that the explanatory variables are relatively highly correlated, and there might be a high collinearity between them. This, I would take care of later via e.g., Lasso regression (or Ridge) feature selection algos Partial Least Squares Decision trees and feature importance Dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis But back to the log-log-transform; now, the data looks like this: To me, it looks like that x2, x3, and x4 are now better suited for a linear regression. However, x1 does not look "very linear" anymore. How would I best deal with x1 before I proceed?
