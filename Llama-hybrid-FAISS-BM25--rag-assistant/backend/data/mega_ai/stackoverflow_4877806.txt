I am uploading a load of images as they will be shown to user for different items. Its not a system where responsiveness is critical so its okay in terms of what I want. Though... public int getIdentifier (String name, String defType, String defPackage) Since: API Level 1 Return a resource identifier for the given resource name. A fully qualified resource name is of the form "package:type/entry". The first two components (package and type) are optional if defType and defPackage, respectively, are specified here. Note: use of this function is discouraged. It is much more efficient to retrieve resources by identifier than by name. They suggest using the resource id but if I want to add a file later on then I have to re-compile the app to include the extra file, this is where it bugs me, as the pic gets associated to an item that I have in a string array. So I can add items to the array but not the images without a change of the code. Surely there is a function to fix this?
