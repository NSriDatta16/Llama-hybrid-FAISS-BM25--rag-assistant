How to change plot size in nltk.plot()

I'm following along the NLTK book and would like to change the size of the axes in a lexical dispersion plot: import nltk from nltk.corpus import inaugural cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (target, fileid[:4]) # "[:4]" slices only the years of the speeches for fileid in inaugural.fileids() for word in inaugural.words(fileid) for target in ["liberty", "equality", "brotherhood"] if word.lower().startswith(target)) Because it gets very crowded otherwise: cfd.plot(title="French ideals in US-American speeches through time") the __doc__ doesn't seem to mention it: print(cfd.plot.__doc__) Plot the given samples from the conditional frequency distribution. For a cumulative plot, specify cumulative=True. (Requires Matplotlib to be installed.) :param samples: The samples to plot :type samples: list :param title: The title for the graph :type title: str :param conditions: The conditions to plot (default is all) :type conditions: list And I think there is nothing on it in the NLTK documentation ,nor the matplotlib documentation (where I figured the plot functionality comes from)
