yes, generally you can call any method (= function) from within any other method. function getVars($vars) { foreach ($vars as $key => $value) { doSomethingWithMyVars($key, $value) } } function doSomethingWithMyVars($key, $value) { $sql = 'SELECT this, that FROM mytable WHERE '.$key.' = '.$value; //get data } getVars($_GET); but attention, this is just exemplary code, you probably won't do it like that. Also the query wouldn't work for strings. it's just an example of how to call functions from within functions based on what your task seems to be more or less.
