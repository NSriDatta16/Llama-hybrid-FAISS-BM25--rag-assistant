The default XML parsing on the iPhone is pretty tragic compared with contemporary scripting languages. If you are doing serious parsing with complex objects with multiple levels of child objects, then god help you with NSXMLParser. I would recommend checking out TouchXML which offers a much more civilized solution that is closer to what you might see in a language like Python or Actionscript in terms of its implementation within your own source.
