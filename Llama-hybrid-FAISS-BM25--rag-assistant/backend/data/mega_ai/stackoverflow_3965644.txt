OnAnimationEnd does not work , and yes ive researched

Im reading a book "Pragmatics: Hello Android" and copy the code word for word and syntax is all correct because i get no errors but it does not do what i tell it to do on the onAnimationEnd.. it suppose to take me to my next activity but since that was not working i changed it to something simple like txtView.setText("ggag") just to see if it was even executing... and i noticed the way the book goes about it is slightly different.. Animation fadein = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this, R.anim.fade_in); fadein.setAnimationListener(new AnimationListener() { /*im thinking the problem is that it does all the work from within the setAnimationLIstener instead of like i have seen around where the methods onAnimationEnd , onAnimationRepeat are all done seprately outside of the setAnimationListener(new AnimationListener() {..all work is done here??... } */ @Override public void onAnimationEnd(Animation animation) { //startActivity(new Intent(splahActivity.this,menuActivity.class)); //the above line of code was not working so i added the line below //neither executes TextView topLogo = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.lblTop); topLogo.setText("dfsgsdfg"); } @Override public void onAnimationRepeat(Animation animation) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } @Override public void onAnimationStart(Animation animation) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } }); so yeah my onAnimationEnd code is never executed :(
