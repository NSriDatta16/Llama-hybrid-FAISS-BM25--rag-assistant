"Thus I want to convert $\beta_2$ such that it shows the value premium of diversification, i.e. the percentage change of firm value for a diversified firm (if $D$ is a dummy)... " "Percentage change" is essentially a mark-up. This is expressed mathematically as $$\text{%}DP \equiv \frac {\text {(average)Change in firm value}}{\text{(average) Firm value without the diversification premium}}$$ $$=\frac {DP}{\bar Q_d-DP}$$ So 1. If $D$ is a dummy & Linear model (as in Equation (1)) : $\hat \beta_2$ estimates the level of the premium ($DP$), but for those firms that are characterized as "diversified" (i.e as a discrete marginal change). So to obtain a percentage expression for the denominator you should consider the average firm value of only those firms that are diversified: $$\text{%}DP = \frac {\hat \beta_2}{\bar Q_d - \hat \beta_2}$$ This is what a firm's value gains in percentage term due to diversification on average. 2. If $D$ is a dummy & Log-linear model with $\log(Q_{it})$ as the dependent variable: $$Q_{it} = \exp\{\beta_1 + \beta_2D+\gamma X'+u_{it}\}$$ and indeed here $$\text{%}DP = \exp\{\hat \beta_2\}-1$$ Note that due to the multiplicative nature of the original non-linear expression, $\hat \beta_2$ inherently represents and is estimated as an average mark-up factor (i.e. level-free), and this is why the average value of the firms does not appear in the calculation. "...or for an average diversification level ($D$ is a continuous variable). I guess you can take it from here.
