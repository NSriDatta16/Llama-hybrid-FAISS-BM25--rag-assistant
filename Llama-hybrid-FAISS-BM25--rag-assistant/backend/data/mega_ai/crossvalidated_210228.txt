Standard errors `NaN` by `Arima` function in R

I'm working with a time series of 59 elements. I'm wondering why the R function, Arima , throws an NaN for the standard errors of some parameters. I'm trying to model the residuals of a log-quadratic stational model: arimaModel = Arima(log(myTS),order=c(1,0,1),seasonal=list(order=c(0,0,1)),xreg=myModelParameters, method="ML") \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline Parameter & Estimate & Std. Error & T\ Value & P(>|t|) \\\hline ar1 & -5.8991e-01 & NA & NA & NA \\\hline ma1 & 1.0000e+00 & 4.4617e-02 & 22.413 & What could I do with this? Why does this happen? I had switched the method between of the function with CSS, CSS-ML, but it's always the same...
