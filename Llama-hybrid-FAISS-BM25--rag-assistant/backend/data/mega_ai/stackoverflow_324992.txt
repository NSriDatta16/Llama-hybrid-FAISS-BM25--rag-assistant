I know it might seem annoying, but the duplication is actually a good thing. The problem here is with your process, not with the way the systems are setup. Keeping the sites separate is actually a good thing. Whilst it looks like "duplication" it's actually not. It's separation . Making changes in the production code by your support engineers should be actively discouraged. You should be looking at changing your process to change once deploy everywhere. This will make everything a lot easier for you in the long run. To actually answer your question, the answer is no, you can't do it. The reason is that web.config isn't designed to store user level settings, it's designed to store per application instance settings. In your case, you need an application instance per user which means separate config files. For your system to work, you need to be able to preemptively tell the application which config file to use, which isn't possible without some sort of input from the user.
