Android webkit.WebView and HTML5

is there any list which HTML5 features the WebView supports and which not? I am interested mainly in: 1) localStorage/sessionStorage 2) offline manifest 3) web sockets 4) web workers Prior there was lack of those features (http://www.mail-archive.com/android-developers@googlegroups.com/msg60143.html), but in Android 2.1, first two should be supported, but I am not sure about 3 and 4. Is there any list of supported features or we have to test it on our own? Thanks a lot BR STeN
