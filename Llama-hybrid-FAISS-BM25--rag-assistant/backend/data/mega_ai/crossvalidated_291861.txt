Your question is on the proper derivation of \begin{equation} p(\omega|X,Y)=\frac{p(Y|X,\omega)p(\omega)}{p(Y|X)} \end{equation} Let me give you some intuition. $\omega$ is the set of parameters that link $x\in{\mathbf{X}}$ to $y\in\mathbf{Y}$. It does not depend upon the distribution of either $X$ or $Y$. The $$p(Y|X,\omega)p(\omega)$$ could be written out as $$p(Y|X,\omega)p(X,\omega).$$ Because they are independent, $$p(X,\omega)=p(X)p(\omega).$$ There is no uncertainty regarding data in a Bayesian context so $p(X)=1$. This leaves you with the prior probability of $\omega.$ For the denominator, because $\omega$ is marginalized out, you are left with $p(Y|X)$ because $$p(Y|X)=\int_{\omega\in\Omega}p(Y|X,\omega)p(\omega)\mathrm{d}\omega.$$ If you want to be really technical, you could make $p(X)=k,k\in(0,1]$ because it is independent of the rest of the denominator and would pass outside the integral and vanish through canceling for all values $\omega\in\Omega$.
