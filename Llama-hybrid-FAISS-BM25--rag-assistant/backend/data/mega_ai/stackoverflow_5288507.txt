About rules in prolog . .

In my program I have some rules like: tellme(X) :- knows(X). tellme(friends1(X)) :- tellme(X). tellme(friends2(X)) :- tellme(X). tellme(friends3(X)) :- tellme(X). . . . tellme(friends25(X)) :- tellme(X). Now this friends1, friends2, friends3 ..... are dependent on N which is a variable. Here, for example value of my N is 25. So is this possible to write a rule to generate these rules till N or do I have to manually write these rules for N times. Any suggestions or solutions are welcomed. Thank you very much for your attention.
