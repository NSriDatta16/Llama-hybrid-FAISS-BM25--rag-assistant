This is the way I would do it: Start using the code , e.g. from within a main method, as if it were used by the other classes - same arguments, same invocation orders. Do that inside a debugger, as you see each step that this class makes. Start writing unit tests for that functionality. Once you have reached a reasonable coverage, you will start to notice that this class probably has too many responsibilities. while ( responsibilities != 1 ) { Extract an interface which expresses one responsibility of that class. Make all callers use that interface instead of the concrete type; Extract the implementation to a separate class; Pass the new class to all callers using the new interface. }
