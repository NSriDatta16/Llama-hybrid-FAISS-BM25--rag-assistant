How to get the location of a touch in touchesBegan function

I tried the following code, but it doesn't work. How should it be modified? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { location = [touches locationInView:self]; } In the h files I have defined location like this: CGPoint location;
