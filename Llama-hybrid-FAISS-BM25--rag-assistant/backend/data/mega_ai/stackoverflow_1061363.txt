"what is the fastest way to know the length of a given resultSet" The ONLY way to really know is to count them all. You want to know how many 'SMITH's are in the phone book. You count them. If it is a small result set, and quickly arrived at, it is not a problem. EG There won't be many Gandalfs in the phone book, and you probably want to get them all anyway. If it is a large result set, you might be able to do an estimate, though that's not generally something that SQL is well-designed for. To avoid caching the entire result set on the client, you can try select id, count(1) over () n from junk; Then each row will have an extra column (in this case n) with the count of rows in the result set. But it will still take the same amount of time to arrive at the count, so there's still a strong chance of a timeout. A compromise is get the first hundred (or thousand) rows, and don't worry about the pagination beyond that.
