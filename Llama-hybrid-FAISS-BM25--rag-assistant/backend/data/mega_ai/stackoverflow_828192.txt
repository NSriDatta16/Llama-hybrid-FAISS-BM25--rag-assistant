See Administrative normal form . In computer science, administrative normal form (abbreviated ANF) is a canonical form of programs, which was introduced by Flanagan et al 1993 to serve as an intermediate representation in functional compilers to make subsequent transformations to machine code more direct. In ANF, all arguments to a function must be trivial. That is, evaluation of each argument must halt immediately. Grammar The following BNF grammar describes the pure λ-calculus modified to support the constraints of ANF: EXP ::= VAL | let VAR = VAL in EXP | let VAR = VAL VAL in EXP VAL ::= VAR | λ VAR . EXP Variants of ANF used in compilers or in research often allow constants, records, tuples, multiargument functions, primitive operations and conditional expressions as well. Flanagan, Cormac; Sabry, Amr; Duba, Bruce F.;Felleisen, Matthias. "The Essence of Compiling with Continuations" likely is the definitive source. Also found some notes on cs252r : Advanced Functional Programming .
