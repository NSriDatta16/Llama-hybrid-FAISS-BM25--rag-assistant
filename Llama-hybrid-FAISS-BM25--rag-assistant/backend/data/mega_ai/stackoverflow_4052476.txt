It really depends on how you've organised the different categories of entity within your database and how you're retrieving them. For example, if you have one large denormalised table that can contain many entity types with each type requiring a different combination of columns being populated then you will have to retrieve all columns if you wish to retrieve all entity types in a single query. Conversely if you've organised your database schema in a normalised form you might well have a parent entity table (which might simply contain entity ID) and multiple sub-tables, one per entity type. In this case you could run multiple bespoke queries to retrieve the various entity types; e.g. select E.EntityId, S.EntityName, S.EntityAge from Entity E inner join SubEntity S on E.EntityId = S.EntityId or select E.EntityId, A.EntityAddress, A.EntityGender from Entity E inner join AnotherSubEntity A on E.EntityId = S.EntityId The trade-off with this second approach is the need to run multiple queries, which could in fact be slower. However, I've resolved this in my application by running the queries in parallel and multiplexing the results together within the application.
