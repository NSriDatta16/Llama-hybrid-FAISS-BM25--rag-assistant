Is there a comprehensive learning plan for a self-teaching beginner in data science with no programming background?

Situation I want to be a data scientist, but I have no programming or maths background. I have more than the basic understanding of python which I taught myself over a couple of months. Right now I am stranded, because I do not know how to frame a study plan? I am working in a marketing firm with lots of data, so I have an income for the time that I study and I have data to apply my knew knowledge on. I am not trying to rush up and want to build up a strong base and grow upon it over a longer period of time. I know it is not going to be easy, but I feel strongly motivated. Questions Could you point out comprehensive learning plans with references to books, courses, and learning materials for self-teaching beginners? Could you also point out any articles or presentations in which former beginners and transitioners share their experiences about successfully becoming data scientists?
