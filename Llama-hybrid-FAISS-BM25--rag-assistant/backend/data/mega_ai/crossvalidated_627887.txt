Understanding Dickey-Fuller test results on series with non-constant variance

My understanding is that a time series that does not appear to have constant variance over time is not stationary and that the Dickey Fuller test tests for stationarity (with the null hypothesis that the series is not stationary). I created a synthetic series of 1000 points where each successive point is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with increasing variance. I ran the Dickey Fuller test on the series and consistently get significant p-values indicating the series is stationary. I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding the test or what a stationary series is. import numpy as np from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller result = [] np.random.seed(42) for i in np.arange(0,10,0.001): result.append(np.random.normal(scale=i)) print(adfuller(result, autolag='AIC')[0]) print(adfuller(result, autolag='AIC')[4]) Output -23.097799978008958 {'1%': -3.431005409094333, '5%': -2.8618296517685877, '10%': -2.566924176499291}
