What is the easiest way to add a page to ask for a string in NSIS using MUI?

I'm an NSIS novice. I'm using the NSIS editor, and the built-in wizard to create a basic installer. I've figured out how to add a second page to ask the user for an alternate folder (install path vs data storage path). I also need to ask them for a URL (a SOAP/WSDL location), and I'd like to just add in another page similar to the directory page that just asks for a generic string (no browse, etc). I'm using MUI (not MUI2). Is there some simple way to do this?
