You can put the components anywhere you like, however you want to organize them. People will site best practices and theory but if you know where everything is and you tell the compiler where they are: import componentName.com.subFolder.componentToBeUsed; Everything will compile and run just fine. Usually you will see code and components broken up in a domain model. So you'll have: com.yoursite.views com.yoursite.events com.someothersite.renderers Which correspond to: /com/yoursite/views /com/yoursite/events Basically all of your code living in folders within /com/yoursite/ and: /com/someothersite/renderers being a custom renderer you imported from someothersite.com to use in your application. In the end, for the compiler and the flash player I don't think it matters where you put things as long as your happy and understand it all...and of course 6 months from now when you come back to look at this code!
