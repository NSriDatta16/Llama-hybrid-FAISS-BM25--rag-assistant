I tried this tool with few projects using Visual Studio 2008, and I found: Pros: - it can collect results from multiple runs, you can run your software at different machines and collect results together - it has useful GUI for browsing results - you can merge coverage from many modules and anlyse it as whole application - forum works, I submited two problems and got implemented fixtures in few days - it works almost without any problems (I found two minor compilation problems) with quite complicated sources, with tons of templates, boost::spirit parsers, other boost stuff (including meta-programming modules etc.), STL, Qt (everything together) - well documented - it's free Cons: - instrumentation is definitely slow - multi-process single project compilation using Visual Studio 2008 doesn't work, only one file at a time is compiled which makes building slower (you will get better performance building whole solution with many projects) At this moment I didn't try to use this tool for continuous coverage measurement. Either way, in my opinion it's worth to try. BTW, Tony, PC-Lint is static-analysis tool, isn't it? interesting idea to compare it with dynamic-analysis tool...
