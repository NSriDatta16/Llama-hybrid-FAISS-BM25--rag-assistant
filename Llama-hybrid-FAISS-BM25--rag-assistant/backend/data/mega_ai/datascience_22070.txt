Training the Discriminative Model in Generative Adversarial Neural Network

What I know so far in DCGAN is that a discriminator is trained using the labeled data (so maybe that occurs before training the generative model). Also, I know that there is race between the generator and the discriminator, so maybe training occur online. So I have some concerns here: How many outputs the discriminator should have (Is it one output that describes the probability, ex: P(x))? How do we chose its output when feeding fake data vs. real data? Is the discriminator trained before using it with the DCGAN or the training is done online (It is mentioned in the Original Paper: Generative Adversarial Nets https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf , that the whole network is trained using the back propagation), hence I think its online? Any help is much appreciated!!
