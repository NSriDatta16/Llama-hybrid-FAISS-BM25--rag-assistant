Agree with the previous answer. In fact, the idea behind almost any Bayesian model is having random variable, which can be distributed according to prior and posterior distributions. It doesn't imply that Bayesian approach works better or worse than non-Bayesian one, but usually it requires more data (for prior distribution of parameters) and in many cases (not all of them) it needs the variables we're working with to be independent. Moreover, Bayesian approaches can be implemented only for parametric models; they're easier to interpret than other types of ML techniques, but the choice of probability distributions and their parameters is crucial here. My opinion is subjective one, but in practice non-Bayesian approaches are used more frequently in real-life applications, where we have no idea about the source of data coming from and have a really bad understanding of probability distributions suitable for the data we have. Overall, for almost any of the Bayesian techniques there's an alternative one. It is more a matter of choice and situation, than a matter of a result, as my experience tells me.
