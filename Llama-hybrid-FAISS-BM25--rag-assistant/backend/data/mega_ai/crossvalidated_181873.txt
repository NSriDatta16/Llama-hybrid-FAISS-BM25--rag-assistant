Is MCMC needed for a Dirichlet prior with multinomial likelihood?

Basically, I have a multinomial distribution with probabilities $\theta_1, \theta_2 ... \theta_m$, and a Dirichlet prior (arbitrarily set as $\alpha_i = \alpha_{i+1} ... = 1$ (i.e. every $\alpha = 1$), which leads to a posterior distribution (which is also Dirichlet?) As far as I know, the posterior distribution reflects a joint distribution of the updated $\theta$ values in light of the data, right? In doing so, I think the marginal distribution of, say, $\theta_1$, is obtained by a Gibbs sampler (or some suitable MCMC method)? In this case, I know that the full conditional is supposed to be used, but what is the full conditional distribution for a Dirichlet posterior? Is it yet another Dirichlet that I sample from, where I sample for $\theta_1$ by fixing all my other $(m-1)$ $\theta$ values?
