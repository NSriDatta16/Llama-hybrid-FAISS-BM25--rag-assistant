You should probably use compile time enhancement instead of runtime enhancement with javaagent. If you're using m2eclipse (you probably do) it would be enough to use something like: org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl and inside build section of your pom.xml you should have something like: org.codehaus.mojo openjpa-maven-plugin 1.2 **/*.class **/*_Roo_*.class true enhancer compile enhance test-enhancer test-compile enhance org.apache.openjpa openjpa ${openjpa.version} commons-logging commons-logging org.apache.geronimo.specs geronimo-jms_1.1_spec Please note that roo might generate different xml snippet that might not work (IIRC it uses different output directory). After you clean your project classes should be enhanced.
