PHP has a function called get_browser() that will return an object (or array if you so choose) with details about the users' browser and what it can do. A simple look through gave me this code: $browser = get_browser( null, true ); if( $browser['name'] == "Firefox" ) if( $browser['majorversion'] == 4 ) echo "You're using Firefox version 4!"; This is not a surefire way (as it reads from HTTP_USER_AGENT , which can be spoofed, and will sometimes be analyzed wrong by php), but it's the easiest one that you can find as far as I know.
