I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this discussion, especially @sega_sai, @ken for taking the time to implement and provide critical review. As a result of this fruitful discussion I have converged to the following solution: The covariance matrix is filled with the covariance/variances observed in the experiments If there are repeating elements then they are averaged The missing elements are estimated by constrained maximization of the log determinant of the covariance matrix (i.e maximizing the entropy). For this purpose the covariance matrix is converted to a correlation matrix (as all diagonal elements are observed) giving upper and lower bounds of [-1 1] for the unknown off-diagonal elements. The optimization ensures that the correlation matrix is symmetric (by design) and positive semidefinite (by ensuring all eigenvalues are positive) The resulting correlation matrix is then converted back to covariance and used to estimate the likelihood of an independent dataset. This likelihood is compared to the likelihood of the true (generating) model and the model obtained using Wishart priors (as per @sega_sai). === Case 1 ==== True model logL: -594.89 Wishart prior logL: -605.75 max Determinant logL: -596.41 === Case 2 ==== True model logL: -525.53 Wishart prior logL: -558.85 max Determinant logL: -531.41 === Case 3 ==== True model logL: -513.15 Wishart prior logL: -962.17 max Determinant logL: -518.87 For the three cases (provided by @ken) the determinant maximization gives significantly better likelihoods. That is why I am accepting my own answer but awarding the bounty to @sega_sai for his efforts in implementing the alternate solution. I should also note that @Hooman's MMSE implementation gives the same results for this example, but the formulation requires a common dimension to be observed in the two experiments (in this case $x_2$ ). The determinant maximization,however, does not require this and therefore is a more general solution.
