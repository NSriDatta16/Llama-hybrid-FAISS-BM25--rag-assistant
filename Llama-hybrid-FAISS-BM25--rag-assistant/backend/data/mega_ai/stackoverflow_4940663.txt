How to find the number of occurrences of a string within a huge string like a big book

I was recently asked this question during a C# interview session: How would you efficiently find the number of occurrences of a word within a huge text like a big book (the Bible, a dictionary, etc). I am wondering what would be the most efficient data structure to store the contents of the book in. The dirtiest soultion I could think of was to store it in a StringBuilder and find the count of the substrings, but I am sure there has to be a much better way to do this. And for a reasonably sized string there are multiple ways of doing this using substring, regular expressions, etc but for a humongous string what is the most efficient way. Update: What I am looking for is this: Assuming there is a text file, lets again say the Bible, of size 20 MB, and I want to find the number of times the word "Jesus" occurs in the text, other than loading the entire 20 MB into a string or StringBuilder and using a substring or regex to find the match count, is there any other data structure that could be used to store the entire text contents. The actual search can be accomplished in multiple ways, what I am looking for is the most efficient "data structure" for the temporary storage.
