Clustering genes in a time course experiment

I have seen a few queries on clustering in time series and specifically on clustering, but I don't think they answer my question. Background: I want to cluster genes in a time course experiment in yeast. There are four time points say: t1 t2 t3 and t4 and total number of genes G . I have the data in form a matrix M in which the columns represent the treatments (or time points) t1 t2 t3 and t4 and the rows represent the genes. Therefore, M is a Gx4 matrix. Problem: I want to cluster the genes which behave the same across all time points t1 t2 t3 and t4 as well as within a particular time point ti , where i is in {1, 2, 3, 4} (In case we cannot do both the clusterings together, the clustering within a time point is more important than clustering across time points). In addition to this, I also want to draw a heatmap. My Solution: I use the R code below to obtain a heatmap as well as the clusters using hclust function in R (performs hierarchical clustering with euclidean distance) row.scaled.expr 0], seq(0,1,length=10))[-1] ) blue.red.expr I recently discovered hopach package in Bioconductor which can be used to estimate the number of clusters. Previously, I was randomly assigning the number of bins for the heatmap and cutting the tree at an appropriate height to get a pre-specified number of clusters. Possible Problems in my solution: I may be not clustering the genes within a particular treatment and clustering genes only across treatments or vice versa. There may be better ways of obtaining a heatmap for the pattern I want to see (similar genes within a treatment and across treatments). There may be better visualization methods which I am not aware of. Note: csgillespie (moderator) has a more general document on his website in which he discusses all the aspects of time course analysis (including heatmaps and clustering). I would appreciate if you can point me to an articles which describe heatmaps and clustering in detail. I have tried the pvclust package, but it complains that M is singular and then it crashes.
