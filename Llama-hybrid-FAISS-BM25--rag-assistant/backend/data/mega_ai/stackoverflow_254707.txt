As far as I know, it all compiles to the same thing. A property in IL for .NET is really just a getPropertyName and setPropertyName function for a property called PropertyName. So its really a matter of style in that regard. It just reads better to see the following: person.Address.Street; rather than person.Address().Street(); So, in a way, its really a matter of code aesthetics. Unfortunately for me in .NET C#, is not as elegant as Ruby in that () are always optional.
