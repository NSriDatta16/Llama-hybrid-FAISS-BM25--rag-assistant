The textbook is comparing the random forest predicted values against the real values of the test data. This makes sense as a way to measure how well the model predicts: compare the prediction results to data that the model hasn't seen. You're comparing the random forest predictions to a specific column of the training data. I don't understand why this would be helpful: you're comparing predictions for observations in the training set to some value of observations in the test set. That's like taking the average height of yourself and your neighbor. Sure, you can compute it, but how is that helpful?
