Cocoa Touch - Drag onto button to trigger event

Hey all, just wondering what the best way to add this capability was. I want to be able to press the button normally by doing touchDownInside, but I also want to be able to slide my finger from one button to the next and have the next one trigger. How can I do that? Ex: (-) -> (-) ^Buttons^
