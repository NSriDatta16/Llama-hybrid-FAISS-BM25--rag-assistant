When native libraries are loaded into the JVM they are mapped into the JVMs address space and any calls they make to allocate memory do so in that address space - therefore in a 32bit world you've got a maximum of 4GB to play with. Competing for this 4GB is the JVM and it's heap (although I believe there are limits to the heap size other than the address space that a JVM specific). Anyway, from your comments on @akf's answer it looks like there's plenty of memory. I'd also consider that the term 'storage' could refer to more than just memory. From the Javadoc on java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError : Thrown if the Java Virtual Machine cannot find an appropriate native-language definition of a method declared native. Please explain/confirm: is program.dll on your java.library.path and are you successfully calling other methods on it. what is program.dll and what are you using it for.
