I found the following which may be of interest: Determine the maximum size of a UDP datagram packet on Linux Set the DF bit in the IP header and send continually larger packets to determine at what point a packet is fragmented as per Path MTU Discovery . Packet fragmentation should then result in a ICMP type 3 packet with code 4 indicating that the packet was too large to be sent without being fragmented. Dan's answer is useful but note that after headers you're really limited to 65507 bytes.
