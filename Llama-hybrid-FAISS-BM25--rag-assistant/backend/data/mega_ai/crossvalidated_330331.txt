The answer given is already quite complete. However, regarding the question : Is there a way to indicate to the random forest that the power of prediction of x1 is high only when z>A? You can build the new feature (as an extra column) in your data-set, using, per example the following : x_1_bis = x_1 * (z>A) - 99 * (z Basically, this is x_1 if z>A and -99 otherwise (you can put a value smaller than the smallest x_1 , so that the random forest can split them easily from). Now you can look at the importance of x_1_bis . Note however that the importance may be reduced if x_1 and z are present in your dataset (since the randomForest algorithm may detect this interaction as well).
