this is VB.NET code to check for any removable drives or CDRom drives attached to the computer: Me.lstDrives.Items.Clear() For Each item As DriveInfo In My.Computer.FileSystem.Drives If item.DriveType = DriveType.Removable Or item.DriveType = DriveType.CDRom Then Me.lstDrives.Items.Add(item.Name) End If Next it won't be that hard to modify this code into a c# equivalent, and more driveType 's are available. From MSDN: Unknown: The type of drive is unknown. NoRootDirectory: The drive does not have a root directory. Removable: The drive is a removable storage device, such as a floppy disk drive or a USB flash drive. Fixed: The drive is a fixed disk. Network: The drive is a network drive.
