There's no clean way to do this and the not-so-clean ways will make your mouse cursor "jitter" at the border of the clipping area . Moreover, I'd question if this is really a good idea. The user should really own the mouse and he or she generally gets frustrated when you try to artificially limit things that he or she owns. If you want to provide feedback when the mouse leaves your canvas, maybe you could leave the item being dragged stuck along the border while the mouse button is still down? This would tell the user that he or she has left the target area without trying to impose limitations on where the mouse can go. Good luck!
