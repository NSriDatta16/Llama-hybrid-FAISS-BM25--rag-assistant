The process could not execute 'sp_replcmds' on

I am having a lot of trouble setting up transactional replication on my test server. I am running SQL Server 2008 SP2. I am able to create a transactional publication. The snapshot agent works fine and subscribing to the publication works fine as well. The problem that I get is that the log reader agent fails with the error: The process could not execute 'sp_replcmds' on [ServerName] The snapshot and log reader agents are run under a windows account with administrator privileges on the domain and sysadmin privileges on the sql server. I have also tried running the agents under the SQL agent profile. I have tried executing sp_replflush and restarting the SQL agent. I have also tried increasing -LoginTimeout to 500 and -ReadBatchSize to 10. Any help greatly appreciated.
