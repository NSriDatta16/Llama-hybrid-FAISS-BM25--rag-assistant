This article discusses Bayesian logistic regression nicely. Basically, you have the flexibility to parametrize estimation however you see fit, but using a model which is linear on the log odds scale makes sense for many reasons. Furthermore, using a normal prior for log odds ratios should give you very approximately normal posteriors. To do the sequential analysis, estimate the "prior" for this season by doing a first-pass Bayesian logistic regression for past seasons using a non-informative normal prior for that model.
