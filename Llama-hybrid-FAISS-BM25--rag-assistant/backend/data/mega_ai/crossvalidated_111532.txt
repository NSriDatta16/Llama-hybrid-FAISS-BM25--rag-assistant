Basic Bayesian reasoning question -- what is wrong with this "equational" argument?

Let's say that we have a model: $y + x = \epsilon$, $\epsilon \sim N(0, 1)$. After observing a value for $y$, we can write $x$ as: $x = \epsilon - y$ Since $y$ is just a constant, and $\epsilon$ is standard normally distributed, it seems that we can claim: $\epsilon - y \sim N(-y, 1)$ and thus: $p(x \mid y) = N(x; -y, 1)$ where $N$ is the normal pdf. But this makes no sense as there is no mention of a prior for $x$ anywhere. So what went wrong with this "equational" reasoning argument?
