First, I don't see how variables at time 2 can be sensibly used to predict dropout at time 2. So, I don't think you need to even worry about the missing data. I'm not sure why you collected it. You seem to know who dropped out, even if they have missing data at time 2, since you refer to that information. Second, I agree with Frank Harrell about the perils of doing variable selection the way you seem to be planning to do it. At a minimum, if you are planning this, then do a train and test set -- that is, divide the data in two and build your model on the training set, then report the results from running the same model on the test set. Third, right now, from your description, I see no need for SEM. You seem to have a relatively straightforward logistic regression problem. But maybe there are things you haven't said that make SEM worthwhile. In general, I am not a big fan of SEM. Of course it can be useful when done well, but it's very easy to go wrong, and very easy to cheat by adjusting things endlessly until they work. Do you have some sort of latent variable? Fourth, be sure to check for collinearity among the 10 personality traits. These traits are usually related to each other and can cause problems. Finally, I don't know why you are ruling out interactions.
