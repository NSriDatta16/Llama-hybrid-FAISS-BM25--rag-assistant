First of all: it's always useful to actually pay attention to the compiler error. Java's compier errors are very clear and useful most of the time, and tell you exactly what's wrong once you're learned to understand them. And generally, it's much easier for people here on SO to help you if you include the actual text of an error rather than saying "I have trouble getting it to compiler" This is the first obviously wrong line: int Student[students] = getStudents(FileIOHelper.getNumberOfStudents(filename)); A variable declaration in Java consists of (slightly simplified): The type of the variable its name optionally an assignment of an initial value In the above line, you start with type int , but the next part Student[students] makes no sense - it looks like an array instantiation, certainly not a name. What you probably meant is: Student[] students = getStudents(FileIOHelper.getNumberOfStudents(filename)); i.e. the type is Student[] (an array of Student objects), the name is 'students', and it's assigned the return value of the getStudents() method. An int is not involved anywhere (you don't have to specify the size of the array here, since it is created inside the getStudents() method).
