I don't know anything about PyDev's integration of coverage.py (or if it even uses coverage.py), but the .coverage files are pretty simple. They are marhsal'ed dictionaries. I haven't tested this code, but you can try this to combine two .coverage files into one: import marshal c1_dict = marshal.load(open(file_name_1, 'rb')) c2_dict = marshal.load(open(file_name_2, 'rb')) c1_dict.update(c2_dict) marshal.dump(c1_dict, open(file_name_out, 'wb'))
