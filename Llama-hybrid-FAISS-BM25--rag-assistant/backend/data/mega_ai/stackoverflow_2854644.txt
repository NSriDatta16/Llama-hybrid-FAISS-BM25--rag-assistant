I've used an in house framework that relied on XSLT to produce all it's HTML (and terrifyingly RTF and other formats too) and that's left me with some fairly strong opinions on the subject. XSLT is a great language for transforming one XML format into another where both are well defined. If your source data is XML then it's handy for transforming it into XHTML fragments but when you start to stray into templating engine territory things start to get a bit messy. As with everything it's just a tool and if you use it for what it's good at it'll work well, if you use it at every opportunity you're probably abusing it and if you use it to generate RTF files you're committing a crime against nature.
