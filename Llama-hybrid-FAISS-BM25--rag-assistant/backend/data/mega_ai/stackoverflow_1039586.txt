I don't feel that this is the most elegant solution, but what we have done before is, creating a folder in the solution, and a text file called placeholder.txt or something similar, and the setting the properties of the text file to be included in the build. The result is a folder where you want it containing a file that you don't want. We then delete the placeholder.txt file before we zip it up, all within the build script. Not elegant but it does the job for our scenario.
