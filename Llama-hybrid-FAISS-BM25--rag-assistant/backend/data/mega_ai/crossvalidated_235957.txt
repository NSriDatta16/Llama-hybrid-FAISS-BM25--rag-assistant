You are missing something deeper: PCA isn't a classification method. PCA in machine learning is treated as a feature engineering method. When you apply PCA to your data you are guaranteeing there'll be no correlation between the resulting features. Many classification algorithms benefit from that. You always have to keep in mind algorithms might have assumptions on the data, and if such assumptions don't hold they might underperform. LDA must compute a covariance matrix inversion to project the data (check these threads and answers: Should PCA be performed before I do classification? and Does it make sense to combine PCA and LDA? ). If you have few data, this is unstable, and you get overfitted projections towards your data points, i.e. a singular within-class covariance matrix. PCA is usually used to avoid that, reducing the dimentionality of the problem. So the answer is you never use PCA to do classification, but you can use it to try to improve the performance of LDA.
