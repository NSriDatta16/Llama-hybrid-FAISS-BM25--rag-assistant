Well, I don't know about neural nets or what's current in "machine learning", but, assuming he's complaining about the set of statistical algorithms for these cases (which he might not be), it's just wrong. In particular, when dependent random variables are modeled, you can, of course, model XOR relationships. It's not the only example, but consider the multivariate normal (or "Gaussian") with an unknown covariance matrix. It is possible to estimate these, with sufficient data, and this can be done in a Bayesian framework. See, for example: Gaskins, Daniels, "A nonparametric prior for simultaneous covariance estimation", Biometrika , (2013), 100, 1, pp. 125â€“138, http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biomet/ass060 Congdon, Bayesian Statistical Modelling , 2nd edition, 2006, Example 5.7, page 177. Section 4.3.4.2, "Hole Models", pages 148-149, Schabenberger, Gotway, Statistical Methods for Spatial Data Analysis , 2005.
