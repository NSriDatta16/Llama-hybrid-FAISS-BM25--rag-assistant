At client side, return value of WCF Operation Contract is null ! Any solution?

I have an Operation Contract in my WCF service which returns an instance of the class which is actually a Message Contract. (Not Data Contract). The Message Contract has properties with attribute > [MessageBodyMember] [MessageContract(WrapperName="AuthorizarionResponse", IsWrapped="true")] public class AuthorizationResponse { [MessageBodyMember] public string role {get;set;}; [MessageBodyMember] public Organization organization {get; set;}; } [ServiceContract] interface IAuthorization { [OperationContract] public AuthoriztionResponse GetAuthorizationResult(AuthorizationRequestMessage request); } Organization class uses the XmlSerializer. It does not use DataContract because I want WCF service to be used from existing ASMX clients. When I debug the service and see the return value in the Operation Contract method, i can see everything which i want to return from the service through this operation contract. But at the client side, I get null value! Everything is ending without any exception/error. Fiddler2 does not give any red/error marks! What would be going wrong?
