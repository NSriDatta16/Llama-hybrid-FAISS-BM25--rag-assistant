First of all, let's clarify what you read in the wikipedia article you linked to. This: $f(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}$ Is simply a logistic function. It is not logistic regression. If you continue reading, you will see this form: $\pi(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x)}}$ Which shows the logistic regression form with one variable. $x$ will be the data and $\beta_0,\beta_1$ will be the parameters that you fit. With multiple variables, you get multinomial logistic regression - see this wikipedia article . This article explains that a Maximum Entropy Classifier is simply a logistic regression model used for classification (i.e. to predict binary classes). This is also the first form of logistic regression which you present in your question. This form now fits one parameter per variable (sometimes with an additional bias parameter), and adds an additional term $Z$ (aka the partition function) which simply normalizes everything into a probability distribution. Finally, the text explains (1.2.2.1) how this form of logistic regression can be viewed as a CRF, via interpreting the function as a multiplication of feature functions (similar to how you multiply factors in random fields - see the beginning of the text).
