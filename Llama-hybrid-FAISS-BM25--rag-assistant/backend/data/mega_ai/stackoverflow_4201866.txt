Some sort of abomination like this might work but it is very fragile, the various widths and heights were determined using the "fiddle with it until it works" technique: #dt0 { display: none; } #dd0 { height: 100px; } #dd0dd { float: left; } #dt1, #dt2, #dt3, #dt4{ float: left; clear: right; width: 80px; margin-left: 100px; } #dd1dd, #dd2dd, #dd3dd, #dd4dd { float: right; } This works on jsfiddle.net in Safari, YMMV anywhere else. I feel dirty now.
