There are no standard open file dialogs for WP7. (some choosers excepted.) If you want to do this you'll have to create the dialog yourself. You can get the details of the songs saved into the Music&Video hub via the MediaLibrary object. (Add a reference to Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll to use this from Silverlight.) You'll then have access to lists (collections) of Albums, artists, playlists, songs, etc. If you want to play tracks you've save in IsolatedStorage you can access these directly yourself.
