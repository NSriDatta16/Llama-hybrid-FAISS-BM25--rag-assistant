How to select a subsample of fixed size to maximize its total PCA variance?

I would like to use PCA to help design my genomics experiment. I can only afford to perform my experiment on a limited number of genotypes so would like to maximize the variation of the ones I select. I have several 100k SNPs for each of ~300 genotypes. If I perform PCA on them, how can I select a subsample that maximizes the variation for a sample that size? Ideally I could then weigh up the benefits of increasing the number of genotypes vs. proportion of the total variation captured in the subsample. Also, say I already have some of the genotype samples; could I ask what proportion of the total variation they already encompass?
