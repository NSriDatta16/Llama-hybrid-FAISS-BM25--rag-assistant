You should not be doing smoke tests. Are you aware of the etymology of that term? A "smoke test", in electronics, is when you turn on the power and see if any smoke comes out. You should be doing more comprehensive unit tests; enough to give you good code coverage. This is what you should do on every build. You should also try to do a deployment, and run some "installation verification tests".
