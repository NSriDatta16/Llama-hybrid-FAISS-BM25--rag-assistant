How to determine the correlation between 2 time series while controlling for a 3rd?

I would like to determine the relationship between two variables after controlling for a third. Specifically, I want to know if the prices of mercury and gold over time are correlated with each other more than or less than they are correlated with a generic metals price index. Is there some special signal in the relationship between these commodities or are they just moving in line with the overall index? I have a data set with 32 annual values (1980-2011) for mercury price, gold price, and metals index. I am using R. Below I have posted time series plots of each of the three variables.
