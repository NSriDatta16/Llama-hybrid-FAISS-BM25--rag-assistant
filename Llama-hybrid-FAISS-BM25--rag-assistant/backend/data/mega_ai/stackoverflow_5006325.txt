pan and scale the view

i have readed many topics but i'm very confused. i don't know if use camera, parallax node, move layers....? i'm trying to make a simple program for test: the 2d scene i'd like to display is: 1) background image 2) some selectable points on background 3) some other sprite 4) on touch drag and drop i'll pan all objects, on second pan event i'll pan the object from the new location (not the beginning location) 5) scaling with two fingers with the center of scaling is the center of the image actually displayed which implementation should i follow? thanks
