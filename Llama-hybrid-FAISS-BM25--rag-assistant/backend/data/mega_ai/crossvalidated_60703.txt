Approach to solving for the probability that a photo contains an object based on tags

I've studied machine learning and statistics only very briefly. I've used linear regression to solve problems with fixed sets of variables, but I'm not sure how to approach the following problem. Given a bunch of tagged photos, I'd like to use the tags to estimate the probability that a specific object is contained within the photo. I have access to a wealth of data which has already been classified as either containing the objects we're looking for or not (however note that this is not a classification problem; the probabilities are being used to rank photos). For example. If a photo is tagged with coke and drink , there is a high probability it contains coca-cola. However if a photo is tagged with coke and crack , there is a high probability it does not contain coca-cola. If a photo is tagged with either crack or drink separately, that doesn't tell us much about what might be in the photo. How would one go about building a hypothesis formula for this problem?
