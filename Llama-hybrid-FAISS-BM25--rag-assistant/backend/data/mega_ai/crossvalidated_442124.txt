Does MCMC Gibbs sampling algorithm first build a steady Markov Chain, then does the sampling to build the posterior distribution?

I am currently studying MCMC Gibbs sampling and while reading this part, a question has come into my head if MCMC Gibbs sampling first build a steady Markov Chain and does the sampling or does sampling first and while sampling, it builds a steady Markov Chain. What is its way to sample to build the posterior probability distribution?
