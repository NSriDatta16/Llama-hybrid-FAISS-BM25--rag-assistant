Magento order ID reorder

With set of products in my shopping cart When I login and start an order I get assigned an orderID. If I then sit on my order, or logout and come back again, my cart products is still there and the order ID I was given (potentailly days ago) is still there. In the mean time the there are 100's of orders placed after me. And now am placing my oder means my oder id is before 100 old ID's. These all are good and goes well. But In the backend, our fulfilment people will have batched well beyond the current ID and my old order ID will get lost in a void(because if i am ordering after one year or so my ID could be 1000 id's Back). SO, is it possible and easy and safe to force Magento to re-issue a new ORDER ID upon step one of the checkout? If not, can we prevent Magento from remembering your cart state after you logout) or perhaps each time you re-login, whichever is easier? Thanks for your support.
