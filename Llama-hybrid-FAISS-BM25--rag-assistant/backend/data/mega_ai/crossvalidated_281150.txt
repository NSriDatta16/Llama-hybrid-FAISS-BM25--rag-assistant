logistic regression in R, problem with output

I am trying to predict logistic regression. For instance fit The data (TARGET) has a label of 0 and 1. I want to get an output of 0 and 1 from the prediction. if I run predict(fit,ValData, type="response") , I can a bunch of 0.001 something like that. How do I get a binary output ? What is that 0.001 represent? (Probability of equal to 1 is 0.001?) Thanks
