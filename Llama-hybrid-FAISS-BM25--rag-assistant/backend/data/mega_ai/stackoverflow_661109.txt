That's one way. You can share the single copy of the /Developer tools, but each have your own login name, preferences, and keychains. If you share the same Mac OS X user account, but have two ADC identities, on the Safari side you just have to make sure you log out of the ADC website when you trade places. On the Xcode side, you'll need to add both Developer Certificates to your keychain, and both Provisioning Profiles to Xcode's organizer. I recommend that you each have your own phone, if you're going to have separate Provisioning Profiles and Developer Certificates. The crucial part is that for each project you work on, you need to set the Code Signing Identity to the full and exact identity for the person who owns it. The projects come set up with a wildcard identity of "iPhone Developer"; you need to change it to "iPhone Developerâ€”John Appleseed" to use your signing certificate and profile, and your wife has to do the same on her projects.
