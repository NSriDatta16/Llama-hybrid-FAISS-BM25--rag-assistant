How to determine if should I adopt a time series approach given a dataset?

I'm learning about machine learning and data science and I Would like to know, given a dataset which contains "Date" as one of it's many features. How to determine if I'm facing a time series problem where I can use ARIMA, SARIMA or maybe a machine learning model like XGBoost or otherwise treat this dataset as a "normal" one? Maybe "Date" is not too related with the target as other features or maybe the target has classes. So how to identify a time series problem?
