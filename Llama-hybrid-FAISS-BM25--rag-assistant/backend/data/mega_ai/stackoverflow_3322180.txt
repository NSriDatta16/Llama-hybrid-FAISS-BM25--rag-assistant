How to retrieve single record in WCF RIA Services?

I'm using WCF RIA Services and I have a domain service method that returns a single entity. In my Silverlight client project I'm now using following code to retrieve that entity: ctxt.Load(ctxt.GetEmployeeByNumberQuery("ABC123")).Completed += new System.EventHandler(EmployeeLoad_Completed); void EmployeeLoad_Completed(object sender, System.EventArgs e) { Employee myEmployee = (sender as LoadOperation ).Entities.FirstOrDefault(); } Is there any better or more elegant method?
