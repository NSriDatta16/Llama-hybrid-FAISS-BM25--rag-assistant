Proof of sum of kernels of concatenated vector

I am reading the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book by Bishops. I have some difficulties proving the (6.21) equation . Can someone help me? N.B: If someone has a better title for this question, i'm opened to it as i couldn't find the good words.
