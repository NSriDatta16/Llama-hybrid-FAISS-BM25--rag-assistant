As others have said, you're giving yourself extra work by using char* instead of std::string . If you switch over to std::string it would look like this: #include struct car { int vin; std::string make; std::string model; int year; double fee; }; std::string askMake() { std::string make; cout > make; return make; } int main() { car tempCar; tempCar.make = askMake(); }
