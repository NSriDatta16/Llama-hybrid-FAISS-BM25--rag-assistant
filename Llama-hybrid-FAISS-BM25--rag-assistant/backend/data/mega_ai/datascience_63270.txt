What is the ideal size to a binary CNN? Is my dataset long enough?

I would like to know what is the ideal size to a CNN, or there's a mathematical function to determine it, or it change through the differents scopes? And also, I'm doing a binary classification CNN with 700 images each class(total - 1400). Is it too small? How could I argue that it is small? Note: I get 83% accuracy with my cnn.
