We use Infragistics libraries in our WinForms products. Infragistics does not provide a redistributable package, so you will need to handle distributing them manually. Just include all the dlls that your product depends on and install them to the local installation directory. There is no additional setup that needs to be done to use the Infragistics dlls at runtime.
