Understanding the Bayesian question

I have a Bayesian question here: In a drug experiment, patients with a chronic condition are asked to choose between two drugs, C (control), and T (new treatment). (You may assume for the purpose of this question that every patient will express a preference one way or the other). Let the population proportion who prefer “T” be θ. We observe a sample of n patients which their responses are independent given θ. Elicit three prior distributions for θ as follows: 1) $π_1 (θ)$ , a non-informative (or vague) prior; 2) $π_2 (θ)$ , a proper informative prior where its mean and standard deviation are 0.5 and 0.25, respectively; 3) $π_3 (θ)$ , a proper informative prior where its first and third quartiles, are Q1=0.62, and Q3=0.715, respectively, and its median is 0.67. I have a problem on understanding the question above. Is it correct if I define the population proportion as $π(θ|T)$ ? I really don't think I understand the relationship between T and θ probably, I would be grateful if someone who can explain it to me. Although I don't get the question, I have answered 1) and 3), but not sure about 2). For 1), I defined it as Be(1,1) ( from θ~U[0,1], all data are equally likely so it is non-informative) For 3), I used the elicitation tool( http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/match/uncertainty.php# ) to get Be(29,14) as answer. For 2), I have tried to apply $$E(X)=\frac{x}{x+B}=0.5$$ and $$Var(X)=\frac{xB}{(x+B)^2(x+B+1)}=0.25^2$$ But it does not work as I get x = B from E(X). Is there any other way I can use to solve this, either by hand or using software? Any help would be appreciated.
