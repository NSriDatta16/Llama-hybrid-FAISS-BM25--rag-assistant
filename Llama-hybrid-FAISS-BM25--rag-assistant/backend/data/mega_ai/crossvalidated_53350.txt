I'm not able to post a comment because of my weak reputation. A simple answer would be a moving average, you simply have to replace the duration of the call by the mean duration of the last p call. You'll choose p empirically, by plotting the results, high enough to remove noise, low enough to observe something. You should be able to observe the trend by plotting your new time serie If you want a single value you should try: short term mean - longer term mean. The definition of short term and long term depends on the process (noise, seasonality ... ect), the way it evolves, the number of data you have, the frequency at wich your client ask for this information. For exemple, if your client ask for it every month you should take: short term: 1 month long term: 12 month if your client ask for it every week: short term: 1 week long term: 1/2/3 month So the progress will be easy to show to your client: over last month the call duration improved by xxms from last year.
