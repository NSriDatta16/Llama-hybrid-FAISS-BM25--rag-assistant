I have heard of Modular Automation also referred to as Component Based Test Case Design. HP is a big player in this space. The came up with a Product that is called Business Process Testing. It consists of: •Reusable Business Components •Business Components converted into Business process test Business components are reusable units that perform a specific task in a business process. (for example – Add to Cart) A business process tests is a scenario comprising of business components (for example - Place an Order) In HP's Quality Center the Business Components module enables you to create and manage reusable business components. Then the Test Plan module enables you to drag and drop the components into business process tests, and debug the components.
