Intervention analysis estimates the effect of an external or exogenous intervention (e.g. the introduction of new regulations) on a time-series. Intervention analysis tests the causal hypothesis that the slope or intercept of the time-series is different after the intervention, or seeks to estimate the magnitude of intervention effects. Intervention analysis is useful when a randomized trial is not possible. Intervention analysis is typically conducted with the Box & Jenkins ARIMA framework, using the methods outlined by Box & Tiao (1965) ‘A Change in Level of a Non-Stationary Time Series’, Biometrika 52, no. 1: 181–192. However, other methods such as segmented regression may be used. Intervention analysis is sometimes called interrupted time-series analysis . Analysis of time series seeking to detect a possible exogenous intervention of unknown time may make use of regime switching or change point analysis .
