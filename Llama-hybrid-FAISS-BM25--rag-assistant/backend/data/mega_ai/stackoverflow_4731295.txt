ASP.net HTTP 404 - File not found instead of MaxRequestLength exception

I have a file upload control on my webpage. The maximum request length is set to 8 MB ( maxRequestLength = 8192 ). I also have server validation that throws an error if the file is more than 4MB. The reason that its 8MB in the config is the leverage that's given to the user and also so that the application can be tested. If I upload a file that's 9MB, I get thrown an exception Maximum request length exceeded. , which is fine and working as expected. But when I try to upload a file that's 1GB, it shows me a HTTP 404 - File not found . Can someone please explain why this is happening and how can I get it to throw me a maxRequestLength exception ? I'm using IIS6.
