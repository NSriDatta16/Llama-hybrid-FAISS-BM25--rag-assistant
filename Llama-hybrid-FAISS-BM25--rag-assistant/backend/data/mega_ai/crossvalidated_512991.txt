Logistic regression: Compare groups with highly different sample sizes

This is a theoretical question! Sorry for that. Any help is appreciated. I am exploring the association between two binary factors using an odds ratio in a large sample that is highly imbalanced: The whole sample contains 150,000 individuals. Of these 146,000 are eating an apple (apple+) and 4,000 never eat an apple (apple -) Suppose my dependent variable is 0=not happy, 1= happy And I have 6 more independent variables say age, daylight, etc . Can I do a multivariate logistic regression although the predictor of interest is imbalanced in distribution without breaking any assumptions?
