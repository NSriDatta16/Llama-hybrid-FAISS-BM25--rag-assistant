My interpretation is that this is calculated by taking each age, finding the number of children borne by women at that age, multiplying that number by the age, summing the results, and then dividing by the total number of births. It should be the same as the average, over all children born that year, of the children's mother's age. That is, if you record for each child born that year the age of their mother, and take the average of those numbers, that should be the same as this statistic.
