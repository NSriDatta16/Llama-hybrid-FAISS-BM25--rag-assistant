Anything related to physical machinery control will have continuous variables. For instance, double pendulum control, see "Control of Inverted Double Pendulum using Reinforcement Learning" . It's a detailed description of the classroom project. see the video , it's easy to implement. This demo is also great at showing and discussing the limitations of machine learning applications to this sort of problem. I've seen this type of demo on Google's event once, and the presenter made it sound as if any control problem would be easily solved with deep learning, didn't mention any difficulties with feature selection.
