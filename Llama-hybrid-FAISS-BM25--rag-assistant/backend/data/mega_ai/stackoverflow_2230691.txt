OSCommerce Product Listing Shows Inaccurate Count and Results Per Page

http://www.roguevalleyroses.com/rose_list.php?search_id=&class=&height=&growth=&color=&bloom_size=&bloom_type=&shade=&fragrance=&disease=&rebloom=&thorns=&zone=&hybridizer=Ashdown%20Roses&date_range=&text=&view=&show=&page=4 This is the page. The code that queries the results is here: http://pastebin.com/d51bfa53f I can't make any sense out of how OSCommerce works. Let me know if you need anything else. Also, is this just a common problem in SQL Queries, PHP loops, or in some math being wrong? I am looking to be pointed in the right direction, not necessarily needing an exact answer as this is a hacked/custom OsCommerce.
