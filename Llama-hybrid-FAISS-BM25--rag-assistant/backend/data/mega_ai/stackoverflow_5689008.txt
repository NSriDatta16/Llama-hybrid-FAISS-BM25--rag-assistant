The solution/workaround to this is quite simple. Instead of this: I now have this: The draggable image no longer lives directly inside the main Canvas. Instead it lives inside a child Canvas. The image is no longer draggable itself. It's the inner Canvas that gets dragged. Now, when a transformation is applied to the image, it stays put as its parent's 0,0 coords are now where they're supposed to be, as it's where you dragged the canvas to. Hope this helps somebody and saves them the time I've wasted on this. Jake
