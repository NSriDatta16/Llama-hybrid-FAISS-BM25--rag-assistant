This is an interesting problem to which I hoped there was an elegant solution. Sadly, I end up with a solution similar to Mr. Leffler, but I'll add that you can call useless from inside a Bash function for improved readability: #!/bin/bash function useless { /tmp/useless.sh | sed 's/Output/Useless/' } ERROR=$(useless) echo $ERROR All other kind of output redirection must be backed by a temporary file.
