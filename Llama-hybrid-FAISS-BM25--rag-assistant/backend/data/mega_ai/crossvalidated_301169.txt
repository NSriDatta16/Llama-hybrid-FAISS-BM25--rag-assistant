Autoencoder and t-SNE can be used together for better visualization in high dimensional data, as described in [1]: For 2D visualization specifically, t-SNE is probably the best algorithm around, but it typically requires relatively low-dimensional data. So a good strategy for visualizing similarity relationships in high-dimensional data is to start by using an autoencoder to compress your data into a low-dimensional space (e.g. 32 dimensional), then use t-SNE for mapping the compressed data to a 2D plane.
