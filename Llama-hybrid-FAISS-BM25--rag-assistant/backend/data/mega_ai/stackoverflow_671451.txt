Actually, I don't think you CAN show a service in the system tray. Applications doing this are always using an agent or other mangement tool. Most of the time the application running in the tray is a very small app giving access to the settings for the service. Configuration options could be stored in the registry, ini file or anyother storage option. After the configuration changes, all you need to do is make sure you restart your service, so it can reload it's new settings.
