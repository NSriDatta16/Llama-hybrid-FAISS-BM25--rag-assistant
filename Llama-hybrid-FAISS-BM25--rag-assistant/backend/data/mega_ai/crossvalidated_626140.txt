The mediation package reports all effects as mean differences on the units of the predictor. So the total effect of 312 means the treatment increases the order value by 312 (whatever units those are; "cents", I guess). The coefficient on treatment in a Poisson regression of the outcome on the treatment is the log of the treatment effect on the ratio scale; that is, the treatment has an average outcome $\exp(0.139755)=1.15$ times that of the control group. Note that the regression of the outcome on the mediator alone is unrelated to mediation analysis; you need to include the treatment variable in that model to arrive at any conclusion about mediation. I urge you to bootstrap the standard errors since the usual Poisson regression standard errors are very sensitive to the assumptions of Poisson regression (the conditional mean equals the conditional variance).
