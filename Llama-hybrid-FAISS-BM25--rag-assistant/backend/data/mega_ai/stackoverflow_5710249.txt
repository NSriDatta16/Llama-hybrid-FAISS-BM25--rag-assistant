If you're using an associative array, you're not accessing it via "use alphabets as well as numbers as their respective keys"; You're using strings - any numbers are the character representations, not an actual index. I can't find anything concrete short of looking through the source, but by most accounts it appears that internally it's implemented as a hash table (rather than a tree) so your access and insert average time is going to be O(1). Doesn't get much more optimal.
