Attention. You have a big error in your code. You are instantiating the endDate before loading the XML. The xml is only loaded when your loadXML is called. This means that xml was null and instantiating the Date with a null value it would give you the begging of the Unix Epoch as a timestamp (Thu Jan 1 02:00:00 GMT+0200 1970) thus the "few thousand" days difference. I'd just like to point out another obvious error. Loading the xml correctly and tracing (2000,8,5) and then using that value for the countdown is like (wrongly) invoking the Date constructor like this var endDate:Date = new Date("2009,8,5"); // note the quotes // because what you trace from the xml is a string as opposed to the correct call you use in the first example. Otherwise Joel gave you an example of how to easily pass that values to your Date constructor if you were to change the xml structure. If you were to test your endDate trace output you'd have received an Invalid Date. If you'd rather not touch your xml, you then can go with something like this. //load in xml var xml:int = 0 var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader(); loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, loadXML); loader.load(new URLRequest("countdown.xml")); var endDate:Date; function loadXML(e:Event):void { var xml = new XML(e.target.data) ; var xmlDate:Array = String(xml).split(","); endDate = new Date(parseInt(xmlDate[0]), parseInt(xmlDate[1])-1, parseInt(xmlDate[2])); trace(endDate); }
