You should use #pragma pack before including the headers of the library you use (and after, with push and pop). This way you won't have to define the structs by yourself. #pragma pack(push, 1) #include #pragma pack(pop) // You can now use the struct defined in the library Indeed, the library has been compiled using a given alignment. You cannot change this , it is already hard-coded in the binary compiled library. However, you have to instruct the compiler, when you compile your files, that the structs contained in the library, are to be defined and used with another alignment.
