Iphone-SDK "unable to read symbols error" when linking to IBOutlet in tab based app

I built a very simple tab based app with 2 tabs, each tab tied to its own view controller. Straightforward so far. I then create a simple IBOutlet on my 2nd view controller like so #import @interface bViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UITextField *aField; } @property (nonatomic, retain) UITextField *aField; @end then i synthesize it in my .m file, then i go into my xib, drag a text field onto the view and then set the files owner to 'aField'. Very textbook so far. It builds, but when i run it and select the 2nd tab (which shows the view where i've linked the UITextfield IBOutlet), it throws this error. warning: Unable to read symbols for "/System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/UIKit" (file not found). warning: Unable to read symbols from "UIKit" (not yet mapped into memory). warning: Unable to read symbols for "/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/CoreGraphics" (file not found). warning: Unable to read symbols from "CoreGraphics" (not yet mapped into memory). which is VERY ODD because this only started happening recently. Any clues? UPDATE: I'm beginning to suspect a config error rather than a syntax error because these are stripped down samples i created just to demonstrate the problem. This fails only when i create a tab-based application. if i do the EXACT same thing in a view-based application, it works fine.
