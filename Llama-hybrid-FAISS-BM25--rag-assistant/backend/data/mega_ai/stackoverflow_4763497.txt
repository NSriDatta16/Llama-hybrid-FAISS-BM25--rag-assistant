This is going to be more of an opinion type answer but... I find that the ease of understanding a program, i.e. maintaining and debugging said application, is inversly proportional to the amount of stateful transitions that occur during the processing of each component. The less state I need to cart around in my head, the more focus I can pay attention to the logic within the algorithms as it is written.
