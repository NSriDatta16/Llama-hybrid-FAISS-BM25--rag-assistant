Allow me to chime in as a guy working specifically on Visual Studio 2010 UI... By "latest beta" I assume that you mean beta 1. If so, keep in mind that its intent was more to showcase the features, and it preceded a lot of optimization work. We do take performance very seriously, and there is a lot of attention dedicated specifically to making it work fast. This goes not just for the common UI, by the way, but for all parts of VS - editor, project system etc - and, of course, the underlying frameworks as well (WPF in particular). So, before judging on VS2010 performance, I would highly recommend waiting for the next beta (no, I can't tell you when, sorry...), which will have a lot of that stuff in it. One important thing that may or may not affect you: WPF has an inevitable (well, so far at least, I don't know if they're planning to do anything about it in future releases) performance hit when used over Remote Desktop, because it can't just send a stream of commands corresponding to GDI primitives, and has to remote invalidated and redrawn regions as bitmaps - read this blog post for more info. As that blog post notes, however, there are some tricks to minimize the performance hit, and we do use them - try running beta 1 over RD, and see if you can spot any visual differences compared to local... All that said, for the use case you specify - 70 projects in a single solution - any potential slowdown from the use of WPF will likely be dwarfed by costs associated with managing those projects to the point of complete irrelevance.
