Perhaps it is related to the fact that the passed parameters are NULL, check how your query is build perhaps it behaves in different way then expected when you pass NULL. Does you proc returns expected results when you call: SET FMTONLY OFF exec [cpExportRecordType_ListByExportAgentID] null, null ? Other possibility: I understand that you build your query dynamically by getting results from calling another queries to get the column names. Perhaps the query that would normally give you the column names returns no data but only column information (SET FMTONLY ON) so you do not have data to build you dynamic query.
