I'd recommend: Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Gelman & Hill) Chapter9 and Chapter10 are about causal inference and publicly accessible. Gelman is known to be a great author who describes complex concepts thoroughly. Also consider his web blog: http://andrewgelman.com/ there are lots of materials about causal inference. You don't get the full picture of all possible methods, but you'd probably get a very elaborate explanation about what is going on. PS: Gelman's 8 schools treatment effect analysis became a classic example of bayesian statistics of hierarchical modelling.
