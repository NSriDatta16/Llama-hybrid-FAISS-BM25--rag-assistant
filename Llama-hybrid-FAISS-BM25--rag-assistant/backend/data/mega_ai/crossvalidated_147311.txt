Hypothesis significance better than Mean Average Precision?

Consider I have two search engines, one (B) with Mean Average Precision higher than the other (B). Now, can this metric be enough to say that the first search engine A is better than the second one B? If not, how would other methods such as hypothesis significance tests would help me find out which one is better?
