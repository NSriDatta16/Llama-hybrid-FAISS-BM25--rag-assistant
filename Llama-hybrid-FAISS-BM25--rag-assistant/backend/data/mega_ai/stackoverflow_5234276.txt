I've seen some database where the indices (indexes?...different debate) have been larger than the data. If one can get away with half the storage demands (varchar) within the index then one assumes that equates to twice the hit density of a given page and more efficient fill-factoring leading to faster data retrieval/writing/locking & less storage requirements (already mentioned).
