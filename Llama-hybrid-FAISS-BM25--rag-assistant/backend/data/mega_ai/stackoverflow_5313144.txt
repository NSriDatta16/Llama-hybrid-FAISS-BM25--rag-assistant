Render in IE 9 and Firefox, Totally Different

http://beta.yigitaydogan.com/ I'm designing a web page which contains a lot of jquery animations in it and I had never tested it with IE during the development. Now, I wanted to test it with IE 9 and just observed that it renders it in a totally different. Is there any easy way to fix it to work in both ? All site is client side and it is on the link above. Thanks,
