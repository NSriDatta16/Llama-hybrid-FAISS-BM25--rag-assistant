What you should initialize the dictionary capacity to depends on two factors: (1) The distribution of the gethashcode function, and (2) How many items you have to insert. Your hash function should either be randomly distributed, or it is should be specially formulated for your set of input. Let's assume the first, but if you are interested in the second look up perfect hash functions. If you have 100 items to insert into the dictionary, a randomly distributed hash function, and you set the capacity to 100, then when you insert the ith item into the hash table you have a (i-1) / 100 probability that the ith item will collide with another item upon insertion. If you want to lower this probability of collision, increase the capacity. Doubling the expected capacity halves the chance of collision. Furthermore, if you know how frequently you are going to be accessing each item in the dictionary you may want to insert the items in order of decreasing frequency since the items that you insert first will be on average faster to access.
