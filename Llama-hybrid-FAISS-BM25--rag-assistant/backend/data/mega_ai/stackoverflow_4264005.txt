The term you are looking for is something like "systemwide code injection," and Cocoa does not provide an API for any such thing. You'd need to take a look at something like mach_star or SIMBL . But honestly, this is one of those things where, if you have to ask, it's probably a little advanced for you. Modifying other processes' code is a gigantic PITA and even harder to do right, even with as much help as mach_star offers. If you want to see just how hard, take a look at Unsanity's site . That's the company that pioneered code injection on OS X, and their entire product line is based around it â€” and many of their programs are still not compatible with OS X 10.6.
