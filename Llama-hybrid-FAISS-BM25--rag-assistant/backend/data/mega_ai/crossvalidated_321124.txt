I don't know about the specific case for daily 365/366 time series, but this is similar to the 52 week vs 53 week issue for some yearly time series. In the case of 52 vs. 53 weeks, the algorithm (whether Holt-Winters or another forecasting algorithm) can't handle it, you need to preprocess the data to transform the 53 week data into 52 weeks using a suitable mapping and then just apply the algorithm to that data. Something similar can be done for 365 days vs. 366 days.
