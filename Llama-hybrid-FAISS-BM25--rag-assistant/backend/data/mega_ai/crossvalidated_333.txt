Ed Thorpe started the whole statistical arbitrage thing. He has a website, and some good articles. http://edwardothorp.com/ You should also read Nassim Taleb's "Fooled By Randomness". Also, go on Google Scholar and read the top articles by Markowitz, Sharpe, Fama, Modigliani. If you don't have full access, go to the nearest college and get a community library card.
