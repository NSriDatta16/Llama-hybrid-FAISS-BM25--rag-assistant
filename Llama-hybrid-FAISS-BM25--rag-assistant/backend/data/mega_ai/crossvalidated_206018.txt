This isn't in any sense a complete answer, but it certainly won't fit in a comment. Thanks for posting sample data [EDIT: now removed from the OP], which makes it easier to think about the question. The spreadsheet posted has no text labels, but given the word description the data structure seems clear. The last variable (column) was created for the purposes of my own software. Three key points: Much depends on the biological or medical details, not given, but rank has no obvious meaning beyond being identified for each experiment. If there were, as it were, some kind of pecking order which emerges during the experiment, then that is different, but in the absence of other information the animals are taken to be independent of each other. I'd certainly be queasy about taking the first animal in each experiment and combining them when they are different animals, and similarly for other ranks. As you say, there will be just be inevitable consequences that the average of the highest is likely to be the highest of the averages, and so forth. As far as visualization is concerned, I don't see that there is an inherent difficulty in plotting the raw data as time series. Example below. That little structure is evident in the data is a different problem, but I can't comment given no knowledge of what you are expecting or hypothesising. I can't imagine that using ranks directly or indirectly would help here. EDIT Stacked bars. I've not tried to make this look good. A small merit of this design is that if you look carefully you can see leakage on a few days.
