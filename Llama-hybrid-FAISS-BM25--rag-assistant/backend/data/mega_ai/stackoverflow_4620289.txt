I've had issues with this before. Try taking off the content type header. here is the code i came up with for it that worked in IE and FF. Notice the commented lines, was having the same issues with different combos of those being on. header("Cache-Control: public"); header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: public"); //header("Content-Description: File Transfer"); //header("Content-type: application/zip"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"adwords-csv.zip\""); //header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-length: " . filesize($filename));
