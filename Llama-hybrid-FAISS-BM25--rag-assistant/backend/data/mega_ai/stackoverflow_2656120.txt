installing glassfish on ubuntu karmic using synaptics package manager

I'm trying to learn to use glassfish for the first time. My IDE is netbeans and I've installed the glassfish plugin for netbeans. I opened up synaptics package manager and typed in glassfish. My choices were imqv2 glassfish-activaton glassfish-mail glassfish-appserv glassfish-toplink-essentials glassfish-jmac-api glassfish-javaee I'm not sure what is in each package, or which package are needed. I can't seem to find anything that tells me anything descriptive about these packages. I've seen a lot of tutorials on how to install glassfish, but I'd prefer to use apt-get / synaptics to install glassfish so that syntactics can take care of updating.
