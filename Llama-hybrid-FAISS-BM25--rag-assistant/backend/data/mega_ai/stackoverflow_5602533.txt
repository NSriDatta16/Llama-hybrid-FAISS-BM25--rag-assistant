Is there any way I can tell if my code is being compiled with cl.exe?

This has probably been asked before, but I couldn't find it. Is there a way to determine, at compile time, if my code is being compiled by cl.exe ? I will be using this to conditionally include (during preprocessing, via #ifdef ) certain #pragma directives only supported by cl.exe .
