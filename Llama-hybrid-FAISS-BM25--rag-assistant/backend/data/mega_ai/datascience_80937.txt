Identify "steady-state" time series window

I'm new with the time-series analysis. I have several time-series (noisy of course) part of the same set of measurements (sampled simultaneously). The time series are the results of a stochastic process (dynamic system) where part of the time-series are inputs to the process and other time-series are the outputs. I need to find a time window corresponding to a steady operation, i.e. where both inputs and outputs don't change over time (for a deterministic signal would say derivative over time almost zero). Do you know any way to accomplish this task? The measurements are quite long, I need a rather computationally efficient method ideally without involving any visual inspection. Thanks!
