What methods exist for leveraging SecurID and similar technologies?

From Wikipedia: RSA SecurID is a mechanism developed by RSA Security for performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network resource. I just read about this device, and it seems interesting to me. However, I'm not sure how (or even if) software (networked or non-networked) can utilize this method of authentication. I'm making this a community wiki post as this isn't a specific question, but a general overview of addressing authentication with SecurID and similar technologies.
