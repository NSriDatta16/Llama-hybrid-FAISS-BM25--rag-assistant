Adding and Removing tinyMCE instances within jQuery instances

Odd problem here. Working with an existing system that uses TinyMCE as it's text editor. I've created a page which contains a whole lot of movable divs using jquery sortables. Now TinyMCE doesn't seem to like being moved in the dom so after doing a bit of research it appears I have to remove the tinymce instance from the textbox within the div being moved and add it back in at the end of the drag. I can do remove the instance fine but however when I go to add it back in, it won't. I have the most up to date version of TinyMCE, a slightly older version of jQuery (tried updating but no luck). Can't work this out hence this post :) $(function() { $("#categoryorder").sortable({ opacity: 0.6, cursor: 'move', revert: true, forcePlaceholderSize: true, scrollSensitivity: 40, start: function(e, ui) { tinyMCE.execCommand( 'mceRemoveControl', false, 'textarea1' ); }, stop: function(e,ui) { // won't add back here for some reason tinyMCE.execCommand( 'mceAddControl', false, 'textarea1' ); $(this).sortable( "refresh" ); } }); }); Not sure why it won't add back, any ideas?
