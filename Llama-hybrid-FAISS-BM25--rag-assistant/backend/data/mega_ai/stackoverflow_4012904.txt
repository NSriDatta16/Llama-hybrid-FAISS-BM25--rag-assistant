When I needed bookmarks without visible text, I used a hack: white text with a very small font size (0.01). I also created a style "Heading1WithoutBookmark" that is a clone of Heading1 but with style.ParagraphFormat.OutlineLevel = OutlineLevel.BodyText; This allows me to have the bookmark point to a page that only contains an image while the text is showing on the following page. It also allows to have different text on the page and in the bookmark.
