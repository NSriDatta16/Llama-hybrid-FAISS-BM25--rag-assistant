How to do string manipulation in an NSValueTransformer?

I have a table column that I'm binding to a value in an NSArrayController . What I'm trying to do is display only a substring of the actual value in the array controller. The way I've been trying to do that so far is by creating an NSValueTransformer subclass, and then doing the string manipulation in the transformedValue method. However, I can't figure out how to get the incoming value turned into a string (it's of type NSConcreteValue ), and maybe there's an easier way to do this without value transformers.
