UPDATE : Android SDK 11 added a recreate() method to activities. I've done that by simply reusing the intent that started the activity. Define an intent starterIntent in your class and assign it in onCreate() using starterIntent = getIntent(); . Then when you want to restart the activity, call finish(); startActivity(starterIntent); It isn't a very elegant solution, but it's a simple way to restart your activity and force it to reload everything.
