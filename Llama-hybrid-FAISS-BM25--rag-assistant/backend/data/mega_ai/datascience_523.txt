In your notebooks, I did not see your neural network model, can you point which library is using, how many layers you have and what type of neural network are you using? In your notebooks, it seems you are using the noisy and outlier dataset to train the neural network, I think you should train the neural network on the dataset that you do not have any outliers so that you could see the observation distance from the prediction of the neural network to label the observation either outlier or not. I wrote couple of things on outlier detection in time-series signals, your data is highly seasonal as sobach mentioned and you could use FFT(first link above) to get the overall trend in the signal. After you get the frequency component in the gas consumption, you could look at the high frequency components to get the outliers. Also if you want to insist on using neural network for seasonal data, you may want to check recurrent neural networks out as they could incorporate the past observations better than a vanilla neural network, and supposedly may provide a better result for the data that you have.
