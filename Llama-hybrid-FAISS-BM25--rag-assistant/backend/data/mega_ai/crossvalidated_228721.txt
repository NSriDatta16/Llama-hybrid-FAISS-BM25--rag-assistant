Can adaptive MCMC be trusted?

I am reading about adaptive MCMC (see e.g., Chapter 4 of the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo , ed. Brooks et al., 2011; and also Andrieu & Thoms, 2008 ). The main result of Roberts and Rosenthal (2007) is that if the adaptation scheme satisfies the vanishing adaptation condition (plus some other technicality), adaptive MCMC is ergodic under any scheme. For example, vanishing adaptation can be easily obtained by adapting the transition operator at iteration $n$ with probability $p(n)$ , with $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p(n) = 0$ . This result is (a posteriori) intuitive, asymptotically. Since the amount of adaptation tends to zero, eventually it will not mess up with ergodicity. My concern is what happens with finite time. How do we know that adaptation is not messing up with ergodicity at a given finite time, and that a sampler is sampling from the correct distribution? If it makes sense at all, how much burn-in should one do to ensure that early adaptation is not biasing the chains? Do practitioners in the field trust adaptive MCMC? The reason I am asking is because I've seen many recent methods that try to build-in adaptation in other, more complex ways that are known to respect ergodicity, such as regeneration or ensemble methods (i.e., it is legit to choose a transition operator that depends on the state of other parallel chains). Alternatively, adaptation is performed only during burn-in, such as in Stan , but not at runtime. All these efforts suggest to me that adaptive MCMC as per Roberts and Rosenthal (which would be incredibly simple to implement) is not considered reliable; but perhaps there are other reasons. What about specific implementations, such as adaptive Metropolis-Hastings ( Haario et al. 2001 )? References Rosenthal, J. S. (2011). Optimal proposal distributions and adaptive MCMC.
