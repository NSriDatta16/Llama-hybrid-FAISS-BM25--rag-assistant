Will automatic ML platforms replace the applied statistician?

In the last years, we have seen rapid advances in several fields related to computing and statistics. This led to statistical/ML models that are easy to use, applicable in several tasks, and perform acceptably to some standards. Being easy to use does not translate into correct application/interpretation of statistics. However, perhaps many industries do not really care about interpretation or correctness of the statistical methodology, they care about predictive power. Combining this mindset with the technological advances, automatic machine learning platforms have risen. These platforms fit a bulk of models, apply data science methodology, and provide the best models to the user. It also has other interesting aspects, e.g. it leads to an easier automation of the entire process. So it prompts us to ask: how does the man model of the applied statistician compare against the best model of these platforms for most common applications? Some people will immediately reply: Go to competitions and see for yourself: man made models win. However, competition problems are, somehow, special problems. If they were regular problems, they probably would not be in the competitions. Hence, the ultimate question is: what will become of the applied statistician? Will these platforms replace him? Will we employ him only in scientific/special problems in which the automation fails? Or maybe he becomes an “enhancer”: get the best model from the platforms, tweak it a bit, make sanity checks, deploy, and then rinse and repeat? I imagine that this type of “will I lose my job to a machine?” question is quite common in this century. I wonder, however, how we statisticians fare against the machine.
