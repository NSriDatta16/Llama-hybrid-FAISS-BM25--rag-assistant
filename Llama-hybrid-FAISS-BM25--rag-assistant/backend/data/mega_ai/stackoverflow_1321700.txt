I found that, the more is done and checked at compile time, the less can possibly go wrong at run-time. So I try to leverage techniques that allow stricter checking at compile-time. That's one of the reason I went into template-meta programming. If you do something wrong, it doesn't compile and thus never leaves your desk (and thus never arrives at the customer's).
