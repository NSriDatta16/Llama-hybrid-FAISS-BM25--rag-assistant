As maximdim said in a comment, preloading the whole thing will take a lot of time. If your system is not very strange, the user won't need all data at once. Just cache on demand instead. I would also recommend using an established caching solution, such as EHCache , which has persistence via DiskStore -- the only issue is that whatever you cache in this case has to be Serializable. Since you can marshall it as XML, I'm betting you can serialize it too, which should be faster. In a past project, we had to query a very busy, very sluggish service running in an off-site mainframe in order to assemble one of the entities. Average response times from our app were dominated by this query. Since the data we retrieved was mostly read-only caching with EHCache solved our problems.
