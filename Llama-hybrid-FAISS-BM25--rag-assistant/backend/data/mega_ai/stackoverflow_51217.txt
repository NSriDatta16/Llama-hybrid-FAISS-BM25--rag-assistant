How would you organize a Subversion repository for in house software projects?

I work for a company whose primary business is not software related. Most documentation for using source control is written with a development team writing for commercial or open source projects in mind. As someone who writes in house software I can say that work is done differently then it would be in a commercial or open source setting. In addition there are stored procedures and database scripts that need to be kept in sync with the code. In particular I am looking to get suggestions on how best to structure the repository with in house software in mind. Most documentation suggests trunk, branches, tags etc. And procedures for keeping production, test and development environments in sync with their respective sections in the repository etc.
