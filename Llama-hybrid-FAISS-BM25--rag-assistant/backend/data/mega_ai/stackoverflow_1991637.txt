As the URL fragment is not transmitted to the server, you can only use a client side solution. Hereâ€™s one using JavaScript: if (location.href.indexOf("#") > -1) { location.assign(location.href.replace(/\/?#/, "/")); } This simply checks if there is a # in the URL and replaces the first occurrence with / . So /site/#blog would get /site/blog .
