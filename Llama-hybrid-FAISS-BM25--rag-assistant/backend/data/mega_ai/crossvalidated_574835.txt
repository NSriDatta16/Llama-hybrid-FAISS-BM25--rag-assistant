Calculation for background characteristic of data sets that were imputed by mice and matched by MatchThem

I have performed multiple imputation in mice and created a dataset of 100 imputed data sets and then used MatchThem to perform propensity score matching. I can assess the balance of matched data sets with the bal.tab function in the cobalt package, but I would also like to know the average background characteristics of the population after matching (for example, mean age of matched subjects). Please let me know if there are any useful functions or packages to compute the average background information of the multiple imputed data sets that were created mice and matched by MatchThem.
