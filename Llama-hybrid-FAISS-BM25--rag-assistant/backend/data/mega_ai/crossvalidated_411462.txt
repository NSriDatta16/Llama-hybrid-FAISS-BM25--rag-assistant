The average of all results would be the "mean score" $\bar{F}(M)$ the problem you're describing with some data sets being outliers might be mitigated by using standard deviation (std) - $$\sigma(M)^2 = \sum(F(M,D)-\bar{F}(M))^2$$ Then you can use the mean divided by the standard deviation as a criterion for your methods, and rank them accordingly : $$C(M) = \dfrac{\bar{F}(M)}{\sigma(M)}$$ You could also plot out both mean and std to get insight into what makes your methods/data sets outliers.
