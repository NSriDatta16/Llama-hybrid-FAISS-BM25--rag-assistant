I only know of one package capable of fitting MV mixed effect regressions; asreml-r , which is a paid package and relatively expensive - I am pretty sure that vegan::adonis2 or the permanova functions are not capable of this; they only do nesting, which is not the same. You could include aquarium as a fixed term to see how much variation actually exists between aquarium though. The differences in sample size aren't too extraordinary. However, if you are really worried about them you can use multiple imputation ( here is a tutorial to do it in R) to generate the missing observations. What kind of community matrix are you dealing with? Presence-Absence?
