You may find some inspirations from language models, especially bigram model or trigram model. A bigram model is essentially a markov chain. You have to either manually specify the parameters like P(brush/line tool) or learn them from user interaction data. A trigram model is a second order markov chain. Hence you consider two previous interactions to predict the next, like P(brush tool/color tool, line tool) I am not sure how effective this kind of prediction will be. If you want to use an HMM, you have to specify some hidden states. Note that picking a tool is an observed state. So you may choose hidden states as the intentions of the user like 1. user wants to add more drawing 2. user pauses to add some finishing touches etc. But you have to try out different things to find out how effective it will be. My advice is to start with the simplest; a bigram model (A first order markov chain) and see how effective it is.
