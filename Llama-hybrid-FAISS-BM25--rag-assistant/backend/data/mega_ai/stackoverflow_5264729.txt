Custom Drupal theme template files not being used

I am trying to organize my theme folder, which has node theming overrides for dozens of views. Basically I have two different styles and I want them all to look the same, more or less. Is there a way in template.php that I can do this? And what is the best way? I tried this code in my theme's hook_preprocess_node function: switch($vars['view']->name) { case 'taxonomy_term' : switch($vars['view']->current_display) { case 'page' : array_push($vars['template_files'], 'list-view'); default : break; } break; default : break; } And when I look in theme developer, I can see the list-view.tpl.php file there, but its not actually using that file from my theme directory. What am I missing?
