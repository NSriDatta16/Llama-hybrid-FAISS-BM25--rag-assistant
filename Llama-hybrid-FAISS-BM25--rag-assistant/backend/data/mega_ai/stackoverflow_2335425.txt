The standard way is to look at your requirements, and store the data required. While this is an interesting academic problem, the truth is, in the dozens of systems I've worked on, first and last name is usually sufficient. Sometimes we will store a middle initial, but most of the time even that isn't required. If you have a requirement to store all of Dr. John Quintus Maximus Public-Doe III Ph.D. MD. RPh's information, then you devise storage for that. But as long as your last name allows for enough data, then Dr. Maximus can type as much or as little as he would like to be stored about his name and titles.
