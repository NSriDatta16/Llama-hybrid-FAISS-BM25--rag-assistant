In order to be able to temporarily suspend data binding, you'll have to put a BindingSource between your DataGridView and your DataView . By setting the RaiseListChangedEvents property of the BindingSource to false, changes in the underlying source are not notified to the DataGridView . You can drag & drop a Bindingsource component from the toolbox in the design view. I tried to set up the data sources via the designer but it didn't work, so I did it in code: bindingSource1.DataSource = someDataTable.DefaultView; dataGridView1.DataSource = bindingSource1; To suspend data binding, just set the RaiseListChangedEvents property to false: bindingSource1.RaiseListChangedEvents = false; To resume data binding, just set the RaiseListChangedEvents to true and reset the bindings so the display is updated: bindingSource1.RaiseListChangedEvents = true; bindingSource1.ResetBindings(false);
