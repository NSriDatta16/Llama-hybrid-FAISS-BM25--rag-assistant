Well, you can't learn a model and then test it in the same data, it will all be biaised... You HAVE to split in train-validation-test (or do Cross-Validation or wathever you want) to apply ANY model... This is one of the basis of Data Science and Machine Learning, so I'd suggest you to find tutorials to learn basis before starting.
