Your chart seems to show that light GBM models are very inconsistent in terms of F1 score. The other two types of model tend to have lower validation accuracy than training accuracy, suggesting overfitting is occurring to some extent (but this is ubiquitous in machine learning so itâ€™s not a deal breaker by any means). The best median validation performance is by RandomForest, however some outliers underperformed the models using bagging. Possibly a good approach would be to have an ensemble of RandomForest models.
