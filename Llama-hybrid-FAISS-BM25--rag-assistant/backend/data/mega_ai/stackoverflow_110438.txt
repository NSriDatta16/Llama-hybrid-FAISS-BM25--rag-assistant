BDD (Behavior Driven Development) Though I'm still learning, it's basically TDD organized/focused around how your software will actually be used... NOT how it will be developed/built. Wikipedia General Info BTW as far as whether to do multiple asserts per test method I would recommend trying it both ways. Sometimes you'll see where one strategy left you in a bind and it'll start making sense why you normally just use one assert per method.
