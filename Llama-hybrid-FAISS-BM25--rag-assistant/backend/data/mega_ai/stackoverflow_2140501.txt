Java maths - testing for NaN

I would like to have some kind of project-wide fail fast mechanism (maybe a RuntimeException ) for any code that causes assignment of NaN . In my project NaN is never a valid value. I realise I could add asserts (using isNaN ) or other tests throughout but I want to know if there is a more elegant way.
