Your derived type is not constructed yet. Class Cat : Animal { //... }; When you create a create a Cat object the following happens: Construct Animal Construct Cat When your object goes out of scope or gets destroyed via delete if on the heap, the following happens: Destruct Cat Destruct Animal For this reason you should not call virtual functions in your constructor or destructor. You would even have a pure virtual function call if you did not have an implementation in your base class. You are going to have to: GUIListbox lb; lb.SetupCallbacks(); The point of virtual is so that you can do things like: GuiWindow *lb = new GuiListbox(); lb->SetupCallback();//Gets correctly resolved to GuiListBox's version
