meaning of posterior distribution and credible internal

In Bayesian method, we can get a posterior distribution of a parameter. Now I want to do some simulation to know if the posterior distribution is the same as the true distribution. For example, mean of a normal distribution, In frequentist's world, I just need to set a fixed true value of mean and generate sample with this mean, calculate 95% confidence interval, repeat n times and then calculate the proportion of the confidence interval covering the true value. But I get confused with Bayesian method. If the true value is supposed to be a distribution in Bayes, do I need to generate mean from a true distribution and than generate sample according to this mean? So now every sample has different mean? Then I get a posterior distribution of the mean with Bayes. So is the posterior distribution same with the true distribution I set? But it seems not so according to the simulation I did. If I calculate 95% credible interval, what are supposed to be in this region?
