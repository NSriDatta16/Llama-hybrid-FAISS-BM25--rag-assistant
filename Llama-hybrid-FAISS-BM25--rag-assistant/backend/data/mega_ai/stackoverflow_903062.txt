The Nerd Dinner app leverages the events that are fired when Linq To SQL persists data. Specifically, the OnValidate() method. Since you have a class that is not Linq To Sql, you can fake it by creating your own custom event handler and firing it when the data in the changes. As an alternative, just call a method that validates a given object, calling as many validation functions as you have objects.
