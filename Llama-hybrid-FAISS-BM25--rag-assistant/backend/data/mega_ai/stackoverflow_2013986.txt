why not use the .css('z-index') or zIndex not sure. that handles the over lapping. - give a value of the elements that need to be on the bottom smaller e.g: 1 - give a value of the elements that need to be on the top bigger number e.g : 3 - if you need the dragged element to go in between then give it a value of 2. or u can use it on css as a class where the z-index controls their overlap
