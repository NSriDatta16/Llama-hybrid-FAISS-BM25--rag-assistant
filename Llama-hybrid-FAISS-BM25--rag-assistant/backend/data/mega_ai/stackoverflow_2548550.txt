So you might want to consider what Mark Byers stated in the comment above. Having a good table structure is important when it comes to data retrieval and query optimization. But having said that, its not always possible to do such changes. From what i know about both engines, it really depends on what you are using the db for. InnoDB supports transactions and row locking whiles MyIsam doesn't. If i remember correctly, MyIsam also doesn't support foreign key relationships so if you depend on them in your table structure, MyIsam is out. On the other hand MyIsam has support for full-text search which InnoDB doesn't support but you can get around that by building your own search capability using Lucene or some other library. Hope this helps....
