I'm guessing here but I suspect the behavior of this might depend on the compiler you use and how it decides to organize the vf pointer table. I'm also going to note that I think what you are doing is a bad idea and could lead to all kinds of nightmarish problems (use of things like static_cast and dynamic_cast are generally a good idea). The other thing is because fun() is defined in the base class (and it is not virtual) ptr->fun() will always call A::fun() without having to cast it to B*.
