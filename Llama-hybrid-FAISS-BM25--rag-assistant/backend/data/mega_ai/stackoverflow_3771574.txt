I wrote a blog post earlier today on why onkeyup isn't a great idea for detecting user input. The better option is to either use onkeydown with a 0ms timer, or a combination of the newer HTML 5 event oninput for standards compliant browsers and onpropertychange in Internet Explorer. These two events will handle other forms of input such as cut, paste, undo, redo, drag and drop, and even changes made by a native spell checker. Something like this should work for you: // Check for which event we need to bind to, onpropertychange or oninput var evt = "onpropertychange" in document.body ? "propertychange" : "input"; $("#serialCode").bind(evt, function (event) { // For the onpropertychange event, check that the value property changed if (evt == "propertychange" && event.propertyName != "value") return; var d = $("#serialCode").val(); if (d.length == 15) { var $code = d.substring(0, 9); alert('Serial code ' + $code); } $(this).val(""); }); Note that if you need to support older browsers, you'll need to use some form of event detection to see if these events are available and if not, fall back to the keydown with timer method.
