This will probably be enough: $url = "http://www.mydomain.com/article/paragraph/low/"; $newUrl = str_replace('/low/', '/high/', $url); or with regular expressions (it allows more flexibility) $url = "http://www.mydomain.com/article/paragraph/low/"; $newUrl = preg_replace('/low(\/?)$/', 'high$1', $url); Note that the string approach will replace any low segment and only if it's followed by a / . The regex approach will replace low only if it's the last segment and it may not be followed by a / .
