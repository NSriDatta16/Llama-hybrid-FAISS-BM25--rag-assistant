I'm not sure what you mean when you say you aren't thinking of a regression problem but of "true multivariate data". My initial response would be to calculate the Mahalanobis distance since it doesn't require that you specify a particular IV or DV, but at its core (as far as I understand it) it is related to a leverage statistic.
