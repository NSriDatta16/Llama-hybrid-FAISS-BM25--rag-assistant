src/ folder structure in C++?

i'm coming into C++ from Java/AS3-land, and i'm used to the package-cum-folder structure for my classes. and i like it. i understand the very basics of namespaces in c++, and i'm happy to leave it at just the basics. but, as my project gets more complex, i'd like to keep my folder structure organized in a way i can keep in my head. i.e. something similar to Java/AS3. 1) is there any reason to not have a folder structure like: src/ model/ view/ controller/ possibly with subfolders? (this is just an MVC example, the folder structure could be whatever depending on the project's needs.) it just seems unruly to have a src/ folder with a huge pile of header and source files within. 2) if the answer to 1) could be "go ahead and do what you want", would it be unwise/unnecessary to create a namespace for each folder, similar to Java/AS3's way of creating a package for each folder? my understanding is that namespaces are not usually used like this, nested deeply and folder-related.
