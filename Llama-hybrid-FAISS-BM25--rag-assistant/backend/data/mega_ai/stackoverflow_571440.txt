From the WP docs for get_posts: get_posts() can also take the parameters that query_posts() can since both functions now use the same database query code internally. The only difference between the two functions is that get_posts returns an array with post records, while query_posts stores the records in the query object for retrieval by the template functions (has_posts, the_post, etc). They both use the WP_Query object to execute the query. Creating a second loop is covered in the Wordpress docs . There are some links there for other examples of multiple loops. You'll notice that everyone does it differently, but they all seem happy with their results.
