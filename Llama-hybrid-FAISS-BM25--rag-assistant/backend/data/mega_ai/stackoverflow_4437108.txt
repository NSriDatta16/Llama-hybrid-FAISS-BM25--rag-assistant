This is just a list of things to try/check -> Unknown Source to true -> Debuggable requires USB Debugging -> Non Mass Storage mode/USB connect to access the SD Card -> unplug replug -> reboot the phone (to be sure you can unplug the usb and remove the battery) -> restart adb Can you see an emulator ? can you launch your app on the emulator? can you launch a different project on the phone?
