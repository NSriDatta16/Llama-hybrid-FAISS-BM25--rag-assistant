I think your intuition is in the right direction, but what you're missing is that it is customary to subtract the mean sample vector before performing PCA. The PCA vectors then represent deviations from the mean. The importance of the components in PCA analysis is always from the one with highest value/score to the one with lowest value/score. Depending on the particular application, the vectors with lowest associated values may even be omitted. The intuition is that to understand the variations in the data between samples it is often easier to think in terms of "independently occurring" (more precisely, uncorrelated) variations rather than variations of each specific element, if the elements actually vary together (and in many problems areas, financial assets included, they tend to vary together).
