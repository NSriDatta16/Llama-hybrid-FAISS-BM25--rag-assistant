Exclude specific methods from code coverage from cobertura?

I was trying to ignore all the toString() methods from instrumentation using following configuration. This wasn't really working? This is using cobertura as maven plugin. This was based on a previous answer Exclude methods from code coverage with Cobertura . toString What do you think I'm doing wrong. I wasn't able to find an example for this on the cobertura documentation.
