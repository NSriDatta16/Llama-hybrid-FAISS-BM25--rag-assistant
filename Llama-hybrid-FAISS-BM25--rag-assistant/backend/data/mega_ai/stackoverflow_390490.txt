Use a framework / MVC system. The more organised and centralized your code is the better. Try using Memcache. PHP has a built in extension for it, it takes about ten minutes to set up and another twenty to put in your application. You can cache whatever you want to it - I cache all my database records in it - for every application. It does wanders. I would recommend using a source control system such as Subversion if you aren't already.
