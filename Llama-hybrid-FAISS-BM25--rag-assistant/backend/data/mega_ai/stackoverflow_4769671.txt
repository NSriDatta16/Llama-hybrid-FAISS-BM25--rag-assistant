Actually, I think you nailed it in your last paragraph. A company is either defined by a user or isn't, so the userId makes sense as a nullable column. This would also allow you to have a unique key on the company name, which allows you to use the database to enforce the fact that a company name can't be duplicated. Your company table exists to define companies--which user (or whether a user) created the company is just information ABOUT a company.
