How to do unsupervised clustering on sentences to find intents

I am working on chatbot for students. So, I have chatlogs on conversation between student and tutor, which is on mathematical problems (no labels). First thing I want to find is intents, such as whether given line is problem description from student , doubt from student or greetings. For which I tried with sentence transformer with math bert to create embeddings and use umap with cosine as metric to do dimensional reduction, and then cluster them using hdbscan to find all intents possible, but the results weren't that great. Also, tried with zero-shot classification with bart, which did not give better results. Any idea on what could be better approach?
