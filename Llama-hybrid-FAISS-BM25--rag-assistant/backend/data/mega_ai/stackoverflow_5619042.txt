Android, storing several MB of app data safely (security/error free) and considerately (not filling storage)?

My Android application is heavily image intensive. Out of consideration for the multiple phone specifications, my application optimizes all the images to smaller, easier to handle sizes for the devices that require them. At present these are stored in: /data/data/com.myapp.example/files However I feel there are two important considerations to make, First of all that the application will take up approximately 10MB of additional space after the initial "setup". How can I make this as small a problem as possible for the user? I havn't considered outputting them to the SD card because they are licensed material and SD is totally insecure. (although i'm totally aware that so is data directory from rooted devices). What would be the solution to this problem? My second consideration is that I need to be able to know if there is enough space on the users device before I start trying to use it, is there some way I can find out before I begin the process?
