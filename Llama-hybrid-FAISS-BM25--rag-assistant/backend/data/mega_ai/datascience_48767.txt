SVM hard and soft margins in matlab,

I am comparing the performances of several SVM models in matlab using the fitcsvm function, and I want to double check that I am using the correct syntax for hard soft amragins and kernel: the syntax of hard margin should be as follows, in which the hyperparameter of hard margin cost (boxConstraint) should be infinite %Hard Margin SVMModel = fitcsvm(x_train,y_train,'BoxConstraint',Inf); while the soft margin, the boxConstraint (which is the only hyperparameter needed for soft margin)should be tuned and given a suitable value, for example %soft Margin SVMModel = fitcsvm(x_train,y_train,'BoxConstraint', 7); or leave it as default (which has the boxconstraint as 1) SVMModel = fitcsvm(x_train,y_train); and for the kernel model, say RBF, both boxconstrains and KernelScale (gamma) should be tuned and used SVMModel = fitcsvm(x_train,y_train, KernelFunction, 'RBF',... 'BoxConstraint', 7,'KernelScale', '0.3'); assuming the all hyperparameters are tuned, is the previous syntax considered correct to have hard, soft and kernel models in Matlab? Also, in case of cross-validation of the model, how to get the best hyperparameters while the SVM model is cross-validated? or selecting the hyperparamters step should be before cross-validating the model?
