What is dense prediction in Deep learning?

I am using TensorFlow's pre-trained model of Convolutional Neural Network. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/slim/nets/resnet_v2.py#L130 I found following sentence: However, for dense prediction tasks we advise that one uses inputs with spatial dimensions that are multiples of 32 plus 1, e.g., [321, 321]. Does anyone know what is dense prediction in this literature?
