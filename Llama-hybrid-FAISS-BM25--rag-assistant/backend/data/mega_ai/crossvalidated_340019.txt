Well, as far as I'm aware there is no strict assumption of sample-by-sample independence, the way you mean it. The closest thing I can find is the assumption of no auto-correlation in a variable, meaning one sample should not depend on its previous values (e.g. as is the case in time series). The main problem in the example you described is that your data, while measuring the same thing , originates from different distributions . Which will hurt your outcome in any case (not just linear regression.
