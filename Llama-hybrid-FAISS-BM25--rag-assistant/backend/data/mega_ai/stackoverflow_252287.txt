Bizarre python ImportError

Here's my setup: a Mac, running OS X Tiger. Windows XP running in a virtual machine (Parallels). Windows XP has my Mac home directory mapped as a network drive. I have two files in a directory of my Mac home directory: foo.py pass test.py import foo If I run test.py from within my virtual machine by typing 'python test.py', I get this: Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", line 1, in import foo ImportError: No module named foo If I try to import foo from the console (running python under Windows from the same directory), all is well: Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 18 2007, 08:51:08) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import foo >>> If I run test.py with Mac python, all is well. If I copy test.py and foo.py to a different directory, I can run test.py under Windows without problems. There is an init .py in the original directory, but it is empty. Furthermore, copying it with the other files doesn't break anything in the previous paragraph. There are no python-related environment variables set. Any ideas?
