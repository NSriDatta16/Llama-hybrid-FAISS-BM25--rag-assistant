Average coefficients of several logistic regression models

I trained M logistic regression models by randomly sampling original data. Now, I would like to combine the models. One way to combine is to perform majority voting on the output of predictions. I am thinking of another way of model averaging - by averaging the coefficients of my M logistic regression models. Does it make sense? Are there any approaches in the literature that tried this?
