Must a Personal Profile be Used to Access the Facebook Graph API?

I'm trying to access Facebook data using the Graph API from an external commercial application. I've created a login for my company and gather that I need to register a Facebook App in order to use the Graph API. However, I am confused about the Facebook requirement to associate a Personal Profile (a real person) with the Facebook App. Why must a person become connected to my organization's application? What if I leave the organization? Will the company I worked for need to pick another employee in order to access the Graph API? Surely I am missing something.
