There are few methods: Universal method is "sort it and find longest subsequence" which is O(nlog n) . The fastest sort algorithm is quicksort ( average, the worst is O( n^2 ) ). Also you can use heapsort but it is quite slower in average case but asymptotic complexity is O( n log n ) also in the worst case. If you have some information about numbers then you can use some tricks. If numbers are from the limited range then you can use part of algorithm for counting sort. It is O( n ) . If this isn't your case, there are some other sort algorithms which can do it in linear time but no one is universal.
