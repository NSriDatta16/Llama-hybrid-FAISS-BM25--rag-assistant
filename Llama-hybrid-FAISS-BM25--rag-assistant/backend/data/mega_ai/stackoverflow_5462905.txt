It's unlikely that PowerShell is directly at fault here. It imposes no security or CLR modifications which are passed down to child processes that it creates. The one item PowerShell will definitely pass down to the child process is environment variables. It's very possible that PowerShell is passing down a different environment variable than say CMD which is affecting the CLR or your Program and causing it to crash. I would start up a CMD and PowerShell session and diff their environment variables to rule this out as a cause. In particular I would pay attention to the %PATH% variable.
