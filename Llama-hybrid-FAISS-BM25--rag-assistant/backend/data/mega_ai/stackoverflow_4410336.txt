Look at the UIScrollViewDelegate Protocol Reference . Specifically check the Responding to Scrolling and Dragging methods, from there you can check the contentOffset property of the scrollview which will give you the x and y offset from the origin. EDIT: Added the proper name of the contentOffset property.
