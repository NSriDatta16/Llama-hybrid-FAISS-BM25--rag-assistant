Easiest way is to nest a FormView inside the update panel. Then the only thing you need to do in the code behind is get the additional info, assign it to the FormView.DataSource, and call FormView.DataBind(). Everything in the FormView will use the syntax. You'll probably need to use a FindControl() to get a reference to the FormView. I'd type up the code for you but I'll save you some headaches down the road and say DON'T DO THIS. The update panel is about the most inefficient way to do any ajax stuff. The only way to get it all to wire up correctly with this repeater and server side code is to either have a gigantic viewstate or to rebind the repeater in your page load. You are turning a request that could be 300ms into something that will take over a second...or longer! Get familiar with a good ajax framework and don't be afraid to write real html. At the very least, use a webservice that loads a usercontrol with your markup. I know the update panel is easy, and it's built in. It might even be adequate for what you are doing, but you must resist. You'll be glad you did.
