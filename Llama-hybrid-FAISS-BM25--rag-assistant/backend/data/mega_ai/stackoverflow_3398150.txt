Regarding Mobile Device Browser File : Quote: "Due to the organizational restructuring of the team that developed and supported the Mobile Device Browser file, we will no longer have the resources to support and update this CodePlex project. The team will be providing two more releases â€“ one on the 27th July 2010 and the final release on the 24th August 2010."
