Did you create the categories programmatically (as opposed to using the admin interface)? As is often the case in Magento, when some value is missing or incorrect in the database, entries may not show up at all. If this is the case, please take a look at a "good" category record in the database and make sure that the missing categories follow the correct conventions. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
