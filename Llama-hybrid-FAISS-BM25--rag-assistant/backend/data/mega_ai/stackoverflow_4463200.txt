products not showing up in magento frontend

I am facing a problem in magento store, when any new customer group is added by admin site and if it is assigned to customer, for that particular customer no product showing, the page displaying like "There are no products matching the selection." Please suggest me how this problem can resolved? or why this is arising? Thanks!
