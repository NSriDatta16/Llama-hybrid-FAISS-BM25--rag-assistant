SQLite & Linq - how can I visually design the .dbml file?

SQLite first timer, and I want to use Linq for data access. I made a SQLite database with sqliteadmin, and added it as a data source in VS2008. The problem is that when i try to drag&drop a table from the server explorer to the .dbml file, i get the error: "The selected object(s) use an usupported data provider." I used .NET Framework Data Provider for SQLite when i defined the data connection.
