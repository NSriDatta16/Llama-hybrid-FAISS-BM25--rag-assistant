How to access an element's class value via CSS

How can I access the numbers (1 and 2 in the example below) at the end of the paragraph's class string via CSS? I can access these paragraphs via the following selector: p[class^="cooking-step-"] I want to add the paragraph's number in front of the text inside of it via the CSS content property. How do I achieve this?
