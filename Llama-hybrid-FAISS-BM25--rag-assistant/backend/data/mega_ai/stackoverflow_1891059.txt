I'm having trouble positioning this button nicely

I've been goin at it now for an 1.5hrs and I just can't figure out a way to make it the way I want. I'm kind of new with all things web, and it takes about as much time (maybe more?) trying to get things where I want and doing it in a way that is elegant. Anyways, I have two text boxes, with two labels above them and centered over the box. I want to simply put a button in between them and about centered with the textboxes' height. This is as close as I can make it get to what I want. I would like the left textbox moved over so it lines up with the words "Jump To:, "Customer:," and "Customer #:" and then have the right box be the same distance on the right with the Next button maybe a just 10px higher but still centered as it is. The problem with this picture is that it only works when the text boxes are shown and expanded, if they are hidden, then the panel actually renders half-way above the Customer # part because of how I manipulated the margins I'm guessing. http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/259/controls.jpg http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/259/controls.jpg Here's my attempt with s --%> And here's my attempt with table elements All of those was to attempt to put spaces between the button and the text boxes because I couldn't get float nor margin to work. Any help would be much appreciated! And here's the complete page source: Jump To: Customer: Customer #: --%>
