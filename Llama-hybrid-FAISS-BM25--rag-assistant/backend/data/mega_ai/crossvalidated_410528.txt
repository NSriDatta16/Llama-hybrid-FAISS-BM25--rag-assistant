Going by this comment: Yes but you are still classifying each of the images independently of each other. 1 image -> 1 class. What I am talking about is taking 6 images -> 1 class where just one image alone may not represent that class. That is why I feed the images through an RNN after the CNN. If order does not matter, then you could provide samples as channels, with images constantly being shuffled within each set. Alternatively, you could build a Siamese network from all samples and sum or aggregate their (vector or scalar) outputs. This would be order-agnostic as well. To the point If you're not modelling a sequence (a set of 5 or 6 images with no defined precedence) then I find recursive architectures hard to justify. Just stick to a convolutional (with possibly Siamese flavor) architecture.
