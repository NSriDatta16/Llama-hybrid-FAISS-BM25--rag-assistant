How do I properly set up a Silverlight-Enabled WCF Service?

EDIT : I started a closed vote on this question because I resolved the issue. I was doing everything fine, but a reference to an ASP URL rewriter that I downloaded and uninstalled a while ago still had a reference in IIS. This forum post by Waclaw Stypula (the one with the steps) helped me track this down, by accident. When I launched the run command, IIS told me that it (obviously) could not find the rewriter DLL. I removed the reference and the app ran fine after that. I am following the silverlight.net tutorials by Jesse Liberty . Currently I am trying to do tutorial three , but I am running into a wall under the heading " CREATE THE WEB SERVICE " (about halfway down). First, when I create the new service by adding it to the solution, the tutorial indicates that three files should be created; IService1.vb , Service1.svc , and Service1.svc.vb . I do not get the IService1.vb file when I add the service to the solution. I downloaded the copy of the project they provided, and the Service1.svc.vb file is in there, so I added one manually and copied the contents of the file. The tutorial says it is a VB tutorial, but displays C# in the accompanying screenshot so maybe that is the issue. After I get all the files made up like the tutorials (copy/paste to make sure I don't have a typo), I try to add the service reference and get the following error: The service class of type KeyboardControl_Web.Service1 both defines a ServiceContract and inherits a ServiceContract from type KeyboardControl_Web.IService1. Contract inheritance can only be used among interface types. If a class is marked with ServiceContractAttribute, it must be the only type in the hierarchy with ServiceContractAttribute. Consider moving the ServiceContractAttribute on type KeyboardControl_Web.IService1 to a separate interface that type KeyboardControl_Web.IService1 implements. I tried googling different portions of the message, but did not find much useful information. Here is the code for the different files: //IService1.vb Imports System.ServiceModel ' NOTE: If you change the class name "IService1" here, you must also update ' the reference to "IService1" in Web.config. _ Public Interface IService1 _ Function GetAllLocations() As List(Of Address) End Interface //Service1.svc.vb Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic Imports System Imports System.Collections.Generic Imports System.Linq Imports System.Runtime.Serialization Imports System.ServiceModel Imports System.Text ' NOTE: If you change the class name "Service1" here, you must also ' update the reference to "Service1" in Web.config and in the ' associated .svc file. Public Class Service1 Implements IService1 Public Function GetAllLocations() As List(Of Address) Implements IService1.GetAllLocations Dim db As New DataClasses1DataContext() Dim matchingCustomers = From cust In db.userControlDemos Select cust 'Return matchingCustomers.ToList() End Function End Class I am new to Silverlight/WCF in general, as well as to Interfaces and Services. Can you guys help me get on the right track? EDIT: I should add that I am using Visual Studio 2008, on Windows Vista Business SP1.
