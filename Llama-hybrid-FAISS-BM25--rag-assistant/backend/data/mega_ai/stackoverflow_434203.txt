Using C# how should I go about extracting titles subtitles and paragraphs from a docx document

Using C# how should I go about extracting titles subtitles and paragraphs from a docx document. I am thinking of doing this through VSTO but do know know the word object model. I am only familiar with the Excel object model. Should I take the unzip + linq to XML approach ? Using VSTO i could build an addin which could be used to edit the application where I would convert to and from docx. does anyone have prior experiences with this kind of thing? any leads will be greatly appreciated.
