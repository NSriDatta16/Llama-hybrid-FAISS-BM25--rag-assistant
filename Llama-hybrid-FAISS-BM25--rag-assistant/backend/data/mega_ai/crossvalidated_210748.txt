Building regression model with multicollinear continuous and categorical variables: can I use PCA?

I am trying to build a regression model that has continuous and categorical predictors. Furthermore, the continuous variables suffer from collinearity. My understanding is that PCA can handle multicollinearity but not categorical variables. My questions are as follows (Question 1 is my main question): Can I do a PCA to get the principle component (PC) scores of the continuous variables and then take both the PC scores and categorical variables to build a mixed datatype regression model? Or is there a concern with this approach (and is there a better method)? When should I do a transform to the data, if needed? Before PCA or after PCA (i.e., before the regression model)? I ask because many of my variables are geometric measurements of length, area, and volume (i.e., this is a power function with 1, 2 and 3 for the power).
