If it is "a big flash site", you should never have a single swf to hold all the things. Usually each page is created as a swf and have a main holder to load them dynamically on request. Also, loads the media elements instead of embedding them. It will let you manage the site easier too. Update: Sorry that I haven't noticed you've already done these... I think the remainning option is really trying those swf optimizer. I've thought of using Gzip on server side, but seems that there is problem . BTW, I found this one .
