Is Core Data useful for readonly data too?

I'm creating an iPhone App and am wondering whether Core Data is better for readonly data than a SQLite database. It feels like the SQLite DB is the better choice, is that right? Can I even pre-fill the Core Data storage? Basically, I need like 3 tables with a bunch (up to 3000) of entities each. I then want to list the data in TableViews, search on it or load things for other purposes. Should or can I use Core Data in this case?
