I think you will find an answer to your questions in this paper: Biswas, S., Wardat, M., & Rajan, H. (2022, May). The art and practice of data science pipelines: A comprehensive study of data science pipelines in theory, in-the-small, and in-the-large. In Proceedings of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (pp. 2091-2103). The authors analysed many different data science pipelines (among others 21 best GitHub projects in this area). They extracted and coined a few proposals for standards, I'm sure you will find something for yourself. For instance - you can read what are the distributions of order of stages between each other, how often some stages are used in general or what is the most popular pipeline.
