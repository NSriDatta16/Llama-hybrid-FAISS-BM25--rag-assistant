@dmckee No clicks, as the images all load automatically. Think mapping software. @Brian Agnew It will run/served on some sort of Linux cloud thing. I'm not an IT guy by any stretch of the imagination, just the programmer. But it will definitely be scaled out to a bunch of machines. @Onkelborg I concur. My inclination has been to go with more folders and less files, as well. I'm thinking the layout would be something like... set/zoom-level/column/row.jpg I wanted to use filename/directory structure to pull files without querying a server. If we're zoomed in by a factor of five and the top left coordinate is 25,600 x 15,360 of this larger image, given a 256 pixel square tile, some basic math would give me this URL: 2389/5/20/12.jpg Where "2389" is a tile-set ID. So you can see images would only be stored in directories three levels deep. The directories with images would hold maybe 4 - ~100 images based on zoom level. Or maybe a dozen to a few hundred (with slightly less folders), if went this way... set/zoom-level/row/column.jpg I came across a similar system that used a similar quad tree system and notice that they had to break out into new folders at odd, non-systemic spots that made me think they did it for performance issues or other limitations. As I've written this, I think I'm realize that the first layout is probably the way to go. It's less items to iterate through to find requested file. I'm just thinking of fragmentation, but I guess that will be IT's job. ;)
