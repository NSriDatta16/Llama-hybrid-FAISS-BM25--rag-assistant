Mail spam filters use the sending IP address as a major component of determining the spamminess of the incoming message. Unless you've specifically paid attention to maintaining it, your outbound mailserver's IP address -- the box you're running sendmail on -- is likely to have a neutral-to-bad reputation in most major spam filters (e.g. Gmail, Postini, and Yahoo to Barracuda and IronPort). Therefore, for the highest deliverability I'd recommended you send through the Gmail outbound servers. That recommendation is assuming you can do so within the TOS; Gmail is meant for individual use, not to be an application gateway, so if you're sending more than approx. 100 messages per day, you should instead look at a commercial relay solution. Adam mentioned http://postmarkapp.com ; two other choices we dealt with at Yahoo were http://authsmtp.com and http://sendgrid.com . Hope that helps.
