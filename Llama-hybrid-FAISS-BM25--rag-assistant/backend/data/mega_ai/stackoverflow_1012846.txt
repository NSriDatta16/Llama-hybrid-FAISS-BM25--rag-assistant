Accessible navigation of large information trees

I am developing a public website which is the front end to information about medical conditions. After the user does a search (questionnaire based) they are presented with the results which are categorised in to sections and sub-sections. Information items can be assigned to both sections and sub-sections. At the moment sections are represented by tabs across the top and the screen and sub-sections by links in a sidebar. The links in the sidebar change depending on which section is selected. The problem is the section names are quite long (several words) and as a result the combined length of the tabs is too wide for a standard screen resolution (1024 x 768). Therefore they wrap and break the page layout. We will also have to add additional tabs in the future. With this problem in mind and the fact our target audience is quite wide, this is a public medical website, what options are there for presenting this kind of information in a way which is accessible and easy to navigate for an average user.
