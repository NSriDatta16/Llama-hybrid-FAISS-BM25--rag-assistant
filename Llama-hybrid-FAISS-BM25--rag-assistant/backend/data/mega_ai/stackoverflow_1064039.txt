Here are two tips for quickly selecting multiple column names, both which seem to be rarely known/used by SQL Server developers. 1 - Highlight your table name in Query Analyzer (double-click it). Then press Alt - F1 . You will see tons of info about the table, among it the column names. Drag to select one or more column names, and use Ctrl - C , Ctrl - V , to paste them into your query. This is also a good way to see what indexes and constraints are on the table. 2 - From Object Explorer, right-click on your table and select Script Table as/SELECT To/Clipboard . Then paste the results into your query and remove the parts you don't need.
