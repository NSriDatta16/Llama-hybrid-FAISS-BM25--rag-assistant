I'm looking for solution manual “A first course in Bayesian statistical methods”

I'm looking for a solution manual for Peter Hoff's A first course in Bayesian statistical methods . I cannot find it online, does anybody know whether there is a manual available? Alternatively does anybody know where I can find good exercises and solutions for a math student who tries to understand Bayesian Statistics? Especially Belief, probability and exchangeability Conjugacy in exponential family models Monte Carlo approximation Gibbs and Metropolis sampling Bayesian linear regression
