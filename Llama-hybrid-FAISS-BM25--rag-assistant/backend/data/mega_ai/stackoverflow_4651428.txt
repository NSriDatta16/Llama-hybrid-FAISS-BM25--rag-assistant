Making a stacked area plot using ggplot2

I'm using the following data structure to try and make a stacked area chart: df However, I don't understand how to stack the areas on top of each other; at the moment they are overlapping. I assume that I need a position = 'stack' argument here, but the plot looks the same whether it is included or not. Also, is it possible to order DomArea by one of the categories in PR_Cat or would I need to reorganize my data?
