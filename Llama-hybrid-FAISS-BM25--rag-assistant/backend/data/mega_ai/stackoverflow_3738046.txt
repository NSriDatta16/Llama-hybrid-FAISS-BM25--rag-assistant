I ran into this post on a google search, and although your findings are excellent, I think we can improve them. This is the results of a bit of hacking on your solution: .ctags --regex-JavaScript=/^var[ \t]+([a-zA-Z0-9_$]+) = \[/\1/a,array/ --regex-JavaScript=/^var[ \t]+([a-zA-Z0-9_$]+) = \{/\1/o,object/ --regex-JavaScript=/^var[ \t]+([a-zA-Z0-9_$]+) = (^{^[)+/\1/r,var/ --regex-JavaScript=/^[ \t]*(this\.)?([A-Za-z0-9_$()]+)[ \t]*[:=][ \t]*function[ \t]*\(\)/\2/u,function/ --regex-JavaScript=/^[ \t]*function ([a-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9_]*)/\1/u,function/ --regex-JavaScript=/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.prototype\.([a-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9_]*)/\1 : \2/u,function/ --regex-JavaScript=/^[ \t]*function ([A-Z]+[A-Za-z0-9_]*)/\1/o,object/ .vimrc let g:tlist_javascript_settings = 'javascript;r:var;s:string;a:array;o:object;u:function' This gets rid of a few more false positives, and adds some more features in, as a tradeoff for getting rid of some of the more problematic regexes. I'll keep updating if I find I need more. Edit : I've gotten everything working really nicely now; I feel like this result is solid. The only major deficiency is that it doesn't work on comma separated variable definitions. That seems particularly nasty. Maybe another day. :) Note also that I changed the .vimrc. This isn't because I'm a freak; it's because somehow taglist or ctags or something has some default values set, and if you don't change it, then you get a lot of doubles where functions and vars are concerned, which really drives me insane (I pay super attention to detail.. :P ) Edit : More tweaks. It picks up on prototype function declarations now, and doesn't do some other stupid stuff.
