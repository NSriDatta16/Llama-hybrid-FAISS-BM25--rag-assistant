Python as an extension language is called "Embedding Python". you can call a python module from c++ by bascially calling the python intepreter and have it execute the python source. This is called embedding . It works from C and C++, and will probably work just as well from C#. And no, you do not need any kind of "shell". While Python can be interactive, that's not a requirement at all.
