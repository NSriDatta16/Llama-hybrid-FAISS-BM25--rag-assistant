The ins and outs of database storage and optimization are huge. Knowing how to index and partition tables well is invaluable knowledge. Also, how to read a query execution plan. SQL is such a cool language in that it will tell you exactly how it's going to run your code, so long as you ask nicely. This is absolutely essential in optimizing your code and finding bottlenecks. Database maintenance (backups, shrinking files, etc) is always important to keep your server running smoothly. It's something that's often overlooked, too. Developers should know all about triggers and stored procedures--getting the database to work for you. These things can help automate so many tasks, and often developers overlook them and try to handle it all app side, when they should really be handled by something that thinks in sets. Which brings me to the most important point, database developers need to think in sets. To often I hear, "For each row, I want to..." and this is generally an alarm in my head. You should be thinking about how the set interacts and the actions you want to take on entire columns.
