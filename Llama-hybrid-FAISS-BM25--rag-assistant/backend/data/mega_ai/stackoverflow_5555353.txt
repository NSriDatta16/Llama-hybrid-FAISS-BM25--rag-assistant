I don't like embedding information in the page for security reasons. At some point in time it is just going to be too easy to store something that shouldn't be there. You have two decent options that occur off the top of my head: Perform the ajax call during the page load (body onload=ajax call) (more secure) Store them in the cookie for the site (less secure) I typically use option #1.
