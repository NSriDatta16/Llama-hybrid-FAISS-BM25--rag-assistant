Tensorflow has implementations for a pool of machine learning algorithms, so it should be comfortable if your application needs to build something on top of word2vec. Gensim is mainly intended for topic modelling techniques, but pretty robust as its their main work. If you want to get a clear grasp of how the algorithm works, then implementing manually makes sense. Else, just go with one of the implementations. Google word2vec model is pretty good and covers most of the English words. Use it, if you do not have computational power or time to train a model. Manual training gives you the freedom of choosing domain-specific dataset, window size, cbow or sg, length of vector. If there are Out of vocabulary(OOV) words, it will throw an error.
