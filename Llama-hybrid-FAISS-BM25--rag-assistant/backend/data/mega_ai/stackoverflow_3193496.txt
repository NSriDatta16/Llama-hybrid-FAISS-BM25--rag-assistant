Database Design for 2D Matrix Algebra

Can anyone advise on a database design/DBMS for storing 2D Time Series Matrix data. To allow for quick BACK END algebraic calculations: e.g: Table A,B,C.. Col1: Date- Timestamp col2: Data- Array? (Matrix Data) SQL Psuedo Code INSERT INTO TABLE C SELECT Multiply A.Data A by B.Data Where Matrix A Start Date = Matrix B Start Date And Matrix A End Date = Matrix B End Date Essentially set the co-ordinates for the calculation.
