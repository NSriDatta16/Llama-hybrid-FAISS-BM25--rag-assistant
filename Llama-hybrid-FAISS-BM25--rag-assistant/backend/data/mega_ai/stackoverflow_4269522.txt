Using Clojure to unit test Java

One of the ways to get an organization to accept an alternate JVM language is to first use it for unit testing Java code -- "Boss, I am just going to write some unit tests in XXX. It'll never go out into production." Are there any tutorials for doing this in Clojure? I have just started using Scala to do this to test a Java REST server. Writing the tests in Scala allows me to embed expected XML output, mock the database calls with literal List objects, etc., not to mention that traits make it very easy to abstract out common code for the tests.
