The most helpful thing for me learning the Java SE APIs was to do " The Java Tutorials ". It covers pretty much the whole of Java SE, in a much more organised manner than the JavaDocs. After you read the bits you're interested in, the JavaDocs will make more sense on their own. Usually I read the JavaDocs for bits I'm interested in through the IDE. I use Netbeans, which automatically displays JavaDoc as part of its code-completion. That way, I can partially type a class or method name that I'm thinking of using, and then browse through the JavaDocs of the suggestions until I find what I want.
