Naive Bayes can certainly work with numeric attributes as well as discrete ones (modulo concerns about the appropriacy of the assumed distribution as mentioned in other answers). However, you should consider whether you really want to use Naive Bayes, as the non-discriminative methodology will break down more and more as you combine data from various sources, with potentially strong correlations. If you want to retain a probabilistic interpretation, consider logistic regression, which is an exact analog of Naive Bayes with a discriminative rather than generative objective (see this paper for example: Logistic Regression Vs Naive Bayes . You can find various implementations of it: I like Mallet , if you can use java (accessible as a command-line tool or an API). If a strict probabilistic interpretation isn't necessary, you can use an SVM. There are many implementations of this, but the de-facto standard (with a variant available in most languages) is LibSVM .
