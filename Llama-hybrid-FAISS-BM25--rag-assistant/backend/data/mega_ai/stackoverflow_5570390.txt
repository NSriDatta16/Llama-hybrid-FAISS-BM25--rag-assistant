Resize event for textarea?

The current versions of Firefox and Chrome include a drag handler to resize a box. I need to capture the resizing event, I thought it would be easy with jQuery's resize() event, but it doesn't work! I have also tried the normal onResize event, but the result is the same. You can try it on JSFiddle . Is there a way to capture it?
