Embedding jetty is handy in two cases I'm familiar with: JNI. It's a lot easier to make sure you've got the right things in the right class loader. Development. It's much easier to fire up an embedded jetty in eclipse than to dance around with the eclipse web tools and deal with deployments and debugger attaching.
