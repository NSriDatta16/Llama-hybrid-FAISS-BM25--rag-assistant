Why can't you see textboxes in Windows mobile standard?

I am looking at windows mobile standard(non touch screen). I dragged in some text boxes and when I run it you don't see them. You only see them if you go if the arrows and move them around. I find that kinda stupid how would I person know where a text box is? Also does anyone actually know how many ppl still use no touch screens?
