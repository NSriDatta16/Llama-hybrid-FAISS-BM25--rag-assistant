As with anything: if used with care, it can be an elegant tool. However, I think the drawbacks more than justify not to use it, and finally not to allow it anymore (C#). Among the problems are: it's easy to "forget" a break it's not always obvious for code maintainers that an omitted break was intentional Good use of a switch/case fall-through: switch (x) { case 1: case 2: case 3: Do something break; } Baaaaad use of a switch/case fall-through: switch (x) { case 1: Some code case 2: Some more code case 3: Even more code break; } This can be rewritten using if/else constructs with no loss at all in my opinion. My final word: stay away from fall-through case labels as in the bad example, unless you are maintaining legacy code where this style is used and well understood.
