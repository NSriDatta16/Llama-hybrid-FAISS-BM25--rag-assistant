Fit a probability density function to the data. I would use a "mixture of Gaussians" and fit it using Expectation Maximisation learning primed by the K-means algorithm. The K-means by itself can sometimes be sufficient without EM. The number of clusters itself would need to be primed with a model order selection algorithm. Then, each point can be scored with p(x) using the model. I.e. get the posterior probability that the point was generated by the model. Find the maximum p(x) to find the cluster centroids. This can be coded very quickly in a tool like Matlab using a machine learning toolbox. MoG/EM learning/K-Means clustering are discussed widely on the web/standard texts. My favourite text is "Pattern classification" by Duda/Hart.
