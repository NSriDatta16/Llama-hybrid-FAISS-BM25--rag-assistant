We can do a manual unpivot. I'm not exactly a tableau veteran, but I've faced similar issues and this is what I've been able to figure out. First, we need some data to work with in Tableau. I whipped this SQL Server query up: SELECT 'John' as [A], 'Paul' as [B], 'Jones' as [C], 'X' as [KEY], '12' as [VALUE] UNION ALL SELECT 'John' as [A], 'Paul' as [B], 'Jones' as [C], 'Y' as [KEY], '74' as [VALUE] UNION ALL SELECT 'John' as [A], 'Paul' as [B], 'Jones' as [C], 'Z' as [KEY], '25' as [VALUE] UNION ALL SELECT 'John' as [A], 'Paul' as [B], 'Smith' as [C], 'X' as [KEY], '99' as [VALUE] UNION ALL SELECT 'John' as [A], 'Paul' as [B], 'Smith' as [C], 'Y' as [KEY], '98' as [VALUE] UNION ALL SELECT 'John' as [A], 'Paul' as [B], 'Smith' as [C], 'Z' as [KEY], '97' as [VALUE] This will give us the following dataset, which I believe is similar to what you've described. A B C KEY VALUE John Paul Jones X 12 John Paul Jones Y 74 John Paul Jones Z 25 John Paul Smith X 99 John Paul Smith Y 98 John Paul Smith Z 97 Because we're working with known, discrete values for "KEY", we can easily do this manually. Start by dragging Dimensions A, B, and C to your Rows shelf. Create a calculated field named UNPIVOT_X, and type the formula below: ATTR(IF [KEY] = "X" THEN [VALUE] ELSE NULL END) Do this three times, substituting "X" for the other values. Drag these new measures to your rows shelf. The ATTR() aggregate will only work if there is a one-to-one relationship between KEY and VALUE. Otherwise, choose your preferred aggregate -- MAX(), MIN(), etc.
