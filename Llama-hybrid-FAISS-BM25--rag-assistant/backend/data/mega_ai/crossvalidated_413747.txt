Somers' $D_{xy}$ is a general measure of predictive discrimination which can handle binary, ordinal, and censored time-to-event outcome variables. In the binary $Y$ case it is just $2 (c - 0.5)$ where $c$ is the concordance probability, AKA area under the ROC curve. It is a very interpretable measure of predictive discrimination but like AUROC is not sensitive enough for choosing or comparing models. To your question, yes we compute $D_{xy}$ by playing $\hat{Y}$ against $Y$ and using the ordinary Somers' rank correlation formula you have listed, where ties on $Y$ are ignored (not penalized against). The only difference is that the estimate of $D$ will be biased when you have overfit the data patterns. For that reason we don't concentrate on the "apparent $D_{xy}$ " but rather on the overfitting-corrected version of it. For most cases this is most efficiently estimated using the bootstrap. Alternatively, 100 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation may be used. Details are in Regression Modeling Strategies book and course notes. Start with the chapter on binary logistic regression where I cover $D_{xy}$ . The R rms package validate.* functions compute apparent and validated (overfitting-corrected) $D_{xy}$ . The "not sensitive enough" comment relates to rank measures not giving a sufficient reward for extreme predictions that are "right". Sensitive measures are discussed here .
