To a certain extent, and more informally, your proposal is related to the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach in which you simulate from your model and check whether or not it is similar to your original data. In your case, you are comparing the two samples using the KS test, and the performance of this approach depends on the tunning parameters (significance level, sample size, and etcetera). The following reference discusses different approaches to estimate the parameters in hidden Markov models, which are related to ABC: Dean, Thomas A., et al. " Parameter estimation for hidden Markov models with intractable likelihoods ." Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 41.4 (2014): 970-987.
