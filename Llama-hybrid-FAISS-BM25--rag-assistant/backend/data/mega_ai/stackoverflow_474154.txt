If you're calling them your "domain model objects" then I will assume that you're refering to Fowler's Domain Model pattern. http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html Given that assumption, then the answer to your question is "all the business logic" since that is essentially the definition of the pattern. Unfortunately the term "domain model" seems to have been watered down recently to only mean an object model of your data with no behaviour. If you haven't already done so, I would encourage you to read PoEAA and decide where you think that domain logic belongs in your situation. If you decide on a domain model, then I would encourage you to read Evan's DDD book and learn about the differences between entities, value objects and services. Hope that helps!
