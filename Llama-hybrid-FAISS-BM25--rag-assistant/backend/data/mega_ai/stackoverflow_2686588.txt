In a java enhanced for loop, is it safe to assume the expression to be looped over will be evaluated only once?

In the following: for (String deviceNetwork : deviceOrganizer.getNetworkTypes(deviceManufacturer)) { // do something } Is it safe to assume that deviceOrganizer.getNetworkTypes(deviceManufacturer) will be called only once?
