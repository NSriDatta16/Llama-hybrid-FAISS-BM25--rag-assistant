Fuzzy Classification in NLP

Is it possible to use use fuzzy classification models such as fknn, fsvm in nlp? I mean I've seen people use K-nn, SVM over textual feature datas extracted from twitter/reddit api to detect emotions like depression,, suicide etc. Can we use fuzzy Knn, fuzzy svm for such emotion detection over textual features too? I haven't seen any research paper regarding this issue or anyone who used fKnn or any fuzzy classification model on textual features/social media data to detect emotions. Can anybody explain its answer in details to me?
