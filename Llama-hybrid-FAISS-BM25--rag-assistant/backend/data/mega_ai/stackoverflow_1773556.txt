If I understand this correctly, one thing you could do is use a ListChanged event like what was mentioned but it seems as if that didn't work. TableAdapters aren't really a table in the standard sense but a temporary storage area. Look in your Form1_Load function (or whatever you named your form, just using the default) and look for a tableadapter.fill method. this.comboboxTableAdapter.Fill(yourdataset name). This is what actually fills your dataset. Create a function that fills those datasets (if you have more than one) and then call that function on a ListChanged event, or even on the Activate event of the form. This way when you go into that child form and change the data, when you come back to main form the data will be there. I hope this helps, and good luck with your project.
