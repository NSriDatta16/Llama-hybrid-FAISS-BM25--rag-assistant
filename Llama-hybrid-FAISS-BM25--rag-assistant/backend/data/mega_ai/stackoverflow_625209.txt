What kind of application are you building? That is really important. If you are worried about your users then: if you control your users then there is no problem - you control their machines and you can make sure that .NET is already installed if you are talking about users that are external (to your organization) then I would recommend either ASP.NET or Silverlight application Decide for yourself. I would probably go with Silverlight since this is closest to Desktop applications (which I think you are referring to) and still the download is very small (I guess something like 2MB). Take a look at http://silverlight.net .
