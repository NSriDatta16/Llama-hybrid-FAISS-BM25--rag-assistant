Yeah, devise is great! If those are truly your requirements then I would suggest that too. If, on the other hand, you are looking for the most minimal authentication system possible, I would encourage you to consider the omniauth gem: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth It will allow you to totally offload authentication to a third party (facebook, google, twitter, etc). This is a great way to avoid writing any of that logic at all.
