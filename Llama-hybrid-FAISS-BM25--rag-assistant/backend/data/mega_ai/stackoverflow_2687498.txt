In my experience, once code works well on a couple architectures, it will port more easily to a third one. Input shouldn't be an issue. Structure alignment may be an issue if you do anything where alignment is an issue. Pay attention to anything that might be platform-dependent: relying on bitfields being aligned the same way, assuming variables are a particular size, etc. If your code is relatively abstract from the hardware, you will likely encounter few problems. If you are doing something with something like networking code, you will have to make sure you align with network byte order properly. I have ported device drivers from PPC to x86, and then to x86_64; in a few thousand lines, there were maybe a couple changes, primarily related to structure and integer ordering. The only way to know for sure is to try it, of course.
