How does dimensionality of network topology affect self organising maps?

I'm pretty new to self organising maps (SOMs). From reading around a bit, it seems like most implemetations use a 2D grid for the SOM network structure (or less often a 1D grid). This is nice, cause it's easy to visualise, but is there any particular reason why barely anyone uses 3D grids, etc? In particular, how does a higher dimensional network topology affect computational difficulty, results, and interpretation of results?
