Look at Mono.Cecil If the Serializer is able to do source ordering it won't be because of the PDB debug info. I assume reflection loses the ordering because it will (potentially) return a mix of direct and inherited members. There is no 'correct' ordering of that mix. Mono.Cecil will let you get directly at the structures in the managed assembly, as well as at the CIL code. Mono.cecil rocks big time and will not eat your puppies. It is the fastestest method to analyze your assemblies, and you don't even have to have them loaded. Mono.Cecil goes on to write a new assembly if you wish, but this propaganda is getting way off-topic. Go get Mono.Cecil
