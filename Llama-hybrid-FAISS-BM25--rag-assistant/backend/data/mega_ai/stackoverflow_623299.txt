Can the "x-requested-with" http header be spoofed?

My research shows that only the Host, Referer, and User-Agent headers can be spoofed. ( source ) Is this a correct assumption to make? The security of a site I am building may require that "x-requested-with" cannot be faked. This is far from ideal but may be the only avenue I have.
