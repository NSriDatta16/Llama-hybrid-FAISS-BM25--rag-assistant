Although CNN stands for convolutional neural networks, what they do is named cross-correlation in mathematics and not convolution. Take a look at here . Now, before moving on there is a technical comment I want to make about cross-correlation versus convolutions and just for the facts what you have to do to implement convolutional neural networks. If you reading different math textbook or signal processing textbook, there is one other possible inconsistency in the notation which is that, if you look at the typical math textbook, the way that the convolution is defined before doing the element Y's product and summing, there's actually one other step ...
