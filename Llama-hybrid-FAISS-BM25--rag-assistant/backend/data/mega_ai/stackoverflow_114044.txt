From Wikipedia : Frequent uses of modal windows include: drawing attention to vital pieces of information. This use has been criticised as ineffective. blocking the application flow until information required to continue is entered, as for example a password in a login process. collecting application configuration options in a centralized dialog. In such cases, typically the changes are applied upon closing the dialog, and access to the application is disabled while the edits are being made. warning that the effects of the current action are not reversible. This is a frequent interaction pattern for modal dialogs, but it is also criticised by usability experts as being ineffective for its intended use (protection against errors in destructive actions) and for which better alternatives exist.
