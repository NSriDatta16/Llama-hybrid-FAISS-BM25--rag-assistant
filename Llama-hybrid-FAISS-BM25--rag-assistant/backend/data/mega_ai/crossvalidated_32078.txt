Some time ago I was asked to analyze the results of an experiment on how the night storage position of a photovoltaic solar array affected the rate at which soil accumulated on the array. (These large concentrating photovoltaic arrays track the sun all day, but at night they are typically stored pointing straight up, as this is the minimum stress position for the tracker.) Soiling is a big issue, because it significantly reduces energy production, and cleaning is not cheap. The experiment had been run on a field of roughly 120 trackers; the west half had been stowed vertically and the east half horizontally (this aligned with the tracker connections to the two inverters, which would convey an advantage in energy production during the experiment if there is a significant effect and no particular pattern of soiling otherwise, so it's not, by itself, a bad idea.) Unfortunately, there is a strong prevailing wind pattern across the desert from the south-southwest, and a large building to the south of the western part of the field, "shading" (somewhat) much of the western part of the field from windblown particulates. Additionally, trackers "shade" each other from the wind to some extent. Consequently, the mechanisms by which soil accumulates (e.g., wind-blown or settling) vary in relative magnitude across the field. This in turn implies that arrays accumulate soil at different rates dependent upon location; this is not a small effect. The end result of the analysis was, essentially, that it wasn't implausible that storage position made a difference, but we could not, by any means, rule out the possibility that the effect was trivial, nor determine with any great confidence (based on the data) the sign of the effect. I then designed a followup experiment, assigning storage positions based on array location with the objective of being able to estimate the soiling "response surface" across the field for both storage positions, estimating "settling" vs "wind-blown" soiling rates, and of course the effect of storage angle on both of these. This experiment was quite successful and we were able to obtain a clear picture of the benefits of vertical stow after just a couple of months.
