The bag in bagging is about aggregation. If you have k CART models then for an input you get k candidate answers. How do you reduce that to a single value. The aggregation does that. It is often a measure of central tendency like the mean or mode. In order to aggregate, you would need multiple outputs. The gradient boosted machine (gbm) as in XGboost, is a series ensemble, not parallel one. This means that it lines them all up in a bucket brigade, and all the learners (but front and back) take the output of one, and give it to the next one). The final output is the same structure as a CART model - a single output. There is no bootstrapping to be done on a single element.
