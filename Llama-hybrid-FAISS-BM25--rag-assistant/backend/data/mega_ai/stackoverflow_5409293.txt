After many decades in the industry, I firmly believe that a good database design will save an application from many problems, especially when it undergoes enhancements. If it is known that a particular constraint will keep the database integrity even after a programming slip (I am sure that I am not the only one to do that), then it by all means should be applied to the database if possible. So I would encourage people to use foreign keys when ever possible. I would also consider using tests to provide data integrity. For we all know about murphy's law.
