Robert is right: digitAt:idx retrieves a byte, starting with an index of 1 (as usual) for the low-byte. digitLength gives you the number of digits. So to enumerate use: n digitLength downTo:1 do:[:idx | do something with (n digitAt:idx)] I am not sure, if there is a convention on what is returned for large negative numbers, because Smalltalks tend to use sign-value representation for LargeInts but 2's complement for SmallInts. So you might have to check for this. Caveat: to me, digitAt: is a bit of a bad name - I tend to associate it with "decimal-digit-at", which is misleading.
