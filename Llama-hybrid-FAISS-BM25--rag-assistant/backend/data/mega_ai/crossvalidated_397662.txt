How to find the unconditional standard error? Unconditional = Full How to create the vector of parameters if we use the par.avg function? I'm not sure what you're asking, the parameters are right there in the output. Do you want to know how to extract them in R? Are the calculated confidence intervals correct? Is the conclusion based on the CI correct? We discuss the theory of creating confidence intervals for a model average in Dormann, Carsten F., et al. "Model averaging in ecology: a review of Bayesian, information‚Äêtheoretic, and tactical approaches for predictive inference." Ecological Monographs 88.4 (2018): 485-504. This is for predictive averages, for parameter averaging there is the additional problem of collinearity. In short - these intervals are at best an approximation, but it could be a pretty bad one.
