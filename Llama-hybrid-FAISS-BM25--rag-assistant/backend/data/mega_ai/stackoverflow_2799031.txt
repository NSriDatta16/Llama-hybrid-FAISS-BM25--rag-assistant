a portal page is defined by a mechanism to lay out portlets to form a page. portlets are a standard way of generating page fragments. you can think of portlets as servlets that suitable for generating a page fragment instead of an entire page. exactly what mechanism the portal page uses for layout depends on the portal. unfortunately there is no standard for that. this probably doesn't answer your question very well, but it's almost impossible to answer without knowing that portal product / project that is used to generate the page. and that's at least one of the problems with portals.
