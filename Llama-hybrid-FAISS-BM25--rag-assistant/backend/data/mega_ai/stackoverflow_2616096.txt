This question reminds me of a story: Once upon a time there was a company. This company believes in automatic tests. This belief is so strong it leads to creating a group whose sole purpose is writing these automatic tests. All the most ardent believers are allowed to join this group. There was much rejoicing! Then one day, it's discovered that this automatic testing group, despite its mission, doesn't use automatic tests for its own work. Stones are cast, yada yada. I'm just saying... I would think that any testing framework would have pretty solid test coverage.
