What are the relation and differences between time series and linear regression?

What are the relation and differences between time series and linear regression? I have a strong grasp of linear regression, and a beginner's grasp on time series analysis; I know the Box-Jenkins method and understand the concepts. To solidify this understanding, I would like to compare and contrast the two methods to understand if time series analysis is an extension of linear regression . Maybe the best way to answer this question is to compare and contrast the model assumptions of each method. Does time series analysis share all assumptions of linear regression, with a few extra assumptions added in (related to autocorrelation, stationarity, etc.)? Note: This question has been asked here but the answers go off-topic and discuss the flaws of a Cornell professor's understanding of time series analysis. I do not have enough reputation to comment on that thread.
