Macroeconomics is a general branch of economics which studies the behavior of larger economic entities like countries. Macroeconomists often analyze time series of country specific data (e.g. inflation, output, unemployment) to understand economic relationships. The application of statistics, specifically econometrics, to macroeconomic questions is called macroeconometrics.
