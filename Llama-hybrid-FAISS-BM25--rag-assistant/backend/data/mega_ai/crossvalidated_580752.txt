I'll describe what could be done with the simple example you gave, but it isn't a sure thing that they generalize. What is known (uniform case): $$\begin{aligned} a | b=60 &\sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0, 100) \\ b | a=10 &\sim \mathrm{Uniform}(50, 150) \\ c | a=0 &\sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0, 300) \\ a + b &\in [60, 160] \\ a &\in [0, c] \end{aligned}$$ This seems like it could be sampled from by calculating the marginal cdfs and then using inverse transform sampling . Sample in the order such that you get the values you need to know exact cdfs of the others. Complement with rejection sampling as you've done previously when necessary. If your expressions are to complicated, then Metropolis-Hastings or some other Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique would probably be a better bet. The python packages emcee and PyMC3 are okay in my experience.
