I think recall and FPR are calculated in scikit-learn using a threshold of 0.5. On the other hand ROC AUC is transparent to model threshold. I encourage you to explore thresholder in scikit-lego to inspect in this direction. An example of AUC = 1 but bad FPR would be if you use 0.5 as a threshold, you model splits your samples perfectly but the positive ones have scores between 0.2 and 0.4 and your negative ones have scores between 0 and 0.2.
