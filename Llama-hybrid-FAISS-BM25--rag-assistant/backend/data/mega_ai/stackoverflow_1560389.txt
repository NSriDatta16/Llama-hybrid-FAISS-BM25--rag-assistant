I think it's a duplicate (here) . Quoting the accepted answer: You need to enable warning 4365 to catch the assignment. That might be tricky - you need to enable ALL warnings - use /Wall which enables lots of warnings, so you may have some trouble seeing the warning occur, but it does. (quamrana) You could also use #pragma warning(default: 4365) to enable. (ChrisN)
