Correct way to multiply Bayesian interacting terms with Cred Intervals

So I've built a (long computational time) jags mixed model that includes an interaction term in the fixed effects. After the fact I want to multiply two of the posterior means for the regression coefficients - with credible intervals. Example: library(lme4) library(runjags) model So I want to work out the value of amd*gen for level 2 of amd afterwards. # For the Mean or Median I can multiply the terms > results[row.names(results) == "amd_effect[2]", "Mean"] * results[row.names(results) == "gen_coefficient_amd_level[2]", "Mean"] [1] 0.0001745244 But how do I put credible intervals around this since multiplying the credible intervals directly is wrong? I know in a frequentist framework I can do this using the standard errors but I was not sure if that is true also in Bayesian stats?
