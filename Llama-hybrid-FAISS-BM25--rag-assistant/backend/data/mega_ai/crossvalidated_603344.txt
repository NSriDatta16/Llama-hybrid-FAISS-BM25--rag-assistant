The difference between GLMM and GEE is indeed primarily in the interpretation of what you are estimating. I.e. effects of treatments on individual patients vs. the average effect for the trial population. There's no reason why one would interpret GLMM results as if patients "changed their covariates", that just seems to be confused mis-information. What comes in with GLMM vs. GEE is also that with repeated assessments you can see whether even beyond explanatory covariates some patients tend to consistently respond badly or well, which one can estimate as a latent patient response. GLMM calculates the patient specific effect taking that into account (in the way discussed below), while GEE averages that out for the population (in the way discussed below). We don't even need to look at repeated assessments to see the difference between patient specific and population average effects, it's also easier to discuss it with an observed covariates (rather than the latent one). To illustrate this with a hypothetical example of survival 1 year after starting on a new and an old drug for some type of cancer (and you can easily construct even more extreme scenarios, these occur in practice a lot). Sex % of the population Survival at 1 year on new drug Survival at 1 year on old drug Conditional odds ratio Marginal (unconditional) odds ratio Rate ratio Female 50% 90% 75% 3 3.00 1.2 Male 50% 50% 25% 3 3.00 2.0 Overall 100% 70% 50% 3 2.33 1.4 We assume the percentages given above are known exactly (e.g. based on an extremely large RCT, there was no dropouts). In both male and female patients the odds of survival at 1 year is 3 times higher with the new drug compared with the old drug, but female patients are more likely to survive to 1 year. As a result, the overall conditional odds ratio is also 3. This is the effect any specific patient could expect, but would not be what happens on a population average level when you e.g. However, the marginal (population average) odds ratio is 2.33, which we obtain by calculating $(0.7 / 0.3) / (0.5 / 0.5)$ . Thus, the treatment effect is attenuated towards no effect (odds ratio of $1$ ), if you look at the marginal effect. This - for logistic regression type analyses - is always that way. While this is indeed the average odds ratio for the population given the particular distribution of male and female patients, this effect does not apply to either male or female patients (or any other population where you have a different male/female distribution - perhaps male/female is not the best example, but e.g. split into disease severities could easily be different between trials and clinical practice). I.e. this effect is arguably irrelevant to any one patient and for any physician that makes a treatment decisions for an individual patient. The marginal effect also tends to not translate well to different studies or clinical practice. On the other hand, some methods have been discovered to obtain marginal (covariate-adjusted) estimates in ways that have nice robustness properties, which is one of the main arguments for doing this anyway (and why the recent FDA guidance on covariate adjustment talks a lot about population average effects). This issue can avoided by effect measures such as the risk ratio that are collapsible. For example, if in our example, the risk ratio if 2 for the male patients (calculated as $0.5/0.25$ ). If the risk ratio also were 2 for the female patients, the population average risk ratio would also be 2. However, the risk ratio cannot be constant across all levels of control group percentages. For example, in our example for the control group percentage of 75%, we would need an impossible 150% of patients to survive on the new drug to achieve a risk ratio of 2 in the female patients. For these reasons, the choice of population-level summary remain controversial. However, note that the choice between a conditional and a marginal effect is separate from the choice of whether analyses should be covariate adjusted, in fact a covariate adjusted analysis is typically more efficient even for estimating a marginal effect. One can for example obtain a marginal effect after a covariate adjusted analysis by averaging the model predicted treatment differences for each patient in a trial.
