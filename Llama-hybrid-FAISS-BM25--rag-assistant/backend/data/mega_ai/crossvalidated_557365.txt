Why doesn't a dilated convolution lose information?

In the example below ( source ), we see the difference between stride and dilation in CNNs. The explanation as quoted: " Using a dilated convolution increases the size of the receptive field relative to the kernel size. In my sketch, a 2x2 dilated convolution has the same receptive field as a 3x3 un-dilated convolution. " It is said that dilation covers more information, but isn't it also losing information since you're skipping over a lot of pixels at the same time (i.e the white crosses in the image)? How are dilated convolutions so useful with this being said?
