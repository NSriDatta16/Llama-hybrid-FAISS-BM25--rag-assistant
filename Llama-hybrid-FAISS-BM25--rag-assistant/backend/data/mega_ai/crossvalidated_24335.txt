Neural network and logistic regression not yielding output for certain inputs

I am working on a project on gesture recognition(in c# language). In some part I had to use neural networks using the sigmoid activation function. I am using the aforge.net(http://www.aforgenet.com/) library for the same. The system developed gets trained when I use a certain part of the training data. However when I use a different portion of the training set I give ans as NaN(not a number). Initially I thought it would be due to some variable overflow. However the system supports large number of inputs from one section of the training data and doesn't support as much as one inputs from the other section. Now this makes me reach a conclusion that something is wrong with that input. However I am not able to what may be probably wrong. I have tried fitting a logistic regression function which yielded similar results. Are there any constraints while modelling the input. Any help would be appreciated.
