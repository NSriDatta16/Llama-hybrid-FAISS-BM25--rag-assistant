Unit testing sampling methods

I'm writing a bit of code that makes pretty heavy use of sampling (eg, MCMC, Particle Filters, etc), and I would really like to test it to make sure that it's doing what I think it is before claiming any results. Is there a typical way unit test these methods to ensure correctness?
