If the question is "why use simulation when the function $p(\theta|y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ is available in closed form?" the issue has been considered repeatedly on this forum . And elsewhere . The manipulation of the posterior for Bayesian inference is a mathematical evidence, in the sense that any related quantity like $$\theta(p_\theta)=\int_\Theta h(\theta) p(\theta|y_1,\ldots,y_n)\text{d}\theta$$ is uniquely and exactly defined; however it does not mean the Bayesian procedures are available in practice. Computing integrals related to this density $p(\cdot|y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ is usually analytically infeasible. Which explains for the recourse to Monte Carlo techniques. A related school of questions deals with the missing constant in $p(\theta|y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ , since the "missing" constant is not "missing" in a mathematical sense, given that it is uniquely defined by the constraint that the integral of the posterior density function integrates to one (1).
