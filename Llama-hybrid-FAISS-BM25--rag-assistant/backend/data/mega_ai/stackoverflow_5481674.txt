MySQL insert issue - works on local machine but not server, regardless of permissions

A problem has come up, and it seems too general to be able to search on here or Google. The issue is that I have a PHP app running just fine on my own machine. I've exported the database to the server, as well as uploaded all files. The database usernames are the same on both the server and my machine, and so are the passwords. I've tried providing the user with full permissions, but this changes nothing. The SQL query is: INSERT INTO users (username, password, email, date, access_level) VALUES('test', 'a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c087333d391e987982fbbd333', 'magista@hotmail.com', '20110329235016', 1) As I said, the query should be fine, given that it works on my own machine. I was thinking there might be some sort of file permissions issue, but I have no idea. Does anybody have any tips? Anything to get me on the right track for solving this problem would be helpful. Thanks, Paragon
