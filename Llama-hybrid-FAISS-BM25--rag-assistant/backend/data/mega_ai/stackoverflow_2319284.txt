SQL recursive query on self referencing table (Oracle)

Lets assume I have this sample data: | Name | ID | PARENT_ID | ----------------------------- | a1 | 1 | null | | b2 | 2 | null | | c3 | 3 | null | | a1.d4 | 4 | 1 | | a1.e5 | 5 | 1 | | a1.d4.f6 | 6 | 4 | | a1.d4.g7 | 7 | 4 | | a1.e5.h8 | 8 | 5 | | a2.i9 | 9 | 2 | | a2.i9.j10| 10 | 9 | I would like to select all records start from accountId = 1, so the expected result would be: | Name | ID | PARENT_NAME | PARENT_ID | ------------------------------------------- | a1 | 1 | null | null | | a1.d4 | 4 | a1 | 1 | | a1.e5 | 5 | a1 | 1 | | a1.d4.f6 | 6 | a1.d4 | 4 | | a1.d4.g7 | 7 | a1.d4 | 4 | | a1.e5.h8 | 8 | a1.e5 | 5 | I am currently able to make the recursive select, but then I can't access the data from the parent reference, hence I can't return parent_name. The code I'm using is (adapted to the simplistic example): SELECT id, parent_id, name FROM tbl START WITH id = 1 CONNECT BY PRIOR id = parent_id What SQL should I be using to the mentioned above retrieval? Additional key words for future seekers: SQL to select hierarchical data represented by parent keys in same table
