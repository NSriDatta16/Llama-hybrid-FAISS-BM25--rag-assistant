How to interpret a logistic regression model with all negative coefficient?

I have 4 predictors, and 1 binary response. I fitted a logistic regression model. A strange thing is that all the coefficient of the model are negative. Is that possible? Probably I did something wrong. My interpretation is that the odds ratio of either variable is less than 1. That is, neither variable actually do any good to the response. Even the intercept is negative. Please share your intelligence.
