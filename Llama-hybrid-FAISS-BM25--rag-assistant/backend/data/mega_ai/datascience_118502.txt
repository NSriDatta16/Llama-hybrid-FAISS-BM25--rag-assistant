Your target is ordinal and as it is, your loss function does not use that. I would give a try to architectures that output ordinal data, that might increase your performance a lot. These posts might help: How to set up neural network to output ordinal data? Classification with ordered classes? You could, for example, try regression models (by taking the mean values of each category). In addition to this, as said in comments, data augmentation will help and everything you can do in preprocessing that can focus on your problem (for example croping the image to keep only relevant data). Note If you use data augmentation on dataset, be careful to use augmented images in the same training/testing dataset to prevent leakage.
