"An error" isn't very descriptive. When you're posting a question and you're getting an error, please state what that error is. In this case the problem is that you're trying to call an instance method ( readArray ) from a static context, without specifying an instance. The method doesn't appear to require any instance data, so you should be able to just make the method static and all will be well. I'd encourage you to read up on .NET naming conventions, btw. You might also want to think about using a List instead of an array. When you feel more confident, you could also make this code simpler using LINQ - but I'd wait until you're more familiar with C# first.
