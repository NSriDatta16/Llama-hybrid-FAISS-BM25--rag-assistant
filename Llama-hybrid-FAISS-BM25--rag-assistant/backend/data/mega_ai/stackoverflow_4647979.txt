The difference between assembly and namespace is, as you've pointed out, that the former organizes code physically , and the latter logically . Assemblies are your DLL and EXE files. Namespaces are just the dot notation that'll help you find your classes as you write code. A Java package is very similar to a .NET namespace. In Java, each public non-nested class needs to have its own *.java-file, and the packages must have their corresponding directories, so that's why you'll read references to directories when reading up on java packages, but not in .NET, as a single file can contain several .NET namespaces, and a single namespace can be scattered across several directories.
