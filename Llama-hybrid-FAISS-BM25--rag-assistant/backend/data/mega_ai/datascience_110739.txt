Typically this is called online machine learning or incremental learning . check which is closest to your thoughts. It is not applicable to all algorithms and all tools to not implement it. You might find adjusting your model to an online/incremental structure makes it weaker on your metrics. Also evaluate retraining your model with newer information. Maybe you can retrain it every day/week/month and get better results.
