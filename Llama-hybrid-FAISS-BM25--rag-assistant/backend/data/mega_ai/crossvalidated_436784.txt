Statistical modeling multidimensional discrete system

I have a system which its state is described by a vector $v=(a, b, c)$ , where $a$ , $b$ and $c$ can take any value between $0$ and $100$ and where $a+b+c . I have observations of the state of the system for about 10 years (one per year, so 10 observations). How can I model the states of the system? Can I accurately model the state of the system using Markov chain? Or shall I use another technique? The first approach that I used was to cluster the possible states of the system (for example a cluster contains all the observations where: $a & $b & $c ). Then I fitted a transition matrix and made the predictions (considering a homogeneous transition matrix) This works fine but the predictions are of course not accurate because of the clustering.
