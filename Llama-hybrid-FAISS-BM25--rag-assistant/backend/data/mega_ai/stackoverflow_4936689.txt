To add onto what Simon said, If there is no SQL Server Agent running there will be no clearing of session values unless a stored procedure inside of the database is actually executed. I don't think SQL Server express has the Agent so an automated job is not possible. If you have control of the server then I would suggest setting up a scheduled task through windows that executes the stored procedure or job that clears your expired sessions. I don't know the exact name of the stored procedure right now but it should be named fairly obvious to it's purpose. So your options are to upgrade to a version of SQL server that has the SQL Server Agent available or set something up to manually execute the stored procedure to clear expired sessions. Alliteratively you can use InProc sessions, which are cleared automatically. But I assumed since InProc is the default there is a reason why you switched to SQL Server.
