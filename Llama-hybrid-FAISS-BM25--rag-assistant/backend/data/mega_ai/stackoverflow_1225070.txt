Sounds like you are ignoring that IDropTarget has a DragOver() method that you need to use in addition to DragEnter(). If DragEnter() does not begin with coordinates that you allow, then you have to return S_OK with the pdwEffect parameter set to DROPEFFECT_NONE , and then let DragOver() continue doing its own coordinate checking afterwards. In addition, since you only want to drag onto specific control, you should be calling RegisterDragDrop() for each of those individual controls (assuming they are TWinControl descendants), not for the TForm itself.
