How does Linq Determine if a propety has a storage field?

I was looking at a dbml file in xml editor and noticed that some of the properties had a storage field and some did not. I also noticed that some had name, which I assuming is the name of the field in sql. If the property in the dbml file has a different name from the one in sql, it will add the member attribute. I don't understand why some fields have a storage attribute and some do not?
