How to execute selected text as Vim commands

When I am writing documents, I find myself settling on an organization convention appropriate to that document, and I would like Vim to syntax highlight that convention. But making a ftplugin is too "global", I want the syntax coloring to come with the document, so if I send it somewhere without that plugin they can still get the coloring. I found that you can't do it through the modeline because that only accepts options. Right now I am trying to find out if there is a way to select some text in visual mode (or whatever) and have it executed as a series of Vim commands. For example, at the bottom of one document I have: vim highlighting: syn match Comment "^>.*$" How can I select that text and say "boom, execute it" rather than having to retype it?
