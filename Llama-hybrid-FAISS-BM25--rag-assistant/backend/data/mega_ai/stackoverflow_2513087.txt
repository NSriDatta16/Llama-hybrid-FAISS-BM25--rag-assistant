How to Profile a C-Program in a Loop of Shell Script, Using Shark on Mac?

I have a question about Shark-profiling on mac. Say if I have a C-program, compiled with: gcc -o mycprog mycprog.c -g -pg and also I have a shell script something like: for file in ($SomeDirectory) do mycprog $file done I need to profile the average performance for all files in $SomeDirectory. Where should I put the shark -i command? Thanks.
