Logistic vs. OLS

So the title is a bit misleading. I have a categorical dependent variable (no, maybe, yes) in multiple observations over a span of several years that I have turned into "percentage that said 'yes'" So technically it is now "yes" vs. "no and maybe" and bounded by 0 (0%) and 1 (100%). I am using OLS because I am interested in the one unit increase association between my independent (another percent) variable and my dependent variable. None of the coefficients of my independent variable would result in my dependent variable crossing 0 (0%) and 1 (100%). Additionally, besides the loss of interpret-ability, I don't want to use logistic regression because the "prevalence" of my independent variable is very high (>65% in most cases), so the resulting OR from a logistic regression would be inflated. What do you all say? How would you explain the use of OLS in this case if someone was very adamant that I have a dichotomous outcome variable?
