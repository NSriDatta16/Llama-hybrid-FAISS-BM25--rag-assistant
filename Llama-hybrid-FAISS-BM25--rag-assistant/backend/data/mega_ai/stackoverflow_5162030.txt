Note in the EXPLAIN output that the join type for the logs table is "ALL" and the key is NULL, which means a full table scan is scheduled. The "Range checked for each record" message means that MySQL uses the range access method on logs after examining column values from somewhere else in the result. I take this to mean that once dates has been created, MySQL can perform a ranged join on logs using the second and third indices (likely those on Timestamp and EndTime ) rather than performing a full table scan. If you only have indices on Timestamp and EndTime separately, try adding an index on both, which might result in a more efficient join type (e.g. index_merge rather than range ): CREATE INDEX `start_end` ON `logs` (`Timestamp`, `EndTime`); I believe (though could easily be wrong) that other items in the query plan either aren't really a concern or can't be eliminated. The filesort, as an example of the latter, is likely due to the GROUP BY . In other words, this is likely the extent of what you can do with this particular query, though radically different queries or approaches that address table storage format are still possibly more efficient.
