Just making an illustration for Muggen's attention call (therefore community wiki): You want to redefine write and call write from inside your redefinition. Something like void write(int a) { /* code code code */ write(42); /* ??? what `write`? ??? recursive `write`? ??? the other `write`? */ /* code code code */ } Better think better about it :)
