Binary logistic regression: p-value of predictor containing all cases of response=1

I'm analyzing a dataset with a set of binary predictors and a binary response variable using logistic regression. The response variable equals 1 only if some variable $x=1$ , so there is a clear link between these variables. However, both in models with single or multiple predictors, the coefficient of that variable is not significant (has high standard error). Minimal reproducible example in R: data Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -20.57 1773.04 -0.012 0.991 x 21.95 1773.04 0.012 0.990 Is logistic regression inappropriate for such data? Models with this predictor explain the most variance, but reporting results with the coefficient of the most important predictor that is non-significant seems incorrect. Is there a proper way to indicate a link between such variables?
