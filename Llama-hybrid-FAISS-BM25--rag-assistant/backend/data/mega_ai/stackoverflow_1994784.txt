I agree with nobugz... it sounds like quite a challenging project to undertake, and you are not going to get the functionality and flexibility that you will get from an app like Visio without some serious manpower and effort. So I would try and go the interop route. BUT if that isn't an option, then you are definitely going to want something that utilizes WPF, as it really simplifies the whole presentation aspect. There is a project that I used from "Code Project" as a base startup called Draw Tools which was a great start as it shows the basics, having a canvas, and dragging objects and shapes onto the canvas - all in C#, and really gave us a jump start. Good Luck!
