I would say that it's not worth it. Either the page contains an email address which can be read by a user-agent with permission or it doesn't. Obfuscating it detracts from the semantic value of the web, restricts to specific types of user agents such as those which can execute JavaScript or those which have a UI and a user sitting at that UI. If you're going to display an email address then you should just display it mailto: and all, go one further and make it part of an hCard , link back to the user's XFN profile page and encourage user agents of the future to use this rich semantic data. Otherwise simply don't display an email address.
