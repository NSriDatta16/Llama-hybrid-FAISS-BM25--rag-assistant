The first thing to check is what M-e is bound to. In tex-mode, for me, it is bound to forward-sentence . You find this out by C-h k M-e . It sounds as though it's bound to forward-paragraph , in which case I'd check your .emacs file to see if you've got any overrides in tex-mode hooks, or other things. You can also try running without your .emacs: emacs -q , and seeing what M-e is bound to (to determine if it truly is your .emacs). You can also start without the site lisp file emacs -q --no-site-file - in case your administrators have added anything.
