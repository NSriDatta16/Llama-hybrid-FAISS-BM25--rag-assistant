Is it necessary to carry out say 100 more samples? No! We happen to know a lot about the distribution of sample means, and we're able to estimate the standard error from just one sample. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (distribution of $\bar{X}$ ), which is $N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$ . Since we don't know $\mu$ or $\sigma^2$ , we estimate them and use a sampling distribution of $N(\bar{x},\sigma^2/n)$ . This means that we can calculate the middle 95% of the sampling distribution by going $2 \sqrt{\sigma^2/n}$ above and below $\bar{x}$ , since a normal distribution has 95% of its density within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, the confidence interval for $\bar{x}$ is $\bigg[ \bar{x} - 2 \sqrt{\sigma^2/n}, \bar{x} + 2 \sqrt{\sigma^2/n}\bigg]$ . Except that this isn't quite true. We don't know the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. All we did is estimate it. Consequently, instead of going 2 standard deviations in either direction, we go an amount given by something called the t-distribution. We go to the $0.025$ and $0.975$ quantiles of the t-distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to $n-1$ . Therefore, the full answer is that the confidence interval is: $$ \bigg[ \bar{x} + t_{0.025} \sqrt{\sigma^2/n}, \bar{x} + t_{0.975} \sqrt{\sigma^2/n} \bigg]$$ (The $t_{0.025}$ value will be negative, so we add it rather than subtract it.)
