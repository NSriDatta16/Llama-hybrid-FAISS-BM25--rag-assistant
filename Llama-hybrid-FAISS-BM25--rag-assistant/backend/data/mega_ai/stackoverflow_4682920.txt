This is only technically possible. Memory pages can be locked in RAM with the VirtualLock() API function. Problem is, that requires supplying the address of the page(s) you want locked. You can't get this address in any documented way from the garbage collector. Nor does it make any promise that the same address for, say, the gen #0 heap will be repeatable. For one, the size of that heap is dynamic, usually ranging somewhere between 2 and 8 megabytes, depending on the program's allocation pattern. Just randomly locking a large range with the hope that you'll catch most of them doesn't work either. A process gets a quota of lockable pages. It isn't very large, above all because it is so destabilizing to the operation of the machine. Dragons live here.
