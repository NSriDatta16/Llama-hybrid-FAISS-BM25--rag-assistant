There are lots of correct ways to do this. The average (which you say is wrong) is one correct way. It may not answer the exact question that you have, but it's still a useful result. (By the way, it should be 16*1 if he spent one minute in each place; I edited that.) If you want to totally discount outliers, you could look at the median by minute. Or you could look at the trimmed or Winsorized mean.
