R - high dimension data using k means clustering

The dataset is 1000(observations) x 700(variables), After using pca to do dimension reduction, PC150 explained 85% Variance, so I use this (1000 x 150) data to do k means clustering. This code was used to choose K: wss I choose k = 80. The between_ss / total_ss is about 53% which is not good. Which k should I choose? What should I do to improve the clustering? Are there any other methods to do a good clustering on this high-dimension data? I tried dbscan and hierarchical clustering(res = hclust(dist(x), method="complete" and "average"), the results seems no good either.
