Try using a just a simple log file. As data comes in, store in memory and write (append) to a file. write() followed by fsync() will guarantee (on most systems, read your system and filesystem docs carefully) that the data is written to persistent storage (disc). These are the same mechanisms any database engine would use to get data in persistent storage. On restart, reload the log. Occasionally, trim the front of the log file so data usage doesn't grow infinitely. Or, model the log file as a circular buffer the same size as what you can hold in memory.
