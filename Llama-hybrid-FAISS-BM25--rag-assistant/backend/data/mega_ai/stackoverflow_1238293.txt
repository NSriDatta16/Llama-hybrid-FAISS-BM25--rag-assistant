Global Event Registry with JQuery

I am developing a heavily AJAX-based web app in JQuery that includes many GUI components. There are some application states that affect all GUI components. E.g. while an AJAX request is executed, I want my toolbar buttons to "freeze" and not trigger any click events until the request finished. The same applies to my slider control and some draggable GUI components. To ease the transition between the app states, I want to develop a global event registry that offers the following features: each gui component can register, remove, trigger its events within the registry the ability to suspend events (i.e. unbind them while my app state is in a certain state and then automatically rebind them) match app states to gui behaviours (e.g. in drawing mode, only the "Exit drawing mode" button is active) Does anyone know about jQuery plugins that could assist me?
