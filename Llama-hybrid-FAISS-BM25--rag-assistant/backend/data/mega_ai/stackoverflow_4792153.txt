static int a; int b; a has internal linkage. b has extern linkage. C99 6.2.2 6.2.2 Linkages of identiﬁers 1) An identiﬁer declared in different scopes or in the same scope more than once can be made to refer to the same object or function by a process called linkage. There are three kinds of linkage: external, internal, and none. 2) In the set of translation units and libraries that constitutes an entire program, each declaration of a particular identiﬁer with external linkage denotes the same object or function. Within one translation unit, each declaration of an identiﬁer with internal linkage denotes the same object or function. Each declaration of an identiﬁer with no linkage denotes a unique entity. 3) If the declaration of a ﬁle scope identiﬁer for an object or a function contains the storage- class speciﬁer static, the identiﬁer has internal linkage .
