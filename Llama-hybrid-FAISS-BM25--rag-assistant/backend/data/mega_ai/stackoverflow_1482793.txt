Complex Maven2 with Flex4 Setup

I have been struggling to get Maven2 to cooperate with me, and was wondering if anyone out there had any ideas on how to get this working.... I am working on a Flash project, and we are considering switching from our hybrid Flex4/FlashCS4 to a pure Flex4 solution. We would like to use the Maven2 build system, so that our developers do not have to manually download, install, and configure Flex4 on their machines. I have managed to create a single-module project using Maven2 with Flex4 (I am using the Sonatype FlexMojos Plugin and their Maven2 repository located at http://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/flexgroup/ ). I really start running into trouble when it comes to making this multimodule.... Our project is organized as follows: |- bin | |- moduleX.swf | |- moduleY.swf | |- ... |- lib | |- moduleA.swc | |- moduleB.swc | |- ... |- src | |- moduleA | |- moduleB | |- ... |- test | |- moduleA | |- moduleB | |- ... |- share | |- asset1 | |- asset2 | |- ... |- ... Basically, each of our modules has its sources located under "src/ /" and its test sources located under "test/ /", with generated SWF files being placed in "bin" and generated SWC files being placed in "lib". Our assets (things that we would like to be able to reference using the "@Embed" or "[Embed]" tags) live under "share". I have looked at the references on project inheritance and aggregation, but can't seem to find anything that would allow us to keep our existing project directory structure. We would like this migration to be as quick, painless, and non-disruptive as possible. I would really appreciate it if anyone can figure out how to create a "pom.xml" file that allows us to keep our current infrastructure.
