Feedforward Vs. Backpropagation Neural Network

I was taking the "Machine Learning-Coursera (Standford) by Andrew Ng" course. In Week 4 and Week 5 we have given programming assignments, Where we have to do digit classification. In Week 4 programming assignment we have used Feed forward Neural Network for classifying digits and we get an accuracy of around 97.5%. Then in Week 5 programming assignment we have used Neural Network with Backpropagation which gives us the accuracy of around 95%. For this particular application (Character Classification) will Feedforward Neural Network always dominate Neural Network with Backpropagation ?
