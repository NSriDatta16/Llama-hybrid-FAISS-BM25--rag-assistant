TeamCity output artifacts not published to IIS7 folder

I am trying to set up TeamCity to build and deploy an ASP.NET MVC application. I have the setup running successfully on other servers using TeamCity 4.5, but the new server is running TeamCity 6, and I am having trouble getting it to work as expected. TeamCity manages to get the files from source control, and the project (Visual Studio Solution 2008 set to "Build") builds and outputs the necessary files as expected. The problem seems to be with my artifact paths, as the output files are not copied to the website folder. My solution consists of dozen projects, of which the "Web" project is the interesting one in this case. The build checkout directory is C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\7da320cebf0ee541, and the "Web"-project is found in C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\7da320cebf0ee541\Web I have set up my build configuration with the following artifact paths (relative from checkout directory to the folder containing the website): Web/bin=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/bin Web/Content=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/Content Web/Views=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/Views Web/Media=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/Media Web/*.aspx=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging Web/*.asax=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging (I've tried with more ../ just in case, but it didn't make a difference). This is the output I get from the log [19:35:29]: Publishing artifacts (1s) [19:35:29]: [Publishing artifacts] Paths to publish: [Web/bin=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/bin, Web/Content=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/Content, Web/obj=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/obj, Web/Views=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/Views, Web/Media=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging/Media, Web/ .aspx=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging, Web/ .asax=>../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/staging, teamcity-info.xml] [19:35:30]: [Publishing artifacts] Sending files [19:35:32]: Build finished Logs from some of the other servers running TeamCity 4.5 uses a different format, with a line for each of the artifacts being published, I'm not sure if this is relevant or only due to a different logging format. Everything seems to be working, but no files are put in my website folder after a build, am I missing something here? Any help will be much appreciated :)
