CABasicAnimation Problem

So, I have read in the docs, that use of blocks like beginAnimation commitAnimation is discouraged from os4.0. So I have tried to get my code to work by using CABasicAnimation. I want to achieve, that an image's frame is resized from its thumbnail size, somewhere within my view, to a full width position e.g. (0, 120, 320, 240) - on my iPhone. What I have so far: [CATransaction begin]; [CATransaction setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:1.0] forKey:kCATransactionAnimationDuration]; CABasicAnimation *scalingAnimation; scalingAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"transform"]; scalingAnimation.duration=1.0/2; scalingAnimation.autoreverses=YES; scalingAnimation.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut]; scalingAnimation.fromValue=[NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:CATransform3DMakeScale(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)]; scalingAnimation.toValue=[NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:CATransform3DMakeScale(4, 4, 1)]; [b.layer addAnimation:scalingAnimation forKey:@"scaling"]; [CATransaction commit]; My nextstep would be to first try to move the image to a centered position then scale it to the correct size. However, I doubt I'm doin it the right way. Can anyone comment on my code/approach.... is there a better way?
