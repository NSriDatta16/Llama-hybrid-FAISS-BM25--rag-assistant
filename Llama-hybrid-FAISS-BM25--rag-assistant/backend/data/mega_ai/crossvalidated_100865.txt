How to handle data with double the number of cases than controls?

I have genetic SNP data with 50 controls and 120 cases. I am said that comparing few controls with more number of cases will cause spurious associations. The analysis that I want to do is just a logistic regression, where the outcome is disease (case/control) and the predictors are the genotypes (AA,AB,BB). I had a thought of comparing the 50 controls with randomly chosen 50 cases and then replicating the finding by comparing with remaining cases. Can anyone comment on this scenario.
