Sorry, I'm new to this but I wanted to comment on the answer above. I don't understand what you gain by BASE64 encoding the url? It won't make the url shorted, the base64 encoded string will usually be about 33% longer. Here is an example: C:\images\myimage.png Base64 encoded: QzpcaW1hZ2VzXG15aW1hZ2UucG5n If you wanted to keep the url short, and you wanted to make sure the filename is correct per the solution above, you should just use the filename itself. The base64 encoded version isn't offering you any benefit. Although, I'm not sure this helps you because its not related to you database solution at all. unless you were to store "images/myimage.png" in a field in your database and have your url look as follows: foo.com/images/image.jpg?h=5&w=10 With that format, the name of the resource being requested, is separated from the representation of the image at a height of 5 and width of 10.
