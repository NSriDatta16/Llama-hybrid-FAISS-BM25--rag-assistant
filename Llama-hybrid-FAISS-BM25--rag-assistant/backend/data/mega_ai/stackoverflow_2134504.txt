What is the best algorithm to calculate the most scored item?

I have an music items that are scored by users between 1 to 5, and I need a formula to get the 5 most scored items. But obviously an item that get 3.5 average score from 1000 different users will be more scored then an item thet get 4.9 average score from only 5 users... in other words I think that if an item get attention from people to score it, this indicates that the item is interesting. so in the calculation the votesCount parameter need to have a power. (how much power? I don't sure, and I asking it you to get ideas). I think that we need the following parameters in the function: votesAverage, votesCount.
