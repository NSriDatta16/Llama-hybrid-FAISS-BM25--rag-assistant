LINQ with 3 Tier

Currently I am working on the design of my degree project. Some days ago I began studying LINQ. I found it was interesting and planned to use it in my project but now I am getting confused at some point. When I add the LINQ to SQL class it auto generates entities classes against each table in database. Suppose I have two tables in database: User Projects UserProjects (joint table) and a joint table that represents which user is associated with which project. LINQ to SQL class auto generates these three classes for me. Now shall I create separate (User and Project) classes as Business Object or use these auto generated entities? Also, to use database functionality we are required to use 3 tier architecture. Can I directly call LINQ DAL method from my BLL or do I need to create separate DAL which will call a method of the LINQ DAL?? class UserBLL { public void saveUser(String username, String password) { // here I am calling LINQ DAL from by BLL UserDataContext db = new UserDataContext(); User u =new User {Username = username, Password = password}; db.user.InsertOnSubmit(u); db.SubmitChanges(); } } Is the above method calling sequence fine?
