A good first sanity check would be to pick some simpler task that you think a RNN ought to be able to easily learn, and use your same setup to see if it successfully learns that task. Example: the correct output is the same as the input from 7 time steps ago. Also, are you sure you want the mean square difference as your loss function? It would be more typical to use the cross-entropy loss in this case (where you want to estimate a probability/likelihood), I think.
