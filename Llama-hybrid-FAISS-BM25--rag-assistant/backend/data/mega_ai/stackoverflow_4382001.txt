Working with Azure local Development Storage via SSMS (sql server management studio)

I am trying to write code to access my azure local development storage. I started off by creating a new storage for myself: dsInit /forceCreate I can now see the DevelopmentStorageDb20090919 in SSMS with some precreated tables such as dbo.TableContainer, dbo.TableRow etc. Now, can I simply add tables to this database via SSMS (ex. Employee table) and start accessing them via code ? Is this the right way to do stuff ? For example: var svc = CloudStorageAccount.DevelopmentStorageAccount .CreateCloudTableClient().GetDataServiceContext(); //"Employees" is the name of the table svc.AddObject("Employees", new Employees("John Doe")); svc.SaveChangesWithRetries(); 2 . And additionally, once I am all done, how do I port the table and the data into the actual cloud account ? By running scripts there ?
