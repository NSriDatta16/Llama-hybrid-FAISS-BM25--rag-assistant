As Pavel said in the comment, you need to assign the result, and you should use Ceiling : Dim result As Double = Math.Ceiling(SubMtP) You are also strongly encouraged to switch Option Strict On everywhere in your code to enable strict, static type checking. This will result in a few compile errors in your above code that will need to be cleaned up. This is good because these code fragments are potential errors in your code and make it hard to maintain and to understand.
