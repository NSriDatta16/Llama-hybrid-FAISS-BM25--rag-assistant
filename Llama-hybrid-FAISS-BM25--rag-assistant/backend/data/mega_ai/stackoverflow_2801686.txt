You can obviously not always do it really evenly in case the number of frames you want to skip is not a divisor of the total number of frames. So if it is important to always skip at least the number of frames you want, perform a floor on the division (totalFrames/framesToSkip). Having said that, you can apply the same trick as you proposed. if (totalFrames % floor(totalFrames/framesToSkip) == 0) skip(); Note that in the case of 44 and 15 you skip much more than 15. The other posibility is to ceil instead of floor, in that case you wont skip 15 frames but 14 frames. Yet another solution is to do a round to the nearest integer, this is a better approximation, however, you sometimes skip more than wished and sometimes less than wished but on average you have better results
