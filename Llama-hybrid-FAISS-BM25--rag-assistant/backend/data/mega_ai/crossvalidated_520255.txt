Probability that a random variable is the k-th smallest

Suppose we have random variables $X_1, \dots, X_n$ drawn independently from different distributions. How do we calculate the probability of some $X_i$ is the $k$ th smallest of those random variables? In other words (using order statistics notation), I want to calculate the following probabilities: Probability that $X_i$ is the smallest: $P(X_i = X_{(1)})$ Probability that $X_i$ is the 2nd smallest: $P(X_i = X_{(2)})$ ... Probability that $X_i$ is the $k$ th smallest: $P(X_i = X_{(k)})$ ... Probability that $X_i$ is the largest: $P(X_i = X_{(n)})$ Probability of smallest and largest seems easy enough. For example, $P(X_1 = X_{(1)}) = \prod_{i=2}^n P(X_1 due to independence. But it gets more tedious after that. For any $k$ , that means $k-1$ of the other random variables are less than $X_i$ . There are ${n-1} \choose {k-1}$ possible choices for which ones those are. We could write an expression for the probability of each of the ${n-1} \choose {k-1}$ cases and then sum those probabilities, but that becomes a lot of expressions as $n$ grows. Is there a more elegant way of calculating those probabilities other than evaluating all of those expressions? If necessary, we can make the simplification that the variables are drawn from normal distributions with equal variance but different means, i.e., $X_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$ . But ideally I'd like to solve for the general case when $X_i$ might come from a different (but known) distribution.
