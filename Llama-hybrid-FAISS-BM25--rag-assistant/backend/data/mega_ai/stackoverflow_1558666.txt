php and file storage on windows servers

My question is related to using a difference drive on a windows server to store files. The partition of the server is too small to handle a large amount of data files, and I want to use the D: drive as the file storage space. My problem is, how do I access the files when they're stored on the D: drive using php? I've tried a multitude of different ways of accessing the files but they never work. I store the filename and path in mysql and download the files based on their ID. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
