If the model is a discriminative model (e.g. a classification model), it is highly unlikely that you can identify whether it was trained with some specific dataset. If the model is generative , (e.g. a language model or a machine translation system), you may be able to try to identify if the model was trained with your data by trying to extract from it information only available in your data. This article for instance studies the feasibility of doing precisely that. However, a different issue would be to prove that the model was indeed trained on your data. Yet a further issue would be if such a fact is legal or not for a specific country/legal system; see these questions on the matter to better understand the problems posed by this kind of situations (I am not a lawyer, you should seek professional legal advice for this kind of matter): [reddit] Is it legal to use copyright material as training data?
