How to use survival model to predict when there are time dependent continuous covariates

In my practical projects, I usually track a group of people for a few months, then I run a model based on the first few months behavior. Hopefully I can predict both overall and individual level's event rate in future time. Here I will use PBC data example to illustrate my question. library(pbc) temp I separate date into training set and test set. I use train data to build model then use test set for prediction. pbc.train=pbc2[(1:995),] pbc.test=pbc2[(996:1807),] fit2 Here are my questions related to prediction: If I want to see the overall survival rate at each time point already occurred, I can use summary(survfit(fit2), time=300) But if I want to predict the overall survival rate at a time point not happened yet, for example at time=10000. How can I do it? summary(survfit(fit2),time=10000) will not do. How to predict each individual's survival rate in future? I can use the predict call to compute relative hazard ratio to average for a set of covariates as follows. covs=data.frame(bili=1.9, protime=12, age=40, trt=1) predict(fit2, newdata=covs, type="risk") But the real test data is organized as one person has multiple records. More importantly, for each individual, time dependent covariates changes at each time interval. Therefore, if I used something like predict(fit2, newdata=pbc.test,type="risk") It does not make sense. I want to know each person's risk of death in future or at each future time points. How can I do that? another side question, in the test data, some people are already died. Is that appropriate that I delete the ids who already have event happened? Only use predict model to predict the future survival rate for patients survived from this study.
