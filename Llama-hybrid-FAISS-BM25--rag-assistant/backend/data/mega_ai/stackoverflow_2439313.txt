The id of an element has to be unique, so you can't have two elements with the same id. When you try to get all radio buttons as a single element, you will get one of them. Which one you get is entirely up to how the browser choose to handle the incorrect id's that you have set. You could get either of the elements, or null, depending on the implementation. In this case you happen to use a browser that gets the first element. Give the elements their own id: Average Sevice: 15% Excellent Sevice: 20% Getting the value attribute from the element will only get the value that you have specified for each of them. Instead you used the checked attribute: var tipPercent; if (document.getElementById("tipPercent15").checked) tipPercent = 15; if (document.getElementById("tipPercent20").checked) tipPercent = 20;
