Hm, what was the meaning of this score? See. This is why it was removed. (As I recall, it was the average probability assigned to the correct class by the k-nearest neighbour classifier on the projection -- or something similar. The number is useful for ranking projections, but doesn't have any meaningfyl interpretation or absolute scale, like >0.70 is good, >0.90 is excellent. Hence there's no point in showing it.)
