Two treatments - How do I compute reliability estimates like Cronbach's $\alpha$?

I randomized my survey, and now I have my data on SPSS (and all cleaned up) but when trying to run my Cronbach's $\alpha$ I have a problem. Because I have two treatments (sexualised and normal) all my measures are present twice in my data set. For example, “similarity” has 3 items but now I have 6 variables: 3 for the sexualized and 3 for the normal condition. Sim1 Sim2 Sim3 aSim1 aSim2 aSim3 SPSS will not allow me to combine 2 treatments because I have no data that has answers for the 6 (obviously). Do I calculate them separately and then get the average between the two, or do I report both Cronbach's $\alpha$s for the 2 treatments?
