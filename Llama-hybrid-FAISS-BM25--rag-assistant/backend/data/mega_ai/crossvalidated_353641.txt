Some advantages of the sample variance $S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2:$ (1) For a population with variance $\sigma^2,$ the sample variance is an unbiased estimator, $E(S^2) = \sigma^2.$ (2) For a sample from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu, \sigma),$ one can show that $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \mathsf{Chisq}(n-1),$ the chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. Thus, a 95% confidence interval for $\sigma^2$ is of the form $\left(\frac{(n-1)S^2}{U},\, \frac{(n-1)S^2}{U}\right),$ where $L$ and $U$ cut 2.5% of the probability from the lower and upper tails, respectively, of $\mathsf{Chisq}(n-1).$ (3) If you know the sample size $n,$ sample mean $\bar X,$ and variance $S^2$ of two separate samples, you can use that information to find the sample size, mean, and variance of the combined sample; similarly, for combining more than two samples. The computation for the variance involves some algebra with repeated use of the alternative formula $(n-1)S^2 = \sum_i X_i^2 - n\bar X^2.$ In some circumstances, a disadvantage of the sample variance is that its value is greatly influenced by high outliers. For example, consider the following data with $S_x^2 = 85.03.$ (Computations in R statistical software.) x [1] 30.10 34.02 39.87 40.31 41.66 42.74 44.61 45.32 46.82 47.09 [11] 48.55 49.03 49.15 52.03 52.85 56.86 58.28 60.06 61.81 66.04 var(x) [1] 85.02517 If the largest observation were 96.04 (say, due to data entry error or equipment failure), the variance would be 185.86.$ y = x; y[20] = 96.04; y [1] 30.10 34.02 39.87 40.31 41.66 42.74 44.61 45.32 46.82 47.09 [11] 48.55 49.03 49.15 52.03 52.85 56.86 58.28 60.06 61.81 96.04 var(y) [1] 185.8567 By contrast, another way to measure variability is to take the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. This difference is called the 'interquartile range' (IQR). The IQR is the same (11.38) for both versions of the data. summary(x); IQR(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 30.10 42.47 47.82 48.36 53.85 66.04 [1] 11.3825 summary(y); IQR(y) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 30.10 42.47 47.82 49.86 53.85 96.04 [1] 11.3825 The IQR is sometimes used in boxplots to call attention to outliers in data. boxplot(y, col="skyblue2", pch=19, horizontal=T) In this boxplot of the data y , observation 96.04 is plotted separately (as an outlier) because it lies beyond a 'fence' (not shown) located 1.5(IQR) above the upper quartile 53.85; that is, $96.04 > 53.85 + 1.5(11.38) = 70.92.$ Note: If you know the sample size, sample median, and IQR of two separate samples, you cannot generally use that information to find the median or IQR of the two samples combined.
