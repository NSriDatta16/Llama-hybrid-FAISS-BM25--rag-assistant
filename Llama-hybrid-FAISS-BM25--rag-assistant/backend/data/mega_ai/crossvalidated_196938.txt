Suppose Xn, $n\geqslant0$ is a Markov chain on $\varphi =\left \{ 0,1,2,...,d \right \}$ and $P(x,y)=\frac{\binom{2x}{y}\binom{2d-2x}{d-y}}{\binom{2d}{d}} $. States 0 and d are absorbing states for this chain. Please show that this chain satisfies the equation: $\sum_{y=0}^{d}yP(x,y)=x, x=0,...,d$ I think the equation is the expectation of x, such as Ex(Xi)=x, so I need to take the condition into this form. But i don't know what to do.
