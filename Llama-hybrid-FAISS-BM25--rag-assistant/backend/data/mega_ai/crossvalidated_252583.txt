I don't see why you need any statistical calculations for the second problem. There are 3400 oranges with a total weight is 255,000 g. So the average weight of an orange is 255000/3400= 75 grams. That is exact. There is zero (0.000000000000....) chance that the average weight is greater than 76 grams. The average weight of oranges in that truck is 75 grams exactly.
