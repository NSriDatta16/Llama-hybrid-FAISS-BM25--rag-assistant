The definition of Week of Year is Locale dependent. How it is defined in US is discused in the other posts. For example in Germany ( DIN 1355-1 / ISO 8601 ): the first Week* of Year is the first week with 4 or more days in the new year. *first day of week is Monday and last day of week is Sunday And Javaâ€™s Calendar pays attention to the locale. For example: public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException { DateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy"); Date lastDec2010 = sdf.parse("31/12/2010"); Calendar calUs = Calendar.getInstance(Locale.US); calUs.setTime(lastDec2010); Calendar calDe = Calendar.getInstance(Locale.GERMAN); calDe.setTime(lastDec2010); System.out.println( "us: " + calUs.get( Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR ) ); System.out.println( "de: " + calDe.get( Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR ) ); } prints: us: 1 de: 52 ADDED For the US (and I can think of that it is the same for Mexico) the 1. Week of Year is the week where the 1. January belongs to. -- So if 1. Januar is a Saturday, then the Friday before (31. Dec) belongs the same week, and in this case this day belongs to the 1. Week of Year 2011.
