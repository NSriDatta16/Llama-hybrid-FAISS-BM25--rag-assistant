You can specify additional members of the anonymous type by adding PropertyName = , so if you want to add a property Genre with some constant value, you can write: new { t.Name, t.Rating, t.AverageRating, t.ShortSynopsis, Genre = "Action & Adventure" } The value of genre will be probably the same as the genre variable or the property g.Name in your query, so you could use this property (instead of string literal): new { t.Name, t.Rating, t.AverageRating, t.ShortSynopsis, Genre = g.Name } // Or 'Genre = genre' It is worth noting that if you just use some property name in the construction of anonymous type (e.g. t.Name ), it is just a shortcut for writing Name = t.Name (the compiler copies the property name automatically).
