Suppose you have subgroups $i=1,...,m$ each with sample mean $\bar{x}_i$ taken over $n_i$ data points. Then the sample mean for the whole sample (pooling the subgroups) is: $$\begin{align} \bar{x} &= \frac{n_1 \bar{x}_1 + \cdots + n_m \bar{x}_m}{n_1 + \cdots + n_m} \\[6pt] &= \frac{1}{n_1 + \cdots + n_m} \sum_{i=1}^m n_i \bar{x}_i. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ So as you can see, the actual mean of the whole sample is a weighted average of the sample means of the subgroups (where each weight is proportionate to the size of the subgroup). Consequently, if you take a set of subgroups of unequal size, and you take the straight (unweighted) mean of their means, this will not generally be equal to the sample mean of the whole sample.
