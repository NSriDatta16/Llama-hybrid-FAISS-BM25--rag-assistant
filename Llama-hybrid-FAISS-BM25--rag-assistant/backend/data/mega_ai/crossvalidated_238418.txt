Weights in the neural network are not changing

I have a neural network model with 20 layers. There are 30 input nodes and 5 output nodes. I am using backpropagation algorithm to train the model. I can see that in the first 5 layers, the weights are not changing. I don't understand why that is happening. Can someone point me in the direction of how to fix it?
