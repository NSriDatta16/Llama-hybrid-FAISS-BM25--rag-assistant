How do you train a model on a dataset that's unlabeled but we know the percentage of every class?

Say we have a data set that's pictures of apples and oranges, but we don't know which is which. However the data is organized in such a way, that for some groups of images we know how many of them are apples and how many are oranges. For example the dataset could consist of 1000 groups of images, each group contains 100 images and a label that's basically the percentage of the images in this group that are apples but not which ones are they. Is it possible to train a model to classify this data? If so what's the technique called? How error tolerant is it (if the group labels are only an estimate and not precise)? Is there any recommended literature on this topic?
