I am currently using OpenSAML by "Internet2". I don't know much about them but we've been using their libraries for a while without any problems. The documentation on the OpenSAML1 version are non-existent ... but support for OpenSAML2 is much better. You may also find some of the commercial product useful (taken from their site): Shibboleth Globus Toolkit gLite VO Privilege Project Clarity Security's SSO Toolkit VOMS JBoss CAS OpenPermis Apache Rampart OLAT eduGAIN openLiberty Wakame OpenASelect
