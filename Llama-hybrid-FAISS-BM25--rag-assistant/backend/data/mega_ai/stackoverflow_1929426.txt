Strict answer: it is not possible. Since you don't want outside process, and PostgreSQL doesn't support jobs - you are out of luck. If you'll reconsider using outside processes, then you're most likely want something like cron, or better yet pgagent. On absolutely other hand - what do you need to do that has to happen every 30 seconds? this seems like a problem with design.
