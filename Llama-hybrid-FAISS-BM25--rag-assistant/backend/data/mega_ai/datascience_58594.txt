To build a machine learning model of large data sets of 20,000 rows using python

What are the essential steps to build a Machine Learning model to predict the following 4 classes: whether the user was a male, a female, a brand (non-individual) or unknown. The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a user name, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, link, sidebar color and other information. How can I implement this in python?
