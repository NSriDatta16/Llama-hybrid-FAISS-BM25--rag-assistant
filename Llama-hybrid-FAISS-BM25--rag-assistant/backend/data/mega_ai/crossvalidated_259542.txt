Your intuition is correct that the statistic above doesn't tell the whole story. Yes, past refugee terrorist behaviour isn't necessarily a good indicator of future refugee terrorist behaviour, but that isn't the problem. The problem is that even one or two large-scale terrorist attacks would be awful, and statistics isn't appropriate for dealing with such small numbers of things. If we only consider mass murder refugee terror attacks, there have never been any, at least not in the past fifteen years. The figure in the graph comes from the fact there were 3 murders by refugees in terror attacks since 1975[ 1 ], which is essentially zero compared to the terror attacks everyone is scared of. But on the basis of statistics alone, that data isn't enough to rule out the chance that a huge terror attack is coming. We can't say "the threat is low", because statistics can't tell us if the threat is low enough. First off, imagine how upset you would be if a refugee committed a horrible terrorist attack that killed 100 innocent people. Now imagine how much you would hate the idea of a 20% chance of that happening. We would want to put safegaurds into the refugee program. Now, let's look at the statistics. How can you prove the probability of a refugee terrorist attack next year is less than 20%? Well, the probability of a terrorist attack went up after the awful September 11 attacks, so you could say there haven't been any attacks in 15 years. If the probability of an attack was 20%, then no attacks in 15 years would be pretty unlikely (p=3.5%). So we can be pretty certain the chance of a major terrorist attack next year by a refugee is less than 20%. But now suppose we're interested in the chance of a terrorist attack within five years. Then we only have three independent samples since 2001 (2001-2006, 2006-2011, and 2011-2016). We can't say with any confidence that the probability of a terrorist attack within five years is less than 20%. And a 20% risk within 5 years of a tragic terrorist attack by a refugee where 100 people die is awful, and would certainly justify changes to the refugee program if it were real. And even a 1% chance of a major attack in ten years would be afwul. In terms of probability, one devastating attack the same size as the September 11 attacks, done by refugees, would turn the chance per year of being killed in a terror attack by refugees into 1 in 1 million, which is almost as bad as the odds of being killed by lightning. But notice that the logic I used there could be applied to anything where the odds of it changed 15 years ago. We failed to disprove a threat of something happening, based only off the fact that it happened zero times. It would be equally hard to say the threat of a terrorist attack by a refugee named Tim was less than 20% in five years, but it wouldn't make sense to stop all refugees named Tim. It would be equally hard to prove the threat of a terrorist attack by an astronaut was less than 20% in five years, but you don't see anyone saying we should stop letting astronauts in . Statistics is the wrong approach to dealing with extreme events. If you want to be certain that something won't happen once in ten years, you can't use past experience to convince yourself of the fact. That's why it's wrong to say the graph shows the terrorism threat from refugees is very low. If we're only using history and a single major incident is unacceptable, then no threat is very low.
