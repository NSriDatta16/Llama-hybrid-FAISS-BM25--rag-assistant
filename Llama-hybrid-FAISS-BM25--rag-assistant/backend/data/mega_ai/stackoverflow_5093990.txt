There's only one spot in the Magento code base that uses that error language. File: lib/Varien/File/Uploader.php ... if( !is_writable($destinationFolder) ) { throw new Exception('Destination folder is not writable or does not exists.'); } ... Add some temporary debugging code right above this ... if( !is_writable($destinationFolder) ) { Mage::Log($destinationFolder); //or var_dump($destinationFolder); throw new Exception('Destination folder is not writable or does not exists.'); } ... This will let you know the exact folder Magento wants to write to, but can't. Examine this folder, and you'll find it's not writable. Reviewing the edge cases on is_writable may also shed some light on the subject.
