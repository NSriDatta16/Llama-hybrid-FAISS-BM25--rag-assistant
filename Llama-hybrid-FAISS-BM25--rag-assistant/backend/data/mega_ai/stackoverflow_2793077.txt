Use wget with: -c option Extracted from man pages: -c / --continue Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or by another program. For instance: wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of the local file.
