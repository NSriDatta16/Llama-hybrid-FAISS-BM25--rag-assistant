Enable code coverage in VS 2010 ultimate

This may seem a bit stupid, but I can't find the answer so: My team just moved to VS2010 ultimate, and we'd like to enable code coverage. All the instructions I've found mention to open the Local.testsettings file and go to the "Execution Criteria" tab. Well, I don't have this tab, and I do have VS2010 ultimate, which is supposed to support code coverage. Help please :) Noa
