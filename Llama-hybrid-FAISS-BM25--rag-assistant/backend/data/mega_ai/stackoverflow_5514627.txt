Have you checked whether its your browser caching the page? I have had similar issues relating to this. I ended up adding a little method to my base page to call to stop the page being cached. eg: /// /// Set the page to not Cache /// protected void DontCache() { try { //Dont Cache Response.Expires = 0; Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Response.AppendHeader( "Pragma", "no-cache" ); } catch ( Exception ) { throw; } }
