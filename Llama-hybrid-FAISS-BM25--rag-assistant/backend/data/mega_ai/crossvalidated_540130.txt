Differences in predicted probabilities from logistic regression across two datasets?

I used 3 continuous predictors (standardized to unit scale with mean = 0) in a glm model to solve for a two-class categorical problem (case, control). The model was selected in a previous published work, we just repeated the predictors measurements in the two new datasets below. How can I explain the discrepancies between the predicted probabilities across these two datasets? I was told that the first one is poor because it is close to 50% probability (i.e., random), even though it correctly classifies all samples. I'm not sure if we can make that claim by using the model's predictive proabibility... Accuracy and 95% CI for: dataset A: 100% (86.7 % - 100%) dataset B: 100% (78.19% - 100%) Any input is appreciated.
