I would recommend you to review the following resources on the topic with excellent explanations: Nice blog post on kernel functions for machine learning (ML) ; Another nice blog post on using kernel approximations / kernel trick in ML ; Yet another nice blog post on using kernel methods in ML ; Great discussion on Cross Validated (CV) on advantages of Gaussian kernel in ML . For more detailed technical treatment of the topic, see references in the above-mentioned blog posts as well as in answers within the CV discussion, linked above. Hope this helps.
