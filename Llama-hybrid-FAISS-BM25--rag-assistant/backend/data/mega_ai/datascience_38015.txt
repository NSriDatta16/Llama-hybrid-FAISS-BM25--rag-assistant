Super basic logistic regression example

I am new to ML and I created a super basic logistic regression example with 4 points on the $x$ line that belong to two classes: points = [[1, 1]] points = points + [[2, 0]] points = points + [[1.5, 1]] points = points + [[2.5, 0]] data = np.array([x[:-1] for x in points]) target = [int(x[-1]) for x in points] alg = LogisticRegression() alg.fit(data, target) print (alg.coef_) print (alg.intercept_) print (alg.predict_proba(1)) print (alg.predict_proba(1.5)) print (alg.predict_proba(2)) print (alg.predict_proba(2.5)) I expected the model to understand that anything greater than 1.5 belongs to class 0, and anything smaller than 2 belongs to class 0. However, everything is predicted to be in class 0. Also, in this case , what is the meaning for the coef and intercept? More precisely, is there a way to deduce from the coef and intercept where the model thinks the points switch from class 0 to class 1?
