A set of probabilities is coherent if a bookie who is willing to take all finite bets at stated prices cannot be forced to lose in all states of nature. This is the "you cut; I choose" problem. You cut the cake in half, and I get to choose the half I want. If you state the odds, then I get to choose the bets. Calibration, unfortunately, has multiple meanings. However, with reference to coherence, a model is well calibrated if it predicts an occurrence $k$ with probability $\alpha$ and $k$ actually happens with long-run frequency $\alpha$ . Additionally, de Finetti also stated the coherence principle with respect to losses. Given a quadratic loss function, if a set of probabilities are coherent then there doesn't exist an assignment of probabilities to outcomes that would uniformly reduce the penalty. If a model is a well calibrated Bayesian model, then it is intrinsically coherent. Just a footnote to the second definition, for some density functions all possible choices on the real number line minimize quadratic loss equally well, so there is a degenerate case in the mix.
