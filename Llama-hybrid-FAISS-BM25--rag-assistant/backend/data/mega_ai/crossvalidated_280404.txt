Best language/library to use Bayesian Network in production

I'm looking for the best language and library to use Bayesian Networks in production. I need the model to be sufficiently fast for an almost real time experience. The computation load is to update the model from about 10 new data points each time a user will make a request and the user shouldn't wait more than about 2 seconds. It seems like there is a lot of libraries in R but R has a bad reputation for production, while Python has a better reputation but less expertise/libraries for Bayesian Networks. What's best ?
