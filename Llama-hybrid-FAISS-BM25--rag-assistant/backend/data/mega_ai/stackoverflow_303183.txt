I ran into this same issue, I couldn't come up with an elegant solution. But the only solution I found was to either use "stitching," or to use reflection. Stitching looks something like this. Person existingPerson - DB.GetPerson(1); existingPerson.BirthDate = newPerson.BirthDate; existingPerson.JobTitle = newPerson.JobTitle; I once read something about using a callback but I can't find it for the life of me.
