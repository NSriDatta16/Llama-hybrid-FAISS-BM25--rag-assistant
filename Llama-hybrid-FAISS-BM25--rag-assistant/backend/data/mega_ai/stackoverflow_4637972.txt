Probably not the cache you want, maybe something more along the line of HTML5 local storage or Offline Web Application , apart from that it would be difficult to know what is in the entire cache due to security constrains, but you can use the server response header to detect what item the browser think it has in cache (detect the response 304 in http server header, if you provide the proper headers ).
