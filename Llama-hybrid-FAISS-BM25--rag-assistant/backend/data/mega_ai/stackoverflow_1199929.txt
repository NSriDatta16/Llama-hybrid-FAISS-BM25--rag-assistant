First, have an index on the game field... :) The query seems simple and straightforward, but it hides that fact that a datasbase design change is probably required. In such cases I always prefer to maintain a field that holds aggregated data, either per day, per user, or per any other axis. This way you can have a daily task that aggregates the relevant data and saves it in the database. If indeed you call this query often, you should use the principle of decreasing the efficiency of insertion for increasing the efficiency of retrieval.
