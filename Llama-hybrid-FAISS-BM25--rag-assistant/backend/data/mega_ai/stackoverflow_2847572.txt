Subversion uses metadata files in your solution folder structure to keep track of where stuff is, and where it maps to in the repository - these files are typically held in .svn or _svn folders in each solution folder and subfolder. Even though you may have physically moved things around in your working copy, those metadata files still point to the original structures in the repository. What you could do (and please, anyone with deeper Subversion knowledge than I pipe-up if there's a smarter / better option) is re-organise the folder structure in the repository through RepoBrowser. Once you've got things where you want them in there, you can check-out a new working copy. The metadata files will then reflect the new repository structure.
