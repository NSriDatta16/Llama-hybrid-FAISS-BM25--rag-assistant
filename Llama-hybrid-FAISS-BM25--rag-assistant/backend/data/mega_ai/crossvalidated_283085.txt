How to combine indicators resulting from a machine learning classification?

I've done a classification with different machine learning method, as result i've the confusion matrix and the roc curve. To find best classification model, i'm looking for a method to combine the indicators computed with the confusion matrix, for example i've thought : score=efficiency+purity+completeness-contamination or score=(efficiency+purity+completeness)/contamination and then find the model with the max score. What is the better criterion?
