Things that I am not sure about "LASSO" regression method

I have read the chapters that are related to "LASSO" regression in: The elements of statistical learning (Tibshirani et al.) Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations. (Tibshirani et al.). My questions: I do not understand why centering $y_i$ leads $\bar{y}$ (the sum of $y_i$ over $n$) to be $0$, and why this allows them to omit the intercept term $\beta_0$ from the optimization problem. They also mentioned that the lasso solution in general cannot be derived. However, they then obtain the solution ($\hat{\beta}_\text{lasso}$) by minimizing $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \| y_i - \beta x_i \|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_1$. How can these two statements be reconciled? Could you please show me mathematically, but in an easy way, so that I can understand? I'm a beginner to machine learning. Thanks in advance.
