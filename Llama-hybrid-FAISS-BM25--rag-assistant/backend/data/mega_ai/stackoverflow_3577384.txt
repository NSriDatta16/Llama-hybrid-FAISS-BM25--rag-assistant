Getting iOS outlets wired in InterfaceBuilder

I'm new to developing in iOS and successfully ran through a tutorial on how to create and connect outlets in a Mac OSX Cocoa App. However, when I try to follow the same process for my iPhone app, I keep hitting walls... (Apologies for the lengthy example- please bear with) Project A: In xCode: Create new Mac OSX Cocoa Application Create a new class SimpleViewController : NSObject #import @interface SimpleViewController : NSObject { IBOutlet NSTextField *aField; IBOutlet NSButton *aButton; } @end In Interface Builder: File > Read class files Drag SimpleViewController from my library into the main.nib Ctl-drag from SimpleViewController to view elements to connect my outlets Everything above works great. Now for the same thing in an iPhone app: Project B: In XCode: Create new iPhone OS Window-Based Application Create a new class SimpleViewController : UIViewController #import @class NSTextField; @class NSButton; @interface EmbedComplexViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet NSTextField *aField; IBOutlet NSButton *aButton; } @end (Notice my view controller is now an extension of UIViewController , not NSObject . Also, this time I need to use forward class declarations for my outlet classes. Not a problem, but is this necessary?) In Interface Builder: File > Read class files Drag SimpleViewController from my library into the main.nib Ctl-drag from SimpleViewController to view elements - BUT now I can't see any of my declared outlet member variables. Instead, the only outlet option I have is 'view' What more do I need to do to have my declared outlets show up? Thanks- Yarin
