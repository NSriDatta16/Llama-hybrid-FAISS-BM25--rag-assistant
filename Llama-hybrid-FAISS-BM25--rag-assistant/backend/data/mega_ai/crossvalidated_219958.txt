Proper way of averaging histograms

How does one go about averaging multiple histograms of a quantity $x,$ if the individual histograms do not have the same range, that is, $R_i=\text{max}(x_i)-\text{min}(x_i)$ will be different for two different $i$ values (where $i$ here is indexing over the realizations of the experiment/histogram). Only common point between them is that the bin size is fixed, $b=1.$ How can I perform the averaging whilst making sure that no discrepancy arises for values of $x$ that do not occur in all histograms (as $R_i$'s can be different)? I am interested solely in the methodology here.
