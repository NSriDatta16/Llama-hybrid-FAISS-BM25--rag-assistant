Implicit data members for @synthesize - good practice or bad habit?

Today, I got a link to a long list of coding guidelines , proclaiming to be "code commandments". A good read, and full of new insights to me. Among the list, somewhere along 25% of the scrollbar, I come across something new to me: Implicit data member creation. Although every tutorial, book and video I've read or watched about Objective-C always performs the triad of NSNumber *number | @property NSNumber *number | @synthesize number , these commandments now tell me I can simply omit the first step (data member declaration in the interface) because @synthesize will create one on the fly. Say what!? With a little disbelief I deleted several of my data member declarations, and indeed, my app still works like a charm. Less typing, less reading, less chance for typos. Sounds to me like a win-win-win, but is it really good practice? I'm asking this question out of pure disbelief that all the tutorials, books and videos are teaching the wrong lesson, at least too much of it, or that I've been not paying attention in class... Cheers, EP. Edit: Although I copied the expression "data member" from the linked post, it is more commonly described with the word "ivar", just a good one to have in here for search friendliness. This also takes care of my former confusion over property/ivar/member naming :).
