Listbox where items have more than one selectable region

I'm not sure about the best way to implement this in WPF, so I'll state my problem first. I have a collection of frames. Each frame has two images. Let's say I have 10 frames giving a total of 20 images. I want to show the images at the bottom of the screen organized like a film strip - 2 rows and 10 columns. When the user clicks on one of this images or uses the arrow, it should become selected and the selected image information will be used somewhere else in the application. I've implemented it as a ListBox with ItemsSource bound to my viewmodel's Frames collection (an observablecollection). In the DataTemplate of the ListBox, I've created a grid with two rows, each one containing a Image control. The one on row 0 is bound to TopImage (a property of my Frame class) and the bottom one is bound to BottomImage. All this work, but the problem is that when I use the arrows, the whole frame (item) gets selected. How do I select each image in the datatemplate individually? OR Is there a better way to implement this>
