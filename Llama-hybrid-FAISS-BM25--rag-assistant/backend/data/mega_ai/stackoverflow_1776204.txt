In a VS Setup project, how can I exclude the dependencies of a project from the MSI?

I'm working in C#. I have a small VS Solution with 4 projects: a DLL an EXE that references the DLL a merge project, that does nothing more than ILMerge on the assemblies from the prior two steps a setup project, that packages the .EXE output of the Merge project. (I've added the "Primary Output of a Project" to the setup, specifying the Merge project here) The problem is, the setup project automatically detects the projects #1 and #2 as dependencies for project #3. When I include the primary output of the 3rd project into the MSI (Setup project), the dependencies are automatically dragged in as well. I don't want this. How can I stop it? I tried specifying an "Exclude Filter" but couldn't get that to work. No matter what I tried, the dependencies always got dragged in. I tried manually modifying the Setup.vdproj, to remove the auto-detected dependency projects, but when I re-loaded the .vdproj in VS, the auto-detected dependencies came back. help?
