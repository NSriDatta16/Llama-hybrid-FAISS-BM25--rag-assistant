Finding the posterior with a uniform prior

Suppose I have a normal distribution $X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ and I impose a uniform prior on the mean, so that it has to be positive. How do I go about finding the posterior distribution $p(\mu | X_i)$ ? Following the Bayesian formulas, we would have that $p(\mu | X_i) \propto \text{likelihood}.$ Does this mean that the posterior is the distribution of the normal likelihood? If so, how do I find this distribution? $\sigma$ is known
