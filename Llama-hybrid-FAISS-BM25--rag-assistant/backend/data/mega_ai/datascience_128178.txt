Imputing techniques for missing values

Currently, I am working on a project for which I would appreciate some feedback and opinions. My dataset contains data about daily solar radiation from 8 stations and covers the period from 2017 to 2020. The dataset have 10 columns, one of them is the target global horizontal irradiance(GHI). Date Air Temperature (Cآ°) Air Temperature Uncertainty (Cآ°) DHI (Wh/m2) DHI Uncertainty (Wh/m2) Standard Deviation DHI (Wh/m2) DNI (Wh/m2) DNI Uncertainty (Wh/m2) Standard Deviation DNI (Wh/m2) GHI (Wh/m2) GHI Uncertainty (Wh/m2) Standard Deviation GHI (Wh/m2) Relative Humidity (%) Relative Humidity Uncertainty (%) Barometric Pressure (mB (hPa equiv)) Barometric Pressure Uncertainty (mB (hPa equiv)) 1/1/2017 14.3 0.5 1016.6 269.7 302.6 7075.4 1441.7 1063.7 5111.2 1131.5 218.5 58.7 3 789 4 1/2/2017 13.6 0.5 1723.8 579.7 852.2 3633.6 1748.5 2532.3 4087.9 1313.5 1666.1 73.1 3 787.7 3.9 1/3/2017 16.5 0.5 2015.2 602.6 833.9 5422.2 1607.8 2908.8 5744.1 1400.3 1471.1 60 3 787.2 3.9 1/4/2017 19.5 0.5 6293.1 1691.1 2125.8 46.3 3 788.5 4 1/5/2017 20.9 0.5 2451.5 186.9 571 5004.4 391.3 1562.3 6345.9 434.2 1021.9 53.5 3 788.1 3.9 1/6/2017 24 0.5 2900.9 253.2 800.4 5423.1 548.6 7080.7 498.3 802.1 35 3 3.9 1/7/2017 1/8/2017 1/9/2017 1/10/2017 The objective of this project is to build a model that can predict the GHI, however, the data have incomplete dates across different months. as shown in the sample data above, i have data for january but 7,8,9 and 10 is missing for all columns including the target.assuming that i have data from 11 to 30 almost complete for all columns or has missing value at the target column too. Therefore, my first step will be to apply imputing techniques to fill in the missing values for missing days. In order to determine whether the technique I used was effective at imputing the correct values, I decided to follow the following steps: Choose two stations and two columns. Use data without missing values, converting them to nulls. Apply imputing techniques, then calculate the accuracy by comparing it with the actual values I have retrieved. If the accuracy is high, I will generalize the same technique to all stations and columns except for the target. Because the target is the one I would like to predict, I excluded it from imputing. So can I train my model on the data without missing values in GHI(target), and test it on the data that I applied imputing techniques on it,so it will has missing values in GHI(target)? But how i will calculate the accuracy of my model? Or does imputing have to be applied to the target column as well before building the final model? Given that the data is time series, can the train and test not be sequenced when building the model? or is there other methodology I can follow to Imputing the missing days values then build the predictive model?
