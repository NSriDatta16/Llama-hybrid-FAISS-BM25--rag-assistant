A dense layer will output a fixed-sized vector. This will be what you want for a classification task for example, say sentiment classification. A TimeDistributedDense will apply a dense layer to each output of the sequence. So let's say you have a text input, represented as a sequence of word embeddings, you would apply an LSTM cell and then the same dense layer to each step output of the LSTM. This will be used for part-of-speech tagging for example, in which case you are interested in labelling each word of the sequential input with a tag.
