Expire a particular page on back button of browser

if users press the browser's back button to reach the prior page, the page should display a message like "web page expired". can i use javascript for this??? for example: there are 4 pages in web sites. on page 1,2 and 3 the user can use the back-button, wheras on the 4th page the user gets the desired message. i thought that i can do this by using counter. i used following javascript on the master page .. function GoBack() { window.history.go(+1); } and call the function in body like this: and on the 4th page_load i do the following: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); it is working for all pages .. but i want to do this only for the 4th page
