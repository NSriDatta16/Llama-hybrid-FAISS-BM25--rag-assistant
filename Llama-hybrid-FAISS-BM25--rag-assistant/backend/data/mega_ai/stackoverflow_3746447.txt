This very much sounds as if there are dependencies between the test. As far as I understand from looking at your test, you're accessing the your data storage in the test. Is there a chance that one of the tests doesn't properly cleanup his traces, therefore causing others to fail?? Testing against a DB is usually not considered a unit test, though it is very useful. Those kind of tests (you may call them integration tests) are however more difficult and time consuming to code because you have to pay a lot of attention that your test leaves the environment in the exact state it found it before.
