Detect if visitor is a browser and not a crawler

How would I server side detect if the user of the webpage is a browser? The reason for detecting this is, that I'm storing statistics about visited pages and I don't want to store any statistics when the user is a crawler. So I'm not trying to detect which browser vendor. I only want a boolean answer, is the user a browser. I assume the answer is connected with the user-agent header, but the numerous possibly values is too overwhelming for me to figure out. How can I detect it? A 90% solution where I only detect the most Top5 popular browser would be good enough. I'm using C# ASP.Net, but I guess most solutions in other languages and frameworks could be translated.
