How to find the optimum when using regularization?

Using regularization increases the training error and the validation possibly as well. How do I find the optimum? Still just the optimum of the biasÂ² and variance, like here: Source: https://dziganto.github.io/cross-validation/data%20science/machine%20learning/model%20tuning/python/Model-Tuning-with-Validation-and-Cross-Validation/ How do I know then how strong the regularization should be?
