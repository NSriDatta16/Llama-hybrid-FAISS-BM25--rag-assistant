You can store date field in this fashion.. Document doc = new Document(); doc.add(new Field("modified", DateTools.timeToString(f.lastModified(), DateTools.Resolution.MINUTE), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED)); where f is a file object... Now use the above document for indexwriter... checkout the sample code comes with lucene... and the following link... http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/document/DateTools.html UPDATE Field.Index NOT_ANALYZED Index the field's value without using an Analyzer, so it can be searched. As no analyzer is used the value will be stored as a single term. This is useful for unique Ids like product numbers. As per lucene javadoc you don't need analyzer for fields using Field.Index NOT_ANALYZED but i think by design the IndexWriter expects an analyzer as indexing the exact replica of data is not efficient in terms of storage and searching.
