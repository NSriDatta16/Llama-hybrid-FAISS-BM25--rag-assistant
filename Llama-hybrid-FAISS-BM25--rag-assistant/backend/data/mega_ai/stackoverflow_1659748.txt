I'm using JProfiler on Mac OS X and I'm very happy with it. I don't know why you wrote that it doesn't support OS X, they even have a DMG download on their site. It is an expensive piece of software - I would suggest contacting their sales. Most companies are happy to donate licenses to open source projects. Shark is the old tool. The latest XCode comes with Instruments. A gorgeously designed profiling application based on DTrace. It can profile Java application, but you won't come close to the level of details you will get with tools built to instrument Java. Another option is to use TPTP. The Eclipse plugin works on OS X, but the agent controller does not. You can run a virtualized Linux (I use VMWare Fusion, but you can use the FOSS alternative, Virtualbox) and run your Tomcat there. You can connect the TPTP on the OS X and profile the application running on the Linux box.
