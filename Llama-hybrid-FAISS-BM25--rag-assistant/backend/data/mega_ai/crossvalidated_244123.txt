One point to consider is are you interested in making predictions or understanding associations and carrying out inference (confidence intervals around effects). Although random forests provide a variable-importance summary, this technique is primarily aimed at prediction; there is no inference. Many researchers think they are interested in making predictions, but often there is a mismatch with their goals. With that said, you can make predictions with glm and gamlss. You also have the flexibility of regression. A benefit to the random forests is that you do not have to specify aspects such as interactions and because of this, it may discover patterns in your data. Further it handles the case where there are more predictors than observations. Still, there is evidence that techniques such as random forests do not use the data as efficiently as conventional techniques do. More research is needed. I think both techniques are updatable in the same manner. Reference: van der Ploeg, T., Austin, P. C., & Steyerberg, E. W. (2014).
