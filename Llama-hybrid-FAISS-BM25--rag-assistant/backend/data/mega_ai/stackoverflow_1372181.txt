Need some explain with OOAD "is a" hierarchy

I have purchase Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications , at page 64 paragraph 2 has explain about "is a" hierarchy like below. In terms of its “is a” hierarchy, a high-level abstraction is generalized, and a low-level abstraction is specialized. Therefore, we say that a Flower class is at a higher level of abstraction than a Plant class. As I understand, I think plant is more generalize that flower then flower class is at lower level of abstraction than plant. I want to know at this point my understanding is correct or the book is correct? Please clarify me.
