To use RFE, it is a must to have a supervised learning estimator which attribute coef_ is available, this is the case of the linear kernel. The error you are getting is because coef_ is not for SVM using kernels different from Linear. It is in RFE documentation A walk-around solution is presented in Feature selection for support vector machines with RBF kernel by Quanzhong Liu et. al.
