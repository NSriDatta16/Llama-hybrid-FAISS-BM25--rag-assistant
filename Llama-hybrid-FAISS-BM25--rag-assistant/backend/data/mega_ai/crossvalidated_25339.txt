Like chl suggested, you need a supervised classifier. I'd suggest either linear SVM, or a decision tree such as C4.5. Both have libraries with a lot of documentation. Linear SVM would give you a "score-like" classifier, something like "2 points if test1 is positive", and "3 points if test2 is positive". The disease is present if overall score is above some threshold. A decision tree would give you a series of decisions, such as "if test1 is positive, do test2, otherwise do test4". As for feature selection, there are lots of different methods, but not too many standard ones. If you use a tree, then it's likely that not all features will be used along any given path. So if you do the tests sequentially, you will need fewer than 15 for most patients. If you go with SVM, each test will get a score; you can dump features with smallest (in absolute value) scores and try to re-do the SVM with fewer features. Yet another feature selection method is by using mutual information, but that would depend on individual features having good mutual information with the class label.
