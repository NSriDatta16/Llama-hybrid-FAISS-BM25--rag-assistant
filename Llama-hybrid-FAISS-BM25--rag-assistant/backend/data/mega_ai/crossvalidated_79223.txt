1) A stationary VAR means that all of its variables are stationary. So I suggest testing each variable individually for stationarity, and thereafter for co-integration if they happen to be non-stationary. 2/3) You should difference the non-stationary components before attempting to use them in a VAR. If there is one non-stationary component, difference it before using it in the VAR, same goes if there are several non-stationary components, or if all are non-stationary, use the differenced series in you model. You can probably use other methods for analyzing, like machine learning, but that is a field I'm not very familiar with.
