Check my solution to this problem here [ http://faiz.kera.la/2009/08/26/ssis-transaction-enabled-tasks-fail-due-to-msdtc ] This is a common scenario if your machines are not in a domain or running Windows XP. Edit: the link is dead. The original text from the link seems to be: In my current project we have multiple SSIS developers in team and we all were sharing the database server instance in my system. We faced an issue yesterday when a team mate was trying to implement transactions in SSIS. The package fails in other machines although it is running smooth in my system where the database resides. The error message thrown out was, The SSIS Runtime has failed to enlist the OLE DB connection in a distributed transaction with error 0x8004D00E “The transaction has already been implicitly or explicitly committed or aborted” Soon we realized that this is something related to Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MsDTC). We did some search and got a tool called “Dtcping.exe” which will check the health status of MsDTC processes in different machines. The tool reported an error “Access denied”, hinting some security issue with in the MsDTC. But we were not lucky even after a couple of hours of Googling. Then I decided to lean the security settings for MsDTC and I found that all network related connectivity is disabled by default. I learned that authentication settings can cause trouble as our machines were running Windows XP and as they were in a work group (we have a strange network configuration in my organization). I changed to “No Authentication Required” for MsDTC instances in all machines and it worked! To change the Security Configuration for MsDTC, go to Control Panel >> Administrative Tools >> Component Services >> Computers >> Right click My Computer and then click Properties >> Click the MSDTC tab >> Click Security Configuration. Below is a screen shot of the settings that I used, but I do not recommend this configuration for all cases as I am not aware of the impact it can have on securiy.
