Performance can only be judged in the context of what you are trying to do. In this case you are requesting the retrieval of around 70 rows (assuming thay are unique values), so you can expect something like 70 times the duration of retrieving a single value. It might be less due to caching, or course. However, the query optimiser may need or choose to perform a full table scan in order to retrieve the values, in which case performace will be little different than retrieving a single value via the same access plan.
