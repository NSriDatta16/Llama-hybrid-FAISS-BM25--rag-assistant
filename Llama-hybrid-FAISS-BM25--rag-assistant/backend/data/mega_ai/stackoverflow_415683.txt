Well you have a couple choices: First, you could leave it all in one class, but split up into different files using the partial class feature of C#. Second, you could have the main service class just pass requests off to one of a number of other actual classes that are organized logically. A third alternative is to consider refactoring to reduce the number of operations you have. Is there actually a use to all of the methods you're exposing? Finally, you could always split up the service into multiple WCF services.
