How to disable warnings in Visual Studio for a Visual Basic Web Deployment Project

For our VB.NET websites we use SVN for Source Control and CruiseControl.NET for continuous integration. To use the SVN build number in the compilation by CruiseControl.NET we need to use Web Deployment Projects. We then replace in the configuration file the Version field with this variable from SVN Labeller $(CCNetLabel) This works great but my problem is that this variable causes warnings in Visual Studio for the solution. I'm working to remove all warnings and am left with just these two: Warning 1 The version string specified for 'AssemblyFileVersion' in the project file is invalid. C:\MyProject\MyProjectDeploy.wdproj Warning 1 The version string specified for 'AssemblyVersion' in the project file is invalid. C:\MyProject\MyProjectDeploy.wdproj I have searched for ways to disable certain warnings but they all reference Windows projects not web site/deployment projects which do not contain a Compile tab. I found information on using #pragma warning( disable : 1000 ) but it appears this is for C++ only and not VB. It's not a show-stopper but is annoying the hell out of me this lazy Friday afternoon, any help would be appreciated - if reputation sharing was working yet I'd offer someone 20 of my rep for a workable solution :) at least....
