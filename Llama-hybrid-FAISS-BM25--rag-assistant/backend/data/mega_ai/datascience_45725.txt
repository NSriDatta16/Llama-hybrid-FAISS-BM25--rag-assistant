Should one normalize the frequency values when feeding it as an input to machine learning model?

Consider an unsupervised data. The data is in the form of a csv file( I am using pandas dataframe for this). Its a web page data at different time steps and the way I am converting data to be fed to my model(K-means) is by taking difference of the time steps of the current web-Page ID load to next web_page ID load. Now, there are some features in the data like "scroll" (which represents a human scrolling on that webpage) which is occurring multiple times for the same web page ID. Since I am only using delta the way I want to encode this "scroll" as a feature is how many times it happened between the delta(time difference). This gives the frequency. Now the question is should I do some processing on this raw frequency I calculated, or can I directly feed it to my model. In case more processing is needed, what do you suggest?
