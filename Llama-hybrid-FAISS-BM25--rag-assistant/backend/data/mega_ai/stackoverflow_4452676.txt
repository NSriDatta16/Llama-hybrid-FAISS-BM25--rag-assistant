Correlated query in visual studio 2010

I have two queries that are connected displaying at the same time in my VB project. I want the results of one query to be limited by the current value of the first. To be more specific, I have one query that lists patient demographics, and another that lists all the visits of all the patients. I want to somehow limit the visits query to only show the visits of the patient currently being displayed. I don't know visual studio that well, and have basically created my program without a true understanding of what's going on under the hood of the GUI drag-and-drop. Where can I modify the text of the query dynamically with the current value of the patient's query? TIA
