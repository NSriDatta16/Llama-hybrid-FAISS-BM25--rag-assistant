Good question. I'm sure someone'll offer up a more elegant solution, but a simple approach might simply be to add a null to your dataProvider at position 0, and having your itemRenderer handle the null by displaying some sort of alternate content, or nothing at all. To extract the index of the clicked element, there are several properties on the ListEvent objects you might use -- event.currentTarget.selectedIndex (or event.currentTarget.selectedIndices, if you're using multi-selection), event.columnIndex and .rowIndex, or event.itemRenderer, which you can use in combination with the TileList's itemRendererToIndex property, among others. Here's a quick-and-dirty app code demonstrating both of these approaches: Hope it helps! Post back with questions if you have 'em.
