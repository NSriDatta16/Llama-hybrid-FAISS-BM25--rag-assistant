try the answer I found here: Force NCover 1.5.8 to use v4 framework like testdriven.net does? . I also made all programs run with .net 4 using the other answer to that question, but don't know if that was important or not. I'll investigate and update the answer. I have updated my answer in the other thread with the solution which I was able to use to get things up and running on my (win 7 x64) machine. Hopefully it will help you, I now get the MESSAGE: v4.0.30319 in my coverage.log.
