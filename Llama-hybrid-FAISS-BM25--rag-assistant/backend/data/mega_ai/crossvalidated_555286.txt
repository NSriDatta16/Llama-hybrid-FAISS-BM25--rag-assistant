Why does McFadden's Pseudo-$R^2$ yield different values for the same model depending on data grouping?

Just stumbled accross the problem that McFaddens Pseudo- $R^2$ yields different values in logistic regression, depending on the grouping of the data. When predictor values occur more than once, there are two ways to specify the model: as binary data with each response being 0 or 1 as data grouped by predictor values with frequencies and weights Both ways to specify the model in R's glm yield exactly the same coefficients and confidence intervals, but different values for McFadden's Pseudo- $R^2$ . Why is this so? Does this not make McFadden's Pseudo- $R^2$ a very dubious $R^2$ candidate? Or is this not a bug, but a feature? Let me illustrate the problem by an example with the dataset menarche in the MASS package from vanilla R: fit.grouped $Age, menarche$ Menarche), rep(menarche $Age, menarche$ Total-menarche $Menarche)), Menarche=c(rep(1, sum(menarche$ Menarche)), rep(0, sum(menarche $Total-menarche$ Menarche)))) fit.ungrouped
