Can select next record alphabetically, but what happens when the record name is identical?

With this sql I can grab the next name in alphabetical order using the ID of SELECT id FROM `names` WHERE `name` > (SELECT `name` FROM `names` WHERE `id` = X) ORDER BY `name` ASC, `id` ASC However let's asume I have these I have these records id | name --------- 12 | Alex 8 | Bert 13 | Bert 17 | Bert 4 | Chris Say I have id 12 as reference I get the results id | name --------- 8 | Bert 13 | Bert 17 | Bert 4 | Chris But if I use 8 as reference I get id | name --------- 4 | Chris Bert 13 and 17 would get skipped.
