Suppose a simple case with 3 independent variables $x_1,x_2,x_3$ and the output $y$ and suppose now that $x_3=y$ and so you should be able to get a 0 error model. Suppose now that in the training set the variation of $y$ is very small and so also the variation of $x_3$. Now if you run PCA and you decide to select only 2 variables you will obtain a combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$. So the information of $x_3$ that was the only variable able to explain $y$ is lost.
