SVN alternative

HI! I started writing some complex C# project. I'm writing it alone. The bad thing is that i'm writing that project piece-by-piece, step-by-step so some of my code is written on my home computer, some parts of code are written on my computer at work and i have HARD TIME tracking which version of project is newest! You know, after few months of pause, i have no idea which project is most recent: the one on my flash disk, or home computer or work computer, i have no idea what classes were changed and how...it's a mess! That's why i started using SVN (AnkhSvn + TortoiseSvn) but IT'S TOO COMPLEX for me! I expected something which could be learned "by the way", in few minutes! I'm developing that app alone, i'm not planning to turn in anybody else, is there any simple alternative for SVN? I need some simple ("instant","no-brain") system for online code storage with just "upload changes" and "download changes" features. Do you know anything like that?
