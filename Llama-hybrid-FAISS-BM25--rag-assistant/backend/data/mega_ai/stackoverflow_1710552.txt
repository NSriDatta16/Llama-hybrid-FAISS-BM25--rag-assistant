I think it would be much more efficient to just store the session ID (a hash or whatever) in the cookie, and then use that ID to get the session data from memory / database / whatever storage you prefer. Keeping the full session state in a cookie increases bandwidth innecessarily. Also, keep security in mind: if the cookie contains authentication information or other sensitive data and you're not careful, it can easily be hacked by the user to gain privileges or otherwise mess with your application (encrypting the data sucks too, because then you have to base-64 encode the encrypted data, which further wastes bandwidth and processing time). You should never trust input from the user.
