Why does Jim Gray call "data-driven science" a new paradigm?

Wikipedia it says about data science : Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[4][5] The term "theoretical" links to "basic research", which I believe to be false, since basic research can be also empirical. However, "theoretical" makes sense in contrast to empirical: In theoretical research you try to find solution "simply" by thinking about the problem, in empirical research you gather data on the problem, and use it to either build models/theories regarding reality or test these models/theories. I do not see what computational science is supposed to be in in contrast , because I believe that I can use computer for both empirical science (e.g. using statistics and machine learning models) or in theoretical science (e.g. building simulations that are based on my assumptions and see if they result in the expected outcome - no data involved). So I think computational science would be a complement to empirical science and/or theoretical science, not a contrasting paradigm. Now, comes in "data-driven science". How is this supposed to be different? Either you could say data-driven is just empirical (as I would say), so it is not a new paradigm. Or you might interpret it as "computational", then it is not even a paradigm. Two lines of argumentation I came up with are invalid after all: "While empirical science uses data, data-driven uses more data." But having more apples doesn't mean you didn't have apples before. This is quantitative, not qualitative. Paradigms are by definition qualitative different. "We have different methods." We do have new machine learning methods, we did not have in statistics, but that does not change the general paradigm to collect data and use it to build models. Questions: What does Jim Gray (allegedly) mean with "fourth paradigm"? Is he justified to call it a new paradigm akin to "empirical science" and "theoretical science"? (Please make an argument why!)
