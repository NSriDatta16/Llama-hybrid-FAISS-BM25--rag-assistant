How to enable ActiveX controls in firefox?

I have an application which uses ActiveX controls. I want to automate this using Selenium IDE. But when i launch the application i end up in an error message "Turn on you ActiveX control". Is there any way to enable ActiveX in FireFox? Note: I am using User Agent Switcher(as IE7) Addon of firefox to run my application.
