HTML Agility Pack - Select nodes after specific node

I asked the question in a codeplex discussion but I hope to get a quicker answer here at stackoverflow. So, I use HTML Agility Pack for HTML parsing in C#. I have the following html structure: text text text text text And I need to get all p elements with class "paragraph" that exist after the p element with class "specific". Is there a way to do that? Thanks.
