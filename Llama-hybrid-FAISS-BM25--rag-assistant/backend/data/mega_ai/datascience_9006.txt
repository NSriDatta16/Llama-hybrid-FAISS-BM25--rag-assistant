Some which I regularly hear to, are: What's the point by FiveThirtyEight It is a very nice podcast, where not only the concepts, but also the applications of data science to a wide range of domains, are discussed. Linear digressions by Udacity It focuses more on ML and concepts of data science. Hosted by two really nice data scientists Katie and Ben. All their episodes are fun to watch. Partially Derivative (Already mentioned by agold) Data Skeptic (Already mentioned by agold) Talking Machine (Already mentioned by jamesmf) Freakonomics It is a fun podcast which focuses on data and it's importance in various domains and how to make sense of it.
