How to call a stored proc from LINQ to SQL if working "code-first"

I need to call a stored proc from LINQ to SQL. I know that in a database-first approach, you simply drag the stored proc into your LINQ to SQL designer, and the stored proc code will be generated for you. However, I'm using LINQ to SQL in a code-first approach, where I create my domain classes, and add attributes to hook them up to LINQ to SQL. I'm not sure how to call my stored procs this way.
