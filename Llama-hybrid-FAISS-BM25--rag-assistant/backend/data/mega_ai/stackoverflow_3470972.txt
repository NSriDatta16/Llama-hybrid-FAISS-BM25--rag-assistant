Building a long query and have a lot of if statements - is there a more elegant way?

I have to build a query based on certain conditions. Is there a better way of doing it than the way I have done below? It works fine but I can see it getting out of hand fairly quickly if there were more conditions since I check if any previous conditions had been met every time I check a new one. $sql = "SELECT DISTINCT fkRespondentID FROM tblRespondentDayTime"; if (!empty($day) || !empty($time) || !empty($sportID)) { $sql .= " WHERE"; if (!empty($day)) { $sql .= " fldDay='$day'"; } if (!empty($time)) { if (!empty($day)) { $sql .= " AND"; } $sql .= " fldTime='$time'"; } if (!empty($sportID)) { if (!empty($day) || !empty($time)) { $sql .= " AND"; } $sql .= " fkRespondentID IN (SELECT fkRespondentID FROM tblRespondentSport WHERE fkSportID='$sportID')"; } }
