How to organize projects?

I've been working with Visual Studio for a long long time, but now I'm been requested to work on a Java web project. We've decide to use Spring MVC as framework, and we want to use Log4J (for logging obviously =P) and JUnit for unit testing. Now, in the "Microsoft way" I will create a Solution, and I'll add A web project and a Unit testing project; now that I'm usign Netbeans, is it possible to do like that? Or how should I organize my projects? Thanks for sharing your experience!
