Use cross-validation trained models for out-of-sample prediction or train a new model using whole data?

I'm using support vector regression(SVR) model and 5-fold cross validation for price prediction. which one is more appropriate after training models for out-of-sample prediction (tomorrow unknown price)? Using 5 trained model and average between output of models for next day price prediction? Train a new SVR model by whole data using selected parameters (I'm using greed search in this and above procedure) and predict next day price using this new single trained model?
