You have a problem, and it is not SQL Server. let me also ignore that you seem to ahve a bad table design. Spreading data files is actually pretty easy. REORGANIZING later is not that easy, but also doable. How is your table, filegroup and file layout? export 1mb per second is a joke. Seriously. I have been handling 150 million row files in minutes - that runs down to a LOT more than 60.000 rows per minute. Something is freaking out. Temp space? Did you do a performance analysis? How does the hardware look? Nothing will work for the log usage. Basically like most pro databases the log contains all changed database pages during a transaction. Adding a field changes - ALL pages. You should: Redesign the database (use a view to keep the same old table in place if you ahve to) so that it does not ahve "LookupColA" etc., but is normalized (LookupValue, and a LookuPTable that is coded by "column"). This way you get instant additional fields. This turns into a data warehouse like star schema. Do a performance analysis. Looks like you ahve some problems. Definitely tell us abou your hardware ;) This problem here is definitely NOT SQL Server, it is related to bad table design AND - possibly - insufficient - badly utilized hardware.
