What ever happened to Fuzzy Logic?

Fuzzy logic seemed like an active area of research in machine learning and data mining back when I was in grad school (early 2000s). Fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy c-means, fuzzy versions of the various neural network and support vector machine architectures were all being taught in grad courses and discussed in conferences. Since I've started paying attention to ML again (~2013), Fuzzy Logic seems to have dropped off the map completely and its absence from the current ML landscape is conspicuous given all the AI hype. Was this a case of a topic simply falling out of fashion, or was there a specific limitation of fuzzy logic and fuzzy inference that led to the topic being abandoned by researchers? To clarify, based on jbowman's comment: Was there some event or finding that caused FL to go out of fashion, similar for example to neural networks in the 60s, when they went out of fashion because it was proved that they couldn't solve XOR? Or were Fuzzy Systems outperformed by a competing paradigm?
