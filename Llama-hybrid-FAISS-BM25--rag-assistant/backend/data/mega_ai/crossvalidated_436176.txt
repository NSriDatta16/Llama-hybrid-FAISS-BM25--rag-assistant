I'm an idiot; I could have just used a nested foreach loop via %:% to store each pair-wise combination of K-value and each of my series/models in a nested list. By not using the .combine argument, things are left simpler (IMO) to have a nested list where each element of our models can be examined (i.e. checking coefficients, AICc/BIC values). For those who want to know a solution, albeit a clunky, inelegant one, here's my solution: library(forecast) library(doParallel) library(lubridate) list_of_means This is my first post, and I realize now (and based off of Andre B's suggestion) that this should have probably been posted on StackOverflow. However I do not want to spam this question so I will leave it here (unless advised otherwise), as I believe it can still be relevant here and of some help to people wanting to speed up batch forecasts while not going through tedious testing to find the optimal K-value for pairs of Fourier terms for their weekly-based forecasts.
