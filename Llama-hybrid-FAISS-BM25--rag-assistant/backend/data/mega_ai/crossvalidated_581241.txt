Item response theory (IRT) is most commonly applied in education and the psychological sciences. Other common applications are typically found in other social sciences like marketing, sociology, and political science (as noted by other responses to this question). One area of application outside the social sciences is machine learning and artificial intelligence. For example, Kline, Kline, & Lee (2021) use IRT to select features in machine learning models.
