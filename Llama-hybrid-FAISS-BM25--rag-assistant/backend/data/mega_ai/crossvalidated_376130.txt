Proving whether a series is stationary

I want to prove whether the following equation is stationary or not: $$ x_t = (x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t) (1+k(x_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t})^2)^{-1/2} $$ Also written like: $$ x_t = (x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+k(x_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t})^2}} $$ where $k$ is a constant: $0 , and $ \epsilon_{t} $ is a random walk: $$ \epsilon_{t}=\epsilon_{t-1}+\omega_t $$ and $\omega_t$ is $iid(\mu=0,\sigma^2)$ . The second part of the main equation is actually always less than 1. I tried deriving the variance but this was getting unwieldy and was unsure I would be able to answer the question with it. I also tried converting it to a geometric series in the hopes I could prove its convergence but I couldn't get past dealing with a "changing" ratio. I would greatly appreciate any help on this! Some context: The equation is actually a simplified version of a physical storage model. What I really want to know is whether non-stationary errors on the store ( $x_t$ ) will show up properly (as non-stationarity) in simulations. In other words, does the model effectively "remove" the non-stationarity property. Simulation results: Because $x_t$ represents physical storage it shouldn't really be allowed to be negative which seems to be crucial but I may worry about that later on. For the following inputs: $$ k=1/100, \mu=0, \sigma^2=1 $$ I get these typical plots when $\epsilon_t$ drifts into the negative: When $\epsilon_t$ drifts into the positive: The model tends towards two different points, so does this imply that $x_t$ is non-stationary? The question that is important to me is: is there a way to prove this without simulations? On the advice of whuber, I also computed the $\tan(\pi x_t/2)$ shown below:
