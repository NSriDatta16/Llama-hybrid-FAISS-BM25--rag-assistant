java inserting date into database

can someone please tell me the elegant way of inserting a java date instance into database? presently, i am using IBATIS with Spring MVC . i have defined a java.util.date property in the command bean and property editor in the controller for Date conversion, however i am unable to insert java.util.date property in DB . should i convert this into java.sql.date instance inorder to store in DB? if i have to convert, then where to write the code of conversion(DAO,...)? i am new to J2EE, so pretty confused with handling date objects. any help? regards
