JavaScript smooth scroll - iphone

Are there any plugins or does anyone know of a good way to achieve the iPhone elastic band scroll? working example in flash http://www.shinedraw.com/text-effect/silverlight-3-and-flash-iphone-dragging-effect/ I'm looking to drag and scroll a div, but if it goes past a certain point it bounces back. Thanks
