You may need to pay attention to data normalization. At least if your data set is actually 3D as in your first plot. But there is a lot unclear in your question - what result do you really expect. Is the data set 3D? Do you expect clusters to be convex or even rectangular? DBSCAN does not guarantee this. Have you tried OPTICS, which is an advanced version of DBSCAN? (Don't use the Weka version, it's broken. Use ELKIs version, which is tons faster, and OpticsXi for extracting actual clusters).
