Maybe it's the id of the class system (as in Freud's id/ego/superego) - that would make a bit of sense given the id is the basal nature of an organism. Not that I believe any of that Freud rubbish anyway :-). Or, maybe the developers of Obj-C came from the UNIX school of namers (with "ls" or "cd") rather than the VAX school (with its "show directory" and "set directory"). Or, it could stand for instance data, which is probably more likely.
