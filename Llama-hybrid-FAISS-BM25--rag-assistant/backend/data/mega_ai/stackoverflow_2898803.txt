jQuery UI Slider Problem

I have been using jQuery sliders for about a week now without issues in my project, but I just hit an issue. I am adding 3 sliders to my page All 3 are added exact same way (like this): $('#slider_id').slider({value:100,'slide':function(e, ui){// some code}}); 2 work properly One does not work (it gives me a fiebug error 'f is undefined' ) when I drag the slider handle The only glaring difference I can see is that the one giving the error is inside of a jQuery UI dialog(). Interestingly, when I place it outside of the dialog, it works! So, wondering if there are known issues with sliders inside dialogs, and/or if there are any workarounds. Thanks MORE INFO If I don't set the dialog autoOpen:false and slide the slider it works If I don't set the dialog autoOpen:false but then close it immediately then reopen, slider DOES NOT work (same error as above)
