How exactly are you embedding the video? There are javascript libraries such as swfobject or jQuery Media that allow you to set the height/width of a flash object when the page loads. Alternatively you could use a little bit of jQuery to alter the height/width attributes after the fact. $('object').attr('height', 405); $('object').attr('width', 540);
