I can't see anything in your code that you've provided that would cause the problem you're talking about. You will need to make sure that you've done a CreateIfNotExist before calling the permissions otherwise you will get a The specified container does not exist error (which is what I'm guessing you were doing before you encountered your current problem). As the code seems fine it's likely to mean that it's something in your environment that's causing you grief, most likely the connection string. I've tried replicating your problem by messing around with the connection string and the only way I've been able to get the exact same error was to use an AccountName with a valid AccountKey from a different account. So my suggestion is to go back to the Azure portal, go to your storage service and copy the Primary Access Key into your cloud config.
