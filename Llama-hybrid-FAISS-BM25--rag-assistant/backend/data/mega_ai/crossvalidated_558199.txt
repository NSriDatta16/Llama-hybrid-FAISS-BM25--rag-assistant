In his answer, Dikran Marsupial provides the following example as evidence that no confidence interval is admissible as a set of plausible parameter values consistent with the observed data: Let the parameter of interest be $\theta$ and the data $D$ , a pair of points $x_1$ and $x_2$ drawn independently from the following distribution: $p(x|\theta) = \left\{\begin{array}{cl} 1/2 & x = \theta,\\1/2 & x = > \theta + 1, \\ 0 & \mathrm{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$ If $\theta$ is $39$ , then we would expect to see the datasets $(39,39)$ , $(39,40)$ , $(40,39)$ and $(40,40)$ all with equal probability $1/4$ . We are then asked to consider the confidence interval $[\theta_\mathrm{min}(D),\theta_\mathrm{max}(D)] = [\mathrm{min}(x_1,x_2), \mathrm{max}(x_1,x_2)]$ and informed this will correctly cover the unknown fixed true $\theta$ $75\%$ of the time in repeated sampling. We are also informed that for an observed data set, $D=\{29,29\}$ , the posterior belief probabilities for $\theta=28$ and $\theta=29$ are $p(\theta=28|D) = p(\theta=29|D) = 1/2$ (without reference to a prior) while the $75\%$ confidence interval is $\theta\in(29)$ . Dikran Marsupial claims that since the confidence level of the confidence interval is a statement about repeated experiments it does not allow one to infer the unknown fixed true $\theta$ based on a particular sample. He further claims that only Bayesian belief is capable of such inference based on a sample. It is best to view a confidence interval as the inversion of a hypothesis test, especially when dealing with a discrete parameter space. For this example we can use the entire data set as the test statistic when calculating the p-value. For $H_0: 27\ge\theta\ge 30$ , the probability of the observed result, $D=\{29,29\}$ , or something more extreme is $0$ , so we can rule out these hypotheses without error. We can therefore construct the $100\%$ confidence interval $\theta \in(28,29)$ . This is a direct contradiction to Dikran's claim that a confidence interval does not allow one to infer the unknown fixed true $\theta$ based on a particular sample. This interval was constructed without any prior belief. The remaining hypotheses available for constructing a narrower confidence interval are $H: \theta=28$ and $H:\theta=29$ . Under $H_0: \theta=28$ , the upper-tailed probability of the observed result, $D=\{29,29\}$ , or something more extreme is $0.25$ . One conclusion is to "rule out" $H_0: \theta=28$ at the $0.25$ level in favor of $H_1:\theta=29$ , producing the $75\%$ confidence interval $\theta \in (29)$ . Likewise, under $H_0: \theta=29$ the lower-tailed probability of the observed result, $D=\{29,29\}$ , or something more extreme is $0.25$ . Another conclusion is to "rule out" $H_0: \theta=29$ at the $0.25$ level in favor of $H_1:\theta=28$ , producing the $75\%$ confidence interval $\theta \in (28)$ . The confidence level of these intervals is not a measure of the experimenter's belief, it is a restatement of the p-value and a measure of the interval's performance over repeated experiments. This does not preclude the confidence interval as a method for performing inference on a parameter based on a particular sample. Dikran's posterior belief probabilities and credible intervals can instead be viewed as crude approximate p-values and confidence intervals. The $100\%$ credible interval is $(28,29)$ , the posterior probability "ruling out" $H_0: \theta=28$ is $0.5$ , and the posterior probability "ruling out" $H_0: \theta=29$ is $0.5$ .
