C# Console App Session/Storage

What would be the best way to implement a psuedo-session/local storage class in a console app? Basically, when the app starts I will take in some arguments that I want to make available to every class while the app is running. I was thinking I could just create a static class and init the values when the app starts, but is there a more elegant way?
