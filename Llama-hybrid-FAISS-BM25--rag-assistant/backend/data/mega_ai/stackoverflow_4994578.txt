You can create a scrollable region using Raphael. Create the viewport with fixed dimensions (say 800x600) Draw the images with increasing y value. After few images, the y value will go beyond 600. It will be drawn but will not be visible in the viewport. Create a scrollbar using raphael rects. Attach drag events to the scrollbar handle rect. When the handle is moved, translate all the images accordingly. For e.g. lets assume in step 2, you had drawn all the images and the bottom most point of the end image is having y value 2000. Assuming the scrollbar has length 500, each dx movement of the handle will have to translate 2000/500 = 4dx. You can calculate the handle length similarly using ratios. Since everything inside a single Raphael paper the dragging of images will work seamlessly. You will have to maintain the positions of each images.
