As a starting point, I'd look at Markov Chains . One option: build a text corpus from the full index. build a text corpus from just the one book. for every m to n word phrase, find the probability that each corpus would generate it. select the N phrases with the highest ratio of probabilities. An interesting extension would be to run a Markov Chain generator where your weights table is a magnification of the difference between the global and local corpus. This would generate a "caricature" (literally) of the author's stylistic idiosyncrasies.
