What are some better ways to encode these symbols?

I was going through some tutorials on information theory. It had the following example concerning transmission of three symbols $A, B$ and $C$ such that $P(A) = 1/3 = P(B) = P(C)$ If we encode the events as $A = 0, B = 10, C = 11$ ; then we get on an average $1.66$ bits per symbol. But it mentioned that theoretically it's possible to send $1.58$ bits/symbol. How would one go below $1.66$ bits / symbol ? I thought of group encoding i.e. encoding $2$ symbols together. But it didn't give any decrement in bits/symbol. Thanks.
