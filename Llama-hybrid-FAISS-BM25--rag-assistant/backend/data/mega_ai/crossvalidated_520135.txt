Unbiasing machine learning model features, is it valid?

I've been working on a RecSys model recently (using HRNNs), and when thinking about the features used for users and itens, I thought that many of them ended up being biased by the old system recommendation model, biasing the propensity of an item to appear based on it, and not what the user really wants. This feedback loop in training new models could be mitigated by weighting the features on the current propensity of being recommended to users? With Inverse Propensity Scoring or something similar? Does someone know anything on the literature about it?
