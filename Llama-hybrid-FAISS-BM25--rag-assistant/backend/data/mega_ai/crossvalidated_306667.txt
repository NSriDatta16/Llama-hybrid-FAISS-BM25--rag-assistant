Here are miscellaneous points, ending with the central question: It's important to realize that what marketers call an A-B test is what social scientists and statisticians more usually call an "experiment", or more fully, a "randomized experiment" or "true experiment" (or a study with "random assignment"); these are the terms you should search for if you're looking for information about these topics. Bayesian and frequentist methods each comprise broad approaches to data analysis and the interpretation of probability, rather than being a particular algorithim. A significance test like a $Ï‡^2$-test of independence is but one frequentist approach to the analysis of an experiment. The test you propose for the Bayesian case doesn't make sense because a typical prior implies a probability of 0 that any two parameters are exactly equal. So if you gave each of $P_A$ and $P_B$ a beta prior and assumed prior independence, then the prior probability of the null hypothesis (viz., $P_A = P_B$) is 0. The posterior probability will be 0, too, no matter your data (in a phenomenon related to Cromwell's rule ). This is one reason that significance tests aren't often conducted in a Bayesian fashion. To return to the idea that a uniform prior makes Bayesian and frequentist methods equivalent, here's how to make that precise. If a parameter has a uniform prior, then its (frequentist) maximum likelihood estimate is equal to its (Bayesian) posterior mode (also called the " maximum posterior probability (MAP) estimate ").
