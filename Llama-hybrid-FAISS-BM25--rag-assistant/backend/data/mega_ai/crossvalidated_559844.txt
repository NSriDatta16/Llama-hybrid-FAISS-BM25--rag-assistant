One way to write the data generating mechanism for logistic regression is as follows $$ \mbox{logit}(p) = X\beta $$ $$ y \sim \mbox{Binomial}(n , p) $$ From this formulation, we find that the linearity assumption is made on the log odds scale . So were we to plot the log odds of the outcome versus the predictor, we would see a straight line $^{1.}$ $^{1.}$ This isn't strictly true. The assumption of linearity is not about the conditional mean, its about how we combine predictors. I could easily make a non-linear curve using linear combinations of non-linear functions. That being said, this all happens on the log odds scale.
