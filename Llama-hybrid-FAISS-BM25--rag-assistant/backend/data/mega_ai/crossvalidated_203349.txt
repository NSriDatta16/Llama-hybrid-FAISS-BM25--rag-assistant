First, your interpretation of Bayesian statistics seems to be a bit restrictive. Bayesian methods do not necessarily rely on belief, e.g. objective Bayesians view the prior as a catalyst needed to express the parameters distribution having observed the data. Second, when belief is available it is not related to the observations. The prior by definition is independent from the observed data and I guess that when stating "Bayesians only rely beliefs, and by resampling the original data: I doubt the belief would change" you misinterpret the meaning of the posterior distribution. Finally, bootstrap can be used to estimate certain kind of posterior distributions. The answer Is it possible to interpret the bootstrap from a Bayesian perspective? gives you the details but here is an extract from the answer: Hence we might think of the bootstrap distribution as a “poor man’s” Bayes posterior. By perturbing the data, the bootstrap approximates the Bayesian effect of perturbing the parameters, and is typically much simpler to carry out.
