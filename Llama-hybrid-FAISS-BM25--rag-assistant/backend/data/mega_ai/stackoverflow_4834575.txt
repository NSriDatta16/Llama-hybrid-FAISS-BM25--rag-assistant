I didn't find an "idle" event either. But listening to ZOOM_CHANGED and DRAG_END individually should give you same results. Is there a particular reason why you are looking to avoid these 2 events for a generic Idle event ? I would argue that individual events are better 'coz they give you a finer resolution at understanding the events.
