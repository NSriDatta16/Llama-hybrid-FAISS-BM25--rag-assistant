How to balance labeled datas and then carry out execution with a certain ratio?

I'm building a binary classification model using a neural network, with python and the libraries tensorflow and keras. For that I have an unequal amount of labeled data: Around 2'000'000 labeled with 1 and only 25'000 with 0 . In order to train the model meaningfully, a balanced amount of data would be advantageous (as far as I understand). However, I would also like to run the model with different ratios of the labeled data (3/1, 1/1, 1/3) in order to gain insights there too. How is that possible? First of all to balance the imbalanced dataset, and then run the model with a given ratio (3/1, 1/1, 1/3) of labeled data.
