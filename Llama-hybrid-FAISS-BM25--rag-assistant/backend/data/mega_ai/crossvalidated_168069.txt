As far I can see, there are at least couple differences: CNNs are designed to work with image data, while SVM is a more generic classifier; CNNs extract features while SVM simply maps its input to some high dimensional space where (hopefully) the differences between the classes can be revealed; Similar to 2., CNNs are deep architectures while SVMs are shallow; Learning objectives are different: SVMs look to maximize the margin, while CNNs are not (would love to know more) This being said, SVMs can work as good as CNNs provided good features are used with a good kernel function.
