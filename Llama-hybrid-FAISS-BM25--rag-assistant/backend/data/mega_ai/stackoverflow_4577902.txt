This seems strange - if you didn't change your own web app this issue must exit in 5.5, too. As @daniel said, your web app is not allowed to have a jar file containing servlet stuff. If i interpret the log correctly, there is a servlet-api in the web app directory. Delete servlet-api completely there. EDIT What is the directory layout of your application, where do the jars (especially the tomcat jars) live. What is the log output when tomcat starts without the servlet-api in your web app How do you "embedd" tomcat What's the classpath when you start your app EDIT You MUST separate the environment lets say in \yourapp | + lib | + webapp | + lib (this is where your webapp lives, WITHOUT servlet-api) If this has similiarity to standard JavaEE container structure - it is NOT by pure hazard :-) yourapp\lib hosts your application and tomcat libraries. This forms the classpath for starting. The yourapp\webapp\lib jars are never referenced by the classpath, only by the webapp classloader. You must take the correct path to them into account when you configure your builtin tomcat to point to this webapp, otherwise the web app loader may not find them. EDIT Maybe start with something less ambitioned than a JSP. Do you have a simple test servlet deployed? You must take care to which web application context you have deployed your application. In the log i see you use the root context. Is this really true? If for example you said tomcat.addWebapp("foo", appBase); in your embedding, you must request /foo/servlet, not /servlet in your browser.
