Antisense Transcript Level

The basic biology says genes on the DNA, get transcribed to mRNA (sense transcription), and the RNA will be translated to proteins. but sometimes, a gene can have transcription from the opposite strand, that sometimes impede RNA translation to protein, or sometimes help the translation by stabilizing the sense RNA We designed an experiment with strand specific transcriptome and proteomics. To avoid the jargon, for each gene (in blue), we have the levels of sense (green) and antisense (red) transcription, as well as how much protein it produced (not shown in the figure below). Additionally, since the sequencing is not an exact measurement and the resulting data, specially with low coverage, can be noisy, we have ran the experiments 3 times (replicates). Therefore, for each gene $g$ we have $S_r(g)$ (its sense transcription at replicate $r$), $A_r(g)$ (its antisense transcription at replicate $r$) and its protein level $P(g)$ (no replicates there) I have shown that Antisense levels are generally much lower, and independent of Sense levels: Additionally, antisense ratio (${A_r(g) \over S_r(g)}$) follows a bell-curve distribution: What I'm seeing is that the correlation between Sense and Protein levels diminishes when ratio of ${A_r(g) \over S_r(g)}$ gets larger and larger: The problem is when transcription levels are low, the ${A_r(g) \over S_r(g)}$ ratio could be thrown off very easily. The QUESTIONs are: How can I use the replicates that I have to power my analysis? What sort of statistical test can I use to show loss of this correlation is significant or not?
