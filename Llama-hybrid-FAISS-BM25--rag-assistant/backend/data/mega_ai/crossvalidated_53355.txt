Logistic regression model comparison

I want to use logistic regression to look at how a continuous variable that I have measured for a sample of participants (how long they looked at a product) is impacting a dichotomous variable (whether they bought it or not, Y or N). There are several products I am interested looking at, which means I will have to run separate LR's for each product, I believe. I am mainly interested in comparing the relative impact that the IV has on purchases of each product. I thought that the most intuitive way to do this would be using the Odds Ratios. I have two questions about this. 1) Is it appropriate to compare the odds ratios between the models? 2) Will the model's predictive ability/performance be important to interpret if I am only interested in the odds ratios? What does a poorly performing model mean for the interpretation of the odds ratio? Thanks for any help, it is very much appreciated.
