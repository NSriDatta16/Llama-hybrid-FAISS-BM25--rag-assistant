Thanks guys for the feedback and suggestions. My opening paragraph was not very clear what I was trying to say is that I have not programmed something as complicated as this FTP client GUI as shown in the picture from the URL. The reason I wanted to give this GUI a try is because I use the very same FTP client and wanted to modify it somewhat. I'll try another FTP GUI something with source code or with a simple GUI.
