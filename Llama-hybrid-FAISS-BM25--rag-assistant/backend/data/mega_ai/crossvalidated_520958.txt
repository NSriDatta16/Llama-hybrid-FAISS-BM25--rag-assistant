Your tests show that values at time points t-1, t-2, t-3 in one of the time series do not have any predictive power for the value of the other time series at time t. This does not imply that the two time series do not have any relationship. You could, for example, find that the contemporaneous correlation between your two time series is nonzero, i.e. cor(Predicted_Compunt_Tweet_Sentiment, Consumer_Sentiment_Index) != 0 . You might be thinking about cointegration. There exists a result stating that (perhaps someone else can give a reference in comments?) if two time series x, and y, have a unit root, and if they are cointegrated, then there exists granger causality from x to y, y to x, or both ways. According to your ADF tests, 1. is not true, so 2. cannot hold (only unit root time series can be cointegrated), so 3. is not implied either.
