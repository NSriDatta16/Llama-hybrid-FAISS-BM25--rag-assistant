In econometrics, people have been using GARCH to model the conditional variances of time series with various degrees of success. The basic idea there is to impose a model for the conditional variances --- i.e. trying to "predict" them with known information. The parameters involved in the model for the conditional variance can then be estimated through various techniques using the log-likelihood as the objective. I guess one can probably extend this line of thought and apply it to non-time-series data.
