.NET 2.0 Setup Project in Visual Studio 2008

I developed a win forms app targeting .net 2.0. All of this is in Visual Studio 2008 sp1. I did this because I didn't really need 3.0+ features in the app. and I didn't want the clients to have to install a gigantic framework when they could just install a semi-huge one. Well, when I create a setup project for the app, build it, install it, it wants me to install .net 3.5. I am targeting 2.0 in both the windows app and the setup project. Is it possible to make the setup project with only a prerequisite of 2.0 in VS 2008?
