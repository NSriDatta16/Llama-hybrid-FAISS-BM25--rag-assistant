I'm pretty sure no browsers currently implement it. And I wouldn't expect any browser to implement it any time soon either. It just isn't mature enough yet. It's only a working draft and will still need a lot of attention and discussion before it's going to turn into anything browser implementors will start having a go at. For example, there are (at least) 2 related proposals: Grid Positioning and Matrix Layout . It is on Mozilla's bug tracker , but for the moment that's little more than a placeholder for future attention. I couldn't find any mention of it at all on the Webkit bug tracker. If you want to find out more about the ongoing status of these layout modules, you should follow the www-style mailing list .
