Adding uiview to a uiviewcontroller

I'd like to add a 50x150 uiview that I will be using as a menu, and I want to overlay it on top of my uiviewcontroller. So far what I've done is declare a UIView IBOutlet in the UIViewController class file, and in that UIViewController xib file, I dragged a UIView from the library and hooked it up accordingly. Problem is its not showing up when trying to call it: menu = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10,10,50,150)]; //[self.view insertSubview:menu atIndex:0]; [self.view addSubview:menu]; //[self.view bringSubviewToFront:menu]; I've tried different variations as you can see, all suggestions from other posts but I get nothing. Am I going down the wrong path here? What am i missing?
