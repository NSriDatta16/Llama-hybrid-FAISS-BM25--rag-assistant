NoMethodError using Memcached Sinatra-style

I've just installed Memcached on my Mac and updated my Sinatra app configuration as described in Heroku's documentation , but I'm getting a NoMethodError when trying to use the hash-based syntax they specify: >> CACHE['color'] = 'blue' >> CACHE['color'] Using explicit get and set methods as below seems to work fine. >> CACHE.set('color', 'blue') >> CACHE.get('color') If necessary I can use the latter syntax, but the former seems more elegant. I haven't tested this on Heroku's environment since I'd like whatever implementation I use to work on my local environment as well. Thanks!
