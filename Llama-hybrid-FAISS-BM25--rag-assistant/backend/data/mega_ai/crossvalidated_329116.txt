I just want to know how much of a good fit line my best linear line is Whilst there might only be a single way to fit a best-fit line to your data, which in fact isnt true, because you can vary various kinds of regularization and so on. But even if it was true, your training data is a single draw from the underlying production distribution. You dont know how well that draw matches the actual distribution. It'll probably match a bit, but clearly it cant match 'perfectly', since the distribution itself is continuous (I assume?), whereas your drawn examples are discrete, Dirac-delta type things. To estimate how well your line of best fit will generalize to new data, you'll therefore almost certainly want to do some kind of cross-fold validation, and/or bootstrapping etc, to get some kind of measure of what happens to the line, and to the test samples, according to different draws. A simple standard approach is cross-fold validation: randomly split the data you have into eg 80% train, 20% split. Train on the train, test on the split. Do this 5 times; and average the accuracy from each split.
