Both the encoder and decoder is used when computing the reconstruction error. So to compute anomaly score you just pass new samples through the trained autoencoder. If you have enough data you might periodically retrain the model to compensate for trends. For example use the last N weeks as the window for training data, and retrain once per week. Detecting trends should probably be considered as a separate problem to your anomaly detector. Classic methods like ARIMA etc might be useful there.
