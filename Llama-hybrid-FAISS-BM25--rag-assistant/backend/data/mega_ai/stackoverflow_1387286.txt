From RFC 2396 : 4.1. Fragment Identifier When a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed. As such, it is not part of a URI, but is often used in conjunction with a URI. The emphasis added is mine and is the reason the fragment is not considered in the Uri.Equals implementation. In your example, the URI for the resource you are retrieving is: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl The fragments are processed by the user agent and have no meaning to or influence on the actual retrieval of the resource.
