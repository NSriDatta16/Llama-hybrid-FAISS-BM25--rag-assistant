How to find the maximum point given two predictor variables

I have 3 variables where 2 are predictors (positive integers) and the response variable is a real number. To give an example: a b c 1 2 5 1 5 7 Because this dataset is unique to my problem, I don't have an equation that can explain the relationship among a, b, c . However, when I plot these as a surface, there is a nonlinear relationship. How do I go about to find the maximum value of c while minimizing a, b . I know this sounds like a numerical optimization problem but without an equation, I won't be able to solve it. Edit: can machine learning help here? Large amount of data can be obtained.
