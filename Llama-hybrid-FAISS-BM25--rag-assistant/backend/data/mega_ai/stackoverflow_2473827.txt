Can you try http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/deque-objects.html allocating expected number of required elements in your list? ? I would bet that list is a contiguous storage that has to be reallocated and copied every few iterations. (similar to some popular implementations of std::vector in c++) EDIT: Backed up by http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#how-are-lists-implemented
