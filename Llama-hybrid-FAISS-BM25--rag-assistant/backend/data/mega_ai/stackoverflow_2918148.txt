I'm having trouble spacing a menu control in an ASP.NET page. Is my solution the correct way to do this?

Hey, I added a menu control to my page that is displayed vertically. I couldn't find a way to add spaces (I'd like about 5px.) between the menu items, so I just did something similar to this: I just created multiple menu controls with a single menu item control in them, and placed a break between the menu controls. This seems very wrong to me, but I could not figure out another way. Also, this is a bit off subject, but is it okay to use empty paragraph tags as line breaks?(sometimes a br tag is too much) Thanks..
