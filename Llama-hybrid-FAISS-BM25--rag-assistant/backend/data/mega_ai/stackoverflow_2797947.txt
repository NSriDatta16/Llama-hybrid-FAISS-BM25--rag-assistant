How to correctly handle click events on Widget

There is a task to make smt like todo list on widget (with dynamic number of elements), how to organize this list for click support on this elements. I only found how add click event on one widget layout element (with setOnClickPendingIntent ), and how send text to widget element TextView. But it's unclear how handle click events for sub-elements, or how get click coordinates(or item) where was click event. I saw widget " Agenda widget " - and it work fine with clicking on different calendar rows. I will be very much appreciated for help.
