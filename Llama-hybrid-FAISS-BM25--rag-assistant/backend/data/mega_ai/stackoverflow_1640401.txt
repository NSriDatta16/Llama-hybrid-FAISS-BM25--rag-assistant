When you move the dragged view around, check the updated frame property against that of the other items. You can use a function such as CGRectIntersectsRect to determine if the frame of any two views overlap each other (i.e. when it's time to show the alert). This acheives a rectangular "hit test", there would be more work involved if you wanted the hit test to respect rounded shapes etc.
