In this specific case, because of the clone, from my opinion, there is no satisfying solution. I would use the second, because in the first you "store HTML" in JS... but I suppose this "storage" is done with a string containing HTML. So the string will be evaluated (with jQuery or innerHTML attribute). This is not really clean and efficient. Moreover, with the second solution, you can edit your HTML with a WYSIWIG editor for instance.
