That doesn't make sense to me either. The password in the LDAP shouldn't be the actual password itself, it should be a hash of the password. If you retrieve the field and do a comparison, you need to know what kind of hash it's using and hash the password you're comparing yourself in the same way. It also requires that the userPassword attribute in the LDAP be available for retrieval, which shouldn't be necessary I don't think. In short, no... I think you should be using bind.
