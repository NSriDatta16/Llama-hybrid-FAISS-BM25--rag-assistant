I found the answer and it's pretty simple. (Probably too simple - it feels like a hack but since I know so little about COM programming I'm just going to go with it.) The storage object had multiple references on it, so just keep going until they're all gone: var storagePointer = Marshal.GetIUnknownForObject(storage); int refCount; do { refCount = Marshal.Release(storagePointer); } while (refCount > 0);
