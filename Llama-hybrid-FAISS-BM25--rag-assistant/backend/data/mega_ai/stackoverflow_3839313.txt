If you had asked about one back-end language in particular, I would have left this response as a comment rather than a full-fledged question. However, the question is extremely broad... asking about use of an HTML/CSS interface in one of four back-end languages. That being the case, you should just do a series of web searches on: "html renderer" [insert-language-here] ... and spend some time browsing through the various options available for embedding an HTML/CSS interface into a back-end language application. Ultimately, you are mostly likely going to wind up using Mozilla's Gecko renderer... either in its raw form, or indirectly through one of the numerous libraries that provide dev-friendly wrappers around it. Speaking of Mozilla technologies, you might also want to check out XULRunner (lets you easily throw together a UI using XML with CSS and JavaScript), or maybe even Prism (takes an app running on an HTTP server and presents it to the user as a desktop app).
