Socket.io Node.js error in IE7 - Access Denied

I am using socket.io to connect to my node server using the following script: $socket = new io.Socket(null,{port:8086,rememberTransport:false}); $socket.connect(); If works fine in IE8/9, Chrome, Safari & FF. When I try it in IE7, a connection is established but then the following error pops up: An error has occured in the script on this page. Error: Access denied. The client is then disconnected from the node server. I am runnig node.js V0.4.1. Does any one have any ideas? Thank you.
