How to use last predicted value as feature? NLP NER mission

I'm performing NER (Named entity recognition) For example: Seq: When Donald Trump announced... Tags: O B-Person L-Person O When I'm predicting the word Trump, I have 'word features' for the word 'Trump' which are also considering the context, but I want to use the PREDICTED LABEL of the last word. It means that I want to use the last predicted tag (Hopefully B-Person) as a feature when I'm predicting the word 'Trump'. I understood there exists some way to do it using sklearn. How can I do it? Thanks
