Adding a service reference is the way to go. As pointed out to me on another thread, it is prudent that I strongly encourage you to avoid using wsdl.exe unless you have a very good reason to be using it. For your reference, the VS option Add Web Reference is a wrapper over wsdl.exe and creates proxies for .NET 1.1 or 2.0 clients. Add Service Reference is a wrapper over svcutil.exe and is used to create .NET 3.0+ clients.
