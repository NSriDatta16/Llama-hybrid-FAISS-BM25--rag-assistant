Suppressing warnings in the source with pragma when compiling with g++

Visual Studio provides #pragma warning in the source to suppress the warnings. Does gcc provide similar feature? I found that I can use -fdiagnostics-show-option to know how to get the option to disable the warning, and use command line to suppress warning, but I'd like to use pragma if it's possible.
