Sometimes a flat line is the best forecast. Not everything is seasonal. Random variations can look like seasonality, but the standard tests, e.g., in R's auto.arima() , often do a pretty good job at deciding whether a given time series should be modeled using seasonality or not (however, see below on averaging). If you force seasonality, you may end up overfitting and getting bad forecasts. To assess forecasting accuracy, use a holdout sample : keep your last 10 or 20 observations out of the training sample. Fit your eight models to the remaining observations, and forecast them out into the holdout sample. Check which model has the lowest Mean Absolute Deviation. Then refit this model on the whole sample and use it to forecast. You may also want to look at taking all eight forecasts for a given time series and average them in each forecast time bucket . Averages of forecasts very often outperform selecting a "best" method. This is a common finding in the forecasting literature ( see here and the references given there ).
