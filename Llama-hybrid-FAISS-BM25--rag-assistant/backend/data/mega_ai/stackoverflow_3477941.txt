Expression required intellisense warning in javascript

Suppose I want to initialize some javascript variables in an aspx page from class variables set during Page_Load() If I do var x = " "; Its sets it as a string. If howerver, I want to set a numeric js variable, or perhaps a boolean type and not a string I don't want quotes, so I do this var x = ; I get an intellisense warning of "expression required". This doesn't hurt anything of course, but it clutters up the warnng list. It also puts a small mark on the screen in VS2010. It used to put the squiggly in VS2008. Any other suggestions on initalizing js variables? Thanks, Brian
