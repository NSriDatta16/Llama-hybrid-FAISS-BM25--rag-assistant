Time series model without ARMA component and with exogenous variables

I am trying to know what is the most simple model for time series data, with exogenous variables. What is the most simple framework I can use ? Is it possible to build a model more simple than ARIMAX, ECM, VARX or ARDL, and, specifically, a model without any AR or MA component ? I imagine something just as simple as : $$Y_{t} = \alpha_{1}X_{1,t} + \alpha_{2}X_{2,t} + u_{t}$$ with most probably some time-series-specific properties (all series stationary, stationary residual, etc.). Is it possible ? Sorry if I talk complete non-sense, but I can’t wrap my head around an AR or a MA component being mandatory while I’m interested by which exogenous variable is useful to predict $Y_t$ .
