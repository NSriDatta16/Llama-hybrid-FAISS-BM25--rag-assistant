Trend in what? The proportion of certain categories, or the values of the levels for the categorical variables? I presume by 4 clusters, you mean 4 groups of observations, and not 4 groups of variables? If your categorical values are like ranks (5 is better than 1, or vice versa) then calculate the averages of each rank variable within each of the 4 groups, then compare and plot averages of the ranks. Otherwise, if the categorical values are truly nominal, like 1-chevy, 2-ford, 3-dodge truck, with no ordinality (directionality implying better or worse), then you have to calculate the proportions of each category within each categorical variable within each group.
