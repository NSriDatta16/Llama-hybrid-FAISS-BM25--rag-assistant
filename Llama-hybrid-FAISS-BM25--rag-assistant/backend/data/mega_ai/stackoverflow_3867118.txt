If you have any interest in leveraging deployment and management of an existing container, you might look at making a new protocol handler inside of Tomcat. See this answer to a related question. UPDATE : This post from Matthew Schmidt claims the NIO-based connector (written by Filip Hanik) in Tomcat 6 achieved 16,000 concurrent connections. If you want to write your own connector, take a look at MINA to help with NIO abstractions. MINA also has management features which may eliminate need for another container (should you be concerned about deployment of many units and their operation, etc.)
