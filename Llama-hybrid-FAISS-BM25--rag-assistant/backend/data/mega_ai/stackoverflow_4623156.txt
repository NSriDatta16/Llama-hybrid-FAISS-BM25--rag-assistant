Typically this means that the SWF you are debugging is mis-matched with the code you are attempting to break at. Therefore it may look like it isn't breaking because the line number you specified in the IDE may match a non-executable line number in the built SWF. I suggest making sure to manually delete bin-debug, do a full refresh, then do a clean. Also, there is a known issue regarding Flash Builder 4 (and Flex Builder 3) where if you connect your computer to multiple monitors, the line-number/breakpoint/error column in the editor will cease to work on any monitor except the one that had the IDE launch to originally. I don't offhand have the Adobe bug page for this, but it's an Eclipse bug in Ganymede and Galileo. I believe it is fixed in Helios, and would expect Flash Builder Burrito to use Helios. HTH
