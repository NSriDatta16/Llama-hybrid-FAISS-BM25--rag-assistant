WCF and AIR/Flex 4 security

In a current project we are hosting a WCF 3.5 service on IIS7 and expose the methods through basicHttpBinding to an Adobe AIR/Flex4-client. Luckily Flash Builder 4 has integrated support for SOAP, so that a service-proxy can be generated easily. Unfortunately, we are not able to find any elegant solution to enable username authentication. The only way we got working, is to pass username und password on every single method-call, which certainly blows up the method-signatures and enforces the service-method-implementation to do a validation by their own. Could you please direct me to any solution, which could bring username authentication within the message-headers to adobe flex? Best regards, Daniel Lang
