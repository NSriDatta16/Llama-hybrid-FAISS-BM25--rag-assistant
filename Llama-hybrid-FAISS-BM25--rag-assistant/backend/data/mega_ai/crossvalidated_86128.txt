One big issue will be level of measurement, since continuous-data (e.g., count-data ) require different models than discrete-data (e.g., a single likert scale rating of anxiety, or a choice of a single income bracket where wealth has been polytomized). poisson distributions are often useful for counts, whereas irt models (e.g., graded response, partial credit, rating scale) may better suit polytomous data (see Templin, 2007 ; Linacre, 2000 ; Wright, 1998 ; Ostini & Nering, 2006 ; Nering & Ostini, 2011). As for the matter of modeling change, I highly recommend reading McArdle's (2009) great review of latent change models, including those @PatrickCoulombe has wisely suggested. I agree that multivariate latent growth-model s seem suitable to modeling overall change, but it's not silly to consider whether changes between consecutive time points are more closely related than overall changes. You can even do both! Take a look at autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) models (Bollen & Zimmer, 2010), particularly Figure 4 in Bollen and Curran (2004) . If you've got plenty of continuous data, or can model continuous latent factors from plenty of discrete data (cf. Regression testing after dimension reduction and Factor analysis of questionnaires composed of Likert items ), you might be able to fit some pretty mind-boggling models like these...but that's a big "if"—I've seen rules of thumb for model fitting suggest anywhere from 5 to 20 observations per parameter that needs estimating. Even without sufficient data tonnage, you might consider a different approach. Comparing nested models with various constraints can produce interesting results for general model comparison hypotheses (e.g., Grant, Langan–Fox, & @JeromyAnglim, 2009). In your case, you might try constraining correlations between first-order latent changes to be equal, i.e. (roughly): $$\text{covariance}(W_2-W_1\ \text{with}\ A_2-A_1)=\text{covariance}(W_3-W_2\ \text{with}\ A_3-A_2)$$ in one model, and then fitting the unconstrained model in which the above is nested. You can compare these nested models with a $\chi^2$ test to see whether the unconstrained model fits significantly better, compare other fit indices to see whether the constrained model might make more efficient (not necessarily in the proper statistical sense of "efficiency" , which I honestly don't understand myself) use of parameter estimates. See Wikipedia's section on assessing model fit and Lei and Wu (2007) for some discussion of fit indices (Lei and Wu give a great introduction to sem in general), many of which penalize model fit by the number of parameters estimated. Freely estimating two identical model parameters will thus reduce such fit statistics relative to a model that constrains them to be equal; such a constrained model only freely estimates one parameter for both paths. You might also try looking at modification indices for the constrained model to see whether the constraint is a major source of model misfit to your data's variance-covariance structure.
