In general, there should be one class per file. If you organise things that way, then when you search for a class, you know you only need to search for the file with that name. The exception is when a class is best implemented using one or more small helper classes. Usually, the code is easiest to follow when those classes are present in the same file. For instance, you might need a small 'tuple' wrapper class to pass some data between method calls. Another example are 'task' classes implementing Runnable or Callable. They may be so small that they are best combined with the parent class creating and calling them.
