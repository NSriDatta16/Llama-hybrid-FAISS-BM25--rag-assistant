A database schema is radically different than an XML schema. A schema is a language for defining a structural grammar. A database schema would define a structure using the database's own meta data. So that the schema can form a data storage document using the database's own descriptors. XML, however, is not a data storage device. XML is a meta language, which is a syntax for creating languages. XML schema is an XML defined language for creating a formal language grammar. The difference between an XML schema and a database schema is that the database schema exists to represent the data while an XML schema exists to represent a markup language structure without regard for any data it may or may not contain.
