Anticicoding major new features is hardly possible. There are however a few spots where planned flexibility is always a good idea. Foremost it makes sense to keep the database interface abstract and table fields extensible. It's often easy with active record or table data gateway or similar schemes, sometimes a simple $fieldnames[$table]=[a,b,c] might suffice. Second of course, try to build the core application upon hooks or plugins. Though, that again only helps for extensions, not major changes. If you have existing users and rework a live system, it might help to implement database views (even versioned?), keep the old application and build the new version on an extended storage scheme. But really, that's difficult to asses on a generic description.
