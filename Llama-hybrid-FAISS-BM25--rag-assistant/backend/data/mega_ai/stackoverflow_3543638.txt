Azure in its current state (Aug 2010) will only run one application ("service", "role") per VM instance. So the simple answer to your question is no, at this time. Now, given all the capabilities of the platform, you could come up with some creative ways of providing this sort of sandbox. With the Service Management API, you could have the deployment sitting out in Azure storage and bring the roles online at the moment they are requested, then turn them off ("delete the deployment") when they are no longer needed. There would be some lag on the deployment as the fabric brings the VMs online .. but depending on the use-case, this could yield you some major savings.
