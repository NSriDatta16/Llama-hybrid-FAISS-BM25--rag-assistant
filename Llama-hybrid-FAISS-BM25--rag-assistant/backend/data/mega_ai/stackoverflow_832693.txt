PDF Tables of Arbitrary (within reason) Width

I know PDF generation has been discussed a lot here; however, I've yet to find what I need. I'm trying to generate PDF reports (mainly tables) from python. Yes I've tried ReportLab and Pisa. Both had column content "break out" in circumstances I didn't think were unreasonable and unrealistic to encounter in production. When I say reasonable I mean 8 - 12 columns of differing widths. Not 80 - 1200 or some such. I don't need a native python solution as I will be able to have my script launch off the linux command line. I have these reports working in XHTML and they look more or less perfect ... I'd prefer to leverage them. What I'm asking is: does anyone know of a tool I can use that will render tables of arbitrary (again within reason) size in PDF with quality near XHTML browser rendering? I'd like to use something like PrinceXML; however the size of this project doesn't justify the expense of such a tool. As an aside I have tried to do what I need in Latex , something I'm not apposed to but if that is a good idea I'd appreciate an example. Regards, and thanks in advance.
