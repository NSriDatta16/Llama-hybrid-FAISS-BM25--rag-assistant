Adding more images in the training set is one way to increase accuracy. You can also do transfer learning, i.e. using layers trained by a larger dataset if you are classifying common things such as animals which have networks that have already been trained such as the ResNet50. When you have enough images that the accuracy does not increase anymore, you can try adding more layers, with convolutional and ReLu layers alternating. If you train for many epochs and the model starts to overfit i.e. training set accuracy still trends up but test set accuracy trends down, you can add layers that reduce overfitting, such as the dropout layer. You should first get the model to overfit and then try reducing overfitting. If you don't have enough training data you could also do augmentation, e.g. adding rotated, shifted and horizontally flipped images to the training set. The thing with traffic signs is that if you are classifying images with also the landscape instead of just the cropped traffic signs, you are going to have problems. You should then also detect the traffic signs (YOLO v3 could be used as transfer learning) instead of just classifying them. Here's also a good example of traffic sign classification using transfer learning on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-classification-with-cnn
